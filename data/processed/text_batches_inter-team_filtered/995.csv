The Protein
Analysis
Major Tropism Determinant
Our protein of interest, the Major Tropism Determinant (Mtd) protein, is located on the tail-end fibers of the BPP-1 bacteriophage. This protein is important in that it allows the BPP-1 phage to bind and infect its host species of bacteria- Bordetella, the bacterial species that causes whooping cough. Because Bordetella can vary the expression of its surface proteins, the BPP-1 phage in turn has evolved a way to vary the specificity of the Mtd protein. Through targeted mutagenesis from the phages diversity-generating retroelement ( DGR ) system, the Mtd protein has shown to be able to support a massive library of protein variants- theoretically up to 9.22*1012 possible variants.
File:Mtd gif 2.gif
474px
The Mtd gene is a 1146 base pair long sequence that contains two mutagenic islands. There are a total of 22 specific mutagenic nucleotides located in the last ~100 nucleotides on the 3’ end of the sequence, known as the variable repeat (VR). In vivo, there is a nearly identical sequence of nucleotides known as the template repeat (TR) located downstream of the Mtd gene. The DRG system reverse-transcribes a mutant copy of the TR, with mutations confined only to specific adenine residues, which then replaces the VR that encodes the C terminus of the Mtd.
On the quaternary level, the Mtd protein assembles into globular trimeric structure comprised of 380 amino acids in each of its monomers. Out of these 380 amino acids, 12 of them can mutate to a range of different amino acids.
Mtd is a multi-domain protein with a C-lectin type fold at its C terminus. The variable regions of the Mtd form a surface on one face of the pyramid-shaped trimer where binding occurs. The rest of the protein forms a stable scaffold that is constant across different Mtd variants. The Mtd protein binds to the phage tail-fiber at the N-terminus.
Thorough analysis of this protein was conducted through our own 'Pro"

II. iGEM Matchmaker and LabSurfing (Technische Universität Darmstadt)
Team TU Darmstadt noticed our match making algorithm and thought that their LabSurfing platform would complement each other. LabSurfing is a website for all iGEM teams and their members to be able to stay in contact with the iGEM community after finishing the annual project. The second main advantage is the opportunity for iGEM teams to get to know each other early in the competition. This facilitates meetups and collaborations right from the beginning. We plan to reserve a breakout room at the Giant Jamboree to present our side  roject Matchmaker alongside LabSurfing in the same room, so you also get the chance to present your application in one poster. The two websites will link to each other so that teams can find teams to get in touch with through the iGEM matchmaker, and use social network tools using LabSurfing.

The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the equation, Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of enzymes’ substrates, Km is the Michaellis constant of enzymes, [I] is the concentration of inhibitors, KI is the inhibition constant towards enzymes DszC brought by HBP, and   shows the influence on enzymes and substrate affinity generated by inhibition or the one on enzymes and inhibition affinity generated by substrates.
Because substrate S has inhibition effect on DszC enzymes, we modify the model into:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Taking astringency into consideration, using MATLAB for models and experimental data fitting will be infeasible, so we choose graphical method to obtain K1 and  .
First we use double-reciprocal plot to analyze the 1/S changes over 1/v:
①The slope of double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
②The intercept of 1/v –axis in the double-reciprocal plot is a function of [I]：
The intercept of I-axis is -αKI.
Based on models above, the value of KI,αparameters are derived.

3. Determination of associated parameters of biological catalytic activity loss, without considering the effects of HBP.
Cell suspension is cultured in DBT-free liquid medium--30℃, 250rpm, 24h. Sample is detected for biological catalytic activity of BDS over time. The biological catalytic activity of BDS accords with an exponential attenuation, which is shown as below:
Hypothesis:
2.3 Modeling Part
1).Suppose the two intermediates--DBTO2 and HBPS—are only present in cytoplasm.
2).The inhibition to DszA, DszB and DszC of HBP is considered, while the inhibitory effect of HBPS on DszC which is mainly exists in the early stages of BDS is neglected, with the purpose of simplifying our modeling.
3).The DszD’s activity is considered non-inhibited, therefore we took the enzyme out of our modeling.
4).The loss of biological catalytic activity without the effects of HBP is considered.
5).Assume that the concentrations of DBT and HBP stay the same in all the three different phrases as the stirring rate of biore"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," changes were made today:
We incorporated the data from Persikov's database into out generator.
We included the ability to remove duplicate sequences in the output file (with a dictionary).
We added pseudocounts for fingers that bind to 'ANN' or 'CNN' targets. Because there is not much information for these targets, the data we do have may be biased. Thus, we want to make sure that amino acids that currently have no probability of occurring are bumped up to a minimum (currently 0.01).
We placed additional weight on non zif-268 backbones. Formerly, the amino acids for positions 1, 4, and 5 were fixed based on zif-268 data, regardless of the original helix sequences on these backbones. Now information from both zif-268 and the original helix sequence is considered when assigning weights to the amino acids.
We started working with Noah's reverse translate program.
We tested our generator to ensure that the sequences it was producing appeared to be legitimate.
Jamie looked at the multiple sequence alignments of the fingers generated, so see if the frequencies correlated with what we expected them to be. (?)
We input a known DNA triplet to see if the program generated sequences known to bind, according to OPEN data. When generating 10000 sequences, about half the known binders for the input triplet were found.
We created WebLogos to more easily visualize how adding the Persikov data affects the sequences we generate. The size of the letters correspond to the frequency of that amino acid in that position. We decided to incorporate the Persikov data so that our generator incorporates more information when generating sequences. Doing so does not drastically change the sequences generated.

Project Overview
Whooping cough, the infectious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, is diagnosed in tens of millions of people and results in almost 300,000 deaths globally each year. Low-income and unvaccinated individuals as well as infants are especially susceptible. Current diagnostic procedures are complicated, costly, and can take up to a week, by which time the disease may have progressed or spread. The enormous impact of this disease urgently motivates the development of a faster, cheaper, and more reliable diagnostic. Our epidemiology models suggest that earlier diagnosis could drastically reduce the incidence and impact of the disease. We propose an engineered bacteriophage diagnostic system for rapid clinical detection of pertussis.
As a proof of principle, we worked on engineering the T7 bacteriophage to express a version of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which we codon-optimized for expression in E. coli. Due to host-pathogen specificity, bacteriophages will only replicate and produce intracellular hCG if the target bacteria is present in the sample. The bacteriophage lyses the cell, releasing the hCG, which can then be detected using a pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests are commonly available in all clinics and can detect very low concentrations of hCG, which is an advantage over currently-available methods for detecting phage amplification. The bacteriophage system also requires minimal training to be used in lab and does not require any high-tech machinery. This will make the diagnostic readily usable in developing countries, where whooping cough is a particular concern. Besides pertussis, this method can be used"

Furture iGEMers
To promote iGEM and attract more high school teams from Beijing, our team went to The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University to give them a lecture about iGEM on October.17.2014. This high school is a key high school in Beijing, which has gained considerable fame in China and certain degree of influence abroad. With advanced teaching facilities and outstanding teachers, the garden-like school attaches great importance to teaching science and technology, so they are glad to learn more about iGEM.
During the classes, Di Ma gave a vivid speech on the general development of synthetic biology. Yuelong Hou gave an impression on what iGEM is, especially on high school team. He also shared the happiness and hardness of scientific research. Xuan Wang shared BNU’s Promethus Program. The students were amazed at the powerful E. Coli Prometheus.
After classes, they showed eagerness to participate in next year’s high school program and asked us to give more classes after the trip back from Boston. And visiting our lab motivated them to practice and learn more about synthetic biology. We also want to help them to build a senior high iGEM team in future. Their feedbacks from 27 students were as following.
Questions:
1. Do you know synthetic biology before? (您在我们的介绍之前知道合成生物学么？)
Yes-2 No-25
2. Do you know iGEM before? (您之前听说过iGEM么？)

Stanford,2009,Team:Stanford#ProjectPage_-_-_TEXT.html," the possibility that the output retinoic acid will become trapped inside Device 1 as inclusion bodies.  Finally the biochemical production of retinoic acid begins with acetyl Coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), the ubiquitous metabolic unit of energy common to almost all life.
The generator of Device therefore consists of the retinoic acid synthesis machinery linked to the SoxR/SoxS sensor.  Following sensor activation, synthesis of retinoic acid proceeds through two stages and the constituent genetic parts are located on two plasmids.  The first stage involves beta carotene synthesis from acetyl CoA derivatives and is mediated by the crt-gene cluster.  The crt cluster (BBa_K125005) is controlled by a constitutive promoter; this construct is located in its own plasmid.  The second stage of retinoic acid synthesis involves cleavage of beta carotene and subsequent oxidation to retinoic acid.  A second plasmid incorporates the two genes required for this conversion into the plasmid with the SoxR/SoxS sensor.
Overall, in an inflammatory IBD environment, elevated NO levels signal through the SoxR/SoxS sensor to induce production of retinoic acid from beta carotene, which diffuses out of Device 1 and modulates CD4+ cell differentiation toward Tregs, which are the primary immunosuppressive cells of the body.
Device 2: Anti-Immunosuppressive Device
Device 2 is the anti-immunosuppressive device: it functions by recognizing an immunosuppressive signal (5-methyltryptophan) and subsequently producing an inflammatory factor (Interleukin-6) that can activate the immune system.  Device 2 is intended to regulate Device 1 so that it does not inadvertently bring the body into an immunosuppressive state vulnerable to opportunistic infection and cancer.
Device 2’s sensor must be able to detect Treg activity in a concentration dependent manner.  Although Treg cells have distinct secretion profiles, the team could not identify any Treg markers to which E. coli responds directly.  Instead, the team discovered that Tregs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) to express the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which oxidizes and degrades tryptophan.  Since the Device 2 sensor’s signal is inversely related to target cell activity – reduced tryptophan levels indicate increased Treg activity and vice versa – the Device 2 sensor must act as an inverter.
Fortunately, there"

With our own subscription ECUSTLab, we posted a collaboration activity on iGEM Collaboration (https://2018.igem.org/Teams/Collaborations#collab_46) and publishing project description after collecting related information. In order to make it easier for subscription followers to understand the project idea, we translated the project description into Chinese, which was more convenient to comprehend. Meanwhile, we offered suggestions on ICT-Mumbai’s software to help them improve.
RHIT
What will happen if every iGEM project represents one superhero with special power just like in the movies? As a superhero with the supernatural power of cleaning all the rust and killing iron bacteria, Iron Guardian is a part of the League of Superheroes, where Iron Guardian met many other superheroes with unique powers and ambitions. What’s more, by designing the trading card of our superhero, we managed to spread the main idea of our project in a more attractive and accessible way.
CCiC
As a grand conference for Chinese iGEM teams to gather up and communicate with each other, CCiC provided us a precious opportunity to exchange opinions and sense the Giant Jamboree atmosphere in advance. We did presentation, presented poster, held a trouble-shooting meet-up, gave and got suggestions on projects, and improved our design accordingly.
XMU-China
Newsletter is a kind of special report on iGEM projects which contains the basic information of projects and teams. Upon the request of XMU-China, we took part in their collaboration activity and became a member of their newsletter group. By reading the finished newsletter published by XMU-China, we also learned other teams’ projects.
FJNU
On top of collaborating on “3+ net”, we also helped FJNU on the design of light-on switch by helping them build the relevant plasmids and sharing the measurement data. In addition, we’ve also put forward many constructive suggestions for the biosafety issues in their project.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," into an opportunity by using our end product to potentially solve yet another environmental issue. We realized that energy security is another pressing issue which countries face.
To solve these two problems simultaneously, we aim to convert the degraded plastics into electricity by feeding them as an energy source for an electricity-producing strain of bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Plastic degradation and electricity generation will be merged together in a Microbial Fuel Cell as described in our MFC design .
4. How Talking to Prof. Bookhart, an Environment and Sustainability Expert, Changed our Project Design
To better mold our project into addressing genuine environmental concerns, we consulted Professor Davis Bookhart, the head of the HKUST Environment and Sustainability Department, who is currently working on different projects to reduce the University’s environmental impacts while addressing and managing risks that arise from climate change and resource scarcities. We thought that he would be able to give us more insights on real/current environmental challenges which we could help solve and how we could ensure the sustainability of our production system.
We first presented our system to Professor Bookhart in July. A few concerns he had was that, from the perspective of sustainability, our project was actually converting PE, a carbon-containing pollutant, into CO2 through the respiration of Shewanella, which in itself ıs a greenhouse gas. This actually exacerbates the problem of global warming despite removing a terrestrial and marine pollutant. Instead, Prof. Bookhart suggested that we find a way to reuse the carbon in any way or to feed back into the system for more electricity generation. We can also sequester the CO2 in a way that the CO2 is converted to a solid or a liquid to be stored.
Prof. Bookhart had also asked about the threshold of electricity we expected to generate and how that electricity could be used. To really transform our project into an impactful product, we should implement an application for the electricity generated. We should as well focus on designing a device that could encourage the public to put their plastic waste to good use by generating electricity for daily use.
5.  More Insights – Meetup with iGEM teams in the environmental track
During our meetups with other iGEM teams for collaboration, we exchanged ideas with team HKJS_S and realized that their project mechanism could be implemented into our system to tackle the concern of CO2 by-product waste raised by Prof. Bookhart.
One of their parts encodes a nitrogenase, which has the ability to transform CO2 into methane. Both substrates were intimately linked with our project: the CO2 was the sustainability problem we had to tackle, while methane was"

Our motivation
Research work forms the basis of social progress by combining many fascinating aspects of science. We see iGEM as an important preparation for students of sciences and future researchers regarding their careers. Being able to acquire real work experiences early, learning to be independent as well as working in a team is a great  opportunity. A few of us have already been working in their field of interest so they were able to share experiences with the team. Nevertheless, everyone had a chance to grow their potentials in a different working environment.    iGEM offers the possibility to work in a team to reach one's scientific goals, create your own projects and become comfortable working with other people. Even if you did not have a university degree yet it does not exclude your personal potential. We are grateful that IGEM exists, for it is a great way to help students in their scientific career and develop the field of synthetic biology.

Grenoble-Alpes,2018,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the camera thanks to servomotors (in position OFF, the filter could be in front of the corresponding LEDs, in this case the scheme is wrong).
The camera takes a picture of the fluorescence, therefore it will probably be measured as last year, with a greyscale.
To do: Onshape of this new prototype, project report.

5/11: Onshape of the fluorescent module. Mail about epifluorescence to Lionel Bastard.
05/12/2018
Explored the iGEM’s latest development about fluorescence detection. Munich 2017 used a photoresistor. Cheap, to detect light variation, but highly sensitive to the environment, so cannot be applied if we’re to cold the well during the detection.
I however found a light captor sensitive from 0.1 lux and quite stable. I need to determine if it will fit to the fluorescence luminance, so I bought it with an Arduino.
Onshape of a second fluorescence detection module. The LEDs are missing, I failed to draw them, but I expect them to be next to the corresponding filter.

1st day at the Phelma’s remise!
I found the PERFECT good LEDs and filters ! The LEDs’ spectra are really narrow, so the noisy light should be entirely filtered. However, the filters are to be tested, especially one which cutoff wavelength is at 605 nm, so very near from the maximum wavelength emission (607 nm). According to its characteristic curve everything should be fine but it still needs to be tested.
From this day, the tests that I need to do are:
→ Influence of temperature on fluorescence
→ Influence of pH on fluorescence
→ Fluorescence intensity of BFP/RFP
→ Resolution test of the sensor; to be compared with a photoresistance
→ Tests of the LEDs & filters
05/15/2018
I received my Arduino Uno ! After struggling a lot to plug my several wires, I finally succeeded to:
→ enlight successively 2 LEDs
→ enlight successively 2 series of 2 LEDs
That is the good part of the day.
Concerning the bad part, the RFP biobrick might not be RFP, but a luminescent protein. The measurement must then be done by absorbance, which changes totally the structure of the module, as the light source is to be under the sample, but we do not have enough space. In a nutshell, this biobrick is a bioshit that I hope we won’t use.

Genetic Parts Rely on Complementation Strategy To Sense Analyte
When MtrB is not present, it is as if the switch is open, and current cannot flow.
When MtrB is reintroduced into the system, it is as if the switch is closed, allowing current to flow.
As described on our chassis page, the protein MtrB is required for S. oneidensis to be able to shuttle electrons outside the cell. Therefore, when a strain of S. oneidensis lacking mtrB is inoculated in a bioelectrochemical system, current cannot be significantly produced.
We can think of this in terms of a simple switch analogy—visualized in the figures to the left: Without MtrB, no extracellular transfer of electrons is possible, and no current is produced. However, when reintroduced, MtrB closes the switch therefore allowing extracellular reduction and current generation.
To sensitize Shewanella’s metal reduction pathway to our analytes, we decided to use a complementation strategy. By using the Shewanella MtrB knockout strain, JG 700, which was graciously provided by Professor Jeffery Gralnick from the University of Minnesota, we are able to reintroduce MtrB on a plasmid under the control of inducible promoters sensitive to the analytes we want to detect. Thus, MtrB—and therefore current—should only be produced in the presence of analyte.
One of the greatest strengths of this approach is its modularity; by simply switching out the sensing region on the plasmid, we"

Martyn offered to connect us with local agents in several countries to better understand what steps are needed to get out product to market. Most medications require rigorous testing, but the requirements vary country to country. We hope that this relationship will allow us to plan for future testing and determine the likelihood of our product making it to market.
Population Council
The Population Council conducts research and works to address critical worldwide health and development issues. Through our connection with FP2020, we met John Townsend, the Director of Country Strategy for Pop Council. Specifically, he works in the women's health division to find new promising birth control methods. John was inspired by our project and offered to connect us with several colleagues in different countries, including other members of Pop Council. We discussed potential issues with manufacturing as well as which countries may be ideal to start product development. John helped give our project a route to development, and we are extremely grateful for our ongoing relations with his organization.
Our Brochure
We created the brochure shown below as a way to educate others regarding birth control and address popular rumors about contraception. This brochure has not been reviewed or approved by professionals and therefore is not ready for distribution. Below is strictly a working draft of our brochure.
Silver Medal Requirements
We contacted family members, friends, and representatives of the World Health Organization to discuss current issues with birth control. We sent out questionnaires to several grassroot organizations and advocacy groups around the world to gauge their interest in our product and learn about stigma, cost, and access issues. We also presented to local classes and partook in a TEDx talk to teach people about iGEM and discuss potential ethical issues with our project.
Gold Medal Requirements
We took what we learned from our questionnaire and other outreach efforts to create a product tailored to our potential users. The women who returned questionnaires encouraged us to consider cost, location, and accessibility. We localized contraceptive production because we were informed that drugstores and hospitals are far away for women in rural areas. We will use discreet packaging for our product because several women are worried about being seen using birth control in stigmatized areas. We are also researching ways to get our product to market in several countries by collaborating with Family Planning 2020 and Population Council. Given that our yeast needs a food source, we collaborated with the ITESG research team and engineered our yeast to survive off upcycled dairy waste. Through our conversations, we determined that women even in rural areas have high accessibility to milk-producing animals, which makes our milk-surviving yeast plausible for most areas"
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#SDP Results_-_-_TEXT.html," appeared to be a medium constitutive T4 ligase generator (), made by the same team. To rule out a mistake by the registry, the part was requested again. A new batch was transformed and sent to us. It was grown up, isolated and restricted with EcoRI and PstI, to obtain insert length. It was exactly as long as the first batch (~1700bp), which corresponds to the expected length of  (1668bp), and is significantly longer than the expected length of 1114bp. These findings were entered into the registry as a user review of .
As a workaround, a twin of what was supposed to be  was constructed, using . The sequence of the resulting part () was confirmed, as shown in the sequence analysis section of the parts page. Thereby the sequence of  was indirectly confirmed.
Close inspection of this sequence also revealed, that the homing endonuclease had an LVA degradation tag attached to the end of its sequence. This information was not mentioned in the original I-SceI parts page (), nor in any of the constructs that contain this part. As protein tags in general can influence the folding and function of a protein and the LVA tag in specific reduces stability of a protein, this is considered quite an essential feat. This information was therefore entered into the registry at the concerned parts pages, in the form of user reviews.
Integration
With the IPTG inducible I-SceI homing endonuclease generator and the I-SceI restriction site with aTc inducible reporter ready, the two parts could be combined to yield the final Self Destructive Plasmid. This final construct is depicted in the image below.
Makeup of , the Self Destructive Plasmid. It consists of the an IPTG inducible I-SceI homing endonuclease generator and its restriction site. An anhydrotetracyclin inducible GFP-LVA generator is included to check for the destruction of the plasmid when the endonuclease is induced.

3) Opportunities and Challenges
Aspect
Opportunities & Challenges
Technological
Opportunities:
The existence of Science Park in Hong Kong as a biotechnology equipment hub.
Tailor made for consumer as the parts can be change to detect other types of fungi and wounds. Tool kit and specific sites for changing the parts will be provided.
Challenges:
Range of concentration by which phenolic and sap flow compounds can be detected is minimal.
Inability to differentiate between damage from fungi versus natural occurrences.
Economical
Opportunities:
The parts are reusable, the average cost drops and reduces the invention costs.
Interchangeable. Setting up a library for certain companies, inventors and scientists to access and exchange their parts.
Protection of public property and human life: Prevent the trees to accidentally fall down.
Reduce the cost of maintenance, human resources need to take care of trees.
Reduce pesticide usage. Once the product is applied, no refill is needed.
Early diagnosis: It can be used to prevent tree from falling down.
Legal
Opportunities:
Risk assessment protocols have not yet been developed to assess the potential ecological risks associated with synthetic biology and the product.
Challenges:
Environmental safety protocols that regulate the release of biotechnology devices into nature are mostly against constructs made through synthetic biology.
Must seek approval from Convention of Biological Diversity in order to proceed with product development (UNEP, 2012).
Environmental
Opportunities:
Protect the Heritage Trees: Old and valuable trees
Reduce fungicides usage: Pesticides can diminish biodiversity, disrupt natural biological equilibrium and contaminate other non-target areas.
Challenges:
Using hosts with short reproductive cycle such as Lianas may enable a rapid distribution of the tri-stable trait across the species, which can create consequences that are unknown to us.
Disruption of the flora’s rhizosphere due to unknown interactions.
Political
Challenges:
Hong Kong government is setting up a Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan – which means that tighter supervision and higher standards will be given by the Innovation and Technology Bureau towards newly formed biotechnological projects such as the tri-stable switch (HK Policy Address, 2016).

So that’s what I’m thinking about, breaking spaghetti into smaller pieces. When I’m doing interviews, sometimes on Quirks and Quarks you’d hear me say, let me see if I’ve got this right, I say that a lot, that’s me thinking on the spot. Because you just said something really complicated, and I’m trying to spin it back in one sentence. You just spent the last two minutes telling me something, and I had to spin it back using one sentence, and usually with an analogy. Is it like breaking up spaghettis? And they would say yeah, and then that just crystallizes it for the audience, and then we move on to the next thing. We just take it step by step by step. And in radios, specially, it is really important to be clear. Not, I don’t like the term “dumb it down”. We don’t dumb it down. We just make it really clear, because in radio we hear it once, and in televisions you have pictures to help you. So you don’t understand it at least you can see it. And in newspapers and magazines if you don’t understand something, you could go back and read it again. But in radios it only go by once. You only hear it once and it’s gone. And if you hear something that you don’t understand, you go, what the heck was that? What did she just say? And while you’re thinking that, you are missing the next sentence. You’re falling behind, and when you try to catch up you can get lost. So it’s really important in radio to be really really clear. Make sure that we are stepping our way through the story and that we understand this point and let’s move on to the next one and don’t turn any sharp corners, you don’t want to go from one subject over here to something that’s totally different. So again, it’s storytelling. There’s a line, there’s a story plot, the setting, the characters, plot, and you come to the conclusion at the end. So it’s all about storytelling. Angela: So have you encountered instances where the audience still doesn’t understand even after you summarize it? Or if there’s something that the scientists are staying that is just too complicated for you to summarize in one simple sentence, then what would you do? Bob: Well I did have a scientist who got really complicated, and I said, could we try that again, could"

Colonies appeared on the plate from the ligation of pC13AU in pAg13H, so we set up cultures of those and ran a colony PCR. Colonies appeared on the other ligated pAg13H plates a little later, and those were cultured (with corresponding colony PCRs) as well. We miniprepped the cultures of pC13AU in pAg13H, and the other cultures of vector pAh13EA. Sequencing for pC13DU came back successful. We ran a Gibson assembly pC13DU and pS13EB then transformed with 5x Spectinomycin to check for selection. We also made a lot more LB and LB/agar! For characterization, we retransformed pAK13D, pC13AQ, and pAK13CY into BL21-AI cells by electroporation in order to run another assay tomorrow. We electroporated ‘’PpkiA’’ + pC13Z and PpkiA + pC13F into DH5a E. coli. Next, we plated the bacteria on chloramphenicol plates for selection. After column purifying the PCR products of pC13A, the carotenoids team performed a double digestion of pC13A and pAK13D using enzymes XbaI and PstI.
We cultured constructs ligated into the pAg13H vector for the upcoming fungal transformation. Hopefully they were successful! We also began to prepare liquid cell cultures for another fluorescence assay. The carotenoids team did a double digestion of pC13A and pAK13D.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Convention on biological diversity: “the fair and equitable sharing of benefit arising out of the utilization of genetic resources” . Especially developing countries which often have a manifold biodiversity are affected by bio piracy. The Nagoya Protocol intends to ensure that these countries at least profit financially or non-financially by the resulting research and products of their genetic resources. In addition to accessing genetic resources, it covers traditional knowledge concerning these resources. Contracting countries are bound to take action to guarantee informed consent prior to any course of action, as well as impartial benefit-sharing, respecting local laws as well as customary use and exchange.
Today, 100 countries signed the Nagoya Protocol . To succeed, every partner nation should establish ABS National Focal Points, competent national authorities, legislative administrative, national databases, and checkpoints for information.
Germany signed the Nagoya protocol on July 20th, 2016. Our donor of the isoG-metabolism-pathway is Croton tiglium, which is a herb in traditional Asian medicine. Its original occurrence is in the Asian region. To make sure we do not infringe upon the Nagoya Protocol regulations, we clarified the origin of our plant as we got it from the botanical garden of the Phillips University Marburg. Croton tiglium is originally from an undocumented old stock of the botanical garden Giessen. In 1986, the botanical garden Marburg received seeds from this stock. The date on which the EU regulation entered into force was October 2014. All resources collected before this date are not subject to reporting requirements of the Nagoya Protocol in Germany. Thomas Greiber (Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, Head of Division Div I 1.4 “Competent National Authority for the Nagoya Protocol”) confirmed “[..]Therefore, the respective areas of application are not touched by this EU-regulation, and the mentioned regulations are not relevant.”
Therefore, we are allowed to work with the plant and publish information and results about gene sequences and metabolism pathways without violating applicable law."

The strains that are used are: I+S+C+, I+S+C-, I+S-C+, I+S-C-, I-S-C-, I-S+C-, I-S-C+, I-S+C+. All constructs are available with either mCherry or GFP functioning as a reporter protein.
Separating bacteria, liposomes and possible media soluble reporter proteins from each other in an intact form proved troublesome. Method is still not fully developed. Centrifugation with spin columns containing a 450 µm pore size filter was used to separate bacteria and liposomes. Proteinase K was used as a method to sever the injectisome needle complex, in case of strong attachment to the liposomes, that could prevent separation. Moreover proteinase k would remove residual media soluble reporter proteins, so.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

CODON OPTIMIZATION: ENGINEERING A MORE USEFUL GENE AT THE CODON LEVEL
Click HERE to return to the Projects page.
Project Summary
Background
Many important bioproducts are comprised of proteins, and proteins are made up of amino acids, specified by certain codons in an organism's DNA. This DNA is then transcribed and translated to create these proteins. Since multiple codons can be used to specify an amino acid in E.coli, it is possible to use multiple coding sequences to produce the same chain of amino acids.
The Big Question
Even though genes with different codon preferences can code for the same protein, they may not necessarily do so at the same rate, or lead to expression of that protein at the same level1. The question we asked is ""How and why are they different?""
To biologists, the answer to this question may shed light on the nature of translation itself, and the reasons that some codons are naturally preferred by the genome of E.coli. To engineers, it could act as an additional point of control over tricky genetic systems, and perhaps more efficient production of useful bioproducts. To undergrads, the pursuit of these answers was the summer of a lifetime.
Degenerate codons do not necessarily lead to equally efficient expression of an amino acid.
Our Objective
Codon optimization is not a new idea, but what makes our project special is that it used several novel criteria for optimization. By picking specific codons for a synthetic gene, we can determine the effect of certain types of codons on translation and ultimately draw conclusions that may be very useful to the biotech community.
Our Design
To optimize genes we had to find some criteria. What we chose were codons that were generally rare in the overall genome (rare-G1), common in the overall genome (common-G2), abundant in regions of the genome with known fast translation initiation (fast-G3), abundant in regions of the genome with known slow translation initiation (slow-G4), or predicted by advanced software to have slow insertion time (slow insertion time-G5).
Next, we chose a gene to optimize, and came up with"

       III) Export our vectors to other cancer research labs throughout the world, in order to test our vector in other conditions and other cancer cells and to improve our product.
        IV) Testing the vector in animal experiments to test possible toxicity and dose regimens
        V) Testing the vector in animal experiments to test the efficiency in vivo.
      V) After achieving positive proof-of-concept results in animal experiments, our strategy will require intensive R&D program toward clinical testing in patients.
        SWOT Analysis
Weaknesses
Delivery- our system is relying on other delivery systems which will be effective enough in vivo.
The features of each target are still not clear, and there we will need to build a ""biological bank"" to gather this information.
Strengths
Specific tool which can easily diagnose and treat cancer, using the biological characteristics of the tumor cells.
In comparison to other methods in the market today, our system offers the most accurate way to diagnose and treat cancer cells. The treatment is unique for the specific features of every tumor.
Our product has modular design, and can be modified according to specific needs (e.g., personalized for each patient tumor profile).
Threats
Our system relies on intensive research that need to be done on DNA vectors and delivery systems.
Competitors.
Opportunities
Our system is modular, so we can match the system to many other methods which are in use today.
Collaborations between different aspects of science can occur with our system, uniting synthetic biology with other fields of medicine.

3.   Market Analysis
        Target Market
Global spending on oncology reached $100 billion in 2014 as new treatments and increased demand drive steady growth.
-Global spending on oncology medicines – including therapeutic treatments and supportive care, and measured at ex-manufacturer prices not reflecting off-invoice discounts, rebates and patient access schemes – increased 10.3% in 2014 and reached $100 billion, up from $75 billion five years earlier.
-Targeted therapies now account for almost 50% of total spending and have been rising at a compound average growth rate of 14.6% over the past five years.
-In the major developed markets, a sharp increase in the volume of protected brands since 2011 and significant new product launches have been the primary drivers of spending growth, while the impact of patent expiries has moderated over the past few years.
-On a per capita basis, spending on therapeutic oncology medicines in the U.S. reached"

One way we could do that is using renewable energies and biofuels and avoiding the use of oils. Once time that Synthetic biology becomes a true engineering and passes its childhood, can be a useful tool to produce cells dedicated to the production of several types of biofuels, which could reduce highly the CO2 emissions and contribute that way to the war against climate warming.

Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we're hoping it's a success this time. We also started overnight LB cultures of  pAb13T (pBARGPE1).
We redid the digestion of crtY and the T7 promoter plasmid from yesterday, apparently successfully this time. We also started liquid cultures of pBARGPE1, a plasmid we got from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center.

If successful, the ligation will form pAK13AD. pC13K (crtI, BBa_K118003) and pC13M (crtB, BBa_K118002) were digested with XbaI and PstI for insertion into pAK13D, and separated on a gel. pAb13T (pBARGPE1) was miniprepped and quantified by nanodrop.
Crossing our fingers, we gel extracted and ligated the ostensibly successful digests of crtY and the T7 promoter plasmid, and then transformed. We also digested crtI and crtB, other carotenoid genes that we will also be putting under the T7 promoter, and miniprepped the pBARGPE1 that had been grown up last night.

pC13K (crtI, BBa_K118003) and pC13M (crtB, BBa_K118002) were digested with XbaI and PstI, pAK13D with SpeI and PstI, pC13Q (TtrpC) with EcoRI and XbaI, and pCg13R (nptII) with EcoRI and SpeI, and all were separated on a gel; crtI looked faint, and pAK13D was smeared, but all fragments were cut out for purification tomorrow.
Unfortunately, there were no colonies on the transformation plate for T7 + crtY, so we redid the digestions for those. We also digested TtrpC and nptII for the eventual cloning of a PtrpC+nptII+TtrpC construct (we have to put the parts together in reverse because nptII contains a PstI site, which we will be trying to remove as well). Gel extractions of digested crtI and crtB were also empty (insignificant concentrations), so these digestions were also redone, and all were run on a gel, which looked mostly okay.

The high-school team leaders plan to have lab training happen on the weekends and Mondays and Fridays for about 2 to 4.5 hours a day. The instructor will lead lab training sessions along with help from experienced members of the UW iGEM team. The high-school team leaders plan to use the syllabus used by the UW iGEM team to train students and notes will be posted on the team google drive. Students planning to work on the dry lab portion of the project will be encouraged to take codecademy courses online tailored to the specific project and determined by Kevin Li, the drylab helper from the UW iGEM team. Kevin plans to also give a lecture on the iGEM wiki and the role programming plays in iGEM outside of the main project.
The summer research plan will depend on the nature of the iGEM project the high-school team plans to pursue and thus, hasn’t been determined yet.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Lab protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,". The ratio of insert to vector should be 5:1 and the total amount of DNA should not exceed 50 ng.
The two remaining items to be added into your mix will be ddH2O and Ligase. The amount of Ligase enzyme to be added is only 1 μl, so you know how much DNA (insert+vector), Ligase and the buffer to add; the rest of the volume (→ 20 μl) should be accounted for with ddH2O.
Remember though that Ligase should only be added in the end, because once added into your mix its going to get to work and you don’t want it playing around with your dna before you have added everything else. Another important thing to remember is that the Ligase enzyme cannot be taken from the freezer to your lab-bench; you have to instead add your Ligase into your mix by working at the freezer.
Controls are always important and good indications if things are working the way they should be, so a good control with ligations is a negative control, that being just vector with no insert, the rest of the recipe being the same. This should hopefully give you no colonies as it would indicate your digested vector is in fact digested and didn’t re-ligate. If there are colonies on your negative control plate, it will give you a good indication of the background noise on your actual ligation plates.

1.1 The Problem

Peptide Delivery System
The Problem
Many short chain peptide drugs are suseptible to breakdown in the stomach making them suitable candidates for encapsulation.
When synthesised, all polypeptides begin with the same amino acid: methionine. This often removes the desired bioactivity of the compounds.  Some larger polypeptides are cleaved by proteases within the body into smaller functional peptides that do not begin with methionine (as shown on the image to the left.)
Making use of the peptide processing pathways within the body, we propose a universal template that can be used for the synthesis of all short chain peptides. By encoding a linker region that is designed to be recognised and cleaved by proteases within the gut, we get past the production difficulties associated with peptides, and allow for the release of these peptides into the gut. What is more, our system does not require the expression any additional genes!
Peptide Processing
To enable The E.ncapsulator to produce peptides without inhibiting their functionality, we have developed a removable linker region that starts with the amino acid methionine. Following the release of the peptide in the intestine, a naturally occuring enzyme (enteropeptidase) removes the linker region from the front of the peptide releasing the remainder in its functional form. The use of this linker region can be extended to any polypeptide that does not begin with methionine.
This image shows the universal template for peptide production. The methionine start is shown in RED, the protease recognition site is shown in BLUE and opiorphin is shown in GREEN. The RED & BLUE sections make up the removable linker region cleaved in the gut.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi.

This is what I tried to perform next but I struggle to have a decent apparatus to do my experiments: the photodiode is not correctly placed on the eppendorf so it saturates. Well, I’m just thinking of it, but it may be time to use again my 3D impressed unit.
08/19/2018
Let’s sum up again.
Since last time, I made a lot of experiments, with many different conditions. I needed to make sure that my filter was correctly chosen. So I reused the last year apparatus, that I know it had worked well.
The blue filter is my own filter, the red one is last year’s. The 1st graph displays different value of voltage fluorescence depending on the light source and the emission filter. I have very little differences between the voltage in any case excepting with a very bright light source. I could conclude 2 things from this : either the light source is too bright to be filtered with the red filter, which means mine is better, or the light source is so bright that the fluorescence intensity is much higher, but my filter is too selective; so the red filter is the better one. The second graph compares the voltage obtained with each filter with the control and the fluorescent samples. ΔU is defined as ΔU=ΔUred-ΔUblue. This Δ is always positive, I always have a higher voltage with the red filter, which is coherent with the previous results. I also get similar differences between the samples with different filters and light sources conditions, except for the very bright one: the control voltage is much higher. My conclusion on this is that the filters are equivalent for low bright light sources, but mine is better for high light intensity, which I can get with my LEDs when I supply them with the voltage source. Considering also that I know my filter but not last year’s, I decided to keep mine.
Yet, I realised something. I don’t exactly remember how, but I got interested in the way my LEDs excite my samples. Either I remembered my past experiments with my 3D printed apparatus or I went on them again, but I was striked by how the light on the sample is less bright that at the level of the LEDs. I made the terrible mistake to think that the viewing angle was not important. Worse than that, I thought that the optical power is unchanging in the light beam, which is dreadfully wrong. I paid too much attention to the optical power, but the light intensity, which is dependent on the solid angle (and Lionel Bast"

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Slide i3: Quotient picture (before/after) Anti-GFP (goat, biotinylated)
Slide i3: Quotient picture (before/after) StrepCy5 - second flush
Slide i3: Platereader after iRIf. Cy5 intensity
As can be seen, StrepCy5 binding (first flush) was good, but a little weaker than for slide i2. Anti-GFP (mouse) again didnt bind to GFP, but Anti-GFP (goat) did bind properly to GFP. Second flush with StrepCy5 confirmed that the biotinylated antibody did bind to GFP (although signal is quite weak). Platereader signal afterwards showed intense Cy5 signal for the bBSA stamp and less signal for the GFP/biotinylated anti-GFP stamp.
Testing stamping with plasma activated PDMS stamps
Two plasma activated stamps were stamped onto a plasma activated slide. Flooding shows a few bubbles, the shape of the stamps are indistinguishible
11.06.2015 Two DiaCHIP stamps were cut out and plasmaactivated for 30 sek, then incubated with bBSA for ~60 min with 50µg/ml bBSA. They were then blocked for 15 min with 50µg/ml BSA. Afterwards they were then stamped onto a plasmaactivated slide (S29) and used in the iRIF setup. The stamping took 30 sek each. One stamp was pushed very gently onto the glass slide, the other one was pressed onto the surface as always.
Observations: Incubation with bBSA showed that the PDMS is a lot more hydrophilic after plasma activation. Normally we incubate with 50µl solution, however with the plasma-activated PDMS, the solutions flows down the side of the stamp after about 30µl.  Flooding in the iRIF showed bubbles, however they don't seem as bad as usual, since the shape of the stamps can't be recognized. The stamp above was gently pressed onto the slide, the lower one with regular pressure.
12/13.06.2015 stamped 4 slides with plasma activated stamps. Stamps were all hydrophyllic. However in no case did strep-cy5 bind to the stamp. Fluorescence never showed any signal, indicating that the protein is bound to the stamp and does not dissassociate. Slide 314 was damaged because PDMS bound to the slide and stuck"

Analysis: There seems to have been no cutting with NotI as the band sin the digested lanes are the same as the bands in the uncut lanes.  There are also some strange bands at about 12 KB which are much too big to be LuxOD47E.  It looks like my gene may be lacking the NotI restriction sites, which indicates that the BBK Ampliification Gradient PCR to Biobrick my gene if interest may not have been successful.  We will proceed by returning to this PCR and repeating it.
Repeated PCR, see protocol on June 6th 2009.
PCR Products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel run at 120 V with 1.0 KB GeneRuler DNA Ladder.  See gel photo below.
Lanes 1-12 contain LuxOD47E in pCR2.1-TOPO vector.  Lane 13 is a negative control with only Mastermix + ddH2O.
From this gel, it looks like our gene if interest, LuxOD47E is there as we see bads around 1.4 KB, as expected (gene is 1362 base pairs).  We will proceed by isoltaing plasmid from the PCR product and performing a NotI Verification digest.
So I pooled the DNA from the BBK amplification PCR.  Lanes: 2,3,9,11 and 12 went into tube 1 and lanes 4,5,6,7 and 8 went into tube 2.  I did a PCR product isolation (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and took the concentration using the Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.

From 2008.igem.org
The Lethbridge CCS team is made up of high school students from Calvin Christian School, near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.  We are loosely affiliated with the University of Lethbridge team.
Our focus for iGEM 2008 is on ligase-independent cloning (LIC).  In existing, commonly-used cloning protocols, the ligation step is often problematic and inefficient.  We believe that LIC can simplify and speed up the cloning procedure, and  we plan to try out a LIC procedure which we believe will be of interest for general use by iGEM teams and others.

5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
I) Purpose
To optimize 5-bromodeoxyuridine concentration for T7 phage
II) Expected Outcome
- Settle procedure for inducing random mutations in phage.
- 5-bromodeoxyuridine concentration will affect phage viability, which will be seen in the different number of plaques formed. 5-bromodeoxyuridine should aslo generate random mutations that produce relatively smaller phage.
III) Reagents Used
5-bromodeoxyuridine stock in freezer labeled T7; various bottles of uncontaminated LB; BL21 overnight
IV) Procedure
1) Applying the mutagen (5.20)
- From 5.13 Determining E coli concentration with spectrophotometer, we know that the concentration of E coli BL21 in a liquid overnight culture is about 3.12E8 cell/mL. We need to dilute it get our wanted E coli concentration.
- Label 5 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200. To each of these test tubes, add 1.5mL of E coli overnight and 8.5mL of LB to make it a total of 10mL. This will give us approximately 5E7 cell/mL or 5E8 cell/test tube
- To the five centrifuge tubes, add 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 uL of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. The volume of the mutagen should correspond to"
Tsinghua-A,2012,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling#Sensitivity_-_-_TEXT.html," degradation of Cre protein increases so that the Cre declines to zero faster and the time when Cre exists decreases , the number of times of flip will be smaller and the inversion may even happen only once when the degradation constant of Cre protein is proper. We can also see that the number of genes in state ‘B’ which we want is bigger for the reason that when lots of genes flip to the state ‘B’ from state ’A’ and ready to flip back , Cre and Cre-Loxp have declined to zero , so these genes keep the state ‘B’ finally. To understand the affection of the degradation constant of Cre protein more clearly, we then simulate the process when the degradation constant of Cre protein changes from 0.1 to 1.5. And we can get the following result.
To see the result more clearly, we magnify the above figure and just see a part of it.
The result shows that there is more genes in state ‘B’ which we want when the degradation constant of Cre protein is smaller. So we can expect that if we introduce a feed forward to the system which can accelerate the degradation of Cre protein after a certain time we add arabinose, we can also get more genes in state ‘B’ finally. Based on this idea, we designed a system with feed forward.

Those supplements include doses of vitamin A and tablets of iron and                         folic acid, in order to prevent xerophtalmia - which can lead to blindness - and anaemia.
However, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) held in 2005-2006 in India reports that                         only 28% of children received those supplements and health care even though 4/5 of children                         under six lived in a region covered by an anganwadi center. In the 6 months preceding the                         survey, only 1/4 of the children between 12-35 months were given vitamin A supplements - and in                         9 Indian states, this number falls to less than 20%. The access to ICDS has been improved in                         recent years, however, although access is still far from being universal (2). According to a                         national survey held in 2013-14, 46% of children aged 6-59 months had received doses vitamin A.
As for folic acid, the 2013-14 survey reports only 14% of children aged 6-59 months having                         received iron and folic acid supplements.
Though the program holds great promise and has implemented more than a million anganwadi centers, it is clear that people’s access to them is still very limited. People have to walk to                         the nearest center everyday if they want to receive the supplements, which is not convenient                         especially in rural areas.
Vitamins in everyone’s home
This observation held a major role in our design of a product that can be grown at home, in every village or household. A culture of microorganisms doesn’t require an expensive infrastructure; in fact, most Indian families have already been growing microbial cultures that are several generations old by using a part of their daily yogurt as a starter for the fermentation of the next day’s yogurt. A great part of our project was dedicated to find a cheap and edible medium in which the microbes could be cultivated at home, and to manufacture a simple and practical way to distribute our engineered yeast and bacteria (See Manufacturing page ). We found that a microbial culture could be grown in a very simple medium like potato juice, and that the yeast could be lyophilized, mixed with rice flour and water, and distributed in the form of small cubes.
We believe that a culture of yeast and bacteria that can be grown at home and supplements                         fermented foods with vitamins could reach far more"

The second batch was left in the water bath at around 60 degrees for about eight hours and had turned significantly darker.  Poured plates with this anyway, but they may be unusable.  Another reason why these plates may be unusable is that the agar was around 60 degrees when antibiotic was added, meaning that they may not actually have active AMP within them.
Also, almost all plates from both batches had bubbles in them, requiring application of flame.  However, lacking a good flame, we were forced to heat up a loop and attempt to remove bubbles using this.  The result was that some bubbles remained on the plates and that the agar was burnt in some places.

The re-priming of DNA template happens every few iterations of synthesis. Each site housing a Guanine nucleotide acts as a potential spot for modified nucleotide incorporation.
The incorporation of nucleotides is based on the probabilities set by initial ratios of the substrate and reference nucleotides. The model assumes that incorporation of the modified nucleotide into a DNA sequence during replication initiates the termination and dissociation of the phi29 polymerase from the DNA template. Every incorporation of Substrate Nucleotides is followed by a probability recalculation.
Using different ratios of the substrate and reference nucleotides as an input, the distribution of DNA fragments was generated. Because the kinetics parameters and features of phi29 polymerase and multiple displacement amplification reaction are complex and not quite understood, the generated data was normalized to the output distribution of DNA fragment size when zero substrate of nucleotides.
Figure 1. Normalized mathematical model output DNA fragment distribution.
The distribution of DNA fragment size for different initial substrate and reference nucleotide ratios was generated using the mathematical phi29 model. The data is normalized to the distribution output generated with zero substrate nucleotides.
As seen from the distribution violin plots shown in figure 1, the increase of potentially inhibiting substrate nucleotide concentration (its ratio to reference nucleotides) decreases the fragment size distribution as expected. Such amplification inhibition and reduced DNA fragment size distribution could pose a difficult task during the Nanopore sequencing of amplified DNA product and short sequencing read mapping and analysis.
Experimental validation
Now that we are aware of such possible degree Substrate Nucleotide inhibition, we set out to test and titrate the possible nucleotide concentration and ratios used in CAT-Seq workflow for best possible DNA fragment distribution results.
Figure 2. Amplified DNA correlation to substrate nucleotide concentration in the reaction.
DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750µM dNTP concentration with varied substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of substrate nucleotides the amount of DNA amplified increases as seen by the increased intensity of the DNA band and smear.
First of all, the lower limit of substrate nucleotides (Sub-dCTP) was determined. MDA reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig. 2 hint that large concentrations of substrate-bound nucleotides might inhibit the reaction, as the larger amplified DNA product bands fade as more substrate nucleotides are added, just as the model predicted.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#safety-d_-_-_TEXT.html," serious problem should watermarking become an integrated part of synthetic biology. Should the genetic watermark deteriorate to the point where one is no longer able to read it, it would not constitute any kind of safety measure, being able to tell that the part was likely to have been made artificially being the only thing we would be able to tell. Knowing that data will deteriorate, it may be impossible to determine whether the watermark found in rogue bacteria is authentic or a degenerate. The deterioration is however slow and arbitrary. Our code is so small, that the change that any nucleotide associated with the watermark is going to mutate is very limited. The chances of finding the authentic code intact should be very good.
The open source approach
Sharing all this information on creating new synthetic parts that can be inserted into living organisms, also means that people with harmful agendas have access to this knowledge. This naturally means that wrongful actions are possible by use of synthetic biology, but we do not think that this should stand in the way of all the possibilities synthetic biology holds. Also, the more we know about how to create synthetic DNA strands, the better we are equipped if any harmful incident should occur. As of now, it might also just be easier to drop a bomb or send out letters of anthrax. Should a bacteria be used for a malign purpose it would be quite easy to insert a false watermark to blame others. So we need to keep in mind that a plot could be made against someone. However, if anyone was interested in harming as many as possible, this person probably wouldn’t care about watermarking at all. This also means that we cannot expect watermarking to play a part in any legal case.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Since the enzymes are only active when both substrates enter the active site, the distance of dirhamnolipid and Serine is also important. For investigation of active site accessibility of dirhamnolipid for all three enzymes, it was preplaced in the active site and distance between the ligand and important residue Serine in the active site of the enzyme was measured in every time step during simulation.
Dirhamnolipid leaves the active site of CALB after more than 100 ns but is not bound in contact distance so a reaction seems to be unlikely (Figure 5, A). Most of the time, it is more than 1 nm away from Ser 105 while it is bound much closer in PLE (Figure 5, B) leading to the conclusion, that PLE is a much better acceptor for this substrate. Here, it stays almost all 165 ns in contact distance slightly over 0.5 nm. For FSC (Figure 5, C), this distance is also bigger than for PLE. Interestingly, dirhamnolipid is reentering the active site at the end just like chitosan in this case. This observation can be further analyzed since this represents the substrate docking process and at the end, a productive conformation is reached.
Figure 5: Measurement of the distance between the second ligand rhamnolipid and the active site of each protein: For all the three proteins, a residue involved in catalytic activity was chosen as part of the active site. For CALB we used Ser 105, for PLE Ser 204 and for FSC Ser 120.
Conclusion and Outlook
To put it in a nutshell, all three simulations showed a well equilibrated system and no protein unfolding. PLE was the only enzyme able to bind dirhamnolipid within 0.5 nm. Therefore we suggest PLE for linking rhamnolipids to chitosan enzymatically.
For higher significance of simulations, replicates are useful since MD simulations always contain a statistical aspect. This work can be done in the future. Furthermore, other enzyme can be tested for better substrate acceptance.  For example other Lipase like Lipase II from Rhizopus Niveus.

While we never seen a plate that contains bacterial lawn before, we found out later that it was not the transformed bacteria because of the following: First, the negative control plate also showed the same bacterial lawn growth. That means the plate was not doing its job in antibiotic-based selection. Because all the plates showed similar characteristic, the plate either lack kanamycin or it was added when the agar mixture was still hot, thus degrading the antibiotic. Second, the plasmid prep did not show any growth, meaning that the bacteria did not prefer 37 degree Celsius (unlike E. coli). This problem appeared suddenly because we just made the kanamycin plate the previous day. Another problem also appeared when Shannon was about to transform several more bench top ligation reaction when Kyle realized that the LB broth was contaminated. There was a yellow/transparent clump of spore-like materials lying at the bottom. This is bad because another set of ligation was transformed with that LB broth on the previous Sunday, meaning that its quality would be compromised as well. We found out later that these plates did not grow either. In order to avoid such problem, we decided to remake the LB broth along with the plates. We did negative control on the new Ampicillin and Kanamycin plates and they turned out fine. I then divided the LB broth into several aliquotes, each for one team member. This is done not only to improve efficiency (no need to transfer broth from big flask to the small one every time) but also to reduce the risk of contamination.
In terms of our overall progress, everything tended to work well up until ligation. While we could not verify the condition of our ligation, they did not transform well. So Traci decided to prepare a new batch of E. coli cells, especially because our stock has been running out as well. Some other people decided to prepare a new set of plasmid prep by either using old plates or streaking new plates. In such cases, transformation never became a problem for us. So we figured out that the problem should be caused by ligation. Traci then ordered a package of Quick Ligation. I also tried doing ethanol precipitation for the gel extraction samples with extremely low DNA concentration, which supposedly compress the DNA into an extract of smaller amount but higher concentration. But it did not work either.
On my own personal attempt at creating a device using GFP composite, I had not been able to progress further either due to ligation problem. So with all the new tools in hand ("

Experimental Design and Lab Work
Earlier in the guide we covered Project Design, now we will be looking into Experimental Design. So what is experimental design? Experimental Design is the layout of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment(s). With this in mind we approached our design by using SMART goals.
Specific: Define goal
Measureable: Established criteria for measuring our goals.
Assignable: Play to your teammates stengths and assign accordingly.
Realistc: The goal and results must beableto be realistically achievable with the  available resources.
Timeframe: When can results be obtained.
For our project our main SMART goal looked like this:
S: To design and create a catalog of novel bio bricks that allows proteins to express colour  when silver stained
M: Measure using SDS-PAGE and Silver Staining.
A: Eduardo and David run the experiments as they were the most capable at the bench.
R: To obtain at least two colors that are not golden brown.
T: To obtain these colors within four months.
While all of these steps are important, we believe that for experimental design two of these steps are critically important to the success of the experiments. They are the Specifics and the Measurables. By knowing the specifics and measurables it leads you to understand how to frame your experiments to obtain your results.
However, like with most iGEM experiences, things very rarely turn out as expected. Two months into our project we realized we made a critical error in our bio brick design. To mitigate this set back we immediately had to rework our specifics so that we can proceed with the rest of our experiments.
We focused on discussing our bio brick design because for all iGEMer’s this is an extremely important aspect of our projects. But do not forget that this is"

Coupling
The communication range of quorum sensing, however, is limited by the diffusion rate of AHL, could only reach cells over tens of micrometers. So, we introduced the coding gene for NADH dehydrogenase II (ndh) and put it under the control of the same luxIpromoter, which means ndh also has a periodical expression in accordance with the oscillator. NDH-2 is a membrane-bound respiratory enzyme that generates low level H2O2 and superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 will permeate to neighboring colonies. Periodic production of H2O2 changes the redox state of a cell immediately and interacts with the synthetic circuit through the native aerobic response control systems, including ArcAB, which has a binding site in the lux promoter region. Before the oxidizing condition is triggered, ArcAB is partially expressed, so lux is partially repressed. When the concentration of H2O2 is increasing, ArcAB is gradually inactivated, and the repression of lux is relieved. With the periodically produced vapor phase H2O2 that can diffuse quickly among colonies, the oscillation is not only strengthened but also expanded to millimeter scales(Fig. 2-2).
Fig. 2-2  H2O2 functions as an activator to the quorum sensing promoter
When compared with the strong but short ranged coupling by QS, H2O2 might be weaker but long ranged because its disperse characteristic. These two levels of communication between cells formed the basic oscillatory system inside our host.
Reporter
A good reporter in an oscillatory circuit should be steadily expressed and can be easily detected by regular equipment in laboratory, so broadly used reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) came into our mind.
First, we built regular gfp gene into our circuit and it worked well. Its fluorescence can be observed by fluorescence microscopy under 1s of exposure time on the microfluidic array 1(Fig. 2-3).
Fig. 2-3 GFP under fluorescence microscopy on a microfluidic array
However, there is a newly found GFP variant Superfolder GFP, which has shown outstanding performance in many ways. It has two advantages in observing: 1) Fold 3.5 to 4 times faster than regular GFP; 2) Yield up to four"

Characterization
Two fungal promoters have been characterized by both a qualitative and a quantitative analysis. The plan was to characterize the fungal promoters; DMKP-P6 also known as PAN1122, a medium strength constitutive promoter and PalcA an inducible promoter. A simple way of analyzing promoters is by measuring the expression of a reporter gene. This was done by performing the widely used β-galactosidase assay (1) with the modifications described here .
Genetics and USER cloning
Aspergillus nidulans can integrate DNA fragments into its genome by exploitation of the natural mechanisms for double-strand break (DSB) repair. In fungi, the most widely occurring mechanisms for DSB repair are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Integration by NHEJ will occur randomly, which means that DNA fragments will be integrated at a random site in the genome, and with alternating copy numbers. HR uses widespread homology search to repair breaks and does this without losing any of the sequence around the break (3, 4). For the characterization of the promoters it was important only to have one copy integrated in the genome. The host strain used for transformation nkuAΔ, was therefore a NHEJ deficient strain, and the integration should occur by HR (2).
p68 is a plasmid that contains a lacZ gene, a terminator, and a USER cassette. For HR to occur, the gene-targeting substrate has to contain two large sequences of around 1500 bp. Therefore, p68 also contains up- and down stream regions for targeting to the specific site called Insertion Site 1 (IS1) situated 202 bp downstream of AN6638 gene and 245 bp upstream of AN663"

1. Modelling
NUSgem assisted iGEM Stockholm with the modelling of two of their genetic circuits: Cumate and Tryptophan. Using their timing diagram and genetic circuit, we generated the functional models of these two genetic circuits. In addition to generating the functional models, we also performed sensitivity analysis and provided feedback and possible improvements that could be made to their designs.

General Support
Professor Dr. Uwe Sonnewald turned out to be the first person to support our iGEM vision. Giving us our lab spaces and getting the Department of Biology behind our project was an enormous help to us. Regularly, he checks up on us to ask if everything is going all right. In addition, he helped us with lab materials and financially.
Lab support
Marlene Pröschel, a PhD student in the Division of Biochemistry, introduced us to the different labs and surroundings. She was our go to person when it came to any questions, be it either theoretical or practical. Moreover, she lent us a hand in the lab on some occasions (e.g. rpd3 overlap PCR).
Thanks to the Division of Molecular Plant Physiology (MPP) for letting us use their confocal laser scanning microscope to analyse our YFP expressing yeast.
Project advisor support
Professor Dr. Christian Koch was our specialist when it came to yeast knowledge. While always staying interested as well as enthusiastic, he also provided us with more lab space and materials. Prof. Koch's never ending expertise gave us great insight to homologous recombination, promotors, plasmids and literature.
Wiki page layout support
This Wiki Page layout was in large parts copied from the 2014 Team from SDU Denmark , which itself is also based on the 2013 Team from denmark under the CC license . There have been several styling adjustments to make it optically distinguishable from their wiki, but the core concept remains the same. Initially, we planned to make our own layout, but since no one in our team has ever done any webpage developing, we had to adapt and only make small changes to an already existing layout.

Tight Regulation
Inducible kill systems are not new to iGEM. Looking through the registry, there are several constructs such as the inducible BamHI system contributed by Berkley in 2007 ( BBa_I716462 ) and tested by Lethbridge in 2011 .  This uses a BamHI gene downsteam of an arabinose-inducible promoter. Another example is an IPTG inducible Colicin construct ( BBa_K117009 ) submitted by NTU-Singapore in 2008.  One major problem with these systems however is a lack of tight control.  As was demonstrated by the Lethbridge 2011 team, this part has leaky expression when inducer compound is not present.  The frequently used lacI promoter has similar problems when not used in conjunction with strong plasmid-mediated expression of"

Testing Water Samples From Around the World
As our project aims to develop a product to remove phosphate out of wastewater, we chose to test water samples from around the world for phosphate concentration. We would like to thank the iGEM teams- TU Eindhoven, Technion Israel and Leuven for their water samples! We also received water samples from Derby, Egypt, Yorkshire and Manchester.
Methods
200uL of all drinking water samples were pipetted directly in to the 96 well plate. All river water and bog water samples were filter sterilised to remove solid particles before 200uL of each sample was plated. A set of phosphate standards were prepared and 30uL of dye was then added before the plate was left to equilibrate for 30 minutes in the dark.  Following equilibration, the optical density of each well was read at 650nm using a plate reader. The concentration of phosphate in each sample well could then be determined using the equation of the standard curve.
Figure 1: Standard curve generated using standards made following the ABCAM (ab65622) protocol.

At the beginning of the summer, TU Eindhoven reached out and asked iGEM teams around the world about which DNA assembly methods they were using. They have put together a cloning guide using information sent from 13 teams, one of which was us! We wrote them a detailed description of our gibson assembly techniques. Check out their guide below and see what they worked on here .

Presentation to NEWBio Teachers - Penn State Center for Science and the Schools
Since past iGEM teams have been very active in outreach and education, we began this summer with the goal of doing the same. We found a perfect opportunity with NEWBio, also known as the Northeast Woody/Warm-season Biomass Consortium. NEWBio is ""a regional network of universities, businesses, and governmental organizations dedicated to building robust, scalable, and sustainable value chains for biomass energy in the Northeast (NE). Driven by the broad societal benefits that sustainable bioenergy value chains could provide, NEWBio aims to overcome existing barriers and dramatically increase the sustainable, cost-effective supply of lignocellulosic biomass while reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing ecosystem services, and building vibrant communities.""
The purpose of NEWBio is to help train secondary school educators in the principles of bioenergy. In this way, NEWBio seeks to ""train the trainers"" that will have an impact on the future career's of the nation's youth. The program is a week long workshop where teachers are exposed to the many areas of biology in a variety of ways.  The week is spent listening to talks led by professors and groups, exploring the campus, and ultimately making new lesson plans for the school year.
We presented to a group of 10 teachers on our research and the need for biorenewable fuels. Our message to them was how the tools of synthetic biology can be used to combat energy and environmental crises and demonstrate how they can introduce simple synthetic biology techniques to their classes. Through this outreach we facilitated the flow of information from the bench to the classroom. The iGEM team is a great asset to this program, as we can provide the teachers with information in a way that students would enjoy and understand.  This is also a great experience in learning how to better discuss our iGEM projects and present to groups of people who may know little about the subject.
Here we were able to show these teachers ways that they can explain synthetic biology to their students.  These are easily reproducible activities and are fun, too!

So in the stable reaction system the concentration of Cl^- will ascend with the beginning of the reaction. The released Cl^- can reaction with Hg^(2+) from Hg(SCN)_2 and release the SCN^-. When adding to the Fe^(3+), they will react together and produce Fe(SCN)_3, a kind of red complex compound， at the 460nm it has absorption peak.

Life at Low Reynolds Number
The Reynolds number in fluid mechanics is a dimensionless number that characterizes       different flow regimes. It is most commonly used to determine whether laminar       or turbulent flow will take place in a hydrodynamic system (Figure 2).
Figure 2
Flow regimes for different Reynolds numbers. Click to enlarge.
In general however, it quantifies the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces       and is defined as (B2.1).
$$      Re=\frac{\text{inertial forces}}{\text{viscous forces}}      =\frac{\rho v^2 L^2}{\eta v L}      =\frac{\rho v L}{\eta} \;\;\; \text{(B2.1)}      $$
For example, if the Reynolds number is high, the inertia of fluids in motion dominate and     turbulent flow will occur. When it is low however, the viscous forces dampen     the kinetic energy of fluid particles and stabilize the flow profile, ultimately     achieving a regular, laminar flow.
The reason we mention the Reynolds number however is not to study the flow of fluids, but     to characterize the behavior of swimming objects inside of a stationary fluid.     When applied to objects in a fluid, the Reynolds number tells us whether their inertia     can be neglected or not. For bacteria, the characteristic length $L$ is on the order     of micrometers, which is quite small. Therefore the Reynolds number is always      very small and hence viscous forces dominate the motion of bacteria. This is what allows     us to eliminate the inertial term in Newton's second law and greatly simplify the     equation of motion.
To justify this simplification we will go through a numerical example.     Take a bacterium of size $L = 2 a = 1 \cdot \mu m$, swimming through water with a speed of     $v=20 \cdot \mu m/s$. Water has a density of $\rho = 1 \; 000 \cdot kg/m^3$     and a viscosity of $\eta = 0.001 \cdot Pa/s$.
Figure 3
Sketch of swimming bacterium. Click to enlarge.
Putting these values in (B2.1) yields     a Reynolds number of $Re = 2 \cdot 10^{-5} << 1$. Clearly we are in an extremely     low Reynolds number regime. To show what this really means, suppose the bacterium     stops propelling itself. How long will it continue to move relying only on its inertia?    "

Hardware
Best Hardware Special Prize
iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.
To compete for the Best Hardware prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

pCDNA-Gal4-EcR
Gal4-C. elegans LBD fusions
Five nuclear hormone receptor LBDs of C. elegans (NHR8, NHR23, NHR31, NHR80, DAF12) have been inserted after Gal4 in pSB1C3, resulting inserts with the lenght between 944 bp and 977 bp. All of the Gal4-C.elegans LBD constructs (e.g. Gal4-NHR8) except Gal4-NHR80 composite part have been fused into pCDNA3.1 expression vector to test them as a lipid sensor.

Estrogen Receptor from basic parts
Estrogen receptor DBD (318 bp) and LBD (828 bp) have been inserted together into pSB1C3. The two main domains of ER are linked together by the hinge region of Vitamin D Receptor (357 bp) resulting a 1503 bp long insert in the backbone.

Creating expression vector from pSB1A3
Three basic parts from pSB1C3 have been ligated into pSB1A3 consecutively by using chloramphenicol and ampicillin assembly in order to create an expression vector from the ampicillin resistance carrying backbone.
pSB1A3-TRE-Gal4-PXR
pSB1A3-TRE-Gal4-EcR
The first step was to insert 321 bp long TRE-CMV (Tetracyclin Response Element- Minimal Cytomegalovirus promoter) into pSB1A3 which has the length of 2157 bp. Then Gal4-PXR LBD (1170 bp) and Gal4-Ecr LBD (1077 bp) fusions were inserted after the TRE- CMV, before PolyA tail (191 bp) was ligated in the end.

Centrifuge
1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
Electric pipetman (propipet)
Procedure
According to the QIAprep™ Spin Miniprep Kit's manual
Pellet 5 mL of overnight bacterial culture by centrifugation in a 5804R at 6000 x g for 3 minutes at room temperature.
Re-suspend the pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μL Buffer P1 and transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.
Add 250 μ L Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 minutes.
Add 350 μ L Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm in a Sigma 1-14 micro-centrifuge.
Apply 800 μ L supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep2.0 spin column by pipetting. Centrifuge in the microfuge for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep2.0 spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through. Transfer the QIAprep2.0 spin column to the collection tube.
Centrifuge for 1 minute to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAprep2.0 column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μL Buffer EB. Let stand for 1 minute, and centrifuge in the microfuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm.
