Kinetic law of Modeling
Mathematic model helps us to predict the reaction result before experiment.                                          First of all, we have to define which kinetic law can be applied into which metabolic pathway and chemical equation.                                          There are three kinds of kinetic we chose in this model, mass action , Henri-Michaelis-Menten ,                                          and Ping-Pong-Bi-Bi .
Mass action
In chemistry, the law of mass action is the proposition that the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional                                              to the product of the activities or concentrations of the reactants.                                              Mass action kinetics describes this behavior as an equation where the velocity or rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional                                              to the concentration of the reactants.
$${aA + bB \xrightarrow{Kf} cC + dD}$$
$${aA + bB \xrightarrow{Kr} cC + dD}$$
$${Kf = {[C]^c[D]^d \over [A]^a[B]^b}}$$
$${Kr = {[A]^a[B]^b \over [C]^c[D]^d}}$$
Where Kf is forward rate of equilibrium,  Kr is reverse rate of equilibrium
Henri-Michaelis-Menten
In 1913, Michaelis and Menten studied the invertase system and found some behavioral patterns of enzyme-matrix reaction.                                              When the enzyme is catalyzed, the matrix will be combined with the enzyme to generate the product.                                              However, the binding of the enzyme to the matrix is reversible.                                              The concentration of ES will be constant when the reaction is steady state.                                              They also proposed the mathematical description of the behavior of the enzyme.                                              They can express the relationship between the reaction rate and the enzyme mathematically.                                              Hence, the reaction rate is in a hyperbolic relationship with the concentration of substrate at a fixed amount of enzyme.                                              That is the Michaelis-Menten kinetic law.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#Selection#InteractionControl_-_-_TEXT.html," seconds after measuring the base line. The SH2-cI fusion protein was added at the start without washing (green), after one (purple) and two (yellow) washing steps with NaCl and after a washin step with a high concentrated HCl solution (upper blue). Also BSA was measured with 1 μg/ml (lower blue) and 10 μ/ml (red) protein.
The reason 4 graphs with different interference strength are visible after SH2 addition can be attributed to the washing procedure after every measurement. The used washing solutions like sodium chloride are weak washing procedures to not damage the immobilized protein.   This results in a not complete closed dissociation. Therefore, a bit targets are left binding on our protein. If the new base line is measured, the base interference is much higher based on the not dissolved targets. After the next addition of our SH2 target the difference between the base interference and new    interference is smaller then on previous tests. Therefore, with every run the results a bit weaker than before.   To test the binding of HA4 to other proteins to exclude a general binding of HA4, the BLItz experiment would be repeated with BSA as target. Both graphs red and blue reveal no differences in the interference line after addition of the BSA protein. This demonstrate, that the interaction of SH2 and HA4 is a very specific    interaction.
These results leads to the same outcome than the affinity chromatography experiment, our positive controls SH2 and HA4 have a high affinity to each other and a strongly interaction.

1.  Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
The establishment of our system was inspired by the urgent need for smart evaluation of peptides for large data and the crisis of fungal diseases. After the system established, we have introduced our system to some companies and                             research institutes who have tried out our system and have given helpful feedback. After their trials we advanced our system to meet the needs of the public. (HP Gold_Integrated)

Prof. Zhuo Wang is an expert in computational system biology. Her store of knowledge in the field of system biology helped us a lot in the project. At the first time of our interview, she expressed her praise towards our idea of building a network alignment tool. Meanwhile, she listed a few methods already existed for the network alignment for us to study and improve.
Later, Prof.Wang reminded us that we should not only focus on the alignment within E.coli, but also need to expand it to other bacteria. This is because in reality, there are far more engineering strains that could benefit from our software. Moreover, a larger number of bacteria involved makes our database richer and larger.
Prof. Daniel Figeys
Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology
University of Ottawa
Daniel Figeys is a Professor and the Chair of the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology (BMI) and cross-appointed in the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences at the University of Ottawa.  He is also a Canada Research Chair in Proteomics and Systems Biology.  His expertise is in the development of proteomics and systems biology and more recently in metaproteomics for microbial community analysis.
In Prof. Daniel Figeys’s Lab, they have developed a advanced bioinformatics software “iMetaLab”. Their project is originally designed for human/mouse gut metaproteomics protein identification and quantification, rooted from the MetaProIQ workflow. Upon the rising request, they wrap up the workflow into a desktop standalone version, with taxon analysis module built in. In the meantime, they have been working on some meta-function annotation and enrichment analysis, as well as some data visualization modules. Then they realize that it would be good to wrap up all related functions and share them to the community. They aim to make iMetaLab a free and one-stop toolset for gut metaproteomics, with increasing amount of tools under development. This interview inspired us how to make our software “Metlab: a metabolic network alignment tool” more user-friendly and complete. The process of their software development enlightened us to make “Metlab” a functional toolset with many tools related metabolic network.

Plastic binding domain
BBa_K608404 IPTG-inducible Promoter with plastic binding domain-tagged GFP
Experimental setup
According to Adey et al. the plastic binding domain (pbd) binds to the polystyrene surface of micro titer plates (96 well plates). To investigate the binding properties of the plastic binding tag we started several spectroscopic assays using a plate reader (FLUOstar Omega) and polystyrene plates (Greiner bio one) To detect the fluorescence of the GFP tagged to the plastic binding domain we used black plates and a well scanning program measuring 10x10 spots in each well of the micro titer plate. We performed several washing steps to find out how much of the proteins can be found in the eluate and how much remains bound on the plate’s surface. To compare the pbd-tagged GFP to a normal GFP without special plastic binding ability we also measured GFP obtained via expression with our diverse PR (Promoter-Ribosome-binding-site constructs). To affirm the results obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy used the Bradford assay and screened for different protein"

Next Version of BioMORTAR
While BioMORTAR has succeeded in its goal to help automate the design process in bacterial and metabolic engineering, it still can be improved on many fronts.
First and foremost, the next version will include a user registry, coded in Django, that will allow users to create a profile and save their designed plasmids on the server while displaying the plasmids their lab currently stores. This will allow the users of BioMORTAR to be able to more easily share resources they have, and access the resources they need to create their desired plasmid. It will also allow BioMORTAR to match parts of stored plasmids to plasmids generated by the plasmid designer, then reference them to the user so that the user can have easy access to the resources to implement the designed plasmid in vivo.
The next step of development of BioMORTAR 2.0 will be a security feature that will deter users from using this tool for malicious purposes. The registry in place will log activity from each user and store the data on the server, allowing for easy access to records in case of need from law enforcement.
One of the most important new functions in the next version will be the ability for the COBRA cell modeling tool to directly interact with the IMPtools module in order to automatically optimize the metabolic pathway for cell growth. With the implementation of the new features in the next version, BioMORTAR will be able to go above and beyond its initial goal in the automation of cell design.

Proof of concept
Demonstrate your work
We explained our project and synthetic biology to the local people.Furthermore, in order to make our project and synthetic biology known nationwide, we used website, television programs, newspapers and radio.As a result, we received some useful feedbacks from the general public.Two of the feedbacks raised very important issued. First issue ""Fragrance on food""When food is kept an ‘Flavorator’, the fragrance might adhere to the food that you want to preserve.Second issue ""Recombinant, may go out of the laboratory. ⇒Recombinant releases""Each solution of these problems to be integrated with the project.
About the first issue
We decided to use farnesol from the scent ingredient, with antibacterial properties, because it is almost odorless.This was the target, and solve the first Issue.
About the second issue
A method in which antimicrobial volatile gaseous substances synthesized using only the endogenous gene of E. coli.Specifically, we used the CRISPR-Cas9.Gene of extra in pathway to synthesis of farnesol, unnecessary intermediate metabolite (non-essential) synthase gene, knocked out.Gene involved in farnesol synthesized by those of endogenous E. coli knock in.Two issues are solved by these solutions.Integrated was completed."

As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.
For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.
In the future
As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and  provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.
Improvements
It is super easy to accomplish  your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.
We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.
It is great significant  to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.
The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing  technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.
The society  is still growing. That is why chatting and communication  could be considered as an important facility in our society.
New features
Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or  plugin.
In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where biologists  can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area.
 
If there is a matching hardware port, it could complete the experiment automatically according to the given steps and protocols. We could match the steps or protocols to the manipulator's operating instructions accurately. For this, we hope BioHub can help achieve experiment automation."

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#Experiments#Cyanobacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," is PA1lac0-1 . Derived from the PA1 promoter of bacteriophage T7 (Lutz et al., 1997), PA1lac0-1 is a LacI-dependent promoter and Isopropyl β-D-1- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter that has been characterized with ethylene biosynthesis as a reporter and has been shown to bring about an 8-fold induction in both E. coli and Synechocystis (Guerrero et al., 2012). PA1lac0-1 has been designed to include the A and B MoClo adaptor sites.
Pcpc560
Recently, the 560bp region found upstream of the cpcB gene encoding the beta subunit of c-phycocyanin in Synechocystis has been reported to act as a promoter that is able of producing heterologous proteins at a level up to 15% of total soluble protein in Synechocystis, which is comparable to levels achieved in E. coli (Zhou et al., 2014). In light of this, this genomic region has been termed as the Pcpc560 “super-strong” promoter. As this promoter already includes a native RBS. it has been designed to include the A and C fusion sites, which enables cloning directly in front of a reporter gene.
J23100_AB
Part J23100_AB is a constitutive promoter from the Anderson Laboratory collection. This promoter is regarded as the strongest promoter from that library. It was selected to serve as a positive promoter control in case the other two promoters were unable to express in E. coli.
Ribosome Binding Sites
In order to start translation, aside from the promoter and the coding sequence, a ribosome binding site (RBS) is required. Even though it is often referred as just a part of the mRNA sequence that binds to the ribosome, the surrounding sequence can also affect the translation initiation rate (Smit & Duin 2013). In the case of the Sca6-2 and L03 promoters, their respective RBS were included in their sequences, in an effort to avoid any negative results that could appear after disrupting the delicate area between the 3’ end of a promoter and the start codon of the coding sequence. Because these parts already included an RBS, the 3’ adapter region was designed to end the standard RBS overhang. The putative RBS are labeled in the promoter sequences in the supplementary data. For constructs related to the J23100 promoter"

For the construction of our BioBricks we did a lot of literature research to identify optimal templates for the selection system. Finally we decided to build a two-hybrid    transcriptional activation system based on the cooperation of the repressor protein cI from one of two different phages with the omega subunit of the DNA-mediated     RNA polymerase of Escherichia coli. These two proteins were encoded on seperate plasmid backbones with different antibiotic resistances. For the first construction of     our system the backbones pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 were used. Our target was the     construction of fusion proteins, which contained on the one hand the cI protein fused with our target protein encoded on the pSB1K3 plasmid ( BBa_K2082225 , part in pSB1C3) and on the other hand the RpoZ protein fused    with our Evobody encoded on the pSB1C3 plasmid ( BBa_K2082221 ). The concept of the construction is illustrated in the figure (X). As positive control the domain SH2 of the tyrosine kinase Abl1    as target and the monobody HA4 as binding"

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html,"sgRNA complex to cleave this sequence. As such, plasmids losing the PAM site would escape cleavage and be propagated. Hence, there would be significant selective pressure for the loss of the PAM site. This is an issue that will need to be considered in future iterations of the project.
Additionally, comparison between the non-induced and the induced groups seems to suggest that there might be some background expression of Cas9/sgRNA despite being under the regulation of a tetracycline based promoter. Assuming that Cas9/sgRNA expression is being properly inhibited, we should see a stark difference between the number of mutants within the PAM site of the induced and uninduced samples. Of course, the sample size difference between the mutant GFP P2 induced versus uninduced groups is large (15 versus 2). Therefore, the comparable PAM site mutation rates observed in the induced and uninduced samples is not significant enough to conclude that there is leaky expression of Cas9/sgRNA.
One final conclusion that can be drawn from the data gathered is that the density of mutants within the region of interest achieved by this system is rather low. In this case, it is actually zero. A major concern in the development of this project was that the activity of Cas9 was sometimes non-specific. If significant sequence similarity is present, Cas9 is capable of cleaving off target sites. The worry here was that this would lead to point mutants in the region of interest being cleaved even though they were, in fact, mutants. To counteract this issue, we tried to obtain a high fidelity version of Cas9 which had been mutated to reduce off target cleavage. We attempted to obtain this gene from two sources, but ended up empty handed in the end. We were forced to settle for using a normal fidelity Cas9 gene provided to us by a professor on campus. This could potentially be the reason why we see a lack of mutations in the region of interest. Of course, the lack of mutants could also be due to the fact that not enough colonies were screened. Ideally, we would've preferred to screen many times more colonies than we actually did, but due to time constraints and limited resources, this was not an option.
Overall, the data collected for the Cas9/sgRNA mutant screening system seems to indicate that it is somewhat effective. The reduced culture density of non-mutant/wild type GFP with induction seems to suggest that non-mutant plasmids are being cut to some degree. Additionally, the prevalence of PAM site destroying mutations within the mutagenized GFP samples supports the notion"

McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," as people think that there are no antibiotics have no side effects, we have issues.” This prompted us to ask if a pamphlet that could be distributed by such healthcare providers alongside the prescription of antibiotics would be helpful. After hearing that he was fond of the idea, the Human Practices team decided to design such a pamphlet that could be given to healthcare providers for their use.
Dr. Andrew MacArthur
— Cisco Research Chair in Bioinformatics
Our group was invited to attend the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research (IIDR) Rounds, where we had the chance to discuss existing computational pipelines in the surveillance of C. difficile in St. Joseph’s Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. While this discussion was focused on the epidemiological surveillance of C. difficile within the hospital wards, much of the clinical discussion was focused on existing tools for prevention of the spread of AMR. Spanning recommendations such as washing hands, isolating patients with diarrhea, diagnostic tools, and prophylactic antimicrobial use, we were fascinated with the host of clinical decisions required to manage C. difficile patients.
Recognizing the complexity of the clinical landscape helped us better recognize and understand the clinical context under which a technology like our prospective point-of-care diagnostic tool would fit within the broader architecture of clinical decision making. SImilar in many respects to the United Kingdom, Canada is pressured under its provincial single-payer, publicly funded healthcare systems to build diligent health technology assessment studies and protocol to ensure that clinical decisions are being informed by both clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. For us, this was a significant tipping point in our understanding of the broader policy context of biotechnology development- particularly in the Canadian healthcare context. While techniques such as immunoassays and rectal swabs yield strong results, it is difficult to assess at what point in the clinical algorithm they should be deployed to ensure the ideal balance of clinical utility and cost-effectiveness.
Mayor Fred Eisenberger
— Mayor, City of Hamilton
With insights from leading researchers across Canada, we reached out to Mr. Fred Eisenberger, the Mayor of Hamilton, to figure out how we could effectively convey this information to the citizens of Hamilton. Specifically, we wanted to know how we could create effective workshops for high school students, campaigns for the general Hamilton community and resources that could be given to patients receiving antibiotics in order to foster a scientifically literate community and to bring awareness to issues surrounding antimicrobial resistance. Mr. Eisenberger’s extensive work in the Hamilton community and his focus on developing the next generation of healthcare leaders made him the best choice to help us develop a platform to share our research.

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in E. coli , it doesn't present stronger fluorescence than either plasmid is expressed in E. Coli respectively. the possible reasons are as follows. Firstly, different metabolic stress of two plamids causes indistinct results. The pSB1C3 carrying sfGFP11, whose gene length is shorter, may have higher expression level than pSB1A3 carry sfGFP1-10. Secondly, there is obvious fluorescence quenching after excitation. Therefore, results of fluorescent images and fluorescent images appear that co-expression of sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11 has weaker fluorescence intensity. Thirdly, because sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11 may as well not be expressed in E. Coli at 1:1 ratio, the collision probability is lower than our expectation.
2.The spilt sfGFP experiment in Yeast(S. cerevisiae,W303)
Firstly, we transformed the two kinds of plasmids into the S. cerevisiae W303 to get three types of S. cerevisiae respectively containing sfGFP1-10, PR-sfGFP11 and both. Then we cultivated the cells at 30 ℃ for 24 hours.

We measured fluorescence intensity of two groups of S. cerevisiae cultivated separately at 30,34,38,42 ℃ without GdnHCl. The first group was cultivated for 1 hour and the other one for 2 hours.

Impressions of some speakers
Pr. Pierre Brissot, Hospital practitioner and university professor in the Rennes Pontchaillou hospital
When Gabriel Guillocheau contacted me at the beginning of the summer to take part in a seminar about hemochromatosis, I perceived well both the originality and the pertinence of the ongoing approach.
The day of the seminar indeed confirmed completely this first impression. I am pleased to underline the two points that seemed to me the most remarkable:
The originality of the scientific project aiming to chelate the intestinal iron with genetically oriented intestinal bacterias, in order to inhibit the duodenal iron absorption, and so helping to thwart the digestive hyperabsorption responsible for the development of iron overload, in particular in case of genetic hemochromatosis.
The performance, and the daring showed by the organizers, coordinated by Gabriel. In only a few weeks of summer, they set up an entire day of exchange with not only the main national scientific experts of hemochromatosis, but also with the presidents of the main hemochromatosis patients' associations. This was a particular dimension of the day, and a special attention.
Thus, I congratulate warmly the entire team – students, advisors and instructors – for this successful meeting.

ESC Workshop
For a neglected tropical disease like T. solium, there is much that goes beyond diagnosis and treatment. As there is barely any data concerning the incidence of the pork tapeworm, it is hard to know which areas are in need of our diagnostic tool. This is why education and the spread of awareness is vital to a project like ours. Only by making people aware of the menace of T. solium, the need of a quick and cheap test is realized by the local population. A step towards this goal was undertaken by us at the European Students’ Conference (ESC) in Berlin.
The ESC is one of the largest biomedical student conferences and hosts about 450 participants. This years topic “Genetic Engineering - When Chance Meets Choise“ was a perfect opportunity for diagnost-x to present the project to the interdisciplinary participants from various cultures. In form a workshop, we were able to teach the attendants about our project, as well as coach them how to form a successful international collaboration.
Tasked with the incredible chance to design a 90 minutes workshop for students from India, Romania, The Netherlands and other countries, it was important for us to go beyond presenting our own project. It had to be shown that besides the idea, the implementation matters. What was important for us to get across is how much personal resources matter, and where the limitations lie. This is why we let the participants come up with their own ideas concerning a partnership with diagnost-x. They were put into groups with members from different nationalities, to get across how difficult communication between different cultures can be. The end-goal was to have the groups mock up a partnership with diagnost-x. For this partnership they used resources and contacts available to them in the real world. The groups were made to work on topics important to a project like funding, acquisition of samples and awareness.  As alluded to earlier, the groups individually found out what a key issue awareness is. Without the general public’s knowledge about T. solium, our project cannot succeed. This is where the members of the"

Arizona_State,2016,Team:Arizona State#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," from MIT, is a device designed to output PoPs when LuxR is activated. This was used by the ASU team to test interactions between inducers from other quorum sensing systems. The Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer, and Sin systems stem from different organisms and their inducers were submitted as parts to the registry with the purpose of completing this induction test. With very few Senders currently found in the registry (only around 7), the addition of 5 Senders adds significant depth to the Sender pool.
Our Senders
Each Sender may also be referred to as an AHL synthase, as it produces a specific AHL. The 3D structures of the AHLs produced by the systems we examined are found in the Project Description . Our Senders from the Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer and Sin systems were submitted to the registry, while the Esa, Las, Lux, Rhl, and Rpa systems already existed in the registry. The induction test was done on a 96-well plate, which was run in a plate reader to read GFP expression levels. Aside from the controls, two different AHL concentrations were used. The AHL source that was used was filtered out via liquid-liquid extraction and then re-seeded with new cells. This allowed an 8-hour read to produce a definitive trend in the growth curve, providing information about the relationship of these Senders with F2620. Additional characterization was done via mass spectrometry, which was done on the Aub system. The Aub system was chosen as the system of interest, because of the unknown bacteria of origin and its alkane acyl tail, which are not nearly as well-characterized as the 3-oxo acyl tails from the Lux and Las systems. Also, safety information regarding potential dangers and proper disposal of AHLs are included on each Parts page.
Modular Cassette
Our 1 composite part was a modular vector designed for the incorporation of Sender sequences. This part will provide a standard cassette in which AHL synthase genes can be inserted. This part is designed to incorporate a Sender between two ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and is considered ""modular,"" because the RFC10 prefix is added between the RBSs to allow insertion of any Sender. mCherry is also added as a visual indicator of transcription.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," developed a mathematical model to describe and simulate this process.
Model Formulation
Our main focus is to examine whether the designed system can effectively lower the concentration of heavy metal ions in the soil. There are 3 main processes at play here: the phytoextraction process, the organic acid production process, and the binding of heavy metal ions with proteins produced by the engineered PSB. To analyze this system, we built the following system of ordinary differential equations.
\[                 \left\{                 \begin{aligned}                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_m}{\mathrm{d}t}&=-r_ac_{m,eq}\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_p}{\mathrm{d}t}&=-r_dc_{p,eq}+a_1\frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_h}{\mathrm{d}t}&=mr_h\\                 \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}&=m(1-\frac{m}{K(c_{h,eq})})                 \end{aligned}                 \qquad\qquad                 \begin{aligned}                 c_m(0)&=c_{m0}\\                 c_p(0)&=c_{p0}\\                 c_h(0)&=c_{h0}\\                 m(0)&=m_0                 \end{aligned}                 \right.                 \]
The above equations are for the case where proteins are displayed on the surface of PSB. For the case where the proteins are secreted into the environment, we only need to change the second equation to
\[                 \frac{\mathrm{d}c_p}{\mathrm{d}t}=-r_dc_{p,eq}+a_1'm                 \]
For clarity, a table of variables and a table of parameters are provided at the end of this section for your reference.
We shall now explain in detail the formulation of these equations. First, notice that for the concentrations $c_m$ (heavy metal ions), $c_p$ (protein) and $c_h$ (hydrogen ions), there are the corresponding $c_{m,eq}$, $c_{p,eq}$ and $c_{h,eq}$ in the right side of the equation. The former ones are the imaginary “initial” concentrations, while the latter ones are the concentrations at the equilibrium state. To further expound this idea, we present the three major chemical reactions in the rhiz"

Beyond the scope of our project:
Being able to quantify detection
Make Cas13a able to detect mutated genes
User Friendliness:
Things we can do:
Contact farmer to check if we meet the friendliness requirements concerning farmers
Contact industrial designer to think along with the final design
Make a decision tree so the farmer knows exactly what to do after obtaining the test results
Beyond the scope of the project:
Develop an easier RNA extraction (specialist should look into this): Adjusting the detection protein to detect the DNA directly instead of the RNA. This would take a step of reverse transcription out of the protocol and make the assay more direct instead of indirect.
Develop a service “a traveling lab in a bus” that does this kind of ABR tests (Front end runner)
TDPs as sustainable storage solution:
Beyond the scope of the project:
Talk to TDP experts about the possibilities
Talk to contextual experts to give insights on this sustainable solution
Make a risk analysis concerning worldwide TDP storage
Costs savings:
Beyond the scope of the project:
Look into cheaper materials
What things need to be considered when bringing our prototype to the market:
Next things to do: Brainstorm with TNO to gain insights and feedback
Conclusion
Concluding, we reflected our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenge considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which things were beyond the scope of the project and we identified things we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible. Thinking from these four different perspectives was really effective. We were able to reflect the project on different levels, even though the team composition was balanced more towards the experts and system integrators.
Summary
The goal of the workshop had two sides. For iGEM, this workshop will be a design evaluation/reflection exercise. For the CEE it is important to receive feedback on the Engineering Roles; possibly determining more engineering roles and match specific skills with the roles.
To conclude, we reflected on our project with the different roles to make sure we did not miss anything. The workshop made us aware of the future challenges considering our project. Due to the reflection we gained insights in which aspects were beyond the scope of the project and we identified aspects that we could still integrate in our project to make our project more relevant and responsible.

Responsibility after disasters
If this iGEM team finds an industrial partner to bring this bacteria on the market and after a while a problem arises. Who is responsible for the damage caused? The team, the company...?
Normally the company who brings the product on the market will be held responsible. There is a European regulation concerning environmental liability.
A Final Word
After these questions all those present at the debate were invited to the reception to further discuss the topic and the symposium in smaller groups with some drinks (beer sponsored by AB-Inbev Belgium) and a bite.
We would like to thank our panel members for enabling us to hold this interesting debate and our moderator Ben Vanheukelom for guiding the conversation. We would also like to thank all the interested people present at the debate and also the iGEM team of UGent for attending the debate.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM projects I was intrigued by the idea of Calgary 2007. The used lysis of agar to produce a high resolution picture on agar plates by bacteria. If we could have bacteria produce a stain/pigment/dye or solid compound (like crosslinking/polimerising it's surrounding) in a 3D agar block we could print a 3 dimensional picture or even a solid item. We would need to excite these bacteria then with a number of different stimuli, like 3 lasers to mark the position of production.
Annother extension of this concept could be to make bacteria produce a pigment and a crosslinking to cotton fiber for high resolution fabric printing. One would spray/spread the bacteria on a T-shirt, exite them using a laser light or metabolite, they produce a pigment and an enzyme (or enzyme system) to crosslink the pigment to the cotton. Just washing once would remove the bacteria (or inactivate them by initiation of a self destruct/DNA-ase after they are done). This may reduce the environmental load of staining fabrics, as we would not use harsh chemicals to raise pH need high temperatures for the crosslinking.
Sticky bacteria
Bastiaan I found this news item on the internet about a sticky bacteria [1] . It is about the Caulobacter crescentus and it is said to be ""nature's strongest-known glue to stay in place on wet surfaces"". Any interesting applications using stickiness?

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Alverno_CA,2016,Team:Alverno CA_-_-_TEXT.html," greatly improve the predictability (and, therefore,         designability) of large gene circuits for metabolic engineering
What are the goals of the project?
We will first build several plasmids (circular         pieces of DNA) that demonstrate cross-talk between genes. These         plasmids will consist of genes for two different fluorescent proteins         (green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein) next to each         other, in different orientations. We expect to see differences in the         relative expression of the two genes depending on how they are arranged         and oriented, and we will quantify this effect. Next, we will try         several strategies for removing these differences, including adding         extra base pairs of spacing between the two genes and adding DNA         ""clamps"" made from DNA-binding repressor proteins between the two         genes. We will again quantify the effects of cross-talk between genes,         which will hopefully be ameliorated by our additions.
Social Media
We created a variety of social media accounts         ( Twitter YouTube Facebook and Instagram ) as a means to reach out to         other teams, and to keep interested people informed about our         progress.

Each specific Biobrick type has been assigned a number as     a unique image ID from 1 to 19. Gathering the information on subparts     was not a direct forward process. ImageID assembly orders for each construct     has been used to extract the type information for each subpart with     that construct. This innovative approach helped us to reveal 400 possible     brick combinations present within the 3x384 well plates distributed     by iGEM in Spring 2010.

Future Plan
The application we have developed can be used by all iGEM members.     As the iGEMs database expands and the recognition of the field of Synthetic     Biology increases, data resources from other biological databases such     as NCBI might be needed to be integrated to the application. In such     a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources     and new functions should be added easily.
Before planning ahead, feedback from other teams and iGEM headquarters     about the BioGuide 1.0 will be collected. That will help us to fill     in the missing features of the application and check the theories which     are basis of our algorithms.
As our application is not geared towards any commercial use and will     stay as an academic application, keeping track of the weekly developmental     process on the wiki notebook environment was satisfactory. If the need     for a commercial application emerges, we should be utilizing professional     software development approaches to determine the exact requirements     and to facilitate the use of a common language between interdiciplinary     members in the team.
For constructing BioGuide 2.0 we have some plans.
Short Term plan:
Next year we are planning to generate BioGuide 2.0 by using all parts     data but inorder to do this we will update our part database but easyway     is standardization and reorganizing all parts in partsregistrty.org     according to our suggestion because re-organizing and normalization     are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation"

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
Our project provides a brand-new solution for cell therapy of cancer – to deal with free extracellular ligands instead of cell surface antigens, which are obviously difficult to reach because of the barrier of tumour microenvironment.
For clinical application, the STEP system can be used to equip cells for cancer therapy. Stable STEP cell line can be produced with T cells extracted from patients. Then it can be reinfused into the blood to monitor level of target ligand and to produce specific drug in real time (Figure 1). In this way we can release patients from the pain of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, while inhibit tumour development in a more efficient way.
Figure 1.
One of the biggest advantage STEP has over other treatments is its modifiable upstream and downstream. For ligand recognition, we’ve already developed STEP for VEGF and for D-Dimer, the former for broad-spectrum scanning for tumour and the latter more specific for NSCLC. Both systems will be ready to use after overall test and optimisation in T cells. Our users can also select one or more tumour marker for a particular cancer type, clone the scFv or other kinds of binding domains to the extracellular domain and test the output. The binding affinity can always be increased, or in some cases decreased, with the help of our user-friendly assistant software and Rosetta. If there’s no sequence of binding domain available, we can also help you design a high-affinity scFv in silico with these softwares (Figure 2). As a result, we can literally achieve recognisation of any customer appointed ligands with our STEP system.
Figure 2.
Another superiority of STEP is the tuneable downstream and the changeable reporter. The curve of downstream gene expression can be easily modified either by simply changing a transcription factor, or by altering the binding"

Minipreped O/N cultures from ligation 04.08. Wanted to test them on PCR to be sure that it is nothing wrong with the way we are doing PCR to test colonies.  Tested the concentration on nanodrop – all samples had a concentration between 50-80ng/ul and good 260/280 values. However all the samples had low 230/260 values that indicates that there are co-purified contaminants in the sample.
Vilde
Digested the minipreps and run gel on them. Run gel on the samples minipreped. The results showed that only Alpha-NS-Ehaj1 gave us the expected size of fragments in the gel. However for the smallest parts (RBS, T1 etc) we will not expect to see the bond from the part after digestion only the linearized plasmid. We can thus not say if these parts are correct or just re-ligated plasmids.
Vilde
Tested the one positive colony on PCR to be completely sure it is correct. Used gene specific primers (for Ehaj and LacZAlpha) combined with the iGEM VR and VF2 primers to be sure the fusion protein is in the plasmid.

Wild type and ∆crcB were grown directly next to each other at varying levels of fluoride. As described in literature, ∆crcB should not grow when exposed to fluoride levels over 500µM. Unexpectedly, ∆crcB did grow on high levels of fluoride when placed on the same plates as wild type E. coli. Without wild type E. coli, no growth of ∆crcB was seen on 1mM and 2mM fluoride.
In order to figure out the cause of the unexpected growth, we reached out to Dr. Randy Stockbridge at University of Michigan for possible explanations. Dr. Stockbridge informed us of Fluoride’s dependability of pH. A low pH environment is necessary for Fluoride to enter cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the wild type altered the pH of the agar to a more basic level, facilitating the growth of ∆crcB.
To confirm our hypothesis, we prepared similar set of plates, but with phenol red, a pH indicator, for visual confirmation.
Phenol red appears red at basic pH and turns yellow at acidic pH. In the absence of a buffer, wild type has a visibly basic pH. Therefore, once the entire plate became basic, ∆crcB showed fair amount of growth. On previous days, ∆crcB grew only at red areas (low pH).
To further confirm our results, we prepared the same plates with a MES buffer, which kept the agar at a 6.5 pH, which is slightly acidic.
Upon the addition of the buffer, the alteration of pH was significantly delayed, so F was able to enter the membrane of ∆crcB, allowing the strain to grow.
CHOP (Chloramphenicol Operon) and ∆crcB (E. coli without Fluoride Channel) were added to 50µ chloramphenicol plates and observed over the course of 4 days.
The plates had increasing concentrations of F with CHOP and ∆crcB to determine the level of fluoride that leads to the greatest growth of CHOP.
∆crcB was part of the control and did not grow because it does not have the fluoride channel to pump out the F.
As observed, there is most growth of CHOP on 100μM of F, suggesting maximum growth of CHOP at 100μM of F.

Northwestern,2010,Team:Northwestern#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," 3A Assembly. These combinations express different levels of lacI, thus exhibiting variable inductivity. These 6 constructs are then ligated with a reporter protein - green fluorescent protein - and characterized via an automated fluorescent microplate reader; fluorescence is used to determine the construct inductivity and expression level.
IPTG Activation
The data is used to fit our own theoretical kinetics model that accounts for IPTG diffusion through biofilm, external IPTG concentration, internal IPTG concentration, lac repressor concentration, repressor bound gene (DNA) concentration, unbound gene (DNA) concentration, mRNA concentration, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, enzyme-substrate complex concentration, and final product concentration, as well as all the rate constants involved. Using the data acquired from the microplate reader, a final semi-empirical kinetics model is generated. Using this model, two different constructs are chosen; both with similar inductivity, but one with and the other without time delay.
Chitin Synthesis Production
The fast expression construct is ligated with Chitin Synthase, while the slow expression construct is ligated with the apoptosis cassette. Both plasmids are then transformed into a chiA and tqsA double knockout strain of K12 Escherichia Coli. ChiA knockouts lack Chitinase, which is an enzyme that catabolizes chitin. tqsA knockouts have a disrupted quorum sensing mechanism that allows them to grow very thick lawns. The mutants are acquired from Keio collection (one from Northwestern, and the other from Yale respectively).
MAGE
The Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) protocol developed by H. H. Wang. et al. is used to acquire double knockouts. The MAGE protocol is an accelerated evolution procedure where oligonucleotides are electroporated into the cells in order to introduce mutations in the genome during replication by binding as lagging strand primers, taking advantage of the lambda-red construct.
Mechanism
The double knockout colonies with both constructs are then sprayed with IPTG, which first induces the fast chitin synthesis construct, causi a buildup of chitin in cells in the top layer of the bacterial lawn. Then the slow apoptosis construct is induced, which then lyses the cells, and releases a layer of chitin in the top layer of the bacterial lawn. This construct is then stained with a chitin-specific rhodamine probe by NEB as well as Baclight by Invitrogen in order to ensure that the cells are producing chitin and lysing. The lawn is then imaged through a"

Technical Standard
Experimental Protocols are an important tool of synthetic biologists both when doing and publishing experiments.  The ideal protocol must be flexible: both detailed enough for a beginner to complete the experiment successfully, but concise enough for an expert to be able to comfortably make use of it to guide their experiment.
In addition, an ideal protocol is easily sharable with those who wish to replicate your experiment or carry out similar experiments of their own.  At present, there is no tool that allows for the creation of such a protocol, so this summer at the CRI we decided to build one of our own called openProtocol and share it with the synthetic biology community.
openProtocol is a website that allows people to create protocols using a simple web form, and have them come out automatically formatted and laid out in a beautiful and easy to use way.   Every openProtocol has its own URL, and can therefore be shared with a link.
Each protocol on the site can be commented on by users and other researchers, allowing you to receive feedback on the way you carry out a certain experiment, as well as solve problems with tricky protocols.  Further, each protocol can be ""forked,"" that is, you can make a copy of any protocol you like to customize for your own lab's situation.  Adding pictures and audio to your protocols is easy, and even videos can be embedded as part of your procedure.  You also have the choice of associating a ""cheat sheet"" type list with each protocol, so that you can have something to take with you to the bench in lieu of the full protocol.
Usage Ideas
We envision several groups of people using openProtocol in quite a few different ways.  Here are some examples to get you started thinking about ways you can use openProtocol in your own research!
Teachers teaching an experimental class can use openProtocols and allow their students to individually annotate and edit the protocols for future classes.  In this way, extremely clear and usable protocols can be developed for classroom use.
Researchers publishing a paper that involves several new methods can include a link to an openProtocol as a supplement to their Materials and Methods section.  Having easy access to a complete protocol online greatly increases the speed at which new and interesting methods can"

Metabolic Engineering
We want to show the suitability of V. natriegens for Metabolic Engineering due to its genetic accessability, fast growth and high substrate-uptake rates.
Our vision of Accelerating Metabolic Engineering
Our Goal
Our goal is to accelerate metabolic engineering by establishing a workflow for fast pathway construction, product screening and pathway optimization.   Metabolic engineering is a broad field in synthetic biology, where existing pathways are divided into modular parts and then used and combined to build new pathways (Stephanopoulos et al.2012) .   One of the best examples for the impact of metabolic engineering on solving global problems is the engineered production pathway for artemisinic acid, the precursor for a drug against malaria (Ro et al.2006) .   In the old days the drug had to be isolated out of"

Note: k-1 is assumed as kcat/100 as preferable yield is 100 µM of product.
Note: due to the lack of literature on these specific enzymes, the values for some of the later K values may be slightly different to theoretical values. For any future reproductions of the model or the experiment, we suggest running individual experiments of each K reaction for correct and accurate measurement of all values.
Model 2
ALA → MgPPIXmonomethylester.
Our second model estimated the time taken for ALA to be converted to MgPPIXmono. Input values of 0.7 µM of necessary enzymes, and a concentration of 1000 µM show that after a period of 8 days the PPIX intermediate levels begin to decline as it is converted to the next intermediate; MgPPIXmono (see Figure. 3-blue dotted line).
Fig 3. Model of ALA to MgPPIXmono using MATLAB, showing formation and depletion of intermediates. Input concentration of enzymes=0.7 µM, and ALA=1000 µM, at day 8 PPIX declines as it is forming MgPPIXmono to be further converted in the chlorophyll a pathway.
Model 3
PPIX → MgPPIX Yield.
From our first model of ALA to chlorophyll a, input values of 0.7 µM of necessary enzymes, over a period of 16 days 1000 µM of ALA was yielded (see Figure 2). However, the Chlorophyll a team conducted an experiment that fed 5000 µM of ALA to wildtype E. coli, expressed with MgCheletase plasmid . No detectable MgPPIX was produced, and only less than 5 µM amounts of PPIX were produced over 5 days. The low amounts of protoporphyrin fits the mathematical model.

Living library experience
Insights: Intimate. The public is excited to live more closely cases of depression and anxiety of people who have already gone through it and overcome it willing to share it.
Changes:We consider listening more closely to those suffering from depression or anxiety to know more about the needs that our project must cover in its entirety.
Resume:
The living library is way of showing those who might be scared to share with others that they are depressed or even as encouraging them to accept their disease. This is a powerful of way of demonstrating the community that depression and anxiety are common diseases and that we must not be ashamed of suffering these illnesses thus we expect to create a digital space where people who go to this experience are comfortable enough to seek help and raise their voice.
Also there are still some people who believe that depression is just something that happens in movies, so via this experience we want to prove the relevance of mental health.

Movie Day
Insights: Conscience. That people would create an informed opinion about these diseases.
Changes: we discovered that many of the students in our school are more interested in the subject if it is explained graphically, so we decided that developing more videos would help us to get our message to the public in a better way, since we are very visual.
Resume:
Similar to other events we expect to project a movie, sometimes documentaries can get boring and tedious, so what we aim to show is a movie that has all the elements of what depression and anxiety are, also the consequences of not seeking help, how to encourage someone to seek help. Our main objective is to show in a way where people can get to experience what depression from another point of view. We intend for this event to be appealing all of the alumni of our campus.

On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the ""government + grassroots + personal"" operation mode, it was necessary to work hard in marketing, with clear targets and strategies.
Visiting Mr. Jianghong Wu, founder of Xiamen Wenda Technology Ltd.
We visited Mr. Jianghong Wu, president of Xiamen Wenda technology LTD. We had an enjoyed communication with Mr. Wu, which is about the communication mode between team hardware and software and the practicability of software design. We introduced the general situation of this year's team project to Mr. Wu, and emphasized the original intention of the team to solve the ""aerial phenomenon"" of the current ""graded diagnosis and treatment"" policy, as well as the difficulty in getting medical treatment in remote areas. Mr. Wu fully affirmed the innovative project and praised the team consciousness of social responsibility.
As for APP part he gave some professional advices and technical guidance, like how to accelerate our convolution neural network recognition speed with collected increasing number of images cases, and how to link block them up between chain technology public health service database to serve the public better. In addition, Mr. Wu gave us a lot of advice on product promotion and profit model.

Every child is a scientist
Kids are natural scientists. They have an enquiring                         spirit. They are very curious and aren’t afraid to                         admit that they do not know something. Exploring and                         drawing conclusions from their experiences allow them                         to build a more predictable world. That is why we think                         that childhood is the suitable moment to impress them                         the passion for research and knowledge. This way, it is                         possible to start educating society to analyze and                         interpret science, instead of rejecting innovation. If                         they understand, they will have the ability to receive                         change without fear.
This summer, we have taken part of their adventure of                         learning at the Summer School of the City of Arts and                         Sciences from Valencia. They have been approached                         biological aspects from cell biology such as molecular                         genetics or the main biological processes –                         replication, transcription and translation. But we                         strongly believe that young children learn best through                         doing, so apart from a brief introduction, we have                         mainly focused on practical activities and games to strengthen the concepts as much as possible. They have                         had to adopt the role of the main enzymes such as                         polymerases and ribosomes to carry out the processes of                         transmission and expression of genetic heritage. To get                         this, we have proposed some games like creating a                         protein from a DNA sequence by adding amino acids,                         writing their names nucleotides based on an imaginary                         genetic code, or guessing the genetic similarities                         between different species.
With all these games we also wanted to impress on                         children the idea of what scientific investigation                         involves. Real examples of proteins and experiments                         were used to show that not everything works the first                         time, even in real organism, mutations and other errors                         occur. Furthermore, some experiments fall in a heap, so                         they had to find out what went wrong, guess why, and                         try again. And this is one of the main characteristics                         of science, it involves a lot of debate, talking and                         listening to others and meet group agreements and                         conclusions.
Children have very enquiring minds, thus they are                         always asking questions and wondering about what could                         happen before they do something, creating hypothesis in                         their minds. Those approaches are very interesting to                         be stimulated since young, in order to face reality                         with a critical thinking, but also to help people to                         build their own ideas and convictions and refuse non                         reliable statements.

UCL,2018,Team:UCL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," using split inteins for  polymerisation. We designed two constructs ,Bba_K2842680 and Bba_K2842690 that could work together to polymerise proteins via intein trans-splicing. Each construct is made of an Intein C termini, a fluorescent reporter protein, a StrepTag and an intein N termini.                                         We introduced Type II restriction sites sites that could be used to introduce any protein of interest into the construct for polymerisation.
Design Details
Inteins: Each construct contains orthogonal inteins on each side preventing self reaction and circularisation. The orthogonal inteins mean that polymerisation will only occur when both constructs are expressed together or when the two proteins are combined.
Reporters: One construct contains GFP and the other mRFP1. This will enable easy identification of cross polymerisation by fluorescence measurements.
Modular design: SapI sites were placed immediately upstream and downstream of the reporter proteins. The codons used were designed to be as innocuous as possible.
Other elements
Promotor: A T7 promoter was used                                         RBS: We used a RBS based on predictions by sallis lab [1,2] Regulatory elements: We introduced a lac operator to further control gene expression if the T7 promoter was too strong or detrimental to cell health.
Spidroin Constructs
Spidroin Constructs
A spidroin is a protein belonging to the family of scleroproteins, which includes collagen and keratin. It is the main building block of spiders’ dragline silk; its tensile properties exceed steel and kevlar and, at the same time, it is more flexible than both of these material as it can be stretched up to 135% of its original length.
The amino acid composition is largely dominated by alanine, found in the crystalline regions of the protein, and glycine blocks found in the amorphous matrix. The alternation of the crystalline and amorphous regions, formed by helical structures and beta turns, is what gives spidersilk its incredible properties. However, the protein by itself is a monomer, therefore in order to form a strong fiber, it has to form an oligomer. The C-termini in solution associate by covalent bond and with a change in pH, which in vivo is carried by transport into a different gland The N-termini form hydrogen bonds and complete the oligomerization.
Our construct, which we split into two for simplicity of assembly, is composed by the spidroin core with four total repetitive regions, two in one construct and two in the"
Tsinghua-A,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#pr_-_-_TEXT.html," search for a rational GRN that can sense the input signal, realize the switch function and show adaptation to copy number. Besides, GRN consists of different kinds of regulatory motifs that may play an important role in functioning. We are also motivated to search for certain motifs which contribute to adaptation. Why are we interested ? Cells with different mir-21 amount response differently towards the input signal and their response may represent state-switch. Therefore, cells of 2 different types can be distinguished according to their response. So an adaptive and robust network topology can be regarded as a sensitive switch and a simple sorter, which is really exciting. In addition, possible functional motifs and its mechanism are also fun.
Project design
What makes an ideal network? An ideal functional network is expected to express output protein at a different intensity according to the different number of input microRNA. So the network should maintain step-like input-output character to realize state-switch. Besides, adaptation to DNA template variation requires the output of ideal network to be saturated along with the increase of copy number.
How to search for an optimal network ? We described our regulation reactions based on Michealis-Menten Equation and Hill Equation and constructed all possible three-node network topologies (around 20,000 networks) via ODE matrix equation sets. Then we iterated the regulation process. During the thorough investigation of every network’s character under steady state, we finished mass amount of calculation and analysis with the help of High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC). High-low Ratio and Interim Slope are main indexes for input-output character, and networks’ ability of saturation is considered as the key index for adaptation. How to verify our results? In order to guarantee the correctness of our results, we simulated the output expression with probability model. We firstly assumed that copy number follows Poisson distribution and studied the Overlap between the output distribution. Then a Bimodal Gaussian distribution is introduced to make comparisons on Overlap of output distribution. The value of both Overlap is rather low when ideal networks are adopted. So we have verified our optimal results to be efficient under distribution by further simulation. Besides, we transferred the corresponding functional networks (screened from simulation) and contrast unfunctional network into Hela cells in wet lab. The output intensity has clearly increased with functional networks and the trend of saturation to copy number is more obvious with functional network than with unfunctional one. The experiment results generally accord with our modeling expectation of the optimal network structure. Why are we interested ? The biological networks are complex, but growing evidence shows that some core topology structures are capable of robustly executing functions, which are known as motifs. And"

Program Description
Darwin is a software package to document changes to DNA which allows for easy, standardized, and collaborative editing on DNA data up to the genome scale. It builds off of tested and proven version control software, so the entire history of the tracked data is easy to browse and transfer. But Darwin is specifically focused on DNA data, speeding up the tracking process and offering significant security improvements from any current system.
Because Darwin uses existing version control systems, the majority of the heavy lifting is complete already; Darwin can be installed right on top of the existing software. Darwin's contribution is to parse and format the biological data so that it can be used more effectively with these systems. It uses a variety of heuristics to effectively split the data and granularize the changes made to produce change logging orders of magnitude more time- and space-efficient than any other method.
Current Status
The program produced by Vanderbilt's 2014 iGEM software team is named darwin, a Unix command-line tool to produce what are known as ""diffs"" between two genomic data files. The command to produce the diff is dwndiff, typically invoked by using:
dwndiff <file1> <file2>
This creates a file with the extension .vcscmp which can be used in typical version control systems.
The project in its current status can be found in its repository on github . Documentation on the produced software tool can be found on the Program page

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," sequence denotes an error that is discussed in the results section.
The GFP2 part was designed without the addition of a RBS. Only a start codon (purple) was inserted into the part sequence. BioBrick prefix/suffix (yellow), and flanking DNA (blue) are included in the fragment amplification. A 1 in 1000 dilution of miniprep DNA of the full GFP part E0040 was used as template for an NEB Phusion polymerase reaction, following their PCR condition protocol.
SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was performed using Bio-Rad 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ 10-well Precast Protein Gels, run in 1x Tris-Glycine buffer. E. coli GFP expression samples were prepared by recording the optical density of 1 ml samples of cells during culture, at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. The 1 ml cell samples were transferred to separate microcentrifuge tubes and pelleted at 16,000 g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 2x final concentration Laemmli sample buffer (65.8 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 26.3% (w/v) glycerol, 2.1% SDS, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 20 mM DTT). Volume of sample-buffer to be added was normalised to OD values, where the highest OD sample received 100 μl of buffer, and lower ODs received less proportionally. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 minutes, then microcentrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 minutes. 20 μl of prepared samples were loaded into the pre-cast gel wells. Empty wells were filled with sample buffer. Gel-electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for roughly 45 minutes, or until the dye front reached the base of the gel. The gel was stained in Coomassie Blue (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 1 hour, then de-stained overnight in 10% methanol 10% acetic acid solution.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Gene Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," genome. The amplified bands of all the colonies correspond to around 300 bp which is approximately the size of the anti-holin gene. The lane furthest to the right is a control in which the anti-holin gene is contained in a pSB1C3 plasmid. (Data by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
In order to test these eight colonies we first did an EcoRI and PstI digest and then looked at the size of the insert compared to a control which only contained sfGFP in the CRIM. According to our results, three of the colonies contained an insert that was larger than that of the control. However, the gel red we used to stain the gel seems to do something funny with the buffer we were using to digest making all the bands run higher than they should be running. Therefore, to conclude that the plasmid contained the inserts we wanted we looked for a restriction site that is unique on the anti-holin and the CRIM. We found that the anti-holin construct contains a ClaI site that is also present on the CRIM vector. We performed this digest in another buffer and obtained the expected bands for the three colonies confirming that they contain the anti-holin on the CRIM.
Then we performed the genome integration step which involves the transformation of a cell line containing the helper plasmid[2]. In order to test whether the colonies had integrated the CRIM in the correct location we ordered the primers that were used in the original CRIM paper and performed a colony PCR on all the colonies. A few of the colonies had integrated the CRIM twice which could be clearly seen under a blue box. However, the rest of the colonies had a single integration event which could also be seen by their phenotype under blue light.
Finally, we had to prove that the anti-holin gene was now present within the colonies. In order to achieve this we performed numerous PCR's with all kinds of buffers and polymerases until we finally got one to work. Using Taq polymerase and Barnes' buffer we managed to amplify a band of the appropriate size using the same primers that we used to initially amplify the anti-holin from its origin.
As of wiki freeze, we are currently having issues with curing the cells of the helper plasmid. We hope to have this fixed and finally test the system before we fly off to Boston. For the conclusion of this module, please come and see our presentation at MIT.

After that we carried out another test to confirm our results more carefully. From the results it was shown that mutant 8M1 of the lactate permease was found to have a consistent growth enhancement for our chassis. However, for our lactate dehydrogenase, none was found to have better expression than the wild type.

We did another round of measurements with additional mutants. However, for the second batch, our lactate dehydrogenase mutants were now ligated to the wildtype version of lactate permease. Other than that, we used the BioScreen which allows an automated measurements of our cultures in a 96-well plate. However, some of the mutants did not grew after inoculations. For lactate permease mutants, we did not carry on further as multiple ligations lead to failure.

When the mutants were tested for the voltage output, several mutants showed high voltage output. The measurements was made on the closed circuit potential with two resistors connecting the anode to the cathode. Our controls showed weird reading but the mutants all seem to have higher voltage output compared to previous control's results.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," promoter of low, medium and high inducer strength. Since we wanted to investigate the interactions between CsgA and different levels of CsgB, we designed this biobrick in the pSB4K5 backbone to avoid problems with incompatibility groups. The proteins CsgC, CsgE, CsgF and CsgG are involved in the maturation, correct folding and export of CsgA. For this reason we imagined overexpression of these proteins to have a positive effect on the total extracellular amount of available, functional CsgA. By increasing this amount, we hoped to increase the rate of biofilm formation.
Using amyloid nanowires to connect the cells, the question arises how long these nanowires can grow. Unfortunately, no exact number can be assigned to usual length of these nanowires. While their thickness has been characterized to be 100 to 350 nm, their length is of several micrometers (Pitkänen, M., et al., 2010). From this data, we created a model using the measures of a bacterial cell and different cell densities (OD600) to calculate the mean distance between each cell either head on or sideways (since E.coli has a worm-like appearance) assuming homogeneous orientation. From this, different required cell densities can be derived depending on the level of crosslinking desired. Two cutoff lines of 10 µm and 5 µm distance are plotted for easy orientation.
Corresponding to this, molecular sizes of the CsgA protein monomer were used to calculate the amount of protein monomers required for connecting two cells at a certain density. This can be used as an orientation for the time it takes to crosslink two cells assuming constant protein production and no differences by diffusion.

First, we completed the biocontainment survey created by the Virginia iGEM 2016 team. They collected information about awareness of biocontainment within iGEM teams. Click on the badge below to get more information about the results! Second, we participated in the iGEM.today project, designed by the EPFL iGEM 2016 team as a part of their Human Practices. This platform presents iGEM teams and their projects through “news articles”, what makes it a great opportunity to learn more about other iGEM projects in fun and interactive ways. We were interviewed about our team, ""Crescentium,"" our project, and our experience with iGEM. We also participated in the iGemMatch.org project, created by the UC_Davies team. This project is designed to easily find collaborators from the iGEM community relevant to your project or areas of expertise."

Remark: Team SCUT help us with some of our modeling work.
In FAFU’s project, it   is difficult to measure the quantitative data and determine the   amount of dsRNAs which is fed to the larvae. So in the modeling   part, we devoted to establishing an accurate mathematical model to   simulate the dsRNA expression according to the mechanism of T7   promoter. After the model is built, we can determine the   relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production   of dsRNA . Then we can control  the amount of dsRNAs which if fed   to the larvae by controlling the concentration of IPTG   easily.
We know that T7 promoter   is a kind of inducible promoter. Hill equation can be used to   simulate the effect of T7 promoter. In T7 strength model, the   independent variable is the concentration of IPTG, and the   dependent variable is the production of dsRNA.
1.The Model Simulating the   Change of dsRNA with Time in Different Concentration of   IPTG
By observing the pattern   of the data, we figure out that the Logistic equation, which is   often used to simulate the growth of population, can model the   trend best. Thus, we adapt the formula
in the following fitting, where a is the   concentration of dsRNA in the steady state.
When the concentration of IPTG=0.3mmol/L, the   result of curve fitting is:
General model:

The central activator is the LuxR-family member GadE (formerly known as YhiE). GadE binds to a 20-bp sequence called the gad box, which is located 63-bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites of gadA and gadBC. (4)GadE and GadBox are an important point for GadA and GadBC. This means that GadE and GadBox are an important for acid resistance. The basis section of acid resistance is GadE’s regulation. At least 10 different regulatory take part in this regulation.
GadE have three main activation mechanisms. The first of these is performed by evgA and ydeO. About GadE activation phase:
1. EvgS (sensor kinase) activate EvgA (response regulator)
2. YdeO and evgA are independently from each other and GadE takes an active role in transcription activation.
The second GadE activation circuit includes CRP,RpoS and two AraC-like regulators, GadXand GadW.
These steps are as follows:
1. GadX and GadW, are located downstream of gadA also GadX and GadW directly activate transcription of gadE
2. GadX and GadW also bind to the gadA and gadBC gad box sequences and seem to repress the gadA and gadBC promoters. (4) GadW inhibits this GadX’s repression  Also GadX and GadW regulate indirectly GadA/BC transcriptional functions.
3. The balance of power in this circuit is influenced by cAMP and CRP,which together inhibit the synthesis of RpoS. Growth under acidic conditions reduces the concentration of cAMP in the cell.  RpoS increases GadX’s transcriptional function  The increase in GadX then stimulates transcription of GadE and also down regulates GadW.
The third activation of GadE contains TrmE and glucose. These steps are as follows:
1. The function of TrmE in the cell is not fully defined but it does have a clear effect on tRNA modification
2. TrmE and glucose increase independently GadE’s transcriptional function
We discourse GadE’s regulation and then now we will discourse GadE’s effect mechanisms. GadA/BC’s effect mechanisms to acid resistance are as follows:
1. The external pH is normally neutral but if external pH turns to acidic pH, internal pH begins to become acidic pH with HCl diffusion.
2. If the external pH=2,5 and internal pH begins pH=4.2 ± "

Its name is the abbreviation respective of Science, Education, Life and Future.
This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

The teacher welcomed the new idea of synthetic biology, and want to help the students to expand their horizon. The high school student were curious about what synthetic biology can do, and want to know more about the details. And the kids’ curiosity for synthetic biology was sparked. And for the youth, they cared more about the project itself, and were curious about synthetic biology.
    We carefully explained the safety problem synthetic biology concerned to the old, and realized it is the first problem that synthetic biology should settled down, in order to apply it to reality. However, some problems of biosafety are easy to settle, while others are hard to make it clear. There is still many attention and effort to be paid. And we were very pleased that the tools can be useful for them to understand it better.
    We explained the details to the youth who asked us problem about the project. And they encouraged us a lot, telling us that the project was very impressive and thanks us for bringing the idea of synthetic biology. We were aware that the youth cared less about the application than others, and they value the idea and creativeness. But we still can’t ignore the problems that synthetic biology meet when it comes to apply it to the real world, which are also the problems that we were asked. We used to think that an innovative design is enough, and we can extract the certain circuit of it for future application. But now we think the application can’t always be delayed. It is not only the problem that the public concerned most, but also the motivation for synthetic biologists."

Report of the day
Gaël Nicolas: ""Iron homeostasis in mammals and its deregulation""
Summary
Iron is necessary to living beings but potentially toxic, that is why homeostasis is required. In a human body there are 4 g to 5 g of iron, that is about a rusted nail. Iron is present as Fe2+ and Fe3+; as Fe3+ it is insoluble and thus must be degraded in Fe2+, but as Fe2+ it becomes highly toxic because it is a strong oxidant. Much of iron is located in the red blood cells. This explains why we associate iron with oxygen transport, but many other reactions imply iron.
In the 1930's, an experiment showed that iron was not excreted by the body: iron remains stocked in the body. Everyday we absorb 1 mg to 2 mg of iron in order to compensate the 1 mg to 2 mg of iron lost through the death of cells. The production of red blood cells daily uses 20 mg of iron, but these 20 mg exclusively come from the recycling process of old red blood cells by macrophages.
Hepcidin is a hormone that makes the level of iron in the serum decrease. Hepcidin is thus to iron approximatively what insulin is to glucose. Its deficiency is implied in almost all the forms of hemochromatosis. This hormone has four sulphur bridges, that makes it very difficult to synthesize.
PDF of Gaël Nicolas presentation (in french)
Question/Answer
Q1: What are the consequences of iron overload on red blood cells? Are they not biconcave anymore?
A1: No, they remain biconcave because this feature has been naturally selected and it is necessary for the red blood cells to go through the capillaries. But there may be more of them, or they may be bigger.
Q2: Given the number of persons who have this disease, how is it still possible that doctors do not know it, or can not diagnose it properly? How can you explain the different forms of the disease (particularly regarding the seriousness) between siblings?
A2: Other genes have effects on iron regulation, so they can increase or decrease the gravity of the disease. Food have consequences too, and for example the red wine contains much iron. Moreover alcohol reduces the production of hepcidin.
You mentioned doctors. I want to put things in perspective: in France there are around 200 "
