Experiment 2
Procedure
The anaerobic experiment is performed in a sealed bottle, where two polarographic electrodes that will measure nitric oxide and nitrous oxide are carefully attached to the lid. The electrodes are connected to a sensor to measure the different concentrations. The bottle is placed to a magnetic stirrer on 270 rpm and 37oC.
There is one control flask, as well, containing only DM medium which will be spiked with NO2- (as will be done for the experimental flasks).
Additionally, we will measure the response of only anaerobic E. coli biomass without any NO2- added, and the same for anaerobic P. aeruginosa.  This will be done in the experimental flasks prior to spiking with  NO2-.
There will be 2 experimental flasks:
E. coli, to which spikes of NO2- will be added.
P. aeruginosa, to which spikes of NO2- will be added.
In addition to the continuous gas measurements, we take samples to measure the concentration of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate at the beginning and end of each spike.
The response time of the cells to spikes of NO2- is expected to be on the order of minutes, and we will run the experiment until the solution has reached saturation with NO2-.
EQUIPMENT NEEDED
1 400 mL bottle with a lid that the electrodes can be fastened air tightly to
1 magnetic stirrer
1 NO probe for NO measuring
1 N2O probe for N2O measuring

3. Make the restriction map
-- Nedcutter, check the page for NewEngland Biolabs (because we are going to use enzymes from that company)
For rcnA and rcnR, the regulatory region that was among the two genes was not explained.
We have to take the whole sequence in fasta format and use it in a program called Gene Construction Kit. This shows reading frames and restriction sites.
 
In fruitfly.org: 9005/seq_tools/promoter.html we can look for primers and we can adjust parameters. We can also analyze the  stability energy, and seek the lowest point of stability. This point is generally the -10box. To find inverted repeats, we shall use the program StemLoop of the parcel of GCG (genetics computer group). This program calls in the sequence in a GCG format. To find direct repeats we will use the program ""repeat"". For rcnR and rcnA we found three direct repeats between the -10 box and the translation start of rcnA.We suggest that this is a regulatory region. Based on this, we designed the primers, trying to preserve the regulatory region and changing its promoter.
 
Primer design.
The region should be rich in GC, of about 20 nucleotides with a 50% GC content at least and it should finish in G. The program can also show the double chain to facilitate the design of oligo lower. If they are rich in AT, they can be longer primers to increase its Tm.
 
The most popular program at the center is Oligo. Here we open a new window and paste the sequence. This will open two windows. The first one with the Tm, and the other one with the free energy. The program can calculate all oligos and show potential couples with its parameters. We can also specify were we want the oligo to be located. Once the program generates it, we can analyze its biochemical properties.
Trying to k Delta G so it won't be lower than -10.
The differences between the TMS should not be greater than 5 degrees. Enzymes used in PCR use magnesium chloride. The most reliable and processed use magnesium acetate. It is said that 10mM of dinucleotidos is an optimal concentration for PCR, .4 mM is used in the lab. Once we have the oligo, we add a site at the far restraining 5 '. And add nucleotides in the 5 'end to ensure that the enzyme is positioned correctly and efficiently cut. These nucleotides"

Over the summer, our team traveled to the campus of the University of Maryland for the 2018 Mid-Atlantic Meetup. This meet-up was a great opportunity to talk to the other teams from the region and get feedback for our project. Two teams present were particularly interested in the 3G portion of our project: University of Virginia and University of Pittsburgh. We quickly began a correspondence and, to demonstrate the accessibility and ease of 3G assembly, we sent them the supplies and instructions to perform a 3G assembly at their own lab. The package consisted of a parts kit, a transcriptional unit assembly protocol, a Gibson protocol and calculator, 100mM IPTG, and 200ug/ml ATC. The parts kit included a small subset of our own 3G assembly library, normalized to 30nM, as well as 50nM UNS adapters, and 10uM primers for amplification. The parts are listed below.

Our strategy: The trick TCS
We could ,with the help of Alfonso Jaramillo, design a synthetic PBP which could detect the substrate we choosed and activate a specific HK. The previous work done by Valencia in 2006 was to design vanilin-sensitive PBP and a network for a graduated response whereas we just need a proteic sensitive PBP and a binary type of response.
Even if the idea of creating a synthethic protein was very attractive, it would have been difficult to have concrete result in just 3 months.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Teaching_-_-_TEXT.html," their own case study centered on issues raised by the threat of antimicrobial resistance. We felt it was important to do this when introducing the main bulk of the ethical discussion our SMITE project centres around.
Previously students had been presented with scenarios to think about and respond to, however, as reflected in the case of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance globally, we cannot simply wait for the situation to be presented to us...we all need to think ahead and take responsibility for the impact of our actions and lifestyles on the world. The task set was as follows:
The need for SMITE: addressing the global threat of antibiotic resistance
Case 7: Consider the issues raised by increasing antibiotic resistance (including the benefits novel therapies like SMITE may offer) in order to design your own advertising campaign to help combat the problem by raising awareness.
Requesting that the students present their work as an advertising campaign warning against antibiotic resistance enabled them to demonstrate skills in persuasive writing under a  popular science construct and also to display their creativity.
To finalise this fourth component, we reviewed all the submissions and chose the best one(s) to present on our Wiki (see below).

Antimicrobial Resistance Conference
In March we attended an event hosted by Edinburgh Infectious Diseases, to learn more about how antibiotic resistance arises, the threat it poses, and potential solutions. This really helped demonstrate to us that antibiotic resistance is an important issue to tackle and it cemented our decision to try and tackle this issue with our iGEM project.
The topics covered during the conference included the current state of global antimicrobial resistance, the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and possible alternatives to antibiotics (such as the use of phages). By talking to many researchers in the field we realised there was real scope to use bacteriophages to get closer to solving this issue, which informed our final choice to create a project with this aim.
Figure 1: Event programme front cover.
Leiden University
In May, we were visited by members of the Biology Society from Leiden University in the Netherlands. As we were still in the early stages of our project at this point, it was great to have their input and they provided some perspectives that we hadn’t yet considered.
We carried out a survey of the students and staff before and after we gave a presentation about our project, to see whether their opinions would change. 45 individuals took part in the survey. Detailed survey results can be found here: Pre-presentation & post-presentation
We found that - even prior to our presentation - the vast majority of our audience were familiar with antibiotic resistance and its importance (98%), and with bacteriophages (96%). This is not particularly surprising given that the audience all have an interest in biological sciences. 34 of the 45 respondents had heard of MRSA, making it the most well known of the pathogens we asked about. 6 of the participants hadn’t heard of any of the pathogens.
Before the presentation, 29% of the audience thought bacteriophages were harmful to humans and 7% were unsure. These numbers fell slightly after the presentation, to 27% and 4% respectively. 89% of the audience hadn’t heard of phage therapy and the use of bacteriophages for medical treatment before our presentation.

CAB Extraction vs. Hydraulic Fracturing CAB Extraction Survey Lethbridge iGEM Human Practices
CAB Extraction Survey
In order to better understand the public opinion about hydraulic fracturing and methods for extracting unconventional natural resources, we put together a short survey for people to fill out. The responses gave us a chance to think, not only about the science behind our project, but also about the financial, environmental, safety, and engineering aspects of our project. After giving a short description of our proposed CAB extraction method, we asked people the following questions:
1. Thinking about the described procedure for extracting carbonate oil, do you imagine any ethical or environmental problems associated with it? If yes, what kinds of problems or issues come to mind?
2. Do you know what hydraulic fracturing is? Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a well stimulation process that involves high-pressure injection of water, sand, and chemicals into buried geological formations to open and enlarge fractures in the rock, creating pathways for trapped hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore at higher rates. When describing our method, did it make you think of hydraulic fracturing? Now that you are thinking of it, do you see any similarities or differences between hydraulic fracturing and our proposed method?
3. What sort of safety procedures would you like to see implemented if our method for extracting carbonate oil were to be used by oil and gas companies?
4. Do you think that Canadians should be investing in new ways for extracting unconventional oil sources? Do you think this is an important investment for the world as a whole? Do you think there are other sources of energy that we should be investing more time and money into instead of unconventional sources? Why or why not? Participants were allowed to give free-form answers to these questions, and we boiled down their answers into a few main responses for each questions. Here is a breakdown of the main responses for each question:
Overall, participants were mostly concerned with the effects acetic acid would have on ground water and the surrounding plant life. However, almost 30% of the participants could not see any major ethical or environmental issues associated with CAB extraction, mostly because acetic acid did not seem harmful enough to cause any major damage. Some participants were concerned that acidification of the soil due to"

Less than twenty years later it is understandable why some are not willing to even entertain the idea of personal infection and thus would choose not to use the test. Hopefully the integration with traditional health practitioners which should be catalyzed by the lateral flow design and cost effectiveness thanks in part to the thermostability, will diminish the stigma in the privacy of clinics. There is also the issue of preventing transmission. The test is not a cure itself, but can lead to people seeking out resources to help themselves and their family. For example, once tested positive, a pregnant woman may seek out drugs (like the Pratt pouch) designed to prevent transmission during birth in rural areas [6]. Whatever the case may be, diagnostics are the first step toward treatment and prevention of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.

These plates were incubated for 21 hours at 37 ℃.  Growth inhibition circle was not observed on the plate(B). While, inhibition circle was observed on the plate with farnesol (A).
This result indicates that farnesol affect E.coli. So, we hypothesized that E.coli needs to have resistance to farnesol.
Enhancement of farnesol resistance
Fig.7:Colony formation of E.coli JM109 engineered with marA on farnesol overlaid plates.
E.coli JM109 and E.coli JM109 (marA) were dropped on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～〖10〗^(-6)), overlaid with 30 % (v/v) farnesol hexane solution (farnesol solution) and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that E.coli JM109 (marA) cells that overexpress the marA product better than the control E.coli JM109 wild type cells survived plates overloyed by 30 % farnesol solution.
Confirmation of Amount of transcription of Farnesol production device.
We reinforced by overexpressing genes that dxs,idi,ispD and ispF, which was the bottom neck of MEP pathway. We checked amount of transcription by RT-PCR. E. coli that we created last year can overexpress the gene. We checked amount of transcription by RT-PCR to confirm whether E.coli can overexpress the gene or not. We thought that amount of RNA transcription was increased .

July – August 2018 iGEM'ers Guide to the Future – Stakeholder value matrix
Inspired by the iGEM’ers Guide to the Future, we performed a stakeholder-value matrix. Over the course of July and August, we reflected on the consequences of our design for several stakeholders. The entire analysis can be found here. From the stakeholder-value analysis, it is concluded that Gelcatraz introduces significant benefits to most stakeholders discussed. Importantly, patients will benefit from the plaster as they will experience less pain, enjoy faster wound healing and thus get a better quality of life. The major safety issues have been addressed under safe-by-design. Medical professionals will also appreciate Gelcatraz as a new tool which will facilitate and ease their treatments.

July – August 2018 iGEM'ers Guide to the Future – Stakeholder value matrix
Society and the government will benefit from hold on antibiotic resistance and a reduction in health care costs. However, it is crucial to increase awareness about GMOs and to maintain a positive debate about the pros and cons. Moreover, increased awareness of the antibiotics resistance problem is required. Lastly, GMO regulations may limit the implementation of Gelcatraz. However, the environment seems not to suffer from any large risks as long as the material is used responsibly.

Insights
Gelcatraz introduces significant benefits to most stakeholders discussed.
Awareness of GMO benefits and the antibiotic resistance problem is important.
Follow-up
We addressed various safety issues for the safe-by-design project.
We interacted with as many stakeholders as possible (several scientists , several medical doctors and nurses, the Maasstad hospital, someone who has worked for insurance companies, experts from governmental institutes and last but not least, with Dutch citizens). These interactions are documented on this page.
We tried to raise awareness of GMOs and antibiotic resistance during our outreach activities.

Results
20 aliquots were stored at -80°C in the freezer (room 3.80)
Electroporation
Introduction
This protocol was provided by the Marburg iGEM team to perform their InterLab study with Vibrigens.
Materials
Recovery media 10 aliquots (a’ 500µL )(BHI + v2 salts (204 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 23.14mM MgCl2), and 680 mM sucrose)
Preheat the aliquots with the recovery medium to 45 °C ( pipetting mixing with cold cells and resuspending in chilled cuvettes will cool down the media )
Agar plates (LB + v2 + 1% agarose + 2 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm))
Procedure
Take nine aliquots of the prepared competent cells and place them on ice.
1µL of the Plasmid DNA (100 ng/µL) and the electrocompetent cells are combined and gently mixed (NO VORTEX, avoid foaming) in a chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
(each aliquot gets one 1 µL of another plasmid from the box one aliquot is a control and will later not be plated out on a plate with antibiotics)
The cell-DNA suspension is transferred to a chilled electroporation cuvette with a 0.1 cm gap size
Cells are electroporated with the following settings: 900 V, 25 mF, 200 Ω (Eppendorf electroporator)
Cells are immediately recovered in 500 μL (one aliquot) preheated (45°C) recovery medium and transferred to a 1.5 mL tube
The cells are recovered by incubating at 37 °C for 1.5 h. (also put the agar plates for preheating in the incubator at 37 °C)
The cells are centrifuged down at 3000x g, most of the supernatant is removed
The pellet is resuspended in the leftover media (approx. 50 µL) and plated out on warm agar plates (37 °C) containing the appropriate antibiotic (2 µg/ml Chloramphenicol - Cm)
The plates are incubated for several hours or overnight at 37 °C for colonies to appear. Check the rest of the InterLab Protocol to keep track of colony growth

Project Scope
the ABCs of Automatic Biological Circuit Design
One ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to program complex biological networks that could achieve desired phenotype and produce significant metabolites in purpose of real world application, by fabricating standard components from an engineering-driven perspective. This project explores the application of theoretical approaches to automatically design synthetic complex biological networks with desired functions defined as dynamical behavior and input-output property.
We propose a novel design scheme highlighted in the notion of trade-off that synthetic networks could be obtained by a compromise between performance and robustness. Moreover, series of eligible strategies, which consist of various topologies and possible standard components such as BioBricks, provide multiple choices to facilitate the wet experiment procedure. Description of all feasible solutions takes advantage of SBML and SBGN standard to guarantee extensibility and compatibility.
The Campus
University of Science and Technology of China, or as we abbreviate it for USTC, locates in Hefei, east of China. It's typical subtropic continent climate here, as midsummer could be sizzling while you'll have plenty of snow to expect in winter. Like the higher education in China itself, founded in Sept 20, 1958, USTC is a young campus packed with vigorous and young faces. There are two major parts, the east campus where physical, chemical sciences and SGY locates, and the west campus where we are here endeavoring together for iGEM. Going against the prevailing trend of expanding enrollment, USTC is subject to our pride to be one of the very few USTCers for all these years.
Members of USTC_Software, in front of main building of School of Life Sciences
The main building of School of Life Sciences is among the most advanced and eye-catching buildings on campus. Another reason for young guys' eyes to be caught here is due to the breakdown of USTC's characteristic guy-to-girl ratio here :-).

Grand View Farms
As our project deals with alternatives to antibiotics as plasmid maintenance, we wanted to learn how and why others avoid using antibiotics in their industries. According to a 2013 Summary Report by the FDA on antimicrobial use, a large majority of antimicrobials in the us are used in food-producing animals. Because of this we decided to meet directly with farmers who choose to purposely avoid antibiotics. In addition to learning about their rationale for using alternatives, these trips also helped inform us of the potential applications of our work with the Hok-Sok system.
Grand View Farms is a certified organic farm in Maryland that does not administer sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics to their animals, uses no pesticides, and grows as few genetically modified crops as possible. As different animals consume different plants, they argued, rotating livestock through the land naturally maintains a healthy nutrient balance while suppressing the growth of harmful weeds. Due to this practice, the farmers at Grand View argued that administering antibiotics was not beneficial, since they naturally received all the nutrients required for good health and from the varied vegetation available for grazing.
Interestingly, the owners of Grand View Farms did not express any particular ethical or health concerns with GMO crops. Instead they informed us that, for a farm of their size, having an organic label made them more profitable and allows them to fill a market niche without directly competing with larger, more industrial scale operations. The allure of organically grown food and organically raised animals is a powerful marketing tool for the farm.
*One a side note, some hungry members of our team sampled the farms ribs, eggs, and vegetables, and according to them, the farms practices have only improved the taste of the food.*
Free range chickens roam Grand View Farms
The farmers' willingness to accept GMO crops demonstrated their interest in maintaining an antibiotic free operation. This helped us gain a greater understanding of the applications for our Hok-Sok plasmid maintenance system. If this could be used to maintain plasmids in lieu of antibiotics, then synthetic biology could benefit and partner with organizations like Grand View Farms without compromising the integrity of their ethical positions.

hall, we considerably arranged all the elements so to utilize the space to the fullest. Thanks to many moveable post boards, we designed a boot-like route for visitors. To be more concrete, visitors were expected to go firstly at the peripheral venue before they enter the cinema. If we could birdview the whole space, we would interestingly find that the entire visiting route resembles a boot very much. This layout not only provided us exact space to post all the panels, but also created a mysterious atmosphere which attracts visitors' interests tightly, for that they had to adjust their directions frequently to follow the content and it seemed that they were travelling in the history of synthetic biology development filling with success and setbacks. At last, visitors sat down to enjoy short videos and even to think about science and ethics. Actually, the human-based route received many nice comments.
Visitors
   
Visitors for the exhibition came from various fields, ranging from students to businessperson and from officials to professors. This means our exhibition was accepted by people from different background. We selected some visitors in five scenes as representatives.
Scene 1 on Aug. 25
A lady with her girl stepped in the exhibition hall. After their visiting, the lady told us that her husband who is a professor in life science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology served as one of the judge committee members in 2011 iGEM Asian Jamboree. She also said it's a pity that her husband was not able to travel with them to Xiamen this time due to personal schedule, or he must be interested in our exhibition and proud of us.
   
Scene 2 on Aug. 26 A retired biology professor came to the exhibition hall. He did research in enzymes and cancer-treating. We noticed that he, though covered with silver hair, was still hale and hearty. He carefully viewed the panels one by one, nodding sometimes to show his agreement with the content in front of him. When we talked with him, he praised us for well organization of the exhibition. What's more, he also give us some suggestions on how to simplify and visualize obscure scientific concepts.

Circularization Program
In order to run molecular dynamic simulations of the circularized AFP, the linkers were individually fit with the scar sequence to optimize positioning to allow the terminal nitrogen and carbon groups in bond length proximity (approximately 1.3 angstroms). To save time and energy in spatially testing multiple linkers, a script was written to utilize PyRosetta’s capabilities to circularize the protein for easy visual assessment of atom positioning. This involved using the small mover method in PyRosetta to allow each movement to be checked in ‘fitting’ the linker to ensure the dihedral angles were within acceptable ranges. The script for this program can be located here.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Latex_-_-_TEXT.html," to a particular use.  However, synthetic rubber lacks the mechanical and low temperature performance of its natural counterpart.  Despite characteristic differences, both natural latex and synthetic latex rely heavily on cis-polyisoprene polymers as their primary constituent.
With global consumption of latex at over 11 million metric tons per annum, latex is an essential raw material worldwide.[11] Currently, natural rubber accounts for 40% of the global rubber demand, with the remaining 60% supplied from synthetic rubber.[12] However, the increasing price of petroleum has elevated prices in the synthetic rubber industry and consequently exacerbated the current market shortfall of natural rubbers.  Additionally, butadiene, the primary monomer used in synthetic rubber synthesis, is facing a global shortage which is increasing the cost of synthetic rubber synthesis.[13] With an increasing demand of 5-6% per annum, the global latex economy cannot be sustained by the elevating cost synthetic rubber synthesis and dependence on shrinking latex farms.[8]  For these reasons, an alternative method for latex production is desperately needed to sustain global demand and undercut material shortages.
Through our project, we sought to address the need for a faster and more economical alternative latex production system to mitigate the accumulating economic demand shortfall.  To achieve our objective, we sought to design a transgenic organism capable of mimicking the natural rubber production process found in H. brasiliensis.  Not only would a transgenic single cell organism allow for optimization of polymer synthesis, but also permit a high yield in polymer producing cells.  A scaled up cell culture bioreactor would yield large volumes of both latex (cis-polyisoprene) producing cells and cis-polyisoprene polymers with minimal growth media input.  For these reasons, we were motivated towards metabolic engineering Escherichia coli for high yield production of cis-polyisoprene compounds which could be used as a synthetic and natural latex replacement or precursor.
Our objective through this project was to enable E. coli to produce isoprene polymers (when supplied basic cell growth media and nutrients, such as glucose, magnesium, and nitrogen compounds.  Our invention must also be scalable in culture to allow for high volume production of polyisoprene compounds.  To develop the latex synthesis pathway in E. coli, we first examined the chemical constituents and the metabolic processes responsible for latex production.

3. Colony forming units (CFU) per 0.1 OD600
The        second approach is to calibrate OD600 to CFU which reflects the cell count in the sample. For this approach        only negative and positive controls were used.
The        overnight cultures of two colonies per control were diluted to        OD600=0.1        (three replications) and serial dilutions were made which then were        spreaded on agar plates. The next morning the colonies were counted        to find out the number of cells in the samples.
NC        1.1 and PC 1.2 samples  has shown relatively high and low values        respectively comparing to other samples which could indicate a        systematic error in a serial dilution step.
Conclusions
In this study cell fluorescence depends on the strength of the promotor under which GFP was expressed. However, all the cells with different devices demonstrated a reduced fluorescence per cell after 6 hours indicating a slowed down GFP production."

      ⇒ Growth and blue color indicates that there is an interaction between surface protein and the peptag.
      ⇒ to verify the interaction we will select on the peptag-plasmids and isolate them and transfer them into strep-vector (pGP172) for over expression in BL21(DE3)
      ⇒ the isolated protein is then used for in vivo studies

RMIT_Australia,2010,Team:RMIT Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," of a library of peptides for drug design and screening. Two test peptides were chosen to explore the capacity of the peptide expression platform being Losartan and arginine vasopressin. Arginine vasopressin and the angiotensin antagonist Losartan were chosen because they both had short amino acid sequences that we could design primers for.
With Taq, it is feasible that the first and last 10 amino acids of Taq may be deleted without greatly influencing the 3D structure . The first 10 amino acids are not present in the original crystal structure and both the N- and C- termini are in regions which project a putative peptide more generally away from the protein structure, with relatively few intramolecular native contacts observable in this region. To further facilitate the separation and projection of expressed peptides away from the native protein structure, a hydrophilic spacer arm was also included in the design of mutTaq at the N- and C- termini consisting of a simple GSSG motif that produces a known extended conformation of ~9.88Å .
Because Taq has a DNA sequence with an unusually rich GC content it was determine that the appropriate dNTP to generate the specific overhangs should be either dATP or dTTP as this allows a lengthy digestion by a DNA polymerase of >19 nucleotides. The generation of these sticky ends would require digestion by the polymerase into the coding region for both the N- or C- terminus of the mutTaq but also into important expression features of the vector such as the stop codon, start codon and ribosomal binding site. An NdeI restriction site (CA^TATG) was therefore designed at the start codon of mutTaq  (5’ coding region) and nucleotides for a GSSG spacer arm and AvrII restriction site (C^CTAGG) were designed at the 3’ coding region. The NdeI and AvrII restriction enzymes were considered favourable restriction enzymes to employ for process control and flexibility as they can be heat inactivated at 65ºC and 80ºC respectively, have more broad buffer compatibilities, are not sensitive to methylation (dam, dcm, CpG) and are suitable for extended digestion (e.g. >8h or overnight).

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Electrace_-_-_TEXT.html,"A biosensor is an analytical device which makes use of a biological component to detect an analyte [1]. This biological component is broadly defined and could include enzymes, nucleic acids, and antibodies. Here, we will focus on whole cell microbial biosensors. In whole cell biosensors, the biological component consists of a living cell [2]. The use of whole cell microbial biosensors has certain advantages over the use of other biosensors and non-biological sensors.
One of the major advantages of whole cell biosensors is that they are able to detect substances by class, and not only one specific substance [3]. Another advantage is that microbial biosensors can give not only analytical output (ie. what is the concentration of the analyte?) but also functional output (ie. how does my living system respond to the analyte?) [2]. In our discussion with Mr. Van Der Burg of BioDetection Systems , he mentioned in this context that with their whole cell biosensors, they stay close to the physiology of the subject to exploit this.
The biggest advantage of microbial biosensors however is the fact that evolution has already created an enormous amount of biosensors for us. Organisms sense environmental compounds to influence their decisions; they will only make a certain metabolic enzyme if the specific metabolite is sensed. Evolution has optimized such systems, thus creating bioreceptors for a lot of compounds [4]. This is used to find “new” biosensors: Mr Van Der Burg has told us that to find a dioxin bioreceptor, they  “[search] for dioxin receptors which might have arisen in species living in contaminated areas.”
The most used sensing elements are promoter regions involved in the response of the cell to the target chemical. [3] With synthetic biology techniques, it is possible to isolate and enhance this promoter region and connect them to the appropriate reporter system. Currently, the most used reporters are genes which yield an optical (colorimetric, fluorescent, bioluminescent) signal. [3] These signals are processed with the use of various microscopy set-ups.
Figure 1: Fluorescence is a typical output for microbial biosensors. This image shows fluorescent cells pictured by our team using a confocal microscope.
As already mentioned, nature has provided with a large array of possible microbial biosensors. With this as a start, a lot of whole cell biosensors have been developed.  This is illustrated by the fact that only in iGEM, hundreds of  biosensors have been developed. Also, D’Souza [4] published a list of 44 papers describing biosensors already in 2001"

Fluorescence standard curve
We observe that the values form a straight line on both linear and log scale.                       Beside, we observed water vapor on the well plate cap, this probably altered a bit the volume in the wells.
Cell measurement
   We can see that both absorbance600 and fluorescence values rise.
    The factors used to pass from the absorbance and the fluorescence values to fluorescence per OD and fluorescence per particles values are the following:
1. OD600 / Abs600 = 3.68
2. uM Fluorescein / a.u. = 1.59E-03
3. Particles / Abs600 = 7.25E+08
4. MEFL / a.u. =9.55E+09
Some values of fluorescence where too high to be computed by our machine. For those, we used the maximal value of the machine in the computations. Corresponding values are indicated by red boxes.

Raw results
As expected, the number of colonies falls with the dilutions. We chose to use the result of the dilution 4(8x10^5) to compute the concentration of CFU/ml.
Our results could be a bit distorted by the fact that there was water on the petri dishes we used as they did not dried under a hood.
The first Petri dish (on the left) was used to control potential contaminations. Nothing has grown on this plate. The left (resp. right) block of 18 plates corresponds to the culture of different dilutions of positive (resp.                   negative)                   controls: The first column represents dilution 3, the next corresponds to dilution 4 and the last column is dilution 5.
To go Further
To smoothen the functioning of the interlabs, we wish we had access to more theoretical documents to understand in more details the goal of the experiments, as well as the computation of the excel file."

The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is an undergraduate competition begun at the MIT in 2004. In four years the competition grew up exponentially from 5 teams in 2004 to 110 teams in 2009. Within the context of its participation in IGEM 09 competition, the Paris team (iGEM Paris) proposes a reflexion about ethical stakes in synthetic biology, in order to exercise our critical reflexion. Our “disciplinary” motivations to lead that ethical reflexion will be developed in a more formal introduction. We propose to wonder, in that preface, about the several “causes” of the necessity of that reflexion, mainly by wondering about the way interdisciplinarity encourages reflexivity. We wish to establish the fact that ethical reflexion is necessarily linked to a critical perspective, a point will be enlighten in the introduction.
Synthetic biology can be read as an encouragement to interdisciplinarity, as a disciplinary challenge by bringing together, in a unique life science, perspectives from engineering and practices from molecular biology. That interdisciplinarity stimulates researchers the necessity to change from their initial “disciplinary standpoint” in order to come up to synthetic biology specifications, requiring them to change position, to become alternatively insider and outsider towards their own science formation. That change sometimes permits the development of a critical perception, or, at least, makes it more attain"

BioMORTAR: 3-Part Genetic Design Suite
The 2010 Illinois iGEM Tools Team is constructing a program to design a plasmid in-silico for the user-specified host bacteria as well as model the growth of the designed cell.
The web-based program will begin by implementing the desired metabolic pathway computed by a greatly improved version of last year's project, IMPtools, then by determining the recommended enzymes for each reaction, and accessing the DNA sequence for it. In the meantime, the program will model the growth of the user specified bacteria with the new metabolic pathway to optimize the plasmid design. Finally, it will construct and display, with annotation, the advised plasmid(s) for the user as well as display important information on projected growth.
An additional function will be a program-based plasmid registry that not only allows for users to display, to others, what plasmids they hold in the lab, but it will also reference these stored plasmids to the other users looking to implement the generated plasmid design. In addition, it will have the option to adhere to the iGEM biobrick standards and will reference the biobrick database.
As a whole, the program will not only give the user the optimal plasmid design for the metabolic process, but it will project growth for the modified bacteria and connect the user with the other users storing the necessary plasmids.

MODELING
We attempt to describe, in a precise way, an understanding of the elements of a system of interest, their states, and their interactions with other elements.
Overview
We perform deterministic and stochastic mathematical modeling alongside wet lab experiments, and the calculated channel capacity values from models and experimental data fit well with each other. The ability to precisely transmit information is crucial for biological process, which is quantitatively evaluated by channel capacity, a novel concept in information theory. Structure differences of gene regulatory circuits give rise to different capacities and, in turn, different levels of information certainty and reliability. Specifically, although splitting the expressed protein into two halves that can assembly to form dimer provides more flexible functions and other regulatory benefits, it curtails the information capacity compared to expressing the undivided protein. Adding intein sequence to the two parts, however, compensated for the loss of capacity by making the association process irreversible. Simulation results tie in with data measured from synthetic gene regulatory circuits"

The nickel chromatography was not completely successful, but improved significantly after an the concentration of imidazole in the binding buffer was reduced to 5mM. The dxCas9 did not completely bind to the nickel resin and was observed in the flowthrough and wash (lane 6-8). It is recommended to further optimize the nickel chromatography to further reduce losses, and reduce contaminating proteins due to non-specific binding to the nickel resin (lane 9-10). However for our purposes, the losses were tolerated, and only elution fractions 3 to 6 were pooled (lane 11-14). Additionally, a double band for dxCas9 is observed. The purification will be continued however, we will look deeper into this observation. Is this double band due to degradation, or some other interaction with the dxcas9? We are working with technicians on performing mass spectrometry.

Engineering a Metabolic Pathway
In this simulation, colored beads were poured through each set of clear tubes.  The beads represented chemicals or molecules entering a pathway which would alter them.  The tubes represented the pathways which consisted of different genes being expressed at different levels.  The first scenario represents a properly engineered pathway where the output of both genes is similar.  This model allowed the beads to flow through the tubes with a constant pace.  Our second scenario represented what can happen when a gene in the pathway is over-expressed.  Here, the first gene was expressing at almost double what the second gene could take in.  This caused the beads to build-up in the first tube while only allowing a small amount through the rest of the pathway.  The third scenario shows a missing gene or a gene knockout situation.  This pertains to the Biodexification project in how we are identifying the necessary genes for the HMF pathway to function in E. coli.  When beads were poured through, the bottom tube did not receive any as they were not ""metabolized"" and in the correct form due to the missing gene.
Assembling a Plasmid Activity
This activity explained individual parts needed to make a functional plasmid and how they are used in the processes of transcription and translation.  The group was given an handout of definitions of each part and, with our help, were able to put each part where it belongs.
Presentation to Science-U High School Students
A major question that we were faced with this summer was what to do to continue the outreach of previous Penn State iGEM teams. Presenting to SCIENCE U was one of the results of our efforts. This presentation  was to 30 high school students about genetic engineering. ScienceU is a program through the Eberly College of Science at Penn State and the goal is to reach out to kids in the community and provide a learning opportunity for them to spark ingenuity and a passion for science. The camp that we presented at was a week long program  called ""Science Leadership Camp"" where high school kids of different ethnic backgrounds were able to come together and learn about possible career paths in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

What is PET?
PET or polyethylene terephthalate is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family. This plastic has a characteristic of undegradable by bacteria. Overproduction of this plastic may result in polluting the environment and cause a great impact for any living things that live in the environment.
Why we must degrade plastic?
As we know, plastic takes 500 or even 1000 years to degrade by process called photodegradation rather than biodegradation. Knowing this fact, it is necessary to degrade the plastic to reduce the quantity of plastic in the environment. Therefore, a brilliant, effective, and efficient degradation method is important, otherwise, the plastic itself will threatening the environment and affected the life of animal and human that lives in there.
How ColiPlasTer work?
ColiPlasTer is Escherichia coli plastic terminator. These bacteria have a capability to degrade plastic by producing an esterase enzyme that fastens plastic degradation process. This enzyme will degrade plastic to its monomer and using it as a carbon source to sustain the bacteria's life. Therefore, no pollutants produce as a result of this degradation process.

DESIGN
This year, our team continued to build upon our previous year’s project in hopes of using synthetic biology to solve the keratin waste problem, in wastewater treatment facilities and the poultry industry. It was discovered that hair build up in the pipes of wastewater treatment facilities can lead to the damaging of equipment as well as cause processes to slow down.The current method of removing waste is done manually which is problematic as it is very expensive and time consuming.
Along with the issue of hair build up in wastewater treatment plants, we are also tackling the build up of feathers within the poultry industry. Because large quantities of feathers are produced, the current disposal methods are not very effective or environmentally conscious. Our team decided to fix these issues by effectively degrading the keratin within hair and feathers while simultaneously lowering the environmental impact. In order to counteract the keratin waste issue, our team has designed two keratinase expression cassettes, for expression in E. coli K12. The first keratinase expressed in E. coli we have synthesized is keratinase A (KerA), which is an enzyme optimized for the breakdown of hair. The second keratinase that was synthesized was keratinase US (KerUS), an enzyme optimized for feather degradation.
Research
In order for our project to have a useful application we need to ensure that its implementation is more effective than current methods of keratin waste degeneration. One of the companies that we contacted for assistance with our implementation strategy was Walker Industries. Walker Industries specializes in the creation of biosolids, meaning that they create high quality fertilizer from fecal matter and hair. Geoff Boyd, the general manager informed us that our construct would serve as a better use in the wastewater treatment plant over his industry. However, he mentioned that our project could help fix minor problems and he suggested to focus on implementing our project within wastewater treatment facilities and poultry industries. As a result, we continued to look at the current disposal processes for both feathers and hair. While researching, it was discovered that there are currently four ways of dealing with keratin waste. This consists of burial of the waste, incineration on site, the removal and transporting of waste as well as the formation of new low-quality products. Once we were aware of the current methods of disposal, we began to research the"

Many organisms possess a glyoxylate shunt. This pathway, consisting of isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (ML), will split isocitrate into glyoxylate and succinate in a first step, and then convert glyoxylate together with acetyl-CoA into malate. It creates a sort of shortcut into the TCA, in which the activity of succinate dehydrogenase could be very relevant for this project as it converts succinate to reduced co-factors (FADPH2) and fumarate. We hypothesized that a synthetic glyoxylate shunt in Synechocystis , would not only reconnect the broken TCA cycle of the Δ fumC strain, but also increase the flux towards fumarate production, by feeding into reactions which produce electron carriers. This would potentially align fitness during the night and fumarate production. This is exactly the type of positive selection pressure, which could stabilize the expression of this heterologous pathway in a production strain.
Using our new iJN678 model variant, we first investigated the individual effect for each glyoxylate shunt enzyme on growth rate and fumarate production(fig. 5.2). This was done by forcing the flux through one of the reactions while the other was kept off (i.e. constrained to a flux of 0). We simulated both day (photoautotrophic) and night (chemoheterotrophic) metabolism, as well as the zwf deletion during the night. Note that the zwf deletion was not simulated in conjunction with daytime metabolism as the reactions catalyzed by zwf are not used during the day, and hence its deletion would have no effect. Moreover, due to thermodynamic constraints, the flux through MS (J MS ) was only simulated in the positive direction whereas the flux through ICL (J ICL ) was simulated in both the positive and negative directions.

For plots A and C, the y axis is growth rate (hr -1 ) and for plots B and D, the y axis is fumarate production (mmol gDW -1 hr -1 ). Three different scenarios are also shown in each graph: (green) Day, (blue) Night Δ zwf , and (purple) Night"

Recognizing the need for a differentiation strategy and focusing on the aforementioned primary and secondary activities could develop the advantages necessary for a positive blue-ocean scenario accompanied by a first-mover effect.
Possible markets and the communicative challenge
Several different food producers are of interest when considering clients who could be potential buyers. Companies such as Kraft Foods Inc., Kellogg Company and Coca-Cola Company are to be considered as prospect buyers because of their operating industry, consumer and industrial foods and their total market share. Working from this perspective of potential buyers, a greater analysis of the respective companies would be required in order to align the internal strategy of SLIM with that of the customers. When determining a possible introductory market for the SLIM product, one important factor has to be considered. Any food product with SLIM incorporated will be considered genetically modified and is therefore subject to general GMO controversy. Rules and regulations of GMO in the US are fundamentally different from those created in the EU. The US has been working progressively with the development of GMO foods including corn, potatoes, tomatoes, soybeans and squash. Especially important was the production of golden rice in 2000, because it was the first product that had its nutrition values dramatically improved by the use of genetic modifications. The communicative challenge imbedded in the release of a SLIM implemented product, has to be handled with great care when released to the public as consumer foods. The quest of maintaining a positive public reception of any given SLIM incorporated product is of paramount importance, not only for the corporation selling the product but also for the SLIM entity. The SLIM entity is completely dependent of the amount of sales generated by its clients and thereby also completely dependent on the end-user reception of the individual products. This end-user reliance stresses the importance of the SLIM entity to have its collaborative relationships tightly knit, especially in the area of sales and marketing. *http://www.dovepress.com/the-economic-impact-of-obesity-in-the-united-states-peer-reviewed-article-DMSO-MVP

1. Introduction
While genetically modified organisms (GMOs), food and feed made thereof, and the related biotechnological processes such as genetic engineering are usually criticized because of their supposed risk for human health or the environment, we should not forget about the promising breakthroughs which they have the chance to perform sooner or later, such as helping to terminate starvation in the third world, or for instance – like the project Team"

Interlab
Overview
As our team is participating in the Measurement track, we are asked to work in the Interlab Study. Interlab Study In this year, we are asked to build 3 devices. The devices are J23101 + I13504, J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504.
In our study, we constructed the 3 devices in E.coli DH5 alpha and the devices were all constructed in the pSB1C3 plasmid. We used the flow cytometer (LSRFortessa, BD) as the equipment and the data was processed by TASEB tools. TASEB tools In the Collections Page of Anderson Promoters, Collections Page of Anderson Promoters we can get the strength of the three promoters(J23101, J23106 and J23117). We had known that J23101 is the strongest and J23117 is the weakest. Our results proved this information.
Experimental Design
We used the BBa_I20270 as the positive control. The negative control is empty plasmid pET-28a. We constructed the three required devices (J23101 + I13504, J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504) by BioBricks"

Always having acute memory lost and wondering whether he has added primer, enzyme or DNA during experiment preparation. Luckily, the result usually turns out to be fine.
Bida, GU BI DA
Bida is a second year student majoring in Biology. He has participated in iGEM 2012 and is currently an advisor of iGEM 2013 HKUST. He plan to advance his study in the US after graduation
Funny random things:
I hate 0.8% gel. It's really fragile!
Cosmos, WANG YU QI
Cosmos, um, is an interesting person. You can see from his name. (Com'on, who will pick up a name like this!) He is currently studying biochemistry in HKUST, and in his year 02. It seems that life science is quite his taste, and he never never said that it was boring to memorize a lot of molecules and pathways. Never.
Funny random things:
A quote from a Dashen: ""Biochemistry is playing with water."" End quote.
Ted, SHEK CHIN HONG
Ted participated in his first iGEM competition in 2011 and has returned as an advisor to the HKUST  iGEM team for both 2012 and 2013. During his time, he was famous for using 20 agar plates a day to monitor bacterial population dynamics, and his current ambition is to create a synthetic biology trading card game to take over the world.

Fig.10    Aggregation after induction with 0.2% arabinose of A) Ag43 without FLAG (Bba_K1352000); B) Ag43+FLAG+MCS (Bba_K1352001); Ag43+FLAG+MCS(-)β-hairpins (Bba_K1352002).
A clear difference is visible between aggregation levels of tested BioBricks. Ag43 clearly aggregates when induced with arabinose. Suprisingly, Ag43+FLAG+MCS does not display aggregation properties, even though it possesses β-hairpin sequences. We hypothesize that insertion of foreign peptide sequences, in this case FLAG tag epitope, slightly changes the shape of Ag43 at places critical for clumping and disrupts velcro-like mechanism of aggregation. Ag43+FLAG+MCS(-)β-hairpins also does not display any aggregation properties. Although we cannot confirm that this is due to removal of β-hairpin sequences and not presence of a FLAG tag epitope sequence due to lack of Ag43(-)FLAG(-)β-hairpins, literature evidence provided evidence that the lack of aggregation properties is due to removal of β-hairpins and would persist if FLAG+MCS were removed (Heras et. al., 2014).
Since the lack of aggregation properties in Bba_K1352001 may be foreign peptide sequence specific, created BioBrick Bba_K1352002 which lacks β-hairpins is still a useful construct which can be utilized in a range of projects where aggregation is undesirable.
Note: Further characterization is needed in order to determine whether removal of β-hairpin sequences does not interfere with foreign peptides expression on cell surface membrane.

Collaborations
Wanting to improve last year's forum, we held a seminar together with East Chapel Hill High iGEM team and the Museum of Life and Science to discuss future outreach projects as well as how to improve our success in engaging a diversity of thoughts. Our mosquito forum from last year (see: Mosquito Forum ) primarily drew from Duke University and thus most people already came from a very scientific background. A variety of backgrounds and point of views is essential to having an engaging and meaningful forum.
We discussed with Chapel Hill and the Museum of Life and Sciences on collaborating to create forums in the future that can achieve this goal. During this seminar we examined the the incredible gap of opinion between the general public and scientist communities, and conversed about how scientific communities must create spaces to speak with and hear public opinion surrounding genetic engineering topics. We deliberated about appropriate ways to engage the public in learning about the scientific process and the research already being done with genome-editing technologies. We concluded that one of the most important goals of such public engagement is the interaction between trained scientists and laymen - this gives ""science"" a human face and allows researchers to learn from perspectives not often considered in their daily work or by their colleagues. The key structure of a forum is that it is NOT a lecture, but rather a chance for opposing sides to discuss; this enables scientists to reach out to people not accustomed to academic settings.
We also discussed price structuring to improve attendance in such public engagement forums. From what the museum found in their past experience, charging people a nominal fee encouraged a higher retention rate but saw an attendance consisting of people already knowledgeable and interested in the topic such as local scientists and graduate students. Making the event free, however, saw a dramatic drop in attendance since there was nothing to disincentivize dropping out the day of the event. What is important is to find a balance between maintaining acceptable retention of attendees but also keeping the event open to all community members. This often requires grant funding to attract a crowd diverse enough to have representative opinions (i.e. running the forum as a kind of paid study).
In a future collaborative forum run by Duke iGEM, the East Chapel Hill iGEM team, and the Museum of Life and Science there are several"

Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

Finally, the KR domain residues which have lost protons are deoxidized to the initial KR domains by other NADPHs.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
Because KR domains catalyzed reactions are involved several steps, it is inpossible for them to be match with any simple mechanism of enzyme catalyzed reactions. After the analysis of equation above, we define that these enzyme catalyzed reactions may be match with [T-C bi-bi + Ping-pong bi-bi] mechanism. In other words, KR domains catalyzed reactions may belong to Ping-pong bi-bi mechanism which include T-C bi-bi mechanism in its former half part.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
(5)DH Part
The leading role of DH Part is DH domain. The function of DH domain is dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond. In DH domain catalyzed reactions, the oxhydryls in the extended units and the hydrogen atoms binding to the neighbor carbon atoms are removed by DH domains together and form . After catalysis, α, β-enol ester bonds are formed in the polyketide chains.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is match with the mechanism of single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
(6)ER Part
The leading role of ER Part is ER domain. The function of ER domain is deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene. The mechanism of ER domain catalyzed reactions is similar to KR domain’s. In ER domain catalyzed reactions, NADPHs provide hydride ions and ER domains provide protons for the complexes and deoxidize carbon-carbon double bond to form the saturated methylene.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that the mechanism of this enzyme catalyzed reaction is similar to KR domain’s.

The level                     Ⅳ work should be verified by the State Council and approved by the safety committee of the national genetic                     engineering. [1]
        Our work belongs to level Ⅰ~Ⅲ which means that we have                     to gain the approval of the relevant administrative departments when we decide to covert the project                     into industrial manufacture. Professor Yang also suggested us paying more attention to the popularization                     of biosafety to avoid the situation that the public rejected to use because of the confusion of bacteria.
Environmental Protection Administration in Zhongshan City
        We were honor to interview the Environmental Protection Administration in                     Zhongshan City, Guangdong Province for acquiring the policy about the environmental monitoring and the                     regulations of polluted water discharge.
        The official of the administration told us that electroplating                     and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture would produce wastewater with heavy metal ions. And inspectors                     would visit the factories to take sample checking whether the discharged wastewater reached the national                     drinking water safety standards. After our introduction of the project, the official said that the public                     and the factories can use it to detect the heavy metals in the water or soil as a mean of self-monitoring.
Questionnaire
        In order to learn the public’s awareness status of heavy metal pollution,                     we conducted a survey with a total of 356 people participated in, most of whom were undergraduates over                     18 years old.
        Our questionnaire included three parts: public attention to heavy metal pollution,                     public awareness of heavy metals and the status quo and demand of heavy metal science popularization.
Public Attention to Heavy Metal Pollution
        More than half of the respondents believed that the heavy                     metal pollution in nearby district was not severe and it was necessary for the public to learn more about                     the heavy metal pollution and repair status.
Public Awareness of Heavy Metals
The Status Quo and Demand of Heavy Metal Science Popularization

A. The source of heavy metal pollution
B. The damage of heavy metals causing to human body
C. The treatment of heavy metal poisoning
D. The means to detect the heavy metal
E. The repair measures of heavy metal pollution
        More than half of the respondents believed that the local government lacked                     heavy metal pollution prevention and propaganda work, indicating that there was a great demand for relevant                     propaganda. At the same time, the"

iGEM recap
We did well, poster looked good, got a bronze medal, missed things on the wiki (they formally check the boxes), gene design wasn’t on there, no page with colabs, weakest link was wiki)
Judges liked it, didnt have a lot of questions,
Easier for HS teams to put together funding and collab with a DIY lab
Patrik wants to do an article for BioCoder about DIY labs experience with iGEM
two meetings on Sat, discussion session about new tracks at iGEM (hardware, art, etc); large discussion on costs that not only will costs NOT go down might go down and might go to weed out weaker teams, don’t have a grant writer on staff, no discount to community labs), no formal process for grants for 3rd world countries etc.
Alternative, join the Labs Program: program for labs to make biobricks and get parts $500/year - https://igem.org/Labs_Program
DIY Bio labs should set up something for themselves aimed for DIY BioLab open to anyone HS or smaller colleges, lower costs.  If a hackathon make it a week long to get something accomplished. Many different possibilities.
South American groups are forming their own iGEM alternative - Maria is contact point
For community involvement: ask Citizen Schools, which offers a lot of established tech/STEM after school programs for lower-income/minority students, to maybe start an after school DIYBio/Introduction to Synthetic Biology- that way, involving students who may never otherwise experience this exposures
Marc Juul is working with new BioBricks Foundation push, a node system for automated freezer to let labs network who has parts, opportunity for a challenge in lab automation

John Tung
We invited the manager of food and nutrition group in John Tung Foundation. She advocate that the consumers have the right to be clear to know the ingredient in the product in order to choose the thing they want, such as GM food labeling, which can ensure consumers know more information about the products. We also call on the regulations of the usage of pesticide. We hope that pesticide management can meet the same standard to the GM food regulation. Moreover, at the planting and processing stage, we also need to do some monitor on both GM and pesticide products.
Introducing iGEM to high school students
This year two of our team members went back to their high school to introduce iGEM to the TGS high school students. First, we brief them on what iGEM was; these high school students did have biology class and had a pretty good idea about what we were working on. Then everything went smoothly and we were really happy that they showed great interest in the project and the teachers were willing to lead an iGEM team next year.
Late Blight in China
Background
Our project this year is an integrated disease control on potato late blight, a disease caused by the infection of Phytophthora infestans and is one of the most devastating diseases from which the potato suffer. It causes more than 17 billion USD of losses in grain production; locally, the potato late blight results in over one billion USD of agricultural losses in our country. We have launched an investigation into the genetic varieties of potatoes, breeding of new strains, current cultivation methods and status quo, disease control on potato late blight, and economic circulation as well as government policy and legislation in mainland China.
Potato has been cultivated and bred for 14000 years and was first discovered and planted by indigenous people of South America. It was introduced to China via Silk Road in the Ming dynasty. French calls potato ""pomme de terre"", which literally means “earthen apple”; Russian calls it “the second bread”. There are more than 150 countries that plant potatoes, with total planting area more than 21.55 million hectares and the total yield over 3.2 hundred million tons. The planting area in China is about 3.5 to 4.7 million hectares, accounting for 23-33% of the planet’s surface area. The total production of potatoes in China is 60 -70 million tons, which is about 18% of the total production and is the highest in the world. Currently the production density is 15 thousand kilograms per hect"

Arteannuin will be the first commodity utilizing synthetic biology, which illustrate the potentiality of synthetic biology i.e. people could synthetise any significant chemicals even it does’t exit in the natural world via the design of cell metabolism.
3.The production of new biofuels The researchers in L9 renewable petrol company utilized synthetic biology to produce bioenergy and they receive the patent in 2008. They combine the gene from bacteria, plants and animals and design the pathway of producing fatty acid, aliphatic alcohol and aliphatic ester. Through the calculation and design the metabolism modules, they could make E.coli produce hydrocarbon compounds.
The hydrocarbon compound float on the top of the fermentor, and the bottom is the mixture of medium and water, so it would be very simple to separate and extract the product without using the high energy consumption technology rectification. Compare with the ethanol rectification technique, the new technology will lower the consumption by 65%. And the petrol produced by this way is totally renewable and clean energy and also compatible with the vehicle motor and gasoline supplies system. In sum, the abstractive modularize standardize concept of synthetic biology would impetus to the development of genetic engineering. That is I would give you want you want, all you need is your imagination.
3.The Argument and Future
With the help of synthetic biology, human are able to create a brand new life form which break the limitation of ‘living’ and ‘nonliving’. And that’s why synthetic biology cause so much controversy and consideration all around the world.
Some opponents afraid that once the artificial biosystem escape to the natural world it might lead to an ecology disaster. What’s more, some terrorist may utilize it to create super dangerous bacteria or even biology weapon target certain people. Though arteannuin is benefit for people’s health, some people argue that it would cause the farmers from Asia and Africa who earn their living by growing Artemisia annua lose their jobs. Keasling explained that ‘I know many people worry about this, and I know the reason why. Any powerful new thing means troubles. But I don’t think that rigidly adhere to past could give the answers we want in the future. And it obviously not the African who were so close to malaria say’ Stop the technology！
Synthetic biology is just at the beginning of its development, the achievement and rapid development show its incomparably feasibility and application. But due to the strong power of synthetic biology, the development of the technology must restrict by the government and academia. Especially when the"

GRNA TESTING SYSTEM
We believe in Simple & Creative
ABSTRACT
We have designed a modular gRNA testing system in order to check if the gRNA provided by the Data Processing Software works as expected on the plant variety to improve. This system works as a genetic switch that remains OFF if the gRNA does not work, and turns ON when the Cas9 does a double stranded break in the target. The device performance is based on the fact that the luciferase reporter gene is out of its reading frame. When CRISPR/Cas9 system works as expected, meaning that the gRNA is well designed, it will introduce indels in our device and the luciferase will be placed on its correct reading frame. Therefore, we will be able to detect bioluminescence with a luciferase assay.

GRNA TESTING SYSTEM
GRNA is a key element in genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 system, since it leads endonuclease Cas9 where the modification must be produced. That means gRNA must work properly in the plant variety that we want to improve.
The plant breeder could use the gRNA provided by our software directly in his plant. However, lots of plant species take a long time to grow. For example, orange trees need at least 1-2 years to exceed the first growth stage, and 3-4 years to produce the first fruits. If the gRNA didn’t work properly, the plant breeder would had lost a valuable time waiting to see a phenotypic improvement on his plant. It would take a long time just to know if the gRNA has worked"

Equipment
Equipment use is a major source of energy consumption in labs. Mindful equipment use can decrease energy consumption, preserve the quality of samples, and enhance lab safety. In this Action Area, you will find a series of best practices concerning sustainable equipment use.
#1: Close the Door!
Always make sure the doors on all of your equipment are closed securely. This includes freezers, incubators, and autoclaves. Closing the door reduces energy loss . For example, if your freezer door is open, your freezer is working hard to bring your entire lab space down to the freezer temperature. This will decrease the lifetime of your freezer by placing undue strain on it.
Moreover, keeping doors closed reduces incidence of contamination, especially in the case of incubators (think about it - they're designed to be ideal for microbial growth! So anything that happens to get in there could grow). As for freezers and refridgerators, keeping the door closed ensures that the temperature inside of the freezer does not rise too high, so that any temperature-sensitive samples (like most enzymes) are secure. A little bit of extra time to make sure the door closes properly can conserve energy and keep your valuable samples safe .
#2: Turn Off Devices
According to a study from the Kirschner lab at Harvard Medical School, turning off benchtop devices overnight and when they're not in use can save up to 50% of the energy used by these devices . [ 1 ] Such devices include gel boxes, tabletop microcentrifuges, and thermocyclers.
Turning off devices when not in use will also preserve the lifetime of the device, which saves money in the long run and decreases down time with broken devices . Take a little time to turn off your devices before you leave the lab! It's a good habit to get into and will save you time and money.
#3: Schedule Regular Maintenance
Keeping a regular maintenance schedule for your devices can prolong the operational lifetime and minimize energy consumption by keeping the device running efficiently.  Freezers and refridgerators especially have filters and compressors that need to be regularly cleaned and maintained. Usually, a good rule of thumb is to schedule maintenance once a month .
#4: Regularly Defrost Your Freezers"

The plastics must be able to withstand the heat from an autoclave in order to be sterilized, they cannot be used to hold liquids, and they must be able to withstand certain amounts of force. With these guidelines, we wanted to start by creating equipment that would not be subject to these risks. Before attempting to design and print everything on our list, we started off by designing a gel comb. Using PLA plastic, we created our first piece of lab equipment for trial. After successful results, we continued to pursue other designs such as different sized gel combs, test tube racks, and microcentrifuge tube holders.
One of our team members with 3D modelling experience ran a quick workshop on how to use CAD software for other team members to attend. As the Student version of AutoCAD was free to download, it fits really well with our goal of accessibility.  Learning how to use AutoCAD under the tutelage of a peer was a fun activity and helped the team grow together, while also learning a new skill. While working in a spatial simulated environment poses its challenges, it becomes relatively easy to use after some practice. Even without an in-house expert, there are many free tutorials available online.
After a couple hours of work together, the ability to perform basic operations and the knowledge of some useful tricks were gained. Further hours of individual practice allowed for the creation of quality schematics. This knowledge was used by the team members to produce gel combs of varying sizes and dimensions, as well as experimental test tube rack designs, and assist with other designs used in the collection.
To determine quality, we ran performance testing on the plastics. We tested the gel combs under the criteria of: well quality, well consistency, and comb deterioration. In comparison to commercial grade gel combs, our 3D printed versions performed equally as well, and have been used over a dozen times without and signs of wear and tear. In terms of strength, PLA plastic has a tensile strength of ~65 MPa and ABS has a tensile strength of ~38 MPa. Both values are subject to printer settings such as infill, shell thickness, layer height, and print speed. It was determined that the type of plastic we were using could not withstand the heat from an autoclave or from a bunsen burner.

Edinburgh,2008,Team:Edinburgh#Notebook#Project summary#01 July 2008_-_-_TEXT.html," AMP (cAMP). cAMP associates with the cAMP receptor protein (CRP, also known as the cAMP activator protein, CAP). CRP¿cAMP can then associate with the CRP binding site upstream of the target gene promoter. CRP¿cAMP then interacts with RNA polymerase, resulting in transcription of the gene.
Some examples of genes controlled in such a way are the rpoH(¿32, the heat-shock ¿-factor), the sdhCDAB operon and the genes of the CAP regulon. The best characterised system seems to be the lac operon (part of the CAP regulon).
The lacoperon has its CRP binding site at -70 -> -55, where CRP¿cAMP binds as a dimer and interacts with the C-terminal domain of the ¿-subunit of the RNA Polymerase. We could take this sequence and add it to the same position upstream of the promoter of an artificial cellulase operon.
There are a couple of other things to think about though:
The lac operon has its activity repressed by the LacIrepressor, which binds to the operator, preventing the polymerase from binding to the promoter. Allolactose (an analogue of lactose) displacesLacI. - What this shows is that we do not want to copy the operator!  Other catabolite-sensitive promoters bind CRP¿cAMP in two locations, as two dimers. This could potentially be better for us. Needing 2 dimers to bind would make initiation of the transcription less sensitive.  Searching EcoCycfor CRP¿cAMP transcriptional dual regulator regulated genes gives some 200 results. I propose that we want a gene whose activity is only controlled by CRP¿cAMP, of which there appear to be five. The best candidate out of these seems to be cstA, the gene for a peptide transporter induced by carbon starvation. The CRP¿cAMP transcriptional dual regulator is located at -89.5 from the transcription start site.
This gives the sequences:

This protein is one of the two Cas proteins responsible for new DNA spacer acquisition in the bacteria's CRISPR locus. This action is done by a protein complex hexamere made up of 4 Cas1 proteins and 2 Cas2 proteins. It has been shown that these proteins are commonly conserved across the major types of CRISPR-Cas systems. To properly use Cas1 protein it should be expressed along with Cas2 protein and a PAM sequence found in the msDNA in the system design for spacer acquisition. The Cas1 protein gene contained in this part expresses the protein with a tag sequence (FLAG) for further identification and purification.

This basic part consists of an optimized NsrR protein gene, which acts as a repressor of PyeaR promoter and is inhibited by the nitrate ion. E. coli natively produces a certain amount of NsrR. As such, the overexpression of NsrR can reduce any basal expression of GFP expressed by the PyeaR construct BBa_K381001 that may not be silenced by native NsrR. With a PyeaR reporter construct, the NsrR can be used to determine the presence of nitrate ion without any leaking.

ColumbiaU_NYC,2016,Team:ColumbiaU NYC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," once again showed sparser colonies      for S. epidermidis with higher concentrations of      Rhamnolipids. We decided that designing a quantitative      experiment with a 96-well plate, instead of just relying      on qualitative experimentation was necessary.
7/17-7/23
Metabolics Troubleshooting
Given the low yield of rhamnolipids from the successfully      cloned promoters of our promoter library, alternative      promoters were explored to possibly boost production.      Experiments were planned to more closely replicate the      Wittgen paper by extracting the RhlAB operon with its      natural promoter by PCRing out the operon along with 200      extra bps upstream.  Cloning this new operon had limited      success and rather than repeating experiments it was      deemed less relevant.  More priority has been placed on      designing/extracting the Xylose inducible promoter given      that it might be viable for usage in Staph epidermidis as      well.
Promoter Characterization
Most of the higher strength promoters have been unreliable      in terms of transformation and rhamnolipid production.  It      is speculated that the issue with this lies in that they      are constitutively triggering the RhlA gene to make the      rhamnolipid precursor HAA while the RhlB is only active      during the stationary phase.  Buildup of HAA might be      causing the bacteria to view the operon as impeding      survivability and in some way shut it down.  This could be      solved using the Xylose inducible promoters so that the      buildup of HAA is prevented and high levels of      rhamnolipids would be produced upon induction in the      stationary phase.
Keratinocyte Experiments
Keratinocytes were treated with different MOIs of bacteria      strains Putida, Arginosa, Mutant, and Putida with      Rhamnolipid to determine the relationship between      bacterial concentration and cell viability. The cells were      treated with gentamicin after 3 or 24 hours and then an      MTS assay was utilized to quantify cell viability. The      cells were then plated to deduce if bacteria had been      drawn in by the cells. The results showed that there was      not a significant difference in the bacterial      concentrations, which may indicate that the serial      dilutions were incorrect. Additionally, there was a high      degree of bacterial growth on the plates, which was not      expected. Perhaps, the gentamicin did not kill the     "

To insert VMA into 601 site of T7 RNAP, Zhuo Pan transformed the ordered plasmid pUC-VMA into Top 10 cells, then he extracted the plasmid for PCR. Two PCR were down to get VMA fragment and VMADEAD fragment. Zhuo Pan extracted plasmid that loaded T7 RNAP gene, splited T7 RNAP gene by PCR at 601 site. Gibson was down to assemble N-terminal of T7 RNAP gene, C-terminal and VMA or VMADEAD. We did PCR identification of the product of Gibson, the Agarose gel electrophoresis shows bands at 2.7 K which stands for intact T7 RNAP gene. The experiment was failed.
Xihan Zhang extracted I0500, I13504, and J04450. Jinyang Liang digested I0500 with EcoRI and SpeI, I13504 with XbaI and PstI, J04450 with EcoRI and PstI. Ligation was down after gel extraction. Xihan Zhang transformed the products into DH10B competent cells. Xihan Zhang did PCR identification. The electrophoresis shows that there are no bands when using primers VF2 and VR. However, there are target bands when using the primers designed by ourselves. It’s indicate that there are multi-sites binding exits.
Xihan Zhang and Jinyang Liang repeated the ligation and transformation. They use two pairs of primers to identify the ligation, the first pair is seg2-F and VR, the second pair is VF2 and seg2-R.
The electrophoresis shows there are target bands above 2000bp. The corresponding bacterium was inoculated to LB liquid medium containing arabinose and it fluoresced !

Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) From several references Ruipeng Wei concluded a theoretical formula fit for the temperature distribution calculation with stochastic movement. We did another more simulationand finally got a good result. From that we could conclude that ftnA is possible to heat the whole cell. Ruipeng Wei also did the sensitivity analysis of the ftnA’s deterministic model to find out every parameter’s importance of the model.
(Device Part)For a better view of bacteria attraction experiment, Xihan zhang designed a device made of acrylic plate whose core is a six well plate struck by six magnets. She called it"

Europe Regional Jamboree
We flew out to Amsterdam on the weekend of the 1st and 2nd of October. Even though nervosity about having to deliver a great presentation and poster started to run high, we enjoyed the opportunity to meet other iGEM teams from all over Europe (and Africa!).

Pre-Jamboree
There was still a lot of work to be done on our presentation, so after a nice lunch we locked ourselves into our hotel room while we worked. Chris and Nikki rehearsed what they were planning to say, while the others improved the PowerPoint slides. Rebekka had been invited to take part in the Meeting of Young Minds event that evening, so she set about researching the issues that were likely to be discussed. Meanwhile, Frank was sent out to explore Amsterdam to find a set of batteries for the temperamental laser pointer.
In the late afternoon, we headed off to register at the Jamboree. This was a fantastic opportunity to show off our embroidered polo shirts, as well as meeting some of the other teams. Frank had booked us a practice room, so naturally we jumped at the chance to rehearse in an area that gave Chris and Nikki some space to stand up.
After we'd eaten, the guys who were working on the presentation retired to the lock-in at the hotel, while the rest of us went to show Rebekka our support at the Meeting of Young Minds event.

Dox concentration serves as the input to our system and navigates the quantitative properties involved in dimerization.
Cellular Information Inference
Sense the environment, or die. The intricate world is full of chaotic information, knowledge of whom are vital for survival. But all that the cell “knows”is the concentrations of downstream products. It has to infer the right input and try to eliminate the uncertainty caused by noise.
For each level of input, the cell exhibits a specific probability output distribution. If the distributions are overlapped too seriously, the cell will have difficulty guessing the right answer. Thus the circuit is prone to error, its ability to accurately transmit information low.
Traditionally, we evaluate the impacts of noise using variance-related statistics, such as coefficient of variance. These quantities can only describe how concentrated the output is around the mean value, but cannot tell us how well we can infer one of the correlated random variables from the other. Channel capacity makes a better criteria of noise because it more scientifically depicts the information dissemination process.

Experiments:
We transfect HEK-293 human cells with our plasmid constructions as described in the form. Different concentrations of Dox are applied to cell culture at the same time.
Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state. FACS examination measures florescent intensity emitted by each cell, from which we obtain a large sample of florescent protein expression level, tens of thousands of cells for each experiment group.
Data collected from flow cytometry are later analyzed on computers. We estimated probability density function (p.d.f.) from data using kernel density estimation, a nonparametric statistics method. Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below.
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate"
