Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh,"

Method
We developed a tool which judges the stability of gene expression loop mathematically using a parameter set mentioned in “method” paragraph in Chapter 1. We conducted this analysis referring to these papers including similar analysis.

We excluded the fluorescent proteins and mRNA encoding them from this analysis, because they do not affect the stability of the expression loop of sigma factor and anti-sigma factors. Arabinose whose concentration declines over time is also excluded. For, if arabinose is included into vector X, there become no fixed points. Vector X and fixed points are mentioned below paragraphs.
We put concentration of sigma-factor A, B, C, anti-sigma factor A, B, C, mRNA encoding sigma-factor A, B, C (without toehold switch), mRNA encoding sigma-factor A, B, C (with toehold switch), mRNA encoding  anti-sigma factor A, B, C as x1, x2, ...., x16, respectively. And we defined vector X = (x1, x2, …, x16). This vector X represents a state of a cell. If X represents a state of a cell which is at the start of cell cycle, the state of the cell three cell cycles later can be represented as P(X). P(X) is a function whose input is X. In other words, E. coli in X state changes into P(X) state after three cell division.
It is existence of X which satisfies two conditions simultaneously that stable establishment of expression loop requires. First one is $P(X) - X =0$ (condition A), and the second one is eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of $P(X) - X$, or $\frac{\partial (P - X)}{\partial X}$(16*16 square matrix) are all negative (condition B). Condition A means the state of E. coli does not change after three generations and it is a necessary condition for gene expression loop of three generations. Xs satisfying condition A are called fixed points. While"

Stakeholder-value analysis
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.
▲
Introduction
As we wanted to improve our project for the people who would be working, handling or get in contact                       with our product, we performed a stakeholder-value analysis. This analysis was inspired by the iGEM'ers Guide to the Future .                       We started with a brainstorm session during which we settled on the relevant stakeholders and values.                       This gave us a good overview of who we wanted to talk to and what we wanted to discuss with them.                       Inspired by interactions with stakeholders and readings, team members filled the matrix with post-it                       notes over the course of the summer. Afterwards, we analyzed the findings. We will shortly discuss                       the most important beneficial aspects of our project to the stakeholders and the main problems to                       overcome in the stakeholders’ interests.

Uppsala,2013,Team:Uppsala#reporter-genes_-_-_TEXT.html," a picture of one of our chromo proteins and RBS fused together with two of our synthetic promoters, CP11 and CP29 . These promoters have been characterised and has been shown to work both in E. coli and Lactobacillus. We wanted to see if our chromoproteins could work as visual reporters. The construct has been shown to work fine with our shuttle vector in E. coli as can clearly be seen in the picture below with blue bacterial colonies. We have however not yet been able to transform it into Lactobacillus. Below in the picture is a plate with our shuttle vector BBa_K1033206 containing the chromoprotein amilCP fused with the synthetic promoter CP29 from our promoter collection.

1. Test PCR with VF/R amd post-elution primers
Test 20x and 23x cycles for VF/R and post-elution primers.
Made new working 10 uM post-elution primers
Set up 2x 25 uL reactions for each using same protocol as 5/19/2015 but with the following modifications.
Tested 23x and 20x cycles.
2. Results
Cast a 2% TAE agarose gel to visualize results. Used NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Test amplification with biobrick sequencing primers (VF/R) and post-elution primers (P/E). The expected product for VF/R is 443 bp. The expected product for P/E is 170 bp.
The post-elution primers were made from stock prior to this PCR, which means that the previous post-elution amplification was unsuccessful due to bad primers.
The presence of a smear above the product bands is probably due to non-specific amplification. We should use fewer cycles. Along with results from 5/19/2015 , which showed that 17 cycles was not quite complete, we will use 18 cycles for future amplifications."

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," biological system depending on the presence of inducers to give usage guidelines for its industrialization.
However...
We are working in a Bacillus subtilis strain and some parameters such as XylR values on binding/unbinding kinetics to both inducer and promoter or production rate from Pxyl promoter cannot be found in the literature and most of the existing values come from an E. coli strain rather than B. subtilis.  Furthermore, we are finishing the biological system construction and its characterization is on the way. Parameters will be measured very soon.
Because of this lack of information, we will create a theoretical model in order to characterize the global behavior of the system.
Moreover, as we are mainly biologists in the team, we thought it could be interesting to explain how we can easily obtain a mathematical model from a biological system.
Biological modelling for dummies !
Basic knowledge
We want to transform the biological system into mathematical equations in order to be able to determine the quantity of inducers (input) needed to obtain a particular behavior (output).

there will be the STICK or COAT option depending on the inducers concentration
Ordinary differential equation (ODE)
mathematical equation;
format:
explanation: used in biology and physics to represent the growth or evolution of a quantity dx (i.e. population or concentration) proportional to the population size/effective concentration x during a period of time t;
x is called a variable.
Elements of the model
First list of variables
We want to have the concentration of LacI and XylR as outputs depending of the inducers concentrations input. We know that the repressors can bind either to their promoter (Plac and Pxyl respectively) or to their inducer (IPTG and xylose). Thus, first of all, we have the following variables in the system:
Figure 4: The model variables at first glimpse
Binding and unbinding kinetics
We decided to analyze the relation between repressors, promoters and inducers depending on the law of mass action. It is a branch of chemical kinetics, which states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances. These substances will bind with an association kinetic k and unbind with a dissociation kinetic km.
Binding and unbinding kinetic
Figure 5: Binding and unbinding kinetics in the model
It is working either for LacI binding to its Plac promoter than for XylR to Pxyl and also the inducers and LacI and XylR. This binding creates a new complex.

After consulting with graduate students and advisors we tried to PCR amplify the CesA ! promoter using different annealing temperatures, concentrations, polymerases, and elongation times. After 12 unsuccessful attempts and two weeks of troubleshooting, we had our first successful band.
June 30-July 13
Gel extraction of successful band and PCR amplified again for better quality and higher concentrations. Moved into PCR amplification of CesA 4, CesA 7, and CesA 8 from the genomic DNA. Just as with the promoter, we encountered many problems and did not have a successful band with genomic DNA. cDNA had been ordered and arrived at the end of the week.
July 14-20
After cDNA arrived, we attempted to PCR amplify CesA 7 and CesA 8 as CesA 4 was backordered. It was successful after many failed attempts.

Pour le traitement contre le cancer, les médicaments agissent comme des inhibiteurs de la mitose. La sélectivité toxique des cytotoxiques est liée pour l'essentiel à l'intense activité mitotique des cellules cancéreuses qui fait de celles-ci une cible statistiquement préférentielle. La sélectivité est une notion importante à la connaissance du médicament. En effet, aucun médicament n’est réellement spécifique. Ainsi les tissus normaux à renouvellement cellulaire rapide sont eux aussi, fréquemment lésés : épithéliums, phanères, moelle osseuse, et gonades.
Il est indispensable de bien caractériser un médicament. On étudie alors plusieurs paramètres comme la biodisponibilité et la vitesse de résorption du médicament. La biodisponibilité d’un médicament peut être incomplète à cause de différents phénomènes comme les caractéristiques physico-chimiques des médicaments ou l’effet du premier passage intestinal, hépatique ou pulmonaire.
La vitesse à laquelle le médicament est résorbé est également un paramètre important pour toutes les voies d’administration autres que la voie intra-veineuse. Le délai  avant l’observation des premiers effets (thérapeutiques ou indésirables) du médicament dépend aussi de cette vitesse. De plus, l’existence d’un rythme biologique est souvent négligée lors de l’évaluation de leur résorption. Pourtant, les propriétés pharmacologiques des médicaments sont étroitement liées au phénomène de temporalité du médicament. Plusieurs notions complémentaires et importantes doivent être envisagées : celle de vitesse de résorption, et de seuil de toxicité.
Les problèmes majeurs que rencontrent ces thérapies sont les variabilités inter-patients dans les réactions aux médicaments qui deviennent une difficulté conséquente à la fois au niveau de la recherche pharmaceutique et au niveau médical.

BBa_K2374005—TH-GAL4
We use the specific promoter pleP (TH Promoter) to control the fixed expression of GAL4, because of the specificity of pleP, GAL4 express in tissue which express dopamine specifically. Then GAL4 binds to the upstream activation sequence (UAS) containing varying numbers of a 17-mer repeat. GAL4 binds to DNA as a dimer through a Zn(2)-Cys(6) zinc finger, and directly interacts with the Tra1 component of the SAGA complex, recruiting Mediator and the general transcriptional machinery to initiate transcription.
BBa_K2374006—TH-GAL80ts
A dimer of GAL80 binds to the C-terminal ends of the GAL4 dimer so that, while it can still bind to a UAS sequence, it can no longer activate transcription. This interaction of GAL4 and GAL80 can be taken advantage of to reﬁne the expression pattern of GAL4-dependent transgenes.
We use the specific promoter pleP (TH Promoter) to control the fixed expression of GAL80ts, because of the specificity of pleP, GAL80ts express in tissue which express dopamine specifically. At 25℃, GAL4 and GAL80ts express, GAL80tsp conbine with GAL4p then stop it to bind to UAS, so the TH do not express.At 29℃, GAL80ts is inactivated, which cannot combine with GAL4p, so GAL4p binds to UAS and starts the expression of TH, leading to the high expression of dopamine.

This functional part is classified as “Reporter” in the parts registry     database. It is very clear that this part fits the same description     as Protein Generator in Biobrick part registry standards. Although,     this part has specific and known functional role, characterizing this     part as a reporter is unnecessary and contributes to the level of complexity     of information provided. Instead, we suggest that this part should be     classified as “protein generator” and related detailed information about     the specific function of this part, should be provided in the part information     page.
In conclusion, as mentioned above we tried to reorganize and normalize     the information about parts which is provided in part registry for 2010     in order to develop our algorithm for the BioGuide application. During     this process, we encountered some inconsistencies and misuses of the     terminology being used and also inadequacies about the information provided     about parts. First of all, we claim that a standard nomenclature should     be constituted for future use in the field of synthetic biology. Based     on the information gathered according to new nomenclature a professional     database should be constructed to address the needs of synthetic biology.     This will enable easy information exchange and exhibition globally.     Secondly, although there are enough information about parts exists on     parts registry database, the information which is provided for parts     need to be ordered urgently. Furthermore, there should be new experimental     standards which must be introduced to groups in the part submission     process for the subtitle “working condition”. These experimental standards     will be important because the experimental details about parts are not     satisfying the needs of wet-lab biologists for the design and the construction     of new Biobricks.

Hence, a remote-control mobile application with these this very quality was developed, thus making ChatterPlant less dependant on direct human action. ChatterApp lends a user-friendly and accessible way to be notified about current status of our cultivated plants and to control environmental and genetic growth conditions.
EVALUATING CHATTERPLANT EVOLUTION
Finally, ChatterPlant was comprehensively developed and built around all the information obtained on meetings, surveys and interviews from our previous analysis. SynBio, Hardware and Software tools were defined according to this information. That’s time to see how our project could be implemented in society and urban environment.
CHATTERPLANT PILOT PROJECT
AN INTEGRATED APPROACH FOR SOCIAL IMPLEMENTATION
When taking on a task as complex as bringing about societal change, its is more effective to take a step-by-step approach as opposed to an all at once radical change. Often times, distant social agents are the ones who drive the normalization of the idea, acting as spearheads of the concepts and allowing the idea to develop.
Bearing that in mind, an exhaustive adoption study was performed following an experimental pilot project. A pilot study is a small scale study conducted before the main study to integrate and normalize cutting-edge ideas into society following a step-by-step strategy.
In the midst of researching paradigms of well-established societies that were open to change, architect Eva Kail became of particular interest. Kail was able to make Vienna, Austria a city where gender mainstreaming, the consideration of gender perspective in the in the creation of policy, was taken seriously and applied to every urban space in the city. Eva Kail, Chief Executive Officer of the city of Vienna and one of the most specialized architects in urbanism.
After interviewing her, a complete pilot project was designed in order to standardized the consumption of GMOs in regular diet through ChatterPlant technology.
PILOT PROJECT DESIGN
After reaching out, Kail explained her successful strategy for addressing the issue and gave advice as to how her approach to the concern can be applied on the topic of transgenic plant acceptance. Based on this notion, the pilot project created to gain society’s acceptance toward transgenic plants follows the step-by-step technique.

Human Practices
Usually an iGEM project mainly focuses on the lab work. We wanted to expand this view by                 investigating how our project might impact the economics of land grabbing by making                 use of the production of terpenoid-derived bioproducts. This resulted in a report, which outlines                 different aspects of land grabbing, such as population growth, prices for food commodities                 on a global scale, political and social influences and how an industrial-scale production of                 biofuels derived from artificial endosymbiosis could change either of these aspects towards a                 biobased production instead of land grabbing for resource generation.
In order to enable a scientific exchange between different iGEM teams, we also hosted the ‘iGEM meets Marburg’ meetup for the second time. Taking place in the beginning of august,                 we were able to welcome all German iGEM teams as well as the team from the SDU Denmark for an                 amazing weekend full of different activities and great discussions.
Because we also wanted to reach out to the general public, we had the opportunity to give several                 talks to different audiences, for example a group of American exchange students or during the junior                 GBM meeting in Marburg. Besides this, we were hosting the booth for Synmikro, the Institute for Synthetic                 Microbiology at the University of Marburg, at the Hessentag 2016, an annual fair of the state of                 Hesse. Here we had the possibility to reach out to a vast majority of society and discuss with them the                 goals, methods and possible threats of Synthetic Biology.

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.

Leicester,2012,Team:Leicester#July2012_-_-_TEXT.html," what the degradation would look like over a period of time that exceeds the running time of our project. The new plates consist of a very small amount of agar so that when this carbon source runs out they switch to the expanded polystyrene which we have melted with acetone to produce a molten polystyrene suspended in the acetone. To maintain the liquid state of the polystyrene we will use the orbital shaker provided by Heathrow scientific for which the team is very grateful. The polystyrene sludge is then placed as a layer in the glass petri dish with a thin layer of agar on and around the polystyrene to start the growth of the bacteria, but will quickly be used up on top of the polystyrene, and will support and outside colonies that spread past the edge of the polystyrene.
(14:30 pm) If this doesn't work for some reason, members of the group are testing out the dissolving power of other solvents on polystyrene. 50%, 66% and 75% Acetone (diluted with still water) had no effect on the polystyrene. Pure methanol was the next target, but this also had no effect on the polystyrene.
    Friday 13th July 2012
(10:00 am) The polystyrene test dish is ready and has solidified so it can be plated when we have grown some bacteria to see if it works as a medium.
(12:00 pm) On further analysis the original plan of a agar and layer of polystyrene covering it has proved ineffective as the polystyrene just formed a thick solid in the centre. However, the team had another idea yesterday. The idea is to attempt to crush the Polystyrene 'sugar' (unexpanded polystyrene beads) using either a pestle and mortar or toughened glass beads. Then the crushed 'sugar' can be suspended in minimal medium, creating a cloudy media, where hopefully claer ""haloes"" will form around specific colonies when polystyrene degrading bacteria are present. It is important to only use a low concentration of the the crushed 'sugar' as too much will mean that the halos won't form due to the slow degradation by these bacteria.
(15:00 pm) The grinding of polystyrene begins, but the process is very slow. The pestle and mortar was producing minimal results so the team switched to the grinder machine mixing our 'sugar' with glass"

Finally, we tested targeted integration of the adapters by PCR of the obtained cleaved fragments and subsequent gel electrophoresis. Additionally, we developed an in vivo screening platform to evaluate the effectivity and efficiency of the fusion protein. The fusion protein was guided with a lacZ sgRNA carrying kanamycin resistance donor DNA, allowing us to perform a dual screen: blue/white colony screening and kanamycin resistance screening. A scheme of this work pipeline is depicted in figure 6.
Figure 6. Design, construction, purification and functionality tests of fusion protein dxCas9-Tn5.
3.1 Background Information
The fusion protein consists of a catalytically inactive version of xCas9 (dxCas9, BBa_K2643001 ), fused to a hyperactive transposase (Tn5, BBa_K2643002 ) via a short linker ( BBa_K2643003 ) of 18 amino acids and cloned into the pACYCDuet-1 vector.
dxCas9
We chose to work with the newly evolved Cas9 variant to guide the fusion protein to a specific DNA sequence. This variant is derived from the common Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). The benefit of the xCas9 variant is that it has the broadest known Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence including NG, GAA and GAT, and a greater DNA specificity compared to SpCas9, resulting in significantly lower off-target activity ( Hu et al, 2018 ). The catalytically dead version of xCas9 (dxCas9) is thus an excellent choice for the component responsible for guiding the fusion to a specific DNA sequence. The variant was evolved in 2018 by phage assisted continuous evolution and has 6 point mutations (amino acids E480K, E543D, E1219V, A262T, S409I and M694I) ( Hu et al, 2018 ).
Tn5
We selected to work with the hyperactive Tn5 transposase variant to integrate in a double strand DNA two small DNA molecules (adapters) compatible with Nanopore sequencing. The hyperactive Tn5 is a modified variant of the wild type Tn5 isolated from E. coli containing two mutations (E54K and L372P) responsible for increasing the activity of Tn5 ( Picelli et al, 2018 ). This variant is an excellent choice for the component responsible for integrating the adapter sequences. This protein forms a d"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," number of patients considered our project with caution, some of them clearly thought that we already achieved it. The hype discourse creates excessive promises that lead to unreasonable expectations. And of course the results are unsatisfying and people become sceptic: it is clear that some of the patients we asked will be disappointed by our results even if they are the best we could possibly wish. But finally who is to blame for the mistrust to which biotechnologies are confronted?
In conclusion, it seems that most of the main philosophical critics of modern technique could be addressed to the iGEM competition: this competition promotes the technique for itself, objectives are only means to advertise the potentiality of synthetic biology, communication strategies are a crucial aspect both inside the competition and outside, thus encouraging excessive promises. To sum up, in iGEM the means justify the end, or rephrased: the goal of iGEM is synthetic biology itself.
Nonetheless, we have to remember that the iGEM competition is only a student competition: none of the genetically engineered biological machines will directly be used. This is an important point to stress: iGEM teams are not in real research conditions. Is it to say that they could then do what they want with no restriction? Of course not. As all the teams are part of society, what they are doing as students has an impact on the public perception of synthetic biology, and moreover during the iGEM competition students learn a specific scientific and technical culture that will probably matter in their professional life.
Thus in the following part we decided to discuss about this technical culture that student learn during the iGEM competition.
II. Creating a Technical Culture to Enhance Responsibility.
“Technical culture” is a specific concept of Gilbert Simondon. Technical culture means more than technical competency or technical knowledge. “Culture” must keep a strong meaning: our culture partakes of who we are. So Simondon considers that we can have a technical culture without being technicians, engineers or scientists, as we can have an artistic culture or scientific culture. We could formulate the difference introduced by the technical culture as this: without it we consume technical objects or technical functions, with it we cooperate with technique.
Philosophers' quotes
“We should like to show that culture fails to take into account that there is a human reality in technical reality and that, if it is to fully play its role, culture must come to incorporate technical entities into its body of knowledge and its sense of values. Recognition of the modes of existence of technical objects should be the result of philosophical thought, which in this respect has to achieve what it analogous to the"

- Overnight inoculations: the DH5a inoculations of pBAD with control and PUF eYFP both grew. However, both of the BL21 inoculations didn't grow at all.
- The replates of the YFP constructs didn't grow at all. So retransformed BL21 with WT PUF + control eYFP and WT PUF + PUF eYFP.
- Also retransformed DH5a with pBAD that had both control and PUF eYFP as well as the same in ptet.
- Digested the PSB1C3 culture made 6/27/12.
- Digested the PSB1C3, then ran a gel of the 3 total PUF PCR samples and 2 PSB1C3 miniprepped sample. Both PSB1C3 showed two bands, which was not expected (one at about 2kb and one a 1kb).
- Will have to run a control uncut PBSB1C3 with digested PSB1C3 to check what the problem is, could be that the strain used for inoculation had an insert in it.
- The PUF PCR digests looked about right.
- Gel extracted all 3 PUF PCR samples and the one band from the PSB1C3 that was at the right size.
- Started an overnight culture of PSB1C3.
6/29/2012
- Today more M9 media was made as we were unaware that it is not suppose to be autoclaved.
- Did a miniprep of pSB1C3
- None of the eYFP constructs in DH5a grew.
- Conclude that neither the control eYFP of the PUF eYFP constructs were properly ligated within either pBAD or ptet.
- While the retransformations of BL21 grew some odd looking colonies, it is almost certain that they only contain the WT PUF plasmid and not a correct eYFP plasmid.
- Attempt a second ligation, used same old digest (because the bands on that were correct).
- Ran the ligation overnight.
- Inoculated the successful but weird looking and dubious BL21 plates.
Week 6 Notes
7/2/2012
- Over the weekend: checked inoculations and had no growth on the control eYFP, so reinoculated it. It proceded to fail again.
- Ran a 24 hour ligation of pBAD/ptet YFP constructs"

Getting a knowledge injection
While building our constructs, we thought about taking our project a step further meaning to develop and establish a new therapy method using our gene constructs. For this, we took into account on how to get our construct into the relevant cells and light to the targeted tumor cells . Those questions were fundamental for the future application and implementation in humans.
But there are way more steps to consider before being able to get an admission for a therapy and actually applying it in clinical practice. There are several federal agencies which control the admission of medicaments such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices located in Bonn , Germany and the Paul- Ehrlich- Institute in Langen , Germany. Their job is to control the active substances as well as all other components of the therapy regarding certain keypoints of the guideline of The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.
Some of the most important points a medicament has to fulfill are efficacy, safety, quality and multiefficency. Furthermore they  the federal agencies act as scientific advisors in the process of a medicament’s development. We contacted them both and luckily we were allowed to visit the Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices and also had a phone meeting with experts of the Paul- Ehrlich- Institute. They gave us a lot of input which we were able to integrate into our project.
It takes about ten to fifteen years to develop a medicament and only one out of 10000 substances finally makes it to the market. Before being allowed to test the active substance it has to undergo certain analysis such as testing for carcinogenicity, single dose as well as repeated dose toxicity, toxicokinetics, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance and tests in juvenile animals. This preclinical phase lasts about four to six years and includes the previously described and standardized tests as well as animal testing.  But even if the medicament makes it to the next phase, the non- clinical phase still goes on and different analysis are made.
After this stage either the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices or the Paul- Ehrlich Institute decides whether the medicament fulfills all necessary criteria to get an admission for clinical studies. Furthermore there are different committees which decide whether clinical studies are authorized, for example the ethical committee at the Heinrich- Heine- University, Duesseldorf.
The clinical phase itself consists of three different sub- phases. First the medicament is tested within a group of about 20 healthy patients who have to be volunteers. To enlighten them and keep them informed is one major task. It is very important"
IIT_Kharagpur,2015,Team:IIT Kharagpur#blog_-_-_TEXT.html," important consideration for the assessment of their toxicological status and may facilitate their   use in food as preservatives and hence pave way for the application of novel food preservation   techniques. (Rai, 2011) Recent  modern  applications  of  microbiology  in  food  spoilage  have  caused  much  buzz  in   academic world. The discovery of novel biochemical pathways and subsequent development of   their  applications  is  increasingly  bringing  up  new  perspective  to  combat  the  intimidating   challenge  of  food  security.  Though  the  general  masses  at  large  is  still  oblivious  to  role  of   microbiota  in  their  dietary  habits.  Fermentation  helps  in  making  bread  and  pasteurization  is   enough to purify milk is the saturation of public’s knowledge about food spoilage. A systematic   campaign to spread awareness at grass root level would boost public’s interest in food spoilage   beyond their monthly budget into the spectrum of global challenge of food security. That would   hopefully  lead  to  more  developed  industrial  base  providing  cheap  protection  against  food   spoilage.. Bibliography Eley, A. (1992). Food Poisoning. Lone Gram, M. R. (2002).

Team building and motivation:
As this is the first time we, the students of IIT Kharagpur are participating in iGEM, we did not  have a pre­existing team of seniors to guide us and make things streamlined for us. Had there   been  an  existing  team,  we  would  have  had  regular  rounds  of  selections  into  the  team  and   organised way of work right from the beginning. But this was not the case with us. The students   in our department were not aware of iGEM and so it was not easy to straight­away build a team. Few of our seniors, Krishna, Madhur, Kaustav and Ayushman, students in the current fifth year   batch, took the initiative. During their summer interns in various universities across the globe,   they  had  come  across  iGEM  teams  operating  in  the  respective  institutions.  Gradually,  they   came  to  know"
Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," about it and discussed with the professionals, through recurrent meetings with our supervisors, various interviews, an online survey, and a conference. We have collected their opinions and advice to take all of these data into account to improve the relevance and the safety of our project.
We gradually changed the focus of our project according to the interviews performed and went from producing sugar to building a tool to improve an uncommon chassis in synthetic biology . Our meetings have also given us current juridical knowledge and public opinions about GMOs. Concerning safety, very interesting alternative systems for the photobioreactor design such as bio-containment measures were brought out with all the experts that we met. All of our meetings were very useful sources of information for the definition of a relevant project and for the improvement of our photobioreactor safety.

Education & Public Engagment
Throughout the year, we were constantly communicating about our project, the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. We have reached a large public through different actions. Indeed, we have organized a professional conference about synthetic biology in collaboration with two other French iGEM teams. To introduce the subject to the next generations, we held an animation for 3 days at the national science fair where we spoke about synthetic biology and C. reinhardtii for the large public including children. We also gave a lecture to high school students and sold crepes on our university campus in order to present iGEM to our university students and non-biologist professors. To reach people around the world we used social media through which we communicated about our project, our experiments and the iGEM competition. Finally, as we deeply give value to understanding the public view and fears about synthetic biology, we created a survey that we shared to the largest public as a tool that helped us address this issue

We did again a yeast genomic extraction (C. tropicalis), but this time we changed the protocol:
Pick 8 colonies of C. tropicalis growth in YPD media and resuspend them with 100 μL of solution (200 mM LiOAc and SDS 1%).
Incubate 15 min at 70°C.
Add 300 μL of ethanol 96%. Then, vortex the solution.
Centrifuge 3 min at 15000 xg.
Discard the superatant and resuspend the pellet (precipitated DNA) with 100 μL TE.
Centrifuge 1 min at 15000 xg.
Recover 1 μL of supernatant.
Using this genomic DNA as a template, we run a PCR (using Taq polimerase) with our primers and another one as a control.

For more information, see the Registry page on BBa_K523025 .
BioSandwich
The BioSandwich system is outlined on its own page . BioSandwich creates parts with homologous ends, but there are a number of ways in which the final assembly could be carried out. Throughout the project we mostly used Gibson Assembly.
Parts made with BioSandwich
Parts that we believe are correct (subject to final verification sequencing) include:
BBa_K523013 : PlacLacZ-INP-YFP
BBa_K523019 : PlacLacZ-INP-cex [update: sequencing shows this part has errors]
BBa_K523020 : PlacLacZ-INP-bglX [update: sequencing shows this part has errors]
BBa_K523022 : PlacLacZ-crtEIB
Extensive tests - what can go wrong?
We also tested a number of final assembly methods, by attempting to join a promoter and LacZ construct to a Yellow Fluorescent coding sequence, making BBa_K523023 . This part will produce a polycistronic RNA transcript, coding for proteins that turn the bacteria blue (on Xgal) but also make it fluoresce yellow.
BioSandwich inserts short spacers between each part to be assembled. Note that after spacer2 we expect to see some extra bases before we reach the RFC10 suffix, because of the choice of vector. We can call these extra bases the ""stuffing"". So, the expected sequence is:
Vector -- spacerT7 -- Plac,LacZ -- spacer1 -- EYFP -- spacer2 -- stuffing
Successful assemblies are expected to generate blue colonies that fluoresce yellow under a blue light. We tried several assembly methods, all of which generated many colonies with the correct phenotype, but also many colonies with an incorrect phenotype...
From each plate we sequenced a colony with the correct phenotype (if there were any) and some colonies with incorrect phenotypes, in an attempt to understand what the failure modes were.
BioSandwich with Gibson Assembly
Like, OEPCR, this method produces many correct colonies and many incorrect colonies.
The Gibson method was described by Gibson et al (2009) . A gentle introduction was written by the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team, and is found here .

Education & Public Engagement
Synthetic biology is a new but fast developing field of biology. It is therefore unlikely that the public will have         thorough understanding of it. Even more, we chose to focus more on the younger generations when we tried to explore         the possible public engagement events for human practices as we believe that children show more interest in new ideas         while having great imagination and thoughts on synthetic biology can achieve. However, our biggest challenge here         is to explain synthetic biology in a much simpler concept to the children as we tend to use complex scientific terms         in which will be difficult to understand for people without biology background. To conquer this challenge, our first         step will be to teach them the concept of DNA.
1. Hong Kong Summer Science Party (Every Sunday from 23/07 to 20/08)
In the “Summer Science Party 2017” organized by the Hong Kong Science Park, we had arranged workshops introducing DNA         models and DNA extraction from strawberries. This activity aims to educate children about biology while acting as         a platform to converse with parents regarding to their opinions towards synthetic biology.
The target audience of this event is children from the age of 4 to 12. We hold the believe that we can ignite the interest         for biology to children at an early age through fun games. We therefore uses candies as a material to make 3D DNA         model which the children can bring it back home afterwards. Unlike the minipreps that we do in our lab, the DNA extraction         workshop only uses easy and accessible household objects such as meat tenderizer and ethanol so children can try         out the same experiment with different fruits to compare their DNA amount, imprinting them with first impression         and a growing interest for biology at the developmental age.
In parallel, we had also chatted with parents there about synthetic biology and the goal of our project. We were able         to receive instant feedbacks from them regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified         organisms. With more than "

T5cumate repressed Tse2 mediated, antihorizontal transfer mechanism
This construct BBa_K1175003 is a modification of the part designed by iGEM2012 Team Trieste it has a T5cumate inducible promoter suppressed by the CymR gene integrated genome into the chassis E.coli Nissle 1917. This part will not be suppressed by CymR in the bacterial cells that have taken up the plasmid.
Project Summary
Wisconsin Lutheran College’s 2013 iGEM team has been hard at work to create a secretion mechanism that is safe and customizable. Our way of approaching this is to make use of removable purification and secretion tags that are separated by a single enzyme cut site Nhel. This is the cut site that is the insertion point for any coding sequence of interest. Then the induced gene can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space via a tripartite secI pump. In order to control a Tse2 toxin, a cymR-regulated T5cumate promoter is placed within the plasmid. This will prevent horizontal gene transfer. Essentially, if the plasmid is ejected from the bacteria and picked up by another, the gene producing the toxin will not be suppressed and will kill the cell. The plasmid also encodes a chimeric ompA-monoclonal antibody gene, which when expressed, inserts into the outer membrane. The antibody then selectively binds norovirus within the gut to hinder infection. This has great implications in the way of helping those with viruses in developing nations. This plasmid construct was used to over-express and secrete plant-based, polymer-degrading enzymes bglS, yesZ, and xynA. This will allow us to break down  hemicellulose and pectin. These enzymes were isolated from the cellulosome of Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168 to digest plant material. We utilized Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 containing a chromosome-integrated cymR gene to secrete these enzymes in the hope to accentuate dietary uptake for humans and livestock in impoverished countries.

One of the great potential benefits of this project is provide impoverished people with more access to food. This project would allow a greater array of options for food sources, as well"

These hollow rod shaped proteins are required for many cellular activities including cell division and transportation. [2] A dynamic equivalence are found in microtubules, meaning that protein monomers are assembling and disassembling at every moment. The anti-microtubule agents can destroy the dynamic balance in microtubules, hence terminating cell mitosis and inducing the tumor cell apoptosis.
There are two types of anti-microtubule agents. One type inhibits assembly, such as vinca alkaloids, colchicine, podophyllotoxin and etc. The other type interferes disassembly, like taxanes and epothilones.
As for the discovery of anti-cancer compounds, we narrow down our sight to the anti-microtubule agents which are of great significance in cancer treatments.
As for our project this year, we modified the homo sapiens α-tubulin, ligated it with N/C terminal of the luciferase report gene fragments. Based on the principles of synthetic biology, we aimed to express the fusion proteins with α-tubulin and signaling residues. Then we made a kit containing the fusion α-tubulins and non-fusion β-tubulins  with buffer which has an appropriate condition verified by experiments. We call the kit “taxolight”, and through which we can achieve these things below:
Screening with high feasibility
Anti-cancer agents especially paclitaxel have showed their powerful ability in clinical application. However, we still need to look for new drugs that are more effective.
The existing screening method of anti-microtubule agents needs to purify tubulins coming from mammalian brains. It heavily relies on the turbidity of tubulin solutions when they aggregate or disaggregate under certain temperatures in vitro. Once using this method, we can get a “S”-type standard aggregation curve based on the liquid OD value and the incubation time. Similarly, we can also get a standard disaggregation curve. When added different anti-microtubule agents, the aggregation/disaggregation curve will change correspondingly. Thus we can determine the role of the drug according to the change of curve.
The defects of this method are shown below:
The operation of extracting and purifying tubulin from animal brain is very complicated, and the experiment must be done within an hour after killing the animal. At the same time, the price of reagents in this experiment is expensive. The experiment period is long which takes no less than 3 days.
The wave length of measuring OD"

Collaboration with OUC-China
From August 9 to August 13, We co-organized the summer camp with OUC-China team. We communicate some experimental ideas, specific technical issues and mathematical modeling, etc. We did not only make a valuable friendship between the two teams, but also attracted some college students and high school students who didn’t participate in iGEM, expanding the iGEM influence in Shandong Province.And, with the help of OUC-China, our team successfully completed the model of the effect of EGF on hTERT promoter and YM155 on survivin promoter.

Collaboration with SCU-WestChina
This year, when we knew that the SCU-WestChina team needed the E.coli strain Nissle 1917 to start their iGEM project, we told them that our lab reserved the strain and mailed it to them as soon as possible. Later, at the request of the SiCAU-China，we also agreed SCU-WestChina team give some of the strains to SiCAU-China.

Collaboration with JNFLS
In the summer，JNFLS team needed to detect the starting efficiency of the anaerobic promoter fdhF, and they don’t have the proper instrument. So we helped them to finish this section of experiment using a Blood-gas analyzer which can detect PCO2 and PO2. And this result is important for them. Meanwhile, we shared each other's social resources and had some other cooperations.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"expressing low-affinity facilitated glucose transporter gave a 1.2 times increase and achieved 97% of glucose absorption in 4 hours. The high glucose transport at a time gave a huge stress for the bacteria, in which the toxic metabolite may accumulate due to the overloading of glycolysis pathway. To further speed up the glucose uptake within one hour, we think in the future we can plan a novel route to divert the metabolic pathway to relieve the burden.
In iGEM team uOttawa in 2009, the team worked on another probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum, to make them convert glucose to cellulose to increase dietary fibre in the gut. Although they seems to just cloned the 4 genes of cellulose synthase from Acetobacter xylium and didn’t get the engineered bacteria, we could extend their idea by combining with our glucose transporter system. Maybe it will make a big breakthrough in the food industry.
In addition, the multifunctional vitamin C is one of the essential and important vitamins that human needs to consume from food. But other mammals could produce vitamin C by themselves because they have whole biochemical synthesis pathway that human being lacks one of them (i.e, L-gulonolactone oxidase). It is intriguing that engineering a probiotic to synthesize vitamin C in the gut will raise interest for future biotechnology. It may be included in our whole picture of engineering probiotics as good food supplements1.
Although we’ve created the standard BioBrick vector for transforming Lactobacillus acidophilus with chromosome integration through homologous recombination. And we also created basic and composite parts of erythromycin resistance gene as an antibiotic selection marker for iGEM community. However, currently we have not successfully engineered Lactobacillus with this vector yet. Based on the paper where the recombination regions were designed, we’re confident and hope that by us or other iGEM teams in one day, transforming probiotics become a standard procedure in addition to E. coli and Bacillus subtilis in synthetic biology field and the iGEM community.
Through our research, we not only learned more about the sugar affecting obesity and diabetes but tackle the problem with synthetic biology and biotechnology. Furthermore, we also increase public awareness and understanding of the relationship between excess glucose uptake and health.

The acidification of the supernatant (g) in (d) serves as a purification, that is, the                             Nanobodies is separated from the supernatant, so the total protein concentration decreased                             significantly and the relative abundance of Nanobodies increased significantly.
After processing, the molecular weight of the Nanobody can be calculated to be about 18 KDa.
Nanobody concentration determination

Based on the standard curve of protein concentration and then based on the molecular weight                             of the nanobody measured by electrophoresis, we can determine the concentration of the                             Nanobody for further experiments.
We measured the absorbance of three groups of protein concentrations:
$$ y_1 = 0.520,\quad y_2 = 0.536,\quad y_3 = 0.495 \quad \mathrm{(Abs)}$$
According to the standard curve, the corresponding concentration was obtained.

Liquid crystal verification section
We designed a liquid crystal cell as an observation supporter. First, the upper glass slide                             was modified with 0.2%DMOAP to induce the vertical alignment of the liquid crystals and make                             the optical imaging of liquid crystals appear black at the first time.Meanwhile, we modified                             the lower slide with a mixture solution of 3% (v) APTES and 1% (v) DMOAP and 1% (v) GA, so                             that it could connect to the target protein. Then We mixed the sample with the antibody and                             added it to the modified slide. Finally, the upper and lower slides were assembled, and then                             the liquid crystals were added. We could observe the optical imaging of the liquid crystals                             pool under the microsco-pe, so as to determine the concentration of β2-MG of the                             sample.

Proof of Concept
This page outlines the characterisation of our RIOTSensor using lactate solution. For other details, please visit the respective subpages of our wiki.
Characterisation
One of our goals is to use the  RIOT sensors to detect the  increased level of L-lactate produced by tumor cells in the microenvironment. To demonstrate this functional proof of concept, we measured the level of sfGFP expression under the control of lactate sensors (Figure 1). Commercially available L-lactate solution was used to activate the sensors, hence induce the expression of sfGFP. Detailed working mechanism of RIOTSensor can be found here .
The design of RIOT sensors is based on a shorter version of the promoter region for the wild-type lldPRD operon (BBa_K1897037, derived from Part BBa_K822000) and a modified version of this promoter, lldRO1-J23117-lldRO2 (BBa_K1847008), which are hereafter referred to as “p62” and “p70”, respectively for convenient purpose. We received them from  team ETH_Zurich 2015. We minimise the basal expression of our reporter by linking ribosomal binding site (RBS) of different strength with these promoters (Table 1). The efficiency of the medium RBS (BBa_B0032) and the weak RBS (BBa_B0033) are about 30% and 1% relative to the strong RBS (BBa_B0034), respectively.
Table 1: Details of RIOT sensors containing a superfolded green fluorescent protein (sfGFP)
The performance of RIOT sensor 10 and 11 was compared to other lactate sensors via the fold change in GFP expression when lactate concentration increased. The results showed that RIOT sensor 10, p70-33-sfGFP-Terminator (BBa_K1897028) is more sensitive"

We envision that our system will detect hypoxia before it has fatal effects and interfere to prohibit the occurrence of more austere conditions without causing any dismay in the target patient.
Achievements
We successfully propose a promising, novel approach and system design to treat ischemia, a common and lethal public health issue.
We have created a system which aims to treat ischemia: the number one cause of deaths worldwide.
We successfully worked all of our seven parts in our engineered eukaryotic cells.
We have accomplished modeling our gene expression dynamics and have also come up with the unique idea of modelling our safety experiment which enables us to prove graphically that we are able to switch our system off in the presence of a simple antibiotic such as tetracycline.
We collaborated with the METU iGEM team and exchanged thoughts on how we can improve our modelling.
We will hold a special metaphor event called ‘Think By Heart’ during the Giant Jamboree where we discover the unknowns of our heart simply beginning from its etymology to the cardiac cycle and how it is bizarrely similar to us human beings in terms of its style of functioning and many more.Have created a system which aims to treat ischemia: the number one cause of deaths worldwide.
Policy & Practices
Click and go to P&P section.
Apart from our project design, we also wanted to engender a better approach on ischemic conditions and diseases by working on human practice and social issues. This year, we preferred to conduct an inclusive perspective and activity to address every aspect of the issue as well as all the stakeholders who are connected with it. Therefore, we separated our P&P design into four columns; all of which present a respective process and interactive strategy.
First, we need to analyze how intense the problem is and how common these ischemic diseases are among people, specifically in the iGEM community. This module is the “Identification” module; which intends to identify the parameters of the problem, in order approach the problem accurately.
AAfterwards, our aim is to undergo some tasks to raise awareness and warn people who are at high risk from ischemic diseases such as heart attacks. We plan to present our “identification” data inquired from the public in an influential way. The data includes information such as the total calories consumed by individuals. This comprises our second column, “clarification”.
Thirdly, we need to be accurate and effective in influencing the stakeholders and improving public health. To do this, we chose the “special"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," this wiki, Nanopore sequencing promises to be especially beneficial regarding the analysis of experiments involving unnatural bases in DNA and RNA. As a single-molecule sequencing technology without the need for special, expensive chemistry or PCR amplification of DNA samples prior to analysis, it could serve as an innovative, novel approach for the analysis of experiments involving unnatural bases.
For the analysis of our experiments with isoG and isoCm, examined if Oxford Nanopore sequencing is suitable for sequencing DNA containing unnatural bases. Therefore, we developed a software called ""iCG"" for the analysis of Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of DNA containing unnatural bases, including data processing and evaluation. Based on differences in the raw output signal of DNA reads containing an unnatural base compared to those containing only natural bases, the software uses linear discriminant analysis to create a statistical model that gives base predictions for a position of interest in a known sequence context, where either a natural or an unnatural base is present. This software is not limited to a certain unnatural base pair or to a certain sequence context, but rather serves as a pipeline tool for the creation of statistical models potentially allowing for the detection of any unnatural base pairs in an arbitrary sequence context based on reference sequencing data.
iCG
Background
In ONT's sequencing technology, the ionic current that passes through a nanopore is not measured for every nucleotide individually. To cope with the influence of random fluctuations of the ionic current, the background noise, the signal is evaluated for a sequence of approximately 5 nucleotides. Every such k‑mer (in this case every possible combination of 5 successive nucleotides) produces a characteristic signal that is evaluated by the basecaller to predict the sequence of the analyzed DNA strand. Therefore, the signal trace of a certain nucleotide is not the same at every position where it occurs in the DNA strand, but is dependent on its sequence context. This has two interesting effects that have to be considered regarding ONT sequencing of unnatural bases: Firstly, the signal of the close sequence context has to be considered too when analyzing if an unnatural base has a significant effect on the ionic current flow. Secondly, if an unnatural base indeed significantly influences the signal, it will have an impact on the signal traces surrounding the position where it is occurring in the DNA. Therefore, the basecalling may fail for natural bases surrounding this positon.
As a consequence of these considerations, a basecaller that shall be able to differentiate between natural bases and unnatural bases at any sequence position would need to be trained with signals of every possible k‑mer that is a combination of natural and unnatural bases. As the"

OBESITY raises increasing concerns worldwide. Too much sugar in the body will be converted to fat and stored in the liver and cells. Excess sugar will make you overweight and obese. Meanwhile, fat is easily gained but hard to break down.
TYPE 2 DIABETES is another health problem because of excess sugar in the blood for a long term period. Insulin produced by the pancreas stimulates cells to absorb extracellular glucose. But in patients with type 2 diabetes, cells somehow become insulin resistant and need more amounts of insulin to maintain normal function. So the patients are advised to adjust their diet and control the blood sugar level.
The fat converted from excess glucose may contribute to atherosclerosis and increase the risk of HEART DISEASE. In addition, a study provided evidence that high blood glucose could lead to ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE and may damage your brain to cause dementia (Scientific Reports 2016;6:25589).
 
PROBLEM - Excess Sugar Consumption
 
How to deal with the excess glucose problems
To stay fit and keep healthy, you can choose to control desire and avoid sugary food or drinks. Or what else you can do to avoid the excess glucose in the blood?
DOING EXERCISE is good to your health and burning glucose you gained. Accordingly, you have to running (at the speed of 5 mph) for 13 min to burn off calories from 330ml of sugary soft drink, 28 min for a medium cup of mocha coffee, 43 min for a sandwich with chicken & bacon or a ¼ pizza (published by Royal Society of Public Health, 2016). When you think about it, I guess you probably already give up.
ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS in diet drinks are common synthetic substitutes for glucose such as aspartame and saccharine. One survey by Boston University School of Medicine found that diet drinks are associated with higher risk of dementia caused by strokes (published on Stroke, 2017). Another study published on Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ., 2017) reported that artificial sweeteners linked to risk of weight gain and heart disease. The sweeteners may have negative effects on metabolism, gut bacteria and appetite.

Kinetic Parameters Identification
First of all, we shall clarify that, being dedicated to dry lab experiments, we naturally doesn't have as many incarnated Bio-Parts as usual wet labs do.
In wet lab experiment, kinetic parameters are notorious for their difficulties to be obtained quantitatively. To construct a well fabricated device, the kinetic parameters are crucial for an extensible part. When certain parts are placed in the network, certain biochemical reactions with holding kinetic parameters are introduced. To identify kinetic parameters of basic devices determines the extensibility of devices.

Figure 14: pAzF
In order to introduce pAzF into bacterial transmembrane protein, we need to mutate one of transmembrane protein, which is called COMPX. COMPX is able to mutate with a special tRNA. The plasmid containing tRNA is as following:

Covalent binding between DBCO and pAzF goes as following:

Mutation of Transmembrane Protein OMPx in E. coli
OMPx is a integral outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli, belonging to a family of highly conserved bacterial protein that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells. Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.
The modified COMPX structure is illustrated as below:
Figure 17: The modified COMPX structure
As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:
Figure 18: The mutation site
The Covalent Reaction Model
Consequently, the model of adhesion goes like this: modified bacteria containing special p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine transformed tRNA carry OMPx with mutated p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine site. The laminated side in pAzF will covalently bind to alkenyl in DBCO-PEG4-NHS ester, and consequently undergo chemical reactions.

We choosed the Ssp DnaB S1 split-intein because it has high ligation kinetics which reduces the time of reaction (Aranko et al., 2014). Also, Volkman et al., 2011 have proved that the intein reaction can occur in Escherichia coli without affecting the cell viability. Aditionally, the high specificity of the C-intein recognition avoids undesired cleavege of other proteins (Tropilina & Mills, 2014). This IP has already been used in iGEM and it's in the repository.
2. Release of split TEV
In order to allow the reaction to occur only with the Cas9 conformational change, we decided to insert the C-intein in one of the hotspots and the complement intein in a second hotspot. Thus, when the Cas9 binds to the target ARN the distance between the insertions is reduced and the intein reaction takes place. Because we aimed to release an amino acid sequence inside a domain we had to excise not one but two peptide bonds. For that reason, one of the insertions consists of a split TEV protease joined with a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein and flanked by two N-inteins. Therefore, when the insertions become closer the C—intein will cleave both N-inteins and release a split TEV protease used in our response module. The trans-splicing intein was added to allow the reconstitution of the split-TEV in the mentioned module.

Based on the protein structural model we decided to insert the smallest sequence in the REC lobe because it suffers the most aggressive conformational change. In contrast, the longest insertion which included the split TEV protease joined to a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein and both N-inteins was inserted in the HNH domain. Also, we added the flexible linker 2x (GGGS) on both sides of each insertion to allow a better interaction between the split inteins. According to Chen et al. (2013) flexible linkers are usually used to provide a degree of movement and"

Opening energies were calibrated around the mean value of opening energies observed for all protein coding genes in E. coli. When designing custom synthetic RNA thermometers, it was important to take into account the upstream and downstream sequences of our constructs and to model different structures and sequences in order to select only the best ones for practical implementation. Therefore 10 designs for each construct was designed (see figures below) out of which only 1 was selected based on the computed plots of translation efficiency vs. temperature.

Score(Promoter)=score(-10 box)+score(-35 box)+score(spacer between -10 & -35 boxes)
And the score of spacer length is calculated by algorithms propozed by Ryan K. Shultzaberger.el. in
E. coli sigma70 promoters.8 But due to a lack of experimental data of promoter strength with both different motifs and spacer length, the weight of the total MSS and the spacer score is very roughly determined with few experimental data available. Currently our weight is determined with the promoter strength data in a literature16 to best fit the the promoter score with promoter strength. Now the relative weight between the total MSS of the two motifs and the spacer score is 0.29:0.71.
In prokaryotes, the strength of sigma factor regulation for a particular gene often depends on how closely a particular site matches the consensus for the motif. The more mismatches to the consensus in a binding site, the less often the sigma factor will bind and therefore the less strength the promoter will have. Experiments have confirmed the hypothesis that the consensus promoter sequences is ""best"". We set the best promoter strength to 100% and calculate the relative strength of a given promoter by the Score (promoter).
Primer design
A primer pair (p, q) is assigned the scoring vector
sc (p, q) = (|p|, |q|, GC (p), GC (q), Tm (p), Tm (q), sa (p), sa (q), sea (p), sea (q), pa (p, q), pea (p, q))T ∈ R12.
All primers are designed to have ideal values of length, GC content, and melting temperature which are specified externally by the designer of the hybridization experiment. These ideal values are to be specified for forward and reverse primers. The ideal score vector or reference vector for the primer pair is
scideal =(lengthf , lengthr , GCf , GCr , Tm,f , Tm,r , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)T.
All ideal annealing values are set to zero and typically
Tmf = Tm,r as well as GCf = GCr . The final assessment of a primer pair ("
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know"

For Z0842 and Z0279, inoculated liquid cultures to grow overnight.  Used 8 mL LB + AMP so that both glycerol stocks and minipreps could be done.  Placed in incubator at 9:05 pm.  Should check on them tomorrow at 11:05 am.  Note that the tubes were held in a styrofoam container that was leaned against another styrofoam container such that the tubes were not exactly vertical but rather pointing at an angle from the vertical line.  This ensured a greater amount of aeration while shaking in the incubator.
Streaked out yeast plasmids on freshly made YPD plates.  Used streaking technique described above for glycerol stocks (shake n' plate).  Note that there were what appeared to be little dots on the plates before any medium was applied.  Thus, decided to do two negative controls: one is a plate with just YPD streaked on it while the other is a plain PD plate.  Streaked out MHY500 colony #1, MHY501, and MHY606 colony #1.  Placed in 30 degree incubator at 9:45 pm.

Took parts Z0279 and Z0842 out of incubator around 2:15 pm after being in the incubator for 17 hr and 8 min.
Z0279: 0.179 600 nm absorbance
Z0842: 0.193 600 nm absorbance
Glycerol stock and miniprep of Z0279 and Z0842
Made 2 glycerol stocks from each of the 2 cultures.  (Glycerol stocks for each part are from the same colony.)
Miniprepped the remaining culture.
Used 60 uL of EB for elution.  Final results:
Z0279: ~58 uL of 109.2 ng/uL; 260/280 = 1.91; 260/230 = 2.05;
Z0842: ~56 uL of 34.4 ng/uL; 260/280 = 1.97; 260/230 = 1.60;
Note that the 260/230 ratio is usually between 1.8 and 2.2 for pure nucleic acid.  According to the Nanodrop manual, ""If the ratio is appreciably lower, this may indicate the presence"

Overview
The 2016 Macquarie iGEM team participated in a total of five collaborations with other iGEM teams around the world. These teams include: Paris Bettencourt iGEM Team , for whom we collected two soil samples from a vineyard here in Australia and sent these samples to the team in Paris for their project.  The Pretoria South Africa iGEM Team offered their assistance with the MatLab program, aiding us in the production of an interactive graph for our ALA to chlorophyll a model. We sent the NTU-Singapore iGEM Team our Mg-chelatase operon plasmids and primer designs for each gene for the RT-PCR.  We also purified and characterised their Cas9 mutants of interest. They sent us their Cas9 mutant plasmids after cloning in a His-tag and performed RT-PCR of the genes in our Mg-chelatase operon. Furthermore, we completed surveys for the Virginia iGEM team and Munich United iGEM team to help them with their projects.
Our team also participated in meet up of Australian iGEM teams at Sydney University. All four participating Australian teams attended; Macquarie University, Sydney University, University of New South Wales and Melbourne University. This was a chance to meet the other Australian teams and find out what they had been working on. It also gave all teams an opportunity to practice a preliminary version of their jamboree presentation and receive feedback."

Table 4: Results of ΔΔGexchange gRNA:target for targets implemented in Testing System.
Results illustrated in the graphic below, show that                         as expected, the R-loop formation is less likely as it                         is reduced the distance between a mismatch and the PAM.                         In general, it seems that our thermodynamics approach                         emulates well the mechanism of a R-loop formation. With                         both targets, the average result of changing one                         nucleotide, is decreased with higher PAM-distance.                         Mismatches placed downstream the 20 th nucleotide, typically result in positive free energy increments, avoiding the RNA:DNA hybridization. This                         agrees with criteria found in bibliography (2), letting                         us assume that the penalty system worked well as representation of mismatch effects.
Figure 13. Estimation of total energy exchange produced between the gRNA and the DNA target, using examples of TFL and Ga20ox.
The variability observed in each position is due to the                         differences between three possible nucleotides.                         However, there are some atypical results as well which                         may be caused by unknown sources of variability. For                         instance, the ΔΔGexchange gRNA:target is                         overlapped for positions 23 and 10 in rice, while                         energy difference for the position 23 was supposed to                         be minor. This could be due to the necessity of training and improving our function, using parameters                         in the penalty function which are based on empirical                         evidence.
DNA supercoiling
Finally, the chromatin state is critical to let the                         gRNA hybridize the DNA, and some energy can be                         extra-needed if the DNA is ""relaxed"", i.e. positively                         supercoiled. Consequently, regions highly similar may                         will not be able to join the gRNA because the chromatin                         could be compressed. Having off-targets means that the binding will be taking place in some unspecified                         regions. The difference between the initial density of                         a target σI and a non-specific region                         (σNS) will"

Interestingly, in this time I am the only person with the background of biology, while nearly everyone’s background is solo. It is really a mixture. I hope there will be chemical reactions among us.

Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a new type of second messenger molecule that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Bacteria utilize it to perceive cell surface signals and activate targets within cells, which involves amplification of the original signal and the subsequent expression of a series of specific genes in the cell. These genes affects the various physiological and biochemical processes in the cells. c-di-GMP control a wide range of process, and has a role in transcription, translation and post-translation levels. In addition, c-di-GMP participates in the regulation of  multiple biological functions and affects biofilm formation. In a nutshell, it is a crucial elements to the formation of membrane-like bacterial cellulose and the improvement of BC production.
This experiment attempts to improve BC production by over-expressing PGM and c-di-GMP, a small signal transfer molecule of bacteria.the goal is to implement both to realize the high yield of BC.
The process of the experiment is divided into following steps, firstly, we   transform the constructed plasmids into the E. coli DH5α. When expressing successfully, then we transform it into G.xylinus through electroporation and put it in comparison with the common G.xylinus. We try to explore the influence of each plasmids on the production of BC after fermentation.
We use PCR to amplify gene PGM and c-di-GMP，and transform reconstructed plasmids J23119+PGM and J23119+c-di-GMP into G.xylinus. Then we put them in comparison with the control group PAsr+PGM and PAsr+c-di-GMP and measure its effect on the yield of BC respectively.
Results
At the beginning of the experiment, it was found that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylinus cultured individually when cultured with E.coli at pH=5 ，so we first construct the PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid and verify its effect on BC yield after overexpression.
The results show that the overexpression of PGM has no significant effect on the increase of BC yield.
We acquire genes of PAsr from K12 genome of E.coli via PCR
We acquire genes of PGM and c-di-GMP from genome of G.xylinus.(With and without PGM)

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen_-_-_TEXT.html," for therapeutics. For a more detailed description of our                     protein production system, go here
How does our system differ from conventional protein production?
In conventional protein production the bacteria would produce the protein, but afterwards, we would                     need to go through a lot of steps in order to purify it. The process of purification takes time,                     lab equipment, chemicals, a lot of water and some of the protein goes to waste. However, the method                     allows for large-scale production.
Due to the purification process, conventional protein production requires well-equipped labs and                     are therefore not portable.
Why do we need a portable protein production system for long term space travel?
There are three very important problems with bringing medicine to space:
Medicine expires after a while, so long-term space travel means that some of the medicine will                         expire during the exploration.
The sheer amount of different medicine astronauts might need is vast which makes it difficult                         to predict what is needed to bring.
The cost to keep transporting medicine to sustain a colony would be unsustainable and very                         high.
This all makes producing the medicine on-site the far the most attractive solution.
