ITB_INDONESIA,2015,Team:ITB INDONESIA#humprac#questionnaires_-_-_TEXT.html,". The responses were varied since the synthetic biology and EOR term might be new for the respondents.
Have you ever learnt/ known about synthetic biology?
The responses were clear that most of the high school students (67%) had never learnt about synthetic biology. This could be due a fact that this term is new for them. Although there were many research in that field, the respondents might be unavailable to access the information since only 33% students that had learnt about that.
Are you interested to study more about synthetic biology?
The majority (88%) of the students we surveyed said that they are interested to study more about synthetic biology. They thought that it was cool and very useful for the future. This means that it is important for them to keep an eye on that field.
If you are interested in the synthetic biology, could you please tell us why? Is it because of your favourite subject or the teacher?
We find out more to analyze the factor that influenced respondents who are interested in synthetic biology. Most of the respondents (73%) are interested since the subject was taught in biology class. Only 18% are keen on learning synthetic biology because of their teacher. It seems like the synthetic biology would be their favourite field in the future.
Have you ever learnt/ known about Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR)?
Since our project focus on Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR), we need to get the responses about this term. About 89% of the students we surveyed had never learnt/ known about EOR. Unfortunately, we did not collect data for whether they thought it was a good thing or not. This could be a question for the later survey.
Do you have any comments/ questions about our project?
The responses were varied because the novelty of our project. We processed the data so that we could get deeper into key points of their comments. Those key points were used to consider our step in developing the project.

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Human Practices
An important part of developing a system is evaluating the impact TERRA will have on various communities. Through our interactions with the synthetic biology and microfluidics communities, we were able to gauge the effect of TERRA within these groups. Additionally, our outreach also served to educate the greater STEM community and in doing so, help bridge the knowledge gap barring many from the field of microfluidics. All of the feedback we received from these interactions helped improved the design, usability, and accessibility of TERRA.
Human Practices
Integrated Human Practices
Throughout the summer, our team has worked with STEM Pathways, an outreach program sponsored by the National Science Foundation aimed to inspire and engage students in synthetic biology and engineering. We participated in various outreach events hosted on the Boston University campus, such as Summer Pathways on July 18, 2018 and Day of Learning on August 4, 2018.
During these events, our team introduced the basics of microfluidics to rising high school students and led microfluidics-based activities for hands-on learning. The events started with a brief overview of synthetic biology and its impact on our world, then led to activities for synbio and microfluidics.
We began our activity by briefly explaining the components of microfluidic chips and the advantages of incorporating microfluidics into synthetic biology. Our activity involved creating paper representations of potential microfluidic chips for synthetic biology protocols, such as ligation or PCR. This allowed the students to understand the thought process behind creating a chip design and how features of the chip accomplish steps in the protocol. Our team then led a tour of our lab space, where we distributed microfluidic devices and walked the students through the goals and basic workflow of the lab.
Our team has also designed a new activity that will be implemented in future outreach events. The students will be able to create droplets similar to those in droplet-based microfluidic devices using common culinary ingredients. This aims to be a highly-interactive, hands-on activity that engages students and increases interest in microfluidics.
We also assisted with high school lab trainings and the Biobuilder Panel. During the high school lab training, members from our team hosted and taught"

Overview
This year, we aim to construct a diseases-monitoring system for automatic agriculture (AA) in which biological, physical and chemical elements can act as a whole. DAPG plays an essential role in operation of the system including serving as signal molecule or effector. Thanks to BBa_K2207997 , we successfully made E.coli synthesize the DAPG and achieved our goal.
Introduction
2,4-DAPG (DAPG), full name 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, is a natural phenol found in specific strains of Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. This compound is found to be anti-phytopathogenic and plays an important role in the biocontrol of many plant pathogens[1]. Meanwhile, 2,4-DAPG has also shown to induce systematic resistance in plants and enhance the plant’s resistance[2]. What’s more, DAPG can also serve as signal molecule to construct a transcriptional switch that is similar to Tet on/off system[3]. What’s also worth mentioning is that previous studies confirmed that DAPG almost has no harmful impact on human health under the effective concentration, and can be degraded easily in nature. [4]
Design
As has mentioned before, DAPG is initially found in specific strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. And it has been demonstrated that a cluster named phl responsible for the biosynthesis of DAPG, which contains eight genes, from phlA to phlH. Further studies shows that phlABCD are the DAPG synthesis genes. [5][6][7]

We successfully cloned the phlABCD via colony PCR from Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24. We put these four genes, phlABCD, under the control of a strong"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"yo! My name is Jaya and I am a student of general biology.  Although I chose this major to explore the diversity of living things, I have recently become interested synthetic biology and its usefulness in solving major issues. I participated on the KillSwitch and Human Practices on the project this summer and thoroughly enjoyed developing and expanding my lab skills. As you can tell from my greeting, I am extremely interested in Korean language, culture and most importantly, entertainment.  Apart from my strange fascination of Korean television, I like learning about invertebrate zoology.
Kevin Huie
I have currently finished my first year of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. This is my first year in iGEM as well as my first taste in working on a research project. Being a part of the University of Calgary iGEM team has been and continue to be a great learning experience from hands on work to gaining knowledge from team members’ past experiences I have developed better skills in multitasking and multi-managing. This year I have been working on the wet lab part of the project, in particular the killswitch. I enjoy playing soccer, drawing, building things and hanging out with friends.

I joined the Calgary iGEM team after completing my first-year at the UofC and spending the summer with the team has been quite a thrill. The field of synthetic biology is really dynamic and I have been involved mainly in the design and construction of the desulfurization components in the conversion of NAs to useful hydrocarbons, as well as in developing an integrated human practices element to the project.
Patrick Wu
I'm wrapping up my fourth year in Bioinformatics, which means that once I graduate, I will pretend to know both biology and computer science. In reality, the only computer science I can probably do is HTML, and so my primary work this year was building this wiki. And drawing cute things. Both of these responsibilities have made me into a pretty big design geek over the summer. This is my third year in iGEM, and I continue to work against the advice and concerns of my friends and family physician. In my ""spare time"" I draw, do karate, and sleep (a dying art).

Currently in my second year of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Calgary, I have a passion for any biological research that involves advanced technology, the potential to benefit our society in the long run, and innovative areas that no one else has explored before. Our iGEM project is an ideal example of this type of project. Focusing on the human practice component,"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html,"TPs) ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP are the building blocks of RNA and therefore essential for transcription. They are one of the main cost factors, and it was shown that it is possible to use nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) instead, although CFPS is less effective in this case ( Calhoun and Swartz, 2005 ; Kim et al., 2008 ).
Translation
Amino acids
Nearly all proteins are built up by L-amino acids. Neglecting selenomethionine and pyrrolysine, there are 20 proteinogenic amino acids that all have to be brought to the cell-free reaction. This is a difficult task for the experimenter, because these molecules have different solubilities and pKa-values. Recently, an easy procedure for the production of an amino acid mastermix has been presented ( Caschera and Noireaux, 2015b ).
Some amino acids – especially cysteine, tryptophan, arginine and serine – are depleted much faster in the cell-free reaction than others, for example due to enzymatic reactions ( Calhoun and Swartz, 2006 ). This is one of the biggest problems that occur during batch CFPS and leads to fast stop of protein production, unless appropriate knockout strains are used or amino acid concentrations are increased ( Jewett and Swartz, 2004 ; Calhoun and Swartz, 2006 ; Pedersen et al., 2011 ).
Other components involved in translation
Amino acids are fused to corresponding tRNAs and thus activated for translation through the action of aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases, a process that is called aminoacylation. Additional E. coli tRNA supplied to the CFPS-reaction is advantageous ( Calhoun and Swartz, 2005 ), though it was observed that under certain conditions an addition has no effect ( Shin and Noireaux, 2010 ; Cai et al., 2015 )
Elongation and releasing factors coordinate translation. For example, the GTP-binding protein EF-Tu is the major elongation factor in E. coli ( Airen, 2011 ). It has been shown that the supplementation of EF-Tu improves translation efficiency ( Underwood et al., 2005 ), and that EF-Tu could mediate the incorpotation of non-natural aminoacids into proteins, for example selenocysteine ( Miller et al., 2015 )
The importance of the mRNA sequence is described in the previous section

Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret.

To learn more about the commercial development and application of biosensors, we visited Amsterdam-based biosensor company BioDetection Systems (BDS). Here we met with the Chief Scientific Officer, Mr.  Van Der Burg. With him, we discussed the activities of BDS, our project Electrace and the biosensor industry.
The main focus of BDS is their sensing system CALUX. A range of CALUX systems exist, which all work according to a mechanism in which the compound to be detected binds to an intracellular receptor. This complex subsequently binds to a promoter in front of a luciferase gene. The luciferase which is then formed emits light and is in that way used to measure the compound of interest. Compounds which can be detected with CALUX include dioxins and several hormones.
The CALUX system is mainly applied to detect environmental and food contaminations which might be harmful for humans. “We aim to stay close to the physiology of our subject, so in this case this means that we have to use eukaryotic cells, in our case rat cells,” Van Der Burg tells. The use of eukaryotic cells however presents some problems. “For multicellular eukaryotes, there is a big step between contact with the contamination and uptake by a cell, which we have to model and simulate in our experiments. In bacteria you don’t have this problem. Next to that, eukaryotes are less robust and more complex than bacterial cells.” Upon asking why they did not work with bacteria, Van Der Burg tells us: “We are developing  a bacterial version of CALUX, but only for usage in areas where bacterial physiology is important, such as soil contamination or antibiotic detection.”
The activities of BDS mainly consist of measuring samples sent by other organizations whit their CALUX system and selling licenses and training to use the system. Their customers include pharmaceutical companies, food companies and (governmental) organizations involved in environmental issues. “We have customers from all over the world. We are currently working on a project in Vietnam to detect dioxins. The concentration of these compounds in Vietnam is far above the health limits as a result of spraying with dioxin-contaminated defoliants.”
Upon being asked about innovations in BDS, Van Der Burg tells us: “We are currently mainly focused on optimizing our CALUX system. We simplify and automate the process of doing assays using our CALUX cells. Although we do not really focus on the detection of novel compounds with new pathways, we are currently trying developing a dioxin sensor for our project in Vietnam. We do this by searching"

Bioremediation
Basidiomycete fungi are very effective chelators of metal ions.  Many basidiomycetes are capable of recovering the potentially harmful metals cadmium, lead, and mercury from the environment, making these fungi a promising candidate for bioremediation of areas with heavy metal pollution [1].  Our fungal toolkit could prove useful for this purpose as well—upregulation of these metal chelating pathways and biosensing genetic circuits could feasibly be integrated into a basidiomycete strain, decreasing pollution while simultaneously monitoring and reporting pollution levels.

In addition, fungal mycelium can form dense masses (like Ecovative’s biomaterial) that can slow the flow of water and act as a solids filter.  Such filters could act as permanent bioswales or buffers around water bodies, decreasing runoff pollution from agricultural and industrial areas.  A safe filter could also be developed for human use.  Such a filter would be reusable and inexpensive, providing clean water to those in impoverished areas.  Our fungal toolkit would be vital to the development of these products.  To reproduce, some fungi release spores that (depending on the species) could be harmful if inhaled. Thus, to produce a fungal material safe for food or water containment, sporulation should be regulated.  Sporulation in basidiomycetes is regulated by the highly conserved velvet protein group, so our fungal toolkit could be utilized to silence these genes, creating a safe fungal product [2].

Motivation and Background
Bioprospecting and Bioremediation
Bioprospecting is the process of searching nature for genetic information that can be adapted in useful or profitable ways. In recent years, bioprospecting efforts have focused on the search for small molecule pharmaceuticals and other bioactive compounds (Müller, 2016). Bioremediation is the use of living organisms to remove environmental toxins from contaminated areas. Microbes in particular are well known for their ability to degrade organic pollutants like petroleum, pesticides and phenolic compounds. Bioremediation has always been a popular topic in iGEM, producing many notable projects with diverse organisms and applications.
Anthocyanin is not harmful, but in the context of a stain it is unwanted and so could be considered a target for bioremediation. Therefore a mechanism to degrade anthocyanin could be revealed with a classic bioremediation strategy :
Select organisms from a contaminated environment, where enzymatic decontamination may have naturally evolved.
Isolate pure strains and measure their activity.
Connect the activity to specific pathways using molecular genetics.
Anthocyanidin and quercetin
In these experiments, we use quercetin as a chemical proxy for anthocyanins. Naturally occurring anthocyanidins are chemically diverse derivatives of a a core flavylium cation. Plant sources of anthocyanidin carry a range of anthocyanidin pigments substituted at any of up to seven positions, with the relative concentrations contributing to a characteristic color. Pure anthocyanidins, like malvidin, are expensive (120 EUR for 1 mg) and do not necessarily represent the full chemical diversity of a natural wine stain. Therefore, in this work we use quercetin, a flavonol, as a structural proxy. Quercetin is cheap (40 EUR for 10 g), stable, and can be quantified by absorbance at 315 nm. In follow up experiments, microbes are tested on real wine and on bulk anthocyanins that we extract directly from grape skins.

All flavonoids are structured as two phenyl rings and a heterocyclic ring. Anthocyanin itself is structured as a chromane ring with an"

E. coli DH5a containing fnr promoter + lycopene coding gene. The  red color was expressed due to the leakiness of the fnr promoter.
B. subtilis 168 containing promoters (alsT, fnr, and sboA) coupled with the lycopene coding gene. The red color was not as     highly expressed as in E. coli. This phenotype was due to the weak promoter of B. subtilis that was used in this     construct and the RBS for E. coli that was utilized for this device construct.
AmilCP (BBa_K592009)
AmilCP is a blue/purple chromoprotein biobrick part (BBa_K592009), created by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011, and was used as one of     the reporter genes in our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Uppsala Sweden 2011 page. BBa_K592009 . AmilCP has a sequence similar to the other     coral chromoprotein, only its maximum absorption is shifted by 10 nm causing the color to appear blue instead of purple.
Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K818000     (plasmid backbone for B. subtilis, engineered by team Groningen 2012), to allow color expression in B. subtilis.     We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in E. coli and B. subtilis. This reporter coding gene was strongly    expressed in E. coli due to the leakiness of the promoters. However, the expression in B. subtilis was not as     leaky as in E. coli.  This phenotype in B. subtilis was due to the promoter strength and the RBS that was used in     this construct. The promoters are considered weak, therefore visible expression requires induction by volatiles produced    by the rotten meat.
E. coli DH5a containing sboA promoter + amilCP (left). Blue/purple colour was highly     expressed due to the leakiness of the promoter and a strong RBS for E. coli. However, the expression     of this part in B. subtilis was more subtle. B. subtilis containing sboA promoter + amilCP     (right) displayed faint blue colour on its colony.

We are drafting an RFC with the aim to use this construct as a new standard to characterise promoters, both constitutive and inducible, in E. coli and B. subtilis.
Our ratiometric luciferase construct arrived with full sequence coverage. Unfortunately, during construction it was found to be unexpectedly toxic. This hampered characterisation, as it the construct tended to be lost, and necessitated its submission to the registry in a low copy number backbone (with permission from HQ).
Starting from the ground up, we first showed that the part was constitutively luminescing.  We also observed that the colonies were orange. This was not initially expected, however this is probably because we designed the construct with consensus RBSes, so any leaky transcription through the inducible promoter would result in enough protein to be visible. We showed that orange colour and luminescence cosegregated, implying that the entire construct is being lost, not just part of it.

Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.

Cambridge,2008,Team:Cambridge#Improved GFP_-_-_TEXT.html," different levels of arabinose. Data shown is the average of 3 experiments.
Superfolder GFP yields up to four fold more total fluorescence intensity than mut3 or P7 GFP when expressed in vivo:
Figure 2: In vivo fluorescence intensities of GFP variants were compared at steady state (between 3hrs – 5hrs after induction). The fluorescence intensities of superfolder and P7 GFP are expressed as fractions of the intensity of mut3 GFP. The data shown is the average of 3 experiments.
Excitation  and emission spectra vary slightly between the GFP variants:
Figure 3: Excitation and Emission spectra determined for 6-his purified GFP variants. Excitation was at 480nm for emission spectra; emission was at 520nm for excitation spectra. Emission peaks occur at 479, 492 and 502nm while excitation peaks are located at 505, 511 and 511nm for P7, superfolder and mut3 GFPs respectively.
After denaturing in vitro,  P7 GFP renatures faster than superfolder or mut3 GFP:
Figure 4: Short term in vitro refolding of 6-his purified GFP samples after complete denaturing. Data shown is the fraction folded at each time point compared to the maximally refolded sample. Data shown is the average of three experiments.
P7  and superfolder GFPs are more resistant to denaturing and have stronger refolding abilities in vitro than mut3 GFP:
Figure 5 (left): Resistance of 6-his purified GFP variants to  denaturing after 100fold dilution into TNG buffer containing different concentrations guanidine hydrochloride  Data shown is the fraction folded after 12 hours compared to a fully folded sample.
Figure 6 (right): Ability of 6-his purified GFP variants to  refold  in different concentrations guanidine hydrochloride after complete denaturation.  Data shown is the fraction folded after 12 hours compared to a fully folded sample. Data shown for both cases are averages of three experiments.
Conclusion
Two improved GFP variants were standardised into BioBrick format and their in vivo and in vitro properties were compared to mut3 GFP:
Superfolder GFP represents a major improvement for in vivo GFP expression and will hence be extremely useful for synthetic biology applications: Its 4fold increased fluorescence  intensity and the 3.5 fold higher speed at which it develops fluorescence in vivo are likely to be very useful features, especially with regard to the reduction of the copy number of synthetic regulatory circuits to low- or single-copy whilst still maintaining the"

Conclusion
USER transformant from last Saturday didn't seem very good and we speculate that this could be because of membrane stress caused by all of the membrane proteins that we are suddenly incorporating. We will try to get around this by making a vector with an arabinose inducible promoter. Then there will be no damaging protein expression before we apply arabinose.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Integrated practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the anaerobes have moved in"". In response to this, we discussed the problem with our panel of supervisors and took advice about the incorporation of an antibacterial instead of an antibiotic into the SMITe. We were encouraged that this might be possible, but unfortunately did not have time to be able to develop and adapt the idea further (so far).
Furthermore, we considered the possible consequences of releasing previously stagnant bacteria from a biofilm into the local wound environment, but also to face the immune system and possibly systemic circulation of the individual being treated.
Again, we are currently far from the point of confronting these issues directly, as the foundations of our idea are still emerging. However, we concluded that there are a number of possible outcomes:
1) Bacteremia- serious and better avoided but with the advantage that bacteria could now be targeted through intravenous antibiotics...rather than festering in a wound and dormantly developing resistance following attempts to clear wounds with systemic treatment
2) Successful immune clearance of the bacteria and rapid healing of the wound (ideal)
3) Unknown effects!
See our safety page for more detailed consideration of these issues.
Ethical Approval:
Professor Rotimi introduced the concept of seeking ethical approval to trial SMITe, with the concern that coupling it with an antibiotic could promote the risks of resistance. However, we considered further reaching complications of ethical approval and whether SMITe as a novel concept has more benefits to offer than risks.
How could you conduct ethically acceptable trials, not knowing what this structure might do? This issue is of paramount importance in trialing all drug candidates, so we respond to this question by intending to follow safety and toxicity testing protocols and working from the ground up in terms of in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. We feel it could offer a possible low risk therapy for individuals who have tried all else and have life or limb threatening wounds.
Is the concept really new? We know already that not many biological wound dressings are in use but spider silk use in wounds dates back centuries, as it was observed to be non-immunogenic. As a treatment platform however, our SMITe structure has many benefits to offer over the silk itself, including the futuristic possibility of constituting a personalised medication.
Could it be possible that in the future we could all attend a doctor's surgery, have our wound ""read & imaged"" in terms of it's microbiology and landscape, and a personalised SMITe dressing synthesised there and then! This is based on the thought that if spider silk can be coupled with S. aureus combat proteins... why not others?

The purpose of these programs is granting funds and financing projects, with an estimate of one to three million pesos for activities directly related to research on scientific and technological development(Conacyt.gob.mx., 2017). In case this strategy does not work, it is planned to be an intensive pre-sales program to potential clients, which will provide us with commercial validation and financial support. Once we reach our equilibrium point, exemplified in point 4 of the image, we will seek private investment so we can expand our production capacity to meet market demand.
Exit strategy
The exit strategy of this new company will be considered, only if an appropriate offer is submitted. In a posterior stage, it is anticipated by the team that the offers probably proceed of companies that their products are established agricultural supplies in the world market such as Bayer or Innovak. With the finality of saving time and thousands of dollars in the investigation, improvement, and development of new products, this kind of companies searches for the most viable alternative to maintaining as the top markets companies and investing in a big amount of money in investigations with a product ready for the market.
Nevertheless, if the offers do not fulfill our expectations, we will follow the business model to our company, as such we propose previously. Due to we trust that the earnings at the moment of commercializing our product will be enough in addition to the investment funds or loans, we can invest in equipment and build our own facilities where we will continue researching to continue solving severe problems in the agriculture fields.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Safty_-_-_TEXT.html," in solution in real-time. Using a biosensor seems to be a good solution to this problem.
This idea was inspired by the naturally-occurring metal-ion-induced promoters. Ligating this kind of promoters with a reporter gene such as RFP is a common idea to visibly monitor the concentration of metal ions. Take copper as an example: after browsing through parts, we found copper-ion-induced promoters in both E.coli and S.cerevisiae. Actually, the ability of E.coli and S.cerevisiae to tolerate copper ions differs from each other. E.coli's maximum tolerance level to copper ions is 1 mM, which is much less than that of S.cerevisiae's (over 15mM in YPD medium and 6.25 mM in SC medium). Considering the response range, the budding yeast is a much better host for copper detection.
We built a biosensor based on the CUP1 promoter and yEmRFP to monitor the concentration of copper ions. The response range of this biosensor was characterized by a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700). To improve the sensitivity of the biosensor and enlarge the response intensity when it is induced, we used error-prone PCR to obtain lots of promoter mutants and then characterized them.
CONSTRUCTION
The biosensor consists of two main parts. One is the Cu-induced promoter CUP1p, the other is yEmRFP, which is modified from a mCherry mRFP to adapt to the transcription environment in yeast. The promoter was synthesized without RFC sites (XbaI) and the RFP was amplified by PCR. We used overlap PCR to combine the two parts and added two restriction sites on the ends. By digestion and ligation, we constructed this biosensor on the plasmid pRS416 which contains a selective marker URA3. After that, we sequenced this part with M13F and M13R as primers. The sequencing result showed that this construction was successful, so we can take the next step – characterization.

Game stage
We designed 2 games with the combination of iGEM and synthetic biology. We used our board game Bio-Chess and iGEM Q&A to make students get to know us in a more fun and comprehensive way. Only those who wins the Bio-Chess will have a chance to join in the Q&A part. And the quiz part is also based on the chess procedure. Through these games, students know more about iGEM and synthetic biology. They said that it was of great fun and the designing of Bio-Chess is unexpected and brilliant.
iGEM Introduction
On the introduction, we told the pre-iGEMers what is synthetic biology and iGEM. Through introduction, they got to know iGEM in a more specific way. Different from what they searched on the internet, we told them what we would do for the competition and what we would gain in joining this. After the introduction, high school students and undergraduates showed their great interests in it and asked many questions about what they should do and prepare for iGEM. And we also did a live show on the hottest platform in China with over 1300 people watching.

LA_Biohackers,2014,Team:LA Biohackers#Practice and Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," may include adenovirus, all human and non-human primate blood contaminated specimens, and herpes simplex virus. BSL-2 suggests restricted lab access during  experimental work, biological safety cabinets, biohazard signs, specific training in handling of agents and personnel protective equipment. Risk Group 3 (RG3) agents are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available. RG3 agents fall under a Biosafety Level of 3 (BSL-3), and may include M. tuberculosis and concentrated Lentivirus. Risk Group 4 (RG4) agents are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available. The latter two groups stipulate much more strenuous safety guidelines, but most aspiring community laboratories will be unlikely to work with  agents falling under RG3 or RG4. 13, 15, 16
In the context of the LA Biohackers’ experiment, the primary types of experimental agent,  Bacillus subtilis or Eschericia coli, fall under RG1 and BSL-1. The aim of the experiment, however, is  to use these agents as hosts for the DNA of agents that are more difficult to modify either due to the complexities of their growth requirements or lack of transformational tools, such as Mycoplasm  genetalium. According to the NIH Guidelines, experiments involving the DNA of agents from RG2,  RG3 within a nonpathogenic host may be performed under BSL-2 containment guidelines.  Additionally, experiments involving the DNA of agents from RG4 within a nonpathogenic host may be  performed under BSL-2 containment guidelines after demonstrating that only a totally and irreversibly  defective fraction of the agent’s genome is present in the given recombinant.13 Thus, should any group  choose to apply the method demonstrated by the LA Biohackers, BSL-2 adherence will likely be  required.
Aspiring community laboratories should also be wary of their impact on the environment. Thus,  the laboratory should take great care to abide by the relevant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  regulations as well as regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA  regulations, however, would likely only apply if the group sought commercial application of their  experiments. EPA regulations that will likely apply to the aspiring community laboratory deal mainly  with the disposal of hazardous waste. For example, the LA Biohackers sought and received the  appropriate permit to allow for the disposal of their hazardous waste products.The EPA has written  detailed regulations to"

Risks of Your Project
a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
The engineered strains used in this project are the most commonly used E. coli which  may cause diarrhea, if used carelessly.
b) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
The E.coli strains may cause diarrhea,however we have inactivated all the strains strictly after experiments.
c) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab).
The E.coli strains used in our project are of low risk to the environment and we are making every effort to minimize the possible risks.
d) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
No,since all the engineered strains are frequently used by researchers all over the world and mostly exist in laboratory environments.
e) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
During the operation, the researchers are required to wear protective gears and we will inactivate all the strains strictly after experiments.

Our Goals
Our project is in the “Foundational Advance” track and similarly we wanted High School students to learn and investigate what Synthetic Biology is, and where it is heading in the future. In 2013, the University of Sydney iGEM team created Strange Nature , a Synthetic Biology writing competition for high school students, asking the question ""What problems will be caused or solved by synthetic biology?"".  We provided students with inspiration through our online learning platform, giving them a multitude of examples of the cool and kooky ways that synthetic biology can be used.
We believe in the saying 'to create is to learn', so this year we decided to continue the writing competition, asking for students to share their opinions about synthetic biology in 1000 words.  We asked students to create a 1000 word piece answering the following question:
“Which advancement in synthetic biology do you think
is the most promising, and why?”
While genetic engineering is superficially covered in the NSW and Australian High School curriculum we felt it important to try and get students to think beyond what they've been taught in class. Our aim was to encourage students to find information on Synthetic Biology on their own, and to raise awareness of the field.
Competition
Our competition was hosted on the Strange Nature website where we provided resources about what Synthetic Biology was, recent developments and future applications. The competition was open until the 1st October. We had a whole host of submissions from Dystopian future stories of genetically engineered super humans to exploding E. coli. We had more essays submitted this year than previously and while the quality of submissions varied they were all incredibly insightful to what the students think about the possibilities of Synthetic Biology. We currently have a short list of 6 pieces which we feel are well written, explore Synthetic Biology and show imagination in their responses.
Out and About
University Open Days
Over the course of the year we volunteered at our Universities Open Days, spruiking both studying Science and participating in the Strange Nature writing competition. Talking to future science students about what is possible and what may soon be possible was incredibly insightful and seeing their interest in Synthetic Biology was wonderful.

The regulation of the bacteriocin expression is a subject for external induction factors (IF). The regulating system is composed of three components; an inducing peptide - either IF or pheromone-activating factors, a trans-membrane histidine kinase or a pheromone receptor and a response regulator Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . IF are small peptides that are ribosomally synthesized at low levels as a pre-peptide and are cleaved before secretion. IF factors are either secreted by the bacteriocin producer-strain itself or concurrent of the bacteriocin producing strain Balciunas, E. M., Castillo Martinez, F. A., Todorov, S. D., Gombossy De Melo Franco, B. D., Converti, A., & Pinheiro De Souza Oliveira, R. (2013). Novel biotechnological applications of bacteriocins: A review. Food Control, 32, 134–142. . The possibility of the production of IF factors by other strains makes the regulatory and controllable aspect of bacteriocin production of a specific strain a target for quorum sensing. IF binds to the correspondent histidine protein kinase and thus activate it to phosphorylate a response regulator, which then stimulates the transcription of target genes by, binding to specific repeats that are present in many bacteriocin operons. The bacteriocin production is thereby autoregulated by the inducer peptide (IF) making it possible for the respective strain to possess positive or negative feedback or to be regulated, or even to regulate, related or competing strains. The production of IF are dependent of environmental conditions such as temperature, pH.

The proteinaceous bacteriocins are secreted out of the bacteria cell in their exponential growth phase by guidance of their respective N-terminal leader sequence Balciunas, E. M., Castillo"

HUMAN PRACTICES SUMMARY
Human practices and ethics is a very general topic which our team has talked about extensively, in an attempt to cover as many perspectives as possible.  Our main focus for our project was outreach and community engagement, which is compatible with our goal to find a solution to hair clogging in wastewater treatment facilities, as well as the tedious problem of feather waste.
Earlier this year, we were given the opportunity to attend a water summit hosted by Inside Education, called Navig8. This event gave us a more comprehensive understanding of what happens to water once it is released from the treatment center, allowing implementation planning of our project to begin.
Naturally, as a Catholic school, we also decided to reach out to our local parish. We spoke with Father Wilbert about the possible conflict that could arise between synthetic biology and our faith. This communication gave us helpful insight into the relationship between science and religion.
Throughout the year, we have participated in many collaborations, including cooperations with the University of Lethbridge high school team, as well as an iGEM team hailing from Taiwan. In addition, we have collaborated with and allowed two university iGEM teams; Rice University, as well as a Swiss university team out of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), to interview a few of our members for their platforms which feature iGEM news and interviews. This was a great way to inform and share our project with other individuals of the iGEM community.
Another way we have informed others is through our two papers that were published in Biotreks, a peer-reviewed startup journal.
As an educational aspect of iGEM, the majority of our team is participating in Synthetic Biology 15, a course that offers high school credits. Our major project is to create an infographic that educates new members of the iGEM community about a biobrick and its parts.
Lastly, we have created an ethics team tasked with analyzing both ours and Lethbridge's ethical, moral, and rational complications within the projects. This will help us understand what is and is not in society, in regards to synthetic biology.
Overall, we feel that during the 2016 season, the extensive work we have put into human practices has lead us to many"

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the extraction of potential reaction products, to be able to start a LCMS analysis in order to detect the synthesized caffeine.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

BBa_K1459005 - PmrA-PmrB(N-term)
This is N-terminal part of PmrA-PmrB two-component system native to Salmonella enterica. PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state it is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, it's intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions. In this part, PmrB protein is truncated just before iron binding tag, which enables one to put any desired tag between two parts of PmrB, to construct a detecting system based on PmrA-PmrB system. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

And this is our basic idea to propose a new way to identify reaction parameters by means of system identification and reverse engineering.
Choose a reaction network contaning the desired interaction parameters. Note that the reactants and products must exist in databse constructed above.
Search substances to find all possible reactions in the bio-network.
For each substance, every reaction will contribute none or one term of interaction at the right end of the ODE equation concerning this substance with respect to reaction's type recorded in reaction database.
Build up the ODE array to fully describe the reaction network.
Identify parameters of every term in the ODE array with accordance to the experimental data of the time course of the network's all substances' concentration. Algorithm might involve classical system identification and reverse engineering.
The identified parameters, if fall in between acceptable error region after repeated identifications, can be accepted as a standard parameter of coressponding substance.

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna_-_-_TEXT.html," One tool is a bacteria fluorescence image analyzer that segments the bacteria, counts their number, computes the size and the fluorescence intensity for each segmented bacterium. The second tool searches data in the Registry automatically to find parts by entry a part name or a string with short part description or a nucleotide sequence. You can download them from this page .
WET LAB
To obtain regulated promoters we synthesized four libraries of operator sequences, respectively for LacI, TetR, CI and LexA repressor proteins. In each library, there are three sequences each with a different repressor binding affinity. The choice of the operator should give a relative fine-tuning of promoter sensitivity to the repressor. In this part, it is explained how we designed the operator libraries and isolated single operators to clone them in the standard format. Moreover, we built and tested: a LacI regulated promoter to tune promoter activation and a lexA based promoter to study the SOS activation (UV and hydrogen peroxide). So wet!

III. Actuator - Oct4
I. Detector
Back to top ↑
Our Detector module relies on the GDF5 tissue-specific promoter to act. Here we demonstrated the specificity of GDF5 by ligating it with ChR2-eYFP and transfect it into in-differentiated mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10. The result (data not shown) shows almost no fluorescence in C3H10 cells, which means GDF5 has controlled the expression of ChR2-eYFP in non-chondrocytic C3H10 cells.
Future: We plan to transfect GDF5 into ATDC5 chondrocytes and see if it can be expressed in large amounts.
II. Supervisor - ChR2
Back to top ↑
ChR2 is a widely used membrane-cross molecule in neuron-related experiments. When illuminated, it could be penetrated by many cations, such as sodium ion(Na+), calcium ion(Ca2+) and even some organic molecules which are smaller than the hole formed by ChR2. ChR2 is sensitive, especially to the light ranging in a particular bandwidth, usually between 450nm-470nm and this is the region for blue light.
Expression of ChR2
Back to top ↑
Idea: To detect whether ChR2 is correctively expressed cross the membrane of another kind of cell, especially in mammalian somatic cells, we could transfect 293T cells with pcDNA3.1 containing the gene encoding ChR2-eYFP. If it could be expressed as the theory told us, the fusion protein--ChR2 and eYFP, will be embedded in the membrane.
Method: We have prepared coverslips in the wells of cell culture plate before adding 293T cells. The medium is composed by DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. We made transfection on the next day. After another 24h-culture, we picked up the coverslips out of the wells and washed them carefully by PBS. Then we treated them with 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride, which is known as DAPI dihydrochloride. This reagent could stain cell nuclear into blue, so it would be easy to observe with the help of microscope.
Result: As we expected, we find the blue points which represent cell nuclears are surrounded by green outer covering under Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica), as"

Comparison
SynBio Map Entries of East Asian Countries
The SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in synthetic biology research. It is a good tool to compare the trend of synthetic biology around the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (""Synthetic biology project,"" ).
With 369 entries in the map, the United States has the most entries in the SynBio map. This value exceeds the sum of all the map entries of Asian countries combined. This indicates that the United States is an important player on the global synthetic biology stage - ""Synthetic biology project"".
In Asia, Japan, with 22 entries has the most entries followed by Mainland China with 20 entries. Considering the fact that no entries were listed in 2009, we can infer that the synthetic biology scene in Asia, especially in Japan and China is rapidly taking shape. Also looking at the map, we have noticed that how synthetic biology is developed in a certain country depends on the political or economic status of that country. For example, China, a socialist country, has no entries of private companies listed in the SynBio map, while Japan, a country with a free market economy, has around one third of the entries from private companies (""Synthetic biology project"").
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Many different teams all around the world participate in the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. In this competition, teams use methods of synthetic biology to develop their projects. Because the iGEM competition and synthetic biology are closely related, we have searched for information on the number of teams that took part from East Asia to make a comparison and ultimately infer the trend of synthetic biology in these countries. Using such statistics is a common way to"

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," This will limit eventually the extra time that is required.
Unforeseen scale-up problems are also a risk that we have to take into account. For example, it appears that bacteria sometimes react differently in a large reactor than in a small variant. When such an incident happens, this can have a major influence on the total investment. Therefore, it is important to minimize the probability of occurrence. We will talk with experts in this field in an early stadium of the development. Furthermore, we believe that making prototypes is very important to minimize this risk. Finally, we think it is wisely to use mathematical models and literature for this. This all should make it unlikely to have scale-up problems.
It is also possible that there are no qualified employees available. However, we think it is very unlikely this is the case and otherwise we think it is relatively easy to educate the new employees. After all, we have a new product, but we are operating in already existing industries with well-educated employees.
For some companies supply problems of raw material can be a major problem. We expect that this is not the case for our company, because we do not use very limited available and very specific materials. Therefore, we are not dependent on one specific supplier. It is likely that sometimes suppliers are not able to supply on time because of supply problems or because they are bankrupt, but the consequences are considered to be insignificant because there are always alternative suppliers.
Financing
Market size
First we will focus on the Dutch and German market. The total market size of both markets is equal to 36.5 GW. Based on the governmental goals, the market size has to grow to 74 GW in the year 2020. This means that the growth potential is equal to 37,5 GW. Currently there are 81 solar panel manufactures in Germany, which have in total around 50% of the market share of both countries (""Solar Panel Manufacturers,"" 2016; Wirth, 2016) .
Based on these data, we have estimated the potential market size. We believe that there is a potential market of 187,5 MW in the first 4 years. This is equal to 1% of the estimated market growth of the German companies.

The BioLens will be further designed and tested during the first half of 2017. The cost breakdown of this phase is shown in Table 3.

Cell Surface Display: Proposals
The first proposed system our feasibility study will examine, while searching for a way to keep extracellular enzymes close together, is based on displaying proteins at high density on an E. coli outer membrane. This type of display is called ""cell surface display"".
We will attempt to design such a system for cellulases, and see if we can get it to work.

Outline
In order to get a normal enzyme displayed on the E. coli outer membrane, the enzyme must be fused to a carrier protein; that is, one which is naturally transported to the outer membrane.
Berkeley 2009 tried several different carrier proteins with several different passenger enzymes, and had success in many areas. However, when they tried attaching cellulases, they weren't so successful - of the two quantified cellulases, one worked just as well without the carrier (Cel5b) and the other didn't work (Cel9a, as compared to negative control).
We will try a different carrier. The BioBrick BBa_K265008 made by UC Davis 2009 is a synthetic, codon-optimised sequence, based on GenBank AF013159 and coding for the first 211 and last 97 amino acids of Ice Nucleation Protein (INP, normally coded by the inaK gene) from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. It seems promising as a carrier of enzymes. Fusions are carried out at the INP C"

We should only run the gel for 20-30 mins this time (as opposed to several hours).  Also, when imaging, we should flip the gel upside down for easier comparison to the ladders.
Competent cell protocol will be provided by Adrian.

--------------------------------------------------
This is an example of the calculations involved:
1 ug of plasmid used per SINGLE transformation.  (we could use 0.5 ug of each plasmid for a double transformation).  OD after the incubation period indicates approximately 1x10^8 cells.  We resuspend this in 1 mL and then add 100 uL to each transformation.  Assuming that the cells themselves take up a negligible volume, this means that 1x10^7 cells goes into each transformation.  This assumption is slightly off, seeing as the cells usually take up an additional 100-200uL.  Thus, let's say 8.33x10^6 cells goes into each transformation.  These cells are then diluted into a volume of 460 uL (adding 360 to the 100 already there), heat shocked for 40 mins, and then spun down and resuspended in 1 mL.  Of this 1 mL, let's say that you directly plate out 20 uL or 100 uL (just as we did on 7/23/08).  This ends up being 1.66x10^5 cells or 8.33x10^5 cells, respectively or about 16,000 or 83,000 cells.  Even if the transformation efficiency is 10%, one would still have to count about 1600-8300 colonies on the plates.  This would be impossible and would yield no isolated colonies.
Thus, after resuspending in 1 mL, one can then do two dilutions by 100x.  The first dilution will be 10 uL in 1 mL of water, which will yield 8.33x10^4 cells in 1 mL.  If you plate out 20 uL or 100 uL of this first dilution, you put 1.66x10^3 cells or 8.33x10^3 cells on the plates.  Then, if the transformation efficiency is 10%, you will be able to count 166-833 colonies, which is a lot, but more manageable.  The second dilution"
Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge#Practices Current_-_-_TEXT.html," land. Remaining pests on particular crops are killed in order to prepare the soil for the following season. Crop burning is considered a quick and easy method for clearing farmland, but it is usually only used by farmers when other methods for clearing pests is unsuccessful. A burning permit is required by farmers interested in crop burning, which may end up being expensive if used continuously [11]. Bigger risks that come with crop burning include air pollution, soil pollution, and an increase in soil erosion from wind and water. Crop burning also has a big impact in local ecosystems surrounding farm land [12].
Buffer Zones
Buffer Zones are placed between organic crop fields and fields containing genetically modified (GM) crops to protect the organic farms from any contact or contamination, keeping organic crops as close to organic as possible. Contamination of organic crops by GM crops can occur through many different methods such as: gene transfer through cross-pollination, seed translocation, and contact with inorganic pesticides [13]. Wheat pollen has been detected to travel up to 50 meters via pollen drift [13] therefore, buffer zones must be greater than 50 meters to have an impact. A 200 meter buffer zone is not enough to stop pollen-mediated genetic antibiotic and drug resistance [15]. When commercial scale equipment is used in harvest, an extra 50 metres is added on to the required distance between the wheat trials [14]. This extra distances helps to protect organic crops from any other form of contamination that could be transferred by the machines. In order to effectively protect organic crops from contamination the distance required for isolation should be further tested and increased.

Hangzhou-H14Z,2015,Team:Hangzhou-H14Z#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," was written in simplified chinese. Also, we put some useful knowledges there such as the bio-switch. Abundant people has visited this website and learnd a lot about synthetic biology and our school.
AP center's website
All of our team members came from Hangzhou #14 highschool's Ap center. And we also put the synthetic biology's link there. Consequently, more students and facilities can see it.
The official website of Hangzhou #14 high school
This is the offcial website of our school. And you can find aboved links there.
     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Occupational Health and Safety Committee and the Environmental Health and Safety Office of the Georgia Institute of Technology has approved Professor Brian Hammer’s laboratory (the lab under which the GT iGEM 2012 team works) for Biosafety Level 2 Research and no concerns have been raised by the committee as regards to our project. As stated above, we have been in constant touch as regards to general lab safety with our department’s lab safety officer Marc Pline and have adhered to all the basic safety protocols.
Combined efforts of all iGEM teams to ensure safety
With such a young iGEM team comprising of all undergraduates, there is a sharp learning curve associated with learning lab techniques as well as lab safety protocols. The Georgia Tech iGEM team attended biological laboratory safety classes which helped, but many things are being learned along the way. So, as an effort to make students aware about lab safety early on in their science careers, we will be combining a basic biosafety class with our outreach program at high school. Also, we propose using the media technology to generate an online, visual course on the basic biosafety issues that are specifically related to iGEM research process.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Model#EKD_-_-_TEXT.html," diffusion to enzyme B. This follows Fick’s Law of diffusion 4. In order to meet this condition the concentration of the first substrate must be held constant. Since the first substrate is being consumed by enzyme A, it must be kept in flow to the system.
Condition (2) describes the physical nature of the system; the enzymes attached to prefoldin are a finite distance apart.
For Condition (3), the second enzyme functions as a sink, removing S2 particles from the system and creating the final product IAA. Similarly the rate of reaction for enzyme B is dependent on the concentration of substrate 2 present; as with any enzyme reaction, thus it is a first order sink 6.
Condition (4) is important to define the diffusion gradient and was verified by the molecular dynamics simulations .
The final condition determines how the model treats the concentration of substrate at very large distances from the source enzyme. Allowing the substrate to escape to infinity implies the concentration tends to zero as distance tends to infinity. This avoids the complexities of determining how long it might take for the reaction to complete by considering the probability of the prefoldin-enzyme complex and escaped substrate colliding due to random walk 3.
Enzyme Kinetics
The IAA reaction is a 2-step sequential reaction:
Figure 1: The enzymatic patway for the production of IAA.
Each enzyme interacts with a single substrate to produce a single product, and each enzyme has its own set of kinetic parameters. We employed the indole acetic acid pathway as a model enzyme reaction, as the enzymes are readily available with well-defined kinetic parameters.
The Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation (equation 1) describes the kinetics of an enzyme-substrate interaction under a given set of environmental conditions. MM kinetics were used to describe the effective rates of product formation and consumption at each enzyme in the sequential reaction.
$$\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \frac{Vmax[S]}{Km + [S]} \tag{1} $$
The Km or Michaelis constant is an affinity constant for the particular enzyme-substrate interaction, whilst the Vmax is the maximum speed of the enzyme when substrate concentration is saturated. The equation is pseudo first order in this sense, as substrate concentration is high, enzyme speed (V) approaches Vmax, but whilst it is low, the MM equation holds true.
To simplify the model, we assume that the first substrate (tryptophan) is maintained in the system at a constant, saturating concentration, thus the first enzyme produces the second substrate (IAM) at a"
XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#wetlabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," perform ligation again from parts.  BL21 is not a safe choose for storing plasmids, which is a fact that we were  too late to realize. That means we are going to have a tough time, much tougher  than before.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PcI-RLT.
Result:  The capsules were spherical and droplets rarely stuck together. But they didn't  emit fluorescence as well as they were supposed to. Maybe the bacteria sample  didn't carry a steady PcI-RLT and some of the plasmid had lost during the  transfer process. Or we didn't effectively embed the bacteria into the  capsules.
Fluorescence  Test:
While we  were preparing the fluorescence measurements this morning, we found strain – PBADRETPcIRLT4J – falsely expressed in the basal medium. So we canceled today’s  test.
Thursday,  September 6th
Digit  Display:
Sophia  flight from Kunming this morning and back to work.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PBAD-RLT. After  cultivated in 100rpm shaker for 3 hours, added 500uL 5mM Ara.
Result:  The capsules were almost spherical, but some were trailing, and droplets rarely  stuck together. But after adding Ara, they didn't emit fluorescence in the  following 8 hours. The reason is still being explored.
 
Friday,  September 7th
Digit  Display:
Isolate  plasmid and ran on a gel for restriction analysis. Result was still  disappointing. We now gave up the original plan completely and construct  circuits from parts. Sophia had transformed some plasmid to DH5α before, so we felt a little release.
Cell  Immobilization:
Explored  a better procedure, and modified the ratio of the solutions.
Prepared  more spherical capsules which seldom leak.
Fluorescence  Test:
We took  a long test from yesterday afternoon to this morning for determining the  fluorescence intensity curves of a strain constructed by the group of Time  Delay. And we designed a gradient with four levels of arabinose concentration – 0, 0.1, 1, 10 mM. Data from this test would be references for our next test  about other homogeneous strains. In general, data gave no distinct connection  between arabinose concentration and values of fluorescence intensity"

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 3_-_-_TEXT.html," built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

They improved the system behavior and back-end                     of the software and gave some advice on during the implementation process.
Bi-direction collaboration
        During the whole collaboration process, we and SYSU-Software                     established very closed friendship. We also gave our feedbacks after they got an embryonic form of their                     main project.

To show this, we first inserted the chromoproteins downstream of our choice of constitutive promoter (BBa_J23110) . We prepared overnight cultures from a single colony and a dilution was made the next morning to normalize it to an OD600 of 0.65. This is to ensure the samples have the same initial cell density. 20µl of each sample was then plated onto a chloramphenicol plate. Pictures were taken at various time points to monitor colour visibility.
It can be concluded that both chromoproteins produce visible colours at the same time point and hence is suitable to use for our project.
Improved PalcA BioBrick (BBa_K2092002)
Figure 10. Schematic representation of the PCR method used to add the missing restriction sites on the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix.
PalcA (BBa_K678001) is a BioBrick requested from the iGEM HQ as it was unavailable in the 2016 kit. Sequencing results confirmed the absence of two restriction sites – XbaI and SpeI on the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix. As these two sites are crucial in the assembly of our composite parts, we designed primers to add the two missing restriction sites.
Table 5: Table showing the primer sequences used to add the missing restrictions sites XbaI and SpeI on the PalcA (iGEM DTU-Denmark 2011, BBa_K678001) BioBrick Prefix and Suffix.
We carried out PCR using the primers we designed.  To verify that we had successfully reintroduced the missing XbaI and SpeI restriction sites in PalcA (iGEM DTU-Denmark 2011, BBa_K678001) , we performed restriction enzyme digest using restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI before cloning PalcA into the submission vector pSB1C3 and transformed into E. coli DH5α.  Lastly, we successfully demonstrated that XbaI and SpeI restriction sites had been added into PalcA by digesting the plasmid using restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI (Fig. 11) and submitted this improved PalcA (BBa_K2092002) as one of our new BioBricks this year.

Figure 2: XL1-Blue (left) and DH5α subjected to cycling (37-41ºC) temperature conditions. Compared to the controls, the former strain did not exhibit any significant change in the growth rate, as deduced by the OD600 after 3 hours (DH5α) and 15 hours (XL1-Blue). By contrast, DH5α significantly increased its growth compared to both controls. The statistical parameters are cited in the text.
The ANOVA analysis performed with the 16 replica of each strain revealed no significant differences in the growth of Xl1-Blue (F=0.870, p=0.433). However, the differences in the growth of DH5α did have statistical significance (F=63.95, p<0.001).
Conclusion
Is E. coli sensitive to fatigue of materials in the form of cycling conditions? Yes! at least DH5α, but in a positive way. Cycling temperatures resulted in an emergent property: increased growth. In order to check whether this effect was due to a mechanical resuspension (convection) linked to the cycling conditions, we performed a specific experiment with dead, antibiotic-treated E. coli cells (Kanamicine and Cloranfenicol) subjected to extreme (30 to 50ºC) thermal fluctuations. The following figure shows that convection forces might not be the reason of such increased growth (no significant differences found in a t-Student test for 2 groups and 16 replicas; t=1.371, p=0.180). A biological explanation may be hypothesized: cycling conditions allow a range of optimal enzymatic activities to be met.
Figure 3: O.D.600 of antibiotic-killed E. coli suspensions of strain XL1-Blue incubated under cycling (30ºC-50ºC) and average (40ºC) conditions. No significant differences suggest that convection forces are not the main key players in the increased growth of E. coli incubated under thermally cycling condition. t-Student test 95% showed no significant differences, as explained in the text.

Market Strategy
To attract customers, Synbiologica will initially donate and sell units at a low price to researchers to try and break into the research market. Additionally, representatives from our company will attend scientific conferences of related fields with the intention of soliciting our product to potential customers whose research would benefit from BEAR. Advertisements on scientific journal websites and in scientific journals will also be used to advertise our product.
The majority of BEAR’s initial market value will stem from the research conducted by Synbiologica’s first customers who have incorporated BEAR into their methods. BEAR is designed to yield fast, accurate, real-time results, which is a form of data collection that has not yet been used in hormone research. As researchers begin to acquire results using BEAR, they will publish more scientific papers and advertise BEAR through a description of their methodology.
Eventually, Synbiologica hopes to license out the finalized BEAR product to existing biotechnology companies. This would allow us the ability to develop other technologies rather than just mass-producing one product, and the biotechnology companies would have more financial backing to promote BEAR as well as the resources to manufacture the device of a large scale. In addition, these companies already have employees with the skills to manufacture, market, and sell BEAR. We intend to sell a licence to our technology to these companies and they will be responsible for getting BEAR to its final customers.
Our pricing policy would be penetration pricing. Synbiologica intends to sell individual BEAR units and the accompanying set of modular units for as low a cost as possible to establish the benefits and use of BEAR in the scientific and medical community, thus gaining market share.
Initial distribution of BEAR will be very small while Synbiologica is still in the research and development phase and can be achieved by mail or courier. As the product gains market value, Synbiologica will contract a distribution company"

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Seminar_-_-_TEXT.html," alcohol reduces the production of hepcidin.
You mentioned doctors. I want to put things in perspective: in France there are around 200 000 doctors, and there are around 200 000 patients, thus a doctor will have on average one case in all his/her career.
Q3: According to you, will the synthetic mini-hepcidin induce an immune response?
A3: The mini-hepcidin is produced with major modifications, so yes.
Q4: Once iron is stored in organs, how can it be eliminated?
A4: It can not, unless by bloodletting.
Pierre Brissot: ""Hemochromatosis: its diagnostic and its treatment""
Summary
Hemochromatosis is a frequent genetical disease: in France one person over 300 is predisposed to develop it. Indeed, it is a disease with an incomplete penetrance, which means that all the people who are homozygote for the mutation will not develop the disease. Hemochromatosis is also a delayed disease because the symptoms are long to appear: hemochromatosis is long silent. The first symptoms are chronic tiredness and rheumatism. As they are not very specific symptoms, 5 to 10 years often pass between their appearance and the diagnosis. The excessive accumulation of iron has serious consequences on the organs, mainly on the liver. The liver is indeed the first barrier of the body against iron. The over absorption of iron in the liver leads to its cirrhosis, and when the liver can no more stock iron, iron goes to the pancreas and the heart. The most usual genetic mutation causing hemochromatosis is a mutation of the “iron gene” on the chromosome 6, called C282Y homozygosity. This mutation drastically decrease the production of hepcidin. The genetic test should be done only after a blood test determining iron level. It is also possible to use MRI to see if the liver stocks iron. Bloodletting forces the organism to use the iron stocks to renew the red blood cells. Bloodletting gives really good results, almost without any side effect, but it is not perfect: for example rheumatism remains. Moreover some patients can not get used to bloodletting. Iron chelators (in oral treatment) can thus be an alternative to bloodletting, or at least complete bloodletting.

References
Keeping track of reference order is a tedious task, when writing your project pages. In the Wiki Wizard, references are ordered automatically. They should have the reference text, and a reference id.
T​he ""id"" is used to insert citations in the content. Similar to LaTeX, they can be inserted with \ cite{ref_id} without spaces.
​""Reference text"" is the text that will be shown in the reference list.
These settings can be grabbed automatically by supplying the doi for the reference. The references will only be displayed, if the reference is used. The default themes include a reference section template which will show the reference list.
Files
Files can be uploaded to the Wiki Wizard under ""Files"". The Wiki Wizard automatically rename files to the correct namespacing, when the files are later uploaded to the wiki (see below).
Settings
The settings tab can be used to select the base url that the wiki should be upload to. This year, it is 2015.igem.org. Next year, it should be 2016.igem.org. This is also the page, where the team name should be entered, so that the Wizard can upload and rename files correctly.

BrownTwo,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," were likely dead or had lost their plasmids.
Made two glycerol stocks of J63006, since it was not glycerol stocked.  Note that both are from the same colony.
Conducted miniprep using the overnight cultures.  Spun down 1.9 mL of overall culture in two rounds of 1 mL and 0.9 mL, each 10 min.  In the future we should try to use more volume, like 5 mL.  Used 60 uL of EB.
End result of the miniprep:
J63001 - 37.1 ng/uL in ~58uL
J63002 - 29.5 ng/uL in ~58uL
J63006 - 36.5 ng/uL in ~58uL
Ran 50uL restriction digest.  In each tube we put 5uL BSA, 5uL multicore buffer, 10 uL H2O, and 27uL DNA and 1.5uL each of two enzymes.  For J63001, this turned out to be 1001.7ng of DNA and we used EcoRI and SpeI.  For J63002, this turned out to be 796.5ng of DNA and we used EcoRI and XbaI.
Stuck in incubator for 2 hours.  After incubation, put in heating block at 70 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes to kill the enzymes.  Then stuck them in the freezer.

Discovered that our parts from Caroline were on the way.  As such, we decided to make a lot of plates in preparation for their arrival.
First batch:
BactoAgar 10.0012g + 10.0021g = 20.0033g
LB Broth 10.0345g +  10.0144g = 20.1785g
Added 0.1008 g of AMP to mixture
Put into plates (make sure mixture is cool)
Note:  The agar was slightly burned when stirring on the hot plate.  This was primarily due to using too much heat to boil the agar and also due to stopping the stirring within the flask.  Will have to be more careful next time.
Second batch:
BactoAgar 10.0190g
LB Broth  10.0113g
Added 0.0502 g of AMP to mixture

Cloning Procedure:
The DNA fragment of GFP-His was amplified by PCR and digested by BamHI and PstI, followed by cloning onto Pcons-RBS-LO-BamHI/pSB1C3 which was cut by BamHI and PstI. The part has been confirmed by sequencing.  BamHI and PstI, followed by cloning onto Pcons-RBS-LO-BamHI/pSB1C3 which was cut by BamHI and PstI. The part has been confirmed by sequencing.
The AOX gene were cloned onto pSB1C3 driven by a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ) and RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) and fused with bacterial outer membrane proteins, Lpp-OmpA (LO) to display protein on the cell surface of E. coli. To test whether the gene expression system works, we cloned a reporter gene (GFP) in the same context (i.e., Pcons-RBS-LO-GFP/pSB1C3). And the gene expression level was compared to Pcons-RBS-GFP/pSB1C3 ( BBa_K1694035 ) got from NCTU-Formosa, which has the same promoter and RBS but without LO. The clones of E. coli DH5α were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37°C overnight. Because overnight cultured LB medium has a background level of fluorescence, the bacterial GFP was measured in the PBS"

Modelling
Building upon our earlier cell model for detection of polyethylene, our cell model for the degradation module aimed to show the amount of laccase our bacteria produce and its role in the degradation of one type of microplastic present in the gyre, polyethylene.  With this model we aimed to have an idea of how much plastic we could expect our system to degrade. This would then be used in further predictive modelling to calculate the amount of bacteria needed for the construction of Plastic Republic. The following diagram shows the degradation system, with each reaction Ri and each DNA species explained below.
Our cell model was made in SimBiology, which is a MATLAB extension used to run simulations of the reactions in a specified system. It shows the following reactions taking place in three 'compartments', with each DNA species and reaction explained in further detail below:
1. Outside1: in this compartment we see the association, adherence, and dissociation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from polyethylene (PE) (R1).  We rely on the POPs to induce our degradation system, increasing from 105 to 106 the specificity to our system.
2. Cell: NahR is a constitutively produced mRNA product (R9). When POP diffuses into the cell (R2), it forms a complex with NahR (R3) which then binds to the pSal"

Our open classes have let thousands of Chinese who knew nothing about synthetic biology have a concept about it, and they are very well reviewed
This was the record only two days since we had uploaded:
There are the comments from Chinese audiences:
Translation: This lecture is very interesting and very easy  to understand.
Translation: Although I am not in this field, after watching  this short lecture, I really have a brief view of the synthetic biology. SynBio really plays an important role in modern society. I am excited to see that  there are so many awesome students from the SUSTC. The more Chinese students be like them, the better the future of China will be. Good job!!!.
Translation: Great presentation, I will  always remember your words about synthetic biology and its future. It will be  better if you can pay more attention to some details like the resolution of  your slides. West China School of Medicine.S.U, chenfan.
Translation: The frame is clear, and the explanation is clear. But  you are a little serious, it will be better if you are more humorous.
