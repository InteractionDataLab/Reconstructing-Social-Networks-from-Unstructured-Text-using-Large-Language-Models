Summary
Population Modelling is concerned with the dynamics in population size  as a consequence of interactions of organisms with the physical environment, with individuals of their own species, and with organisms of other species.
We designed a dynamical population model in which we simulate the behaviour of bacteria.
We want to gain insight into the dynamics of bacteriophage infection, bacteria-phage interaction essentially is a fight for survival between two populations.  By adding a phage invasion in our simulated bacteria population we can simulate the whole infection process. The modelling of infectious processes is a tool which has been used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the future course of an outbreak and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic (Daley & Gani, 2005). Our kamikaze construction was designed to sabotage the phage lytic cycle, but our final goal is to contend the infection at the Population Scale.
We used 3 different approaches to model the population dynamics:
Multi-Scale integration using Cellular Automata : Using this system we can simulate spatial interactions as movement and biomolecules diffusion. In our model spatial dynamics are of vital importance: Quorum Sensing dynamics is one of the main aspects of the Defense System, infected E.Coli will produce AHL and will warn it’s neighbours. Using the Cellular Automata we can make direct sampling from the distributions generated by the molecular simulations in real time linking the molecular and population scales.
Delay Differential Equations System : Deterministic models can accurately simulate the behaviour of populations when the number of individuals is big. Our experiments consists of big numbers of cells so population dynamics might be approximated using deterministic models. We want to compare the stochastic and deterministic behaviours of the population.
Agent based simulation :Using an agent based model implemented using the | NetLogo ] platform we can see the general behaviour of our system in a nice graphical user interface. Link to Agent based simulation Applet .

For future projects, a video that looks into the mechanisms and the debate surrounding genetic engineering might be more beneficial in being able to influence more changes in opinion. Furthermore, better organization of the video might have helped to make the video much easier to follow along with, making it more informative to the population. Future projects could look at a variety of populations to get a larger demographic involved in the project. These results could be very interesting.
Institutional Review Board
In order for the Penn State team to conduct research in the form of a survey using human participants, the surveys and recruitment process needed to be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Three of the students, Alex Bina , Lauren Rossi and Vishal Saini received training through the IRB in conduction sociological and biomedical research. After training, and with the help of Leland Glenna, an associate professor of rural sociology and science, technology, and society at Penn State, the research proposal was reviewed and approved, as proven by the implied consent form .

For the year of 2017, we picked up two                                     candidate projects – both of which were trying to provide possible solutions to                                     present-day issues – one was “Rabies Vaccine Taken by Mouth” and the other was                                     “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E. coli”. We always want to be of help of our world; so before making the final choice, we looked carefully into the potential                                     social and scientific value of both projects, by means of initiating field survey,                                     interview professors and experts from universities and authorities as well as                                     collaborating with other iGEM teams.

Upon binding of NO• a conformational change in NorR frees the AAA+ domain which allows for transcription initiation. 10 . Based on these considerations, we included in our detection system the promoter element 'PnorV', which is resposive to NO-activated norR, allowing us to sense the presence of nitric oxide.
N-ACYL HOMOSERINE LACTONES

Our goal is to not only detect a general inflammation biomarker, but also specific molecules secreted by the microbiota, which would allow us to gain insights into microbiome composition. One well-known class of molecules secreted by many bacterial species belongs to the quorum sensing (QS) system. QS molecules act as bacterial hormones allowing intra- and interspecies communication. Among other things, they control biofilm formation and growth behaviour. Furthermore, manipulation of QS signals has been found to affect the gut microbiota and its composition 12 . The best known subclass of QS molecules are the N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL). Previous findings have shown abnormal levels of a number of AHL species in IBD patients. One of the AHLs that has been found to be upregulated in IBD is 3-hydroxy-hexanoyl-HSL (3-OH-C6-HSL) 13 . A well characterized regulatory protein that senses a very similar HSL (3-oxo-C6-HSL) is EsaR from Erwinia stewartii that was used by a former iGEM team . The special feature of EsaR is its regulatory behaviour: while most HSL-responsive elements are inducible activators, EsaR is a repressor that dissociates from the DNA in the presence of HSL. This is important when designing a genetic circuit as a repressor is thought to be less leaky than an activator. Based on all these considerations, we chose HSL (3-oxo-C6-HSL) as the microbiome-associated target to be detected by our genetically engineered E. coli. As our target HSL is not the natural ligand for EsaR, we designed and commenced experiments for the directed evolution of EsaR in order to change its specificity.

Figure 5: Our pupils test their titration experiment with an optophone that translates colour to sound.
Together, we observed the change in conductivity during a titration and tracked the color change of indicators. The optometer was then used to determine the pH of the solution and if the equivalence point was already met. To investigate exemplary esterifications, a commonly used reaction in the food and pharmaceutical industry, but also an easy method in the follow-up chemistry of 3HPA. Displaying a distinctive and often pleasant smell, many esters can be identified by adding such an olfactory dimension to the experiments. This aided the acoustic output of the chemophone and optophone.
After this chemical introduction we moved on to the synthesis of aspirin one of the most common pharmaceuticals of the world. We taught the pupils how they can identify their own product by breaking it apart again. A complexation reaction was utilized to react to chemical changes of the target molecule, leaving us with color response that could once more be translated to sound.
Excerpt: Study Perspective for the Visually Impaired.
After our Open Laboratory Days, it didn't feel right to us to just give the pupils a taste of how much fun it can be to experiment without giving them a perspective on how to get there themselves. At first, we to had no idea how a student with poor to no vision should be able to study biology or chemistry, subjects that are still very much like artisan work, where seeing what you do is so important.
So, we decided to find out! Click here to head over to our Human Practices section for more information on university politics for the visually impaired!
Global accessibility - A Look beyond Marburg
The World-Wide-Web has the power to remove barriers in communication and interaction that many people with disabilities face in the physical world if programmed properly. Unbiased web design provides access to all people independent of ability or interface. At this point in time, a lot people with vision impairment still need to adjust web pages themselves to make them accessible to them.
Experiencing the scientific hunger of the visually impaired during our Open Laboratory Days we questioned:
Why should the visually impaired be excluded from the amazing results iGEM teams achieve each year? As a part of our Integrated Human Practices project, we asked iGEM teams to design their wiki in ways accessible to people with disabilities. Through this, we aim to make the results of the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. For more"

30th July - 6th August
BioBrick Transformation
Last Thursday, the primers VF2 and VR arrived. These primers allow a confirmation of a succesful transformation of most BioBrick parts by means of PCR. The resulting fragment length depends on the specific BioBrick DNA.
Using VF2 and VR, a colony PCR are was conducted with all colonies that were obtained with chemical competent cells so far. Two colonies with the yeast ADH1 promoter (No. 1 and 2, see left photo) and three colonies with a GFP generator (No. 3-5, see left photo) were identified as positive. Thus, all colonies are positive, but the transformation efficiency is too low, since the result was only one or zero colonies per transformation attempt.
Electroporation should give higher efficiencies. An attempt with a new BioBrick ( ADH1 terminator ) resulted in 69 colonies! Ten of them were analysed using PCR. The resulting fragment should have a length of 461 bp, but from the eigth positive colonies fragments between 650-750 bp were obtained (see right photo). This is probably due to a mutation which might result in a different binding location for one of the primers. Another explanation might be that the denoted length is wrong. Since this BioBrick is not important for our project, it will be disregarded.

The transformation efficiency of the electroportation was significant higher than of the chemical competent cells. Therefore, an own stock of electric competent cells was made.

Cells are viable, growth curve done. 11µm PS beads shown to be moved by bacteria (MG1655); we observed ‘jiggling’ of beads when bacteria present (not seen in no-bacteria control). Also, we observed significant movement in different directions (distances of approx 1x to 5x length of the beads by eye) of beads that were close together, suggesting that movement was not due to currents in the medium. We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small"

CCA San Diego and iGEM Goes Green
We have participated in iGEM Goes Green to consider a more eco-friendly way to work in our lab. The iGEM Goes Green initiative centers around the idea of raising awareness around the environmental impacts we, especially as members of iGEM, have on the world around us and how we can lessen the negative side effects of those impacts. Namely, iGEM Goes Green is focused on spreading awareness on what our carbon footprint is. Our project is supposed to help clean the environment and we want to be effective in our lab methods to make sure that we keep the environment clean, while researching a way to save it! In one of our many contact points with them, we - along with our school’s Ecology Club - sent suggestions for their Go Green Guide, a document that outlines exactly how one can conduct a more eco-friendly lifestyle in and out of the laboratory. We detailed the impact of several other processes (that did not deal with the conventional tips) concerning greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Eco Club helped by planting a tree on our campus for the purpose of compensating for our carbon footprint created by our flights to Boston, as well as to establish our collaboration with TU Dresden.

Tongji-Software,2018,Team:Tongji-Software#Human practice_-_-_TEXT.html," pathways in papers had a higher score in software assessment. （这里插入软件validation图片） fvrfbgtbt Organism recommendation Inspiration from iGEMers: We attended the iGEM Eurasian meet-up in August and communicated a lot with other iGEM teams. Through those communications, we learned that most of them faced the problem of organism selection in pathway engineering. It inspired us to add a new function, organism recommendation to make our software more practical.
Improvement: Based on this human practice, we develop a model to scoring each microorganism. After ranking all those score, we provide users with top five organisms to choose. At the same time, related information about organism and pathway are optional to get. SMILES Comparison Inspiration from R&D staffs in WuXi AppTech: Original thinking about SMILES comparison is derived from our visits to WuXi AppTec. Experts of WuXi AppTec proposed an idea to us. They said that sometimes their company got or designed a novel compound which did not exist in current database, and they want to find a possible way to synthesize it. So it came to our mind that what if we could compare the similarity between different compounds and select the most similar compound as a trigger to help us design new synthetic pathway, which can be very useful in small molecular drug discovery and synthesis.
Improvement: We added a new function called SMILES Comparison into Alpha Ant. First we convert user’s input SMILES into molecular fingerprints by using RDkit toolbox. Then we compute similarity score between input compound and compound in databases by comparing their fingerprints. At last, we offer the similarity score and ranking list to users. Software Assessment: Results validation： We visit Shanghai R&D center of Meihua Group in September. Meihua Group is one of the largest MSG manufacturers in the world. It is the largest amino acid producer in China and an important member of the global bio-fermentation field. Their R&D center is dedicated to do research in amino acid production by bio-fermentation. There are several mature production lines for amino acid, which utilizes pathway engineering. We used these efficient pathways to evaluate the results of our software.
The result of validation is as follows. （之后插入软件validation的照片） vrtbtytbvgtrvtbht Aspects to be improved We visit R&D center of Cathay Industrial Biotech in September.

Modelling
Computational simulations save time and money in biological research as well as in preparation of large-scale industrial processes. In view of the pragmatic nature of our project, we sought to apply both.
1. Kinetic modelling
2. Process modelling
Process Considerations
In developing a commercial version of the 'Edinburgh Process' for conversion of cellulose to starch, the following points must be considered:
Some of the glucose released by cellulose hydrolysis will be used by the 'Micromaize' organisms for growth and enzyme synthesis. We therefore envisage use of an aerobic process (rather than an anaerobic process, as envisaged by most developers of cellulose bioconversion processes) to minimise the amount of glucose which is used in this way, as more energy is available from aerobic degradation of glucose, leaving the maximum amount of glucose available for conversion to starch.
Aerobic processes are more expensive to operate than anaerobic processes due to the greater cost of aeration, mixing, and cooling. However, cellulose degradation is intrinsically slower than use of soluble substrates, so the power requirements for aeration and mixing are expected to be much lower than for a typical aerobic process, and it may be possible to use a non-traditional bioreactor such as a continuous tower reactor (airlift or pressure cycle reactor)or a rotating drum device, rather than a more usual (and more expensive) aerated stirred tank reactor.
Since starch is an insoluble product (unlike glucose, the more usual target product of cellulose bioconversion processes), it can be recovered simply by harvesting and drying the cells. Further processing requirements will be dictated by the size of starch grain that can be achieved in bacterial cells. Starch granules are generally much larger than glycogen granules, but since bacteria do not naturally produce starch, we cannot accurately estimate this until some experimental evidence is available.
Since starch is insoluble, it does not exert osmotic pressure and should not cause product inhibition, unlike"
Northwestern,2016,Team:Northwestern#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," investigated, particularly related to the septic shock-inducing effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on humans 17 . It has been shown that E. coli can be genetically modified such that LPS no longer lines the outer membrane 18 . Removal of LPS from the outer membrane of E. coli does not elicit an immune response from in human cells 18 .
Once all theoretical requirements for use of OMVs in mammalian systems have been met, in vivo experiments will need to be performed to test if OMV can successfully transport Cas9 and gRNA, and if Cas9 can perform gene editing after the delivery.
Finally, a macro-scale delivery method will need to be investigated. As the intestines are a likely target for CRISPR Capsules, this method will probably take the form of an oral capsule or a suppository. CRISPR Capsules could also serve as a treatment for skin infections, and in this case, would need to be suspended in a gel or cream. Liposomes are an established form of drug delivery, so we speculate that OMVs can eventually also become a renowned drug delivery system 19 .
Beyond Antibiotics; Beyond CRISPR Capsules
In nature, OMVs target a wide variety of cell types including eukaryotic hosts, meaning that CRISPR Capsules could be used wherever there is a need to bring Cas9 into a cell 20 . They might be used to modify gut flora, or even to perform gene therapy on intestinal cells. One can imagine using CRISPR Capsules to prevent cancer by converting oncogenes back to proto-oncogenes, and restoring functionality to tumor suppressor genes.
In addition, proteins other than Cas9 could be delivered via OMVs. They might be particularly useful in cases where human body cells do not readily take up a pharmaceutical in their environment. CRISPR Capsules could even be extended to non-medical applications in exogenous whole-protein delivery, such as water treatment, food preservation, or maintaining a sterile environment aboard spacecraft. These examples should not be considered boundaries. CRISPR Capsules and vesicular protein delivery hold broad potential for technological advances in the near future.

Michigan,2011,Team:Michigan#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The outcome was compared with the digested fridge stock of ADIA-I, which appears to be bad:
The expected part size should be 1320bp, and when the distance between the VF2 and VR sites is taken into account, about 1600. This part is nowhere near these two measurements. For further confirmation, the part will be digested in a 100µL reaction.
This makes sense, but with terrifying implications. Part cut with XbaI (incompletely?) yields two bands; part cut with SpeI also yields two bands; both have cut bands at predicted locations. PCR product cut with both XbaI and SpeI yields a product shorter than both others, indicating the PCR product is not a partial product. The only resonable conclusion(s) at this stage are as follows:
∴ The part is completely wrong, and was put in the wrong well (and is hence unusable.)
∴ The VF2 and VR primers somehow generated product by binding to completely wrong locations on the plasmid, while still producing predictable products.
When viewed in an earlier snapshot, bands around 150-170bp are notably missing; these would correspond with subsequent ""tail pieces"" cut off of the part by the restriction enzymes. Unfortunately, the sample appears too dilute and the cutting too incomplete if conclusions can be drawn from this missing component.
⇒ The last of AIDA-I (K257018) was transformed and plated from residue in the wells in the hopes overnight cultures + digestions will be able to resolve this matter conclusively.
⇒ A ligation of J32015 and J04500 was completed using previously digested stocks. Three ligations total were produced using the standard ligation protocol. Ligation products were plated on AMP plates.

⇒ Colony PCR was run on 6 ligation samples, as the ligation of SP (J32015) and the promoter/rbs (J04500) appears to have grown properly on the plates. Also in the PCR were colonies from the elusive ADIA-I part as well as J04450 from the RFP colonies as a control.
This gel is difficult to interpret. All ligation bands appear to be around 360-380bp in length, which, unfortunately, corresponds with J32015 without J04500. While an indication the ligation failed, the presence of these bands in both the AIDA-I part (which failed to have any other bands) as well as the RFP part are strange and may indicate nonspecific binding.

BostonU_HW,2016,Team:BostonU HW#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," successful, long term open source project. By integrating our software, with all its documentation and supporting educational material, to NONA, we have provided Neptune a community and a platform for long term sustainability.
SEE OUR WORK WITH NONA
NONA and the iGEM Community
We mentioned that our team could give NONA a hand. Indeed, Neptune is the first iGEM project to be placed on NONA, and in our discussions with NONA we found that our team could pave the way for future iGEM teams that want to have a place for their software tools.
The Problem: iGEM software tools get lost
Each year, software solutions to synthetic biology problems are generated from teams around the world. iGEM software tools are especially prone to losing support or community after they are developed, as teams that developed those tools for the competition often find it hard to maintain those projects in the years thereafter. And worse yet, there have been dozens of software tools to come from iGEM, and none of these tools have a clear or coherent locations where they can be found.
The Solution: NONA to protect iGEM software tools
Our team offers itself as a point of contact for NONA at the iGEM Giant Jamboree this year. We want to extend the hand to other iGEM teams that have developed amazing tools, but are worried about how these tools will be maintained in the future. We will have an active NONA “about” booth at our Jamboree table, where we will provide information about what NONA is, how NONA can help iGEM teams with software, and information about how these teams can contribute their tools to NONA. We will also actively help these teams contact NONA and we’ll give them information on how to properly send their tools to NONA, expediting the integration process.
We are very excited that Neptune is now part of the NONA software tool platform. We are even more excited about the incredibly potential of integrating iGEM software tools with NONA. We envision a future where iGEM is integrated with NONA such that NONA has an entire section dedicated to tools developed by iGEM teams. This would be a huge way to make software tools in synthetic biology more integrated, well documented, coherently located and above all, accessible."

Case: South America
In Latin America, the degree of medical education differs greatly on multiple levels. Between countries the contrast can already be dramatic. Mexico, for example, has advanced in developing its national standards by investing in application procedures, instruments and facilities [2]. Meanwhile, Venezuela is heavily affected by a healthcare crisis [3]. Furthermore, multiple occasions of certain institutions educating new healthcare workers which lack a minimal scientific and technical level in the process have occurred, leading to large differences in the capabilities between physicians [4]. However, in most official healthcare institutions in urban areas, education levels are expected to be appropriate and implementation of Mantis in the system should not pose any problems as it is easy to use.
Point-of-care diagnostic tests should be operated by primary healthcare workers without any formal laboratory experience and further training with the device should not take more than 2 hours [5, 6]. Hurdles encountered in later situations can be solved with the supplied manual, should training still be insufficient.

CU-Boulder,2012,Team:CU-Boulder#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," from our bathrooms to our gums and teeth. By utilizing our construct - which intercepts the bacterial signal preventing the quorum threshold from being met - the majority of biofilms would be prevented from forming. This could be utilized in a variety of different applications such as applying our construct to areas that may not receive regular cleaning. For instance applying our construct throughout a shower curtain would reduce biofilm activity and inhibit bacterial flourishing in the shower. Theoretically, stationary bodies of water prone to generating intense bacterial mats on their surface could be preemptively stopped by adding our construct.  Biofilms also form in the plants we eat, usually resulting in disease of the plant and spoilage of food. Our construct could be a marker for consumers applied to encased produce (such as bananas).  If our reporter mechanism began to glow intensely, it would be a good indicator that the food was beginning to turn bad.
While our project has relevance and application today, if it was continued to be worked on, there is much more that could be accomplished.  Many plants have defense mechanisms against biofilm, secreting proteins that inhibit the formation of biofilm similar to our project.  If in the future we could express our construct in plants, we could produce healthier plants less prone to disease and with a longer shelf life, while at the same time limiting the amount of pesticide needed to keep them from spoiling. The plants would effectively be defending themselves from pathogenic bacterial invasion and farmers would be selling a more healthy product.
Another future application for our project is developing the AHL recognition complex.  Our complex recognizes a broad range of AHLs because we wanted our construct to react to a broad range of bacteria.  If we could “tune” our receptors to recognize species-specific AHLs, we could determine bacterial environmental composition.   If we could take a broad range of reporting mechanisms all with different color outputs and have them activate when the species-specific AHL is present, then we would know exactly which bacterial species is present.  By having a cocktail of these constructs with specific reporters linked to specific AHL receptors, we could efficiently visualize a microbial environment at low cost.  This could be a useful tool diagnostically where today physicians learn so much about the body from bacterial fecal population; a bacterial population so crucial to humans that fecal transplants are undergone to re-culture humans with poor bacterial environments.  By adding this cocktail to fecal matter, it would be possible to image and observe the type of fluorescence in the feces in order to make a diagnosis. This would be especially useful to physicians in the third world who lack modern medical equipment. This goes"

Then, one of the products of the breakdown, called terephthalic acid (TPA), is fed to a microbial fuel cell which only produces electricity when TPA is present. We detect an increase in voltage from the microbial fuel cell as a signal that PET has been processed by the device, and a GPS ping can be sent to ocean researchers that PET is present in Plastiback’s location.  In this way, we break down PET and send valuable feedback to ocean plastic researchers about the distribution of ocean plastic.  Below is a schematic of the Plastiback device:
In a floating ocean bioreactor, sea water will be able to flow in. A filter will catch microplastics, which are then broken down by engineered bacteria that express PETase, the enzyme found in Ideonella Sakaiensis to degrade PET. After PET is broken down, TPA will flow to the microbial fuel cell, while the other byproduct, ethylene glycol will be collected in a separate container. In the microbial fuel cell, TPA acts as a carbon source for a type of bacteria called Delftia tsuruhatensis that will produce electrons which are shuttled to the cathode by a mediator known as methylene blue. Finally, this results in an increase in voltage we can measure as a signal that PET was broken down.
Nature’s Solution: Ideonella Sakaiensis
In order to sense PET, first we needed to figure out how to break it down. For this, we turned to nature’s solution, a recently discovered microbe that can degrade PET. This microbe, called Ideonella Sakaiensis, was discovered to metabolize PET by the Oda group at Kyoto Institute of Technology in 2016 6. The microbe produces an enzyme, called PETase, which can breakdown PET into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. This enzyme was shown by the Oda group to be more active at degrading PET than other known enzymes7. We decided this would be the key to the plastic degradation component of our system.  Although the structure of PETase is yet unsolved, we used a homology model to visualize its structure below:
With Ideonella Sakaiensis’ PET-degrading power, we thought we could break down PET so we could detect the presence of its byproducts. However, because Ideonella Sakaiensis is a poorly characterized, it is not a suitable chassis for genetic engineering. To harness the power"

Ethanol Reduction
Figure 1: YPD plates made with pH indicator bromothymol blue. Colonies are various strains of Lachancea fermentati isolated from kombucha in our lab. Carbon dioxide and ethanol form as products of fermentation. The carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, lowering the pH of the plate and changing the color of the pH indicator. More dramatic color changes should correlate to greater ethanol production, but this assay is limited in that a variety of metabolites unrelated to ethanol production could influence pH. Credit: Matthew Hooper.
Approach
Two potential ways to reduce ethanol content over the course of the fermentation process are to reduce the rate at which yeast produce ethanol or increase the rate"

From our discussion with experts in academia and private enterprise, we learned that BactoGrip therapeutics are worth pursuing as a cancer treatment. It is desirable since cancer does not specify a single disease and BactoGrip may be customized to treat a broad variety of gut epithelial cancer phenotypes. Moreover, our system is potentially more cost effective because of self-replicating nature of microbial therapeutics and could be used make effective gut anti-cancer therapies more accessible globally. It emerged that BactoGrip therapies would be scrutinized to at least the same extent as traditional small molecule therapeutics. We realized we must incorporate other control mechanisms as design of our system matures to address risks of BactoGrip escaping into non-therapeutic environments. Additionally, we incorporated specific feedback into our design by testing BactoGrip in the probiotic E. coli Nissle to address concerns about microbial therapies in immunocompromised cancer patients. Ultimately, we are using this advice to plan future assays with BactoGrip to ensure widespread acceptance of the therapeutic organism.

Collaboration with UPF-CRG_Barcelona Team
UPO-Sevilla, UPF-CRG-Barcelona and Valencia_UPV teams met up this year to share their projects. From that point on, and on-going active communication has continued. As a result, UPO-Sevilla and UPF-CGR-Barcelona teams found that they both were working with metabolic pathway modeling. Particularly, assessment of metabolite concentrations in different biochemical routes were necessary.
And so, it was time for the corresponding dry labs to cooperate. It turned out that both softwares were actually very similar, although UPO-Sevilla’s software assumed the first metabolite in the pathway to be a “source” and therefore constant in concentration. This is justified by the need to model primarily assimilation of a constant source of glycerol by Pseudomonas putida.
At the same time, there was a consensus between the groups to specialize in the format of the computer applications. UPF-CGR-Barcelona team opted for a more user-friendly approach (“Polyenzime”), displaying a graphical interface. This way, they facilitate computer analysis of biochemical pathways even for non-computer experts, and this constitutes an excellent contribution in the field. Then, UPO-Sevilla team worked to orient its metabolic pathway modeling software to advanced users. That is, researchers interested in making an intensive use of the program, or developers pursuing implementing the software as a module for their own programs. For this goal, all of the input parameters and output results in the application are set in the form of text files.
We met in Valencia in a meeting of the spanish iGEM teams and as a result we decided to collaborate.

Green Light Module
We have had marked success with our Green Light Module. Not only is the magenta pigment bright and evenly synthesised, but we have also managed to show magenta synthesis is inhibited by exposure to white light. This was shown by setting up an experiment which involved growing spread plate cultures of E.coli, containing our green light sensor in two separate light conditions. The first condition was total darkness; this was inside a standard static incubator. The second condition was exposure to constant white light through the use of a light box. Both of these cultures were grown overnight (16 hours) and then analysed for magenta pigmentation. As shown in the picture below we found that the E.coli grown in total darkness had expressed magenta pigment (eforRed), whereas in white light this expression had been repressed. These results were in agreement with what we had expected, however they do not conclusively determine the green light module to be exclusively sensitive to green light. We are currently working on showing that green light specifically switches off magenta production (see 'planned ""post-freeze"" work').
A universal vial showing
our vibrant magenta pigment
Plates grown in the dark
clearly show magenta pigment
Comparison of liquid cultures
grown in dark vs. light
We chose some of the cultures that were showing the strongest colour development and remade liquid cultures of them. We then ran these through a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer the next morning and across the day. Both cultures clearly showed an increase in absorption across the day; it is reasonably safe to assume that this is due to continued synthesis of magenta pigment. One hurdle that this data may bring up is that different cultures may have different levels of expression and pigment output. It is therefore important that further data is gathered on this area, and full characterisation of a pathway and strain is made before an accurate colour photograph is possible. On this note it will also be important to have expression levels equal to those for the red light and blue light modules; we do not want one colour being expressed far faster than the others, as this will swamp the image and not produce an accurate coliroid.

Aalto-Helsinki Alumni
We were fortunate to have the support of the three previous year's Aalto-Helsinki team's alumni. We could always contact them when in doubt about iGEM practices. Especially the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM 2016 team members did a huge job in first recruiting us and then instructing us in how iGEM works, how we should proceed in the ideation and so forth. They also handed over our association: Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry. Warms thanks to all the alumni!
Pihla Savola
Pihla is an Aalto-Helsinki team alumnus and a research assistant in the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems. She helped us many times with practical questions and doubts in the laboratory.
Oskari Vinko
Oskari offered his help when we were planning our presentation in Turku, where we promoted iGEM and encouraged them to start their own team! He also gave us useful tips regarding presenting at the Giant Jamboree.
Snehadri Sinha
Snehadri provided us information on how their team dealt with several different small practical problems in their iGEM journey, which helped us to solve similar situations.
Laura Laiho
Laura instructed us on association matters and gave us her contacts so that we could spread the word about our presentation in Turku to the target audience.
Jami Valorinta
Jami had improved the WikiFire+ tool, which is meant for fast uploading of web files on the iGEM servers, and so he instructed us in how we should develop the wiki and upload it.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.
Participated teams: AHUT_China, BNU-China, UESTC-China, FAFU-CHINA, HZAU-China, NAU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, Tianjin, TUST_China, WHU-China, UCAS
Watch our VIDEO!
Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.
Offering equipment and reagent

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Meetings#4 March 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," may not be much.
We may store the spores on a plaster to save their positions and use it on another agar plate to display the same data.
We can use nutritions and other signals to wake the spores in a timed manner.
Do a research on how to get the data into the bacteria and out again.
Is it possible to make coloured spores? In this case we do not have to germinate them.
Sequester metals
Advantages: Implementation of stochastic switch, it can be used in both water and soil.
Sin operon regulates spoA gene to control the sporulation. It can be engineered to provide stochastic effect.
Should the bacteria move towards the metal or should they just grow everywhere? We need to improve the idea.
PH level of the B. subtilis is in the normal range
Getting the heavy metals to a level where it is useful would be a good achievement.
Do a research on if it is ok to leave the spores in the environment after all.
There are some plants that get the metals but they need to be harvested.
Germination genes need to be knocked out so that metals will stay in spores.
Can termites be used to eat spores?
Skin repairer
It has been pointed a similar idea may have already been done.Check the previous IGEM projects for similarity. We plan to use sporulation and it may add some difference to previous projects.
Advantages: has a medical application
(as above) we can use sporulation for storage and for something good to model.
The HA synthesis has already been done in Widner et al. 2005 (below)
The S. aureus signalling proteins have been sequenced Otto et al. 1998.
Also it may be good to model the effects of signalling proteins as there are four different typer which each enable their endogenous Agr pathway but inhibit pathways for other signals.
Disadvantages: It may be hard to get the B.subtilis to secrete the right part of the signalling protein (AgrD gene) as it needs clevage and further modification by other genes.
might this be a good backup?
In the university we can find the support in Fluorescence Imaging, Cytometry, mRNA and Proteomicssubjects

ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Wetlab#Switch Circuit_-_-_TEXT.html," to be extremely tight, it might repress expression of the target protein despite induction and result in a pulse generator that is unable to initiate expression of the target protein upon induction. In order to test induction of a lac-controlled gene in presence of the pulse generator, we co-transformed pulse generator K142027 and target plasmid K142073 into DH5-alpha cells. We plated the cells harboring the pulse generator as well as the target plasmid on LB-agar with and without IPTG and compared the fluorescence of the colonies.
Figure 11: Pulse generator construct K142027 was produced from device K142047 using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously. After transformation by electroporation of purified PCR product into DH5-alpha cells, eight colonies were selected and plasmids were purified using Qiagen Miniprep kit. The eight plasmids have been co-transformed together with target plasmid K142073 into electrocompetent DH5-alpha cells and were plated on LB-agar supplemented with carbenicillin and kanamycin. Upon incubation overnight at 37C, numerous colonies appeared and one colony from each plate was streaked onto a LB-agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin and kanamycin and on a LB-agar plate supplemented with carbenicillin, kanamycin and 1mM IPTG. Cells were incubated overnight at 37C for the same duration and imaged with a Nikon D80 SLR on the UV lamp of a Kodak Gel Logic 200 imaging system.
While induction is not successful in all eight strains, we see a considerable increase of fluorescence in four of them (stars). Obviously, leaky expression of the LacI IS uninducible repressor has not occurred to the extent that would make induction impossible, since all eight strains can be seen expressing fluorescent protein under control of the lac repressor. Since we have not been able to get the construct sequenced yet, we have no definite proof of the functionality of the pulse generator, however, based on this experiment we can with great confidence exclude any complications arising from premature expression of LacI IS.
Termination of Expression upon Addition of Tetracycline
Unfortunately we have not been able to conduct experiments on termination of expression by induction of repressor with tetracycline before the Wiki freeze. However, we are optimistic about conducting the experiments before the Jamboree and we might be able to present results during our talk or on our poster.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," each droplet contains a defined amount of nucleotides with their substrate removed, which is proportional to how strong the catalytic activity was in the particular droplet, of that particular biomolecule.
This information must then be stored into the biomolecule coding DNA sequence in the process of DNA amplification.
There are two main things that need to be considered in order to precisely record the activity information: effective DNA amplification and the addition of reference information which would serve as an activity baseline or a point of reference.
First of all, the efficiency of amplification reaction. After an in-depth discussion with microfluidics expert Karolis Leonavičius we have decided that DNA amplification reagents must be added after the initial droplet generation and protein production. That is because protein synthesis reagents usually do not work well with various amplification mixes.
Droplet merging can solve this problem. Main principle of droplet merging techniques, is that by using a specially designed microfluidics device, droplets can be merged with the help of electrical field. In CAT-Seq, the initial population of substrate droplets must be merged with freshly generated amplification droplets . All the the amplification droplets contain the same amount of reagents that are required to amplify DNA.
Another important thing to consider is creating a reference point which would help to precisely determine the activities of different catalytic biomolecules. For CAT-Seq, such reference point is nucleotides with reference modification. This modification can be any small modification which still allows a DNA polymerase to incorporate it during the amplification. We call them the Reference Nucleotides.
For example, If we would try to amplify DNA template in each droplet that contains different amounts of nucleotides that can be incorporated, we would get a sequencing bias that would be more favourable for biomolecules that are highly active.
That is because biomolecules with higher activity would produce more nucleotides for polymerase and the amplified DNA amount would be much bigger than compared to lower activity mutants which would produce less. Reference nucleotides can easily remove this bias - after merging the Substrate Droplet with Amplification droplets that contain Reference Nucleotides, they allow the synthesis of a similar amount of amplified DNA in each droplet.
Thus, two important parts of CAT-Seq has now been established - droplet merging and Reference Nucleotides.
Going back, we now have a population of substrate droplets that have a defined amount Product Nucleotides (the chemically converted substrate nucleotides). Those must then be merged with Amplification Droplets, wherein every droplet contains the"

First time I hear synthetic biology is at iGEM presentation and I love the way we can play with our little friends and I thought joining iGEM team would be a good lab experience.
Deniz Kınık: Hi I’m Deniz  =) I’m 2nd  year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in ITU. I am responsible for human practice in general and I have worked as a lab assistant, so, I got the opportunity to learn new techniques from our team members who have more knowledge. That was one of my goals to participate in iGEM. My first thougt when I considered joining the team was whether I will be useful for the team or not and I was fussy about it. But I got rid of all the hesitates thanks to our team leader and the team spirit, so, the stressful and funny year was started . This year, we have learned not only about synthetic biology but also thinking for new ideas, working as a team, overcoming"

With assistance of the shell of scale insects, they will not be suffocated by the horticultural oil and are free enough to continue sucking the sap from plants.
In some cases, horticultural oil and neem oil could be an effective and safe way to kill pest insects without harming the plants. The mechanism is that oil could block the air holes (spiracles) through which insects breathe, causing them to die from suffocation.

Use insecticide spray, like Malathion
Malathion is a good spray to use for outdoor plants. However, its smell is intolerable for most people when used for indoor plants. Since most succulent plants are planted indoor, this is not an advisable solution.
Malathion is a pesticide which widely used in agriculture, residential landscaping, public recreation areas, and in public health pest control programs such as mosquito eradication.
(3)
Pick off or prune heavily-infested leaves
This method could directly hurt the health condition of the succulent plants. Even though this is the easiest way to solve the infestation, this is also the most inadvisable one.
Usually when succulent plants have been heavily infested, people have no choice but pick off the leaves and hurt their plants.
(4)
Wash the plants with a strong stream of water
Succulent plants should be cultivated in comparably dry environment. Too much water is actually a catastrophe for them. Although strong streams of water could wash off the scales, it will also destroy the plants at the same time in some degrees.

(5)
Use cotton swabs dipped into the alcohol
It is always hard for people to control the amount of alcohol and the percentage of the alcohol that for killing the scales. When the amount of alcohol is not enough, no effect will occur; however, when using too much alcohol, because the leaves directly contact with the alcohol, they will be negatively affected.
The word ‘alcohol’ is not very exactly defined here. In most cases, the ‘alcohol’ can be understand as common medical alcohol of unspecified concentration.
(6)
Personal created spray: Use a little travel sized spray bottle with 70% isopropyl alcohol
When using the 70% isopropyl alcohol, since it is not the final products, costumers themselves need to mix the alcohol with  a certain amount of water. Even though this method seems to work well, inexperience of people could cause great inconvenience and may minimize its advantages.

Could have gone better. Tried to make L1modules retain information across clones, but it seems that setting pointers to the original's data isn't enough. We may have to copy all the properties over one by one. But once that's done it won't be a huge deal to put in the information we need from the backend or Kathy needs from us, but I wish we could have figured out a way that was more dynamic. Also looking further into the question of the sortable listbox, but so far inquiries have been unsuccessful. We found several links to frameworks developed some years ago, from before the current .NET framework. I tried downloading one and implement its drag-drop functionalities on a listbox, but it didn't work. With this, and the listbox not even detecting my touchdown events, I'm at a bit of a loss as to how to proceed.
10 Jul 2012
Breakthrough! I spent the morning putting in the properties one by one, so information was preserved even as L1modules were moved around and cloned. I would have liked to find a codier solution, but you can't argue with what works. Still, that's not the thing. The thing is, we got sortable stackpanels to work! It's been days. That sounds shorter than it felt.  After trying out some relatively (?) simple looking sample code and configuring it for touch, we found DoDragDrop was killing VisualStudio. Not good. At the end of our ropes, Nahum and I sat and discussed with Consuelo, who gave us this grave proclamation: sample code was doing nothing for us. It was time to give up on the pretty, coders' solutions and go for the uglier functional code. But we thought we'd try one last thing, and so we wrote something very simple (plus a result callback method). Two event handlers with maybe 30 lines maximum between them, and you know what? It worked! Crazy, hacked-up thing, but it worked and it never even went near the drag and drop handlers that had become the bane of my lab hours. I was so happy! After, it was easy, smooth sailing - we got dropping L1modules into L2modules to work as well, and did a little styling on the parts whose gargantuan side had been rather irksome since we made the switch from mammoth Big Mac to the sleeker but smaller Uppy. Tomorrow, we write a method stub for the Permutations tab for Kathy and Consuelo's Eugene code, and start with backend.

Degradation rate of GFP vs Degradation rate of CI.
Degradation rate of TetR vs Degradation rate of mRNA.
Translation Rate α1 (of TetR mRNA) vs Translation Rate α4 (of GFP mRNA).
Maximum Transcription Rate of λp vs Translation Rate α4 (of GFP mRNA).

Transcription Leakage of λp vs Transcription Leakage of pTet.
Stability
The stability of the system was investigated by determining the Jacobian of the system of ODEs analytically. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian can be seen below.
Since all of the values are real and negative we can conclude that our system will be stable.
As the parameter sweeps revealed, there are areas within the parameter space with a delay time of infinity. The plots below highlight the regions of the parameter space to avoid. Red areas correspond to a delay time of infinity, while blue areas correspond to a delay time less than 10 min (not enough time to conjugate the signal plasmid further). The cascade operates properly within the yellow areas.

Design Recommendations
Based on the results of the simulations, a series of recommendations were given to the delay team to aid them in choosing parts which would maximize the delay time.
Minimize the degradation rate of CI, do not use genes with degradation tags .
Significant transcription leakages greatly shorten the delay time. Attempt to minimize leakages. Leakage of λp is a far bigger problem than pTet leakage"

Summary
On this week we retried the curve of protein production of BBLEP and BBTNC but                                         applying the points that our professor gave us, the results obtained made us                                         replan the project methodology into a fresh beginning.
Wet lab
After the results obtained last week we set the objective to prove that our                                         proteins could be produced by the bacteria. For this to be achieved we made a                                         new production protein curve with different new settings such as: BL21(DE3)                                         with another plasmid to corroborate that bands seen were not result of                                         antibiotic resistance peptides, creation of a non induced protein curve, and                                         starting induction until OD600 of 0.7. The results obtained were not                                         significant and there were no bands showing our proteins. Also we performed a                                         PCR to an alkaline extraction of plasmids coming from BL21(DE3) transformed                                         strains (BBLEP and BBTNC), using VR and VF2 primers, the results obtained show                                         no amplification of BBLEP and inconsistent results for BBTNC. With that on mind                                         we aimed to redo the transformation of parts and protein production, in order to obtain new and much better results. We also obtained kanamycin for the                                         ligation of BBCOL into psB1K3. We realized the quantification of lactate of our                                         burned cell lines at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 minutes, in order to get numerical data                                         that will translate into proliferation rate after a burn accident, those                                         results will help us into developing a more accurate math model for the                                         purposes of the project.
Dry Lab
We started to investigate new lysis protocol to ensure that our protein was                                         released from the bacterial pellet, we obtained one protocol which was specific                                         for the purification of tag His proteins derived from BL21(DE3), but also we                                         attended with our professor specialist in protein purification for new                                         protocols, she gave us a Laemmli buffer for fast visualization of results for                                         protein induction. Also we received the idea from one of our assessors to use                                         RIPA buffer for the lysis, but after an extensive internet research no                                         methodology was seemed to work with E. coli pellets.
Hardware
We went to CDMX to obtain the hoses and syringes for the assembly of the skin                                         chip. Also we talked with professor Chong to land the idea of how we will be                                         measuring the proliferation rate in the skin chip, the idea ended up in the                                         usage of Tsc320"

4. Gene Transfer Method: Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
After settling the genes we wished to transfer and the target plants, we had to decide upon how we would transfer the genes into plants. Gene transfer in plants is complicated by the presence of a cell wall. Literature research revealed several methods: agrobacterium-mediated transformation, biolistic gene gun, nanoparticle delivery, and so on. Though the gene gun was our first choice in the beginning, our research demonstrated that success rates are modest and that forceful bombardment could cause damage to plant tissues or lead to random integration of the DNA. Nanoparticle delivery, while capable of carrying a variety of payloads, is not well developed in plants. Ultimately, we chose an agrobacterium-mediated transformation as the agrobacteria are readily accessible and can deliver genes to areas of injection more feasibly than its alternatives.
5. Plasmid for agrobacterium-mediated transformation-pHB
As our final goal is to inject our plasmid with the lux operon genes into plants, we considered using vectors that have a promoter capable of initiating transcription in plants. pCAMBIA2301 and pCAMBIA1301 were two of the vectors we investigated as both of them possess a CaMV 35s promoter that has a high rate of transcription in transgenic plants. However, the direction of their promoters were awkward since the multiple cloning site with the restriction enzyme sites we wanted to use (EcoR1 and PstI/ HindIII) comes before the promoter, thus forcing the RNA polymerase to transcribe the whole plasmid (~11kb) before reaching the lux genes, which will drastically decrease transcription rates.
Therefore, we decided to use the pHB plasmid, which has the features shown in the picture below. The pHB plasmid has a 2x CaMV 35s promoter, which is capable of generating high levels of mRNA to cause greatly increased gene expression in plants. In addition, the MCS site comes directly after the promoter, and has the restriction enzyme sites that we can use (BamHI, PstI and HindIII).
Experiment design
1. Verify the BBa_K325909 part and confirm it works
According to the work of a previous team iGEM 10_Cambridge, BBa_K325909 could emit light in normal E. coli strains without the addition of any external substrate. We first need to transform its plasmid from the DNA Kit Plate (provided by iGEM) and to repeat the experiment in order to verify it. We"

First of all Mr. Holmes must has a piercing eye to find the trail of pollutant; And after detecting pollutant, Mr. Holmes must has the ability to convey the message to us in time. Therefore, in order to constitute a series of inductivity parts which can be efficiently expressed in E.Coli BL 21 bacterial strains we link the efficient receptor of heavy metal ions with RibB--- the key synthesis gene of riboflavin. They can translate the information from the concentration of heavy metal ions to the riboflavin content, which is the product of reporter gene RibB. Riboflavin is a kind of redox mediator who works as a highly-efficient electronic transfer mediator. When the concentration of Riboflavin increased, it can improve the efficiency of electronic translocation between E.Coli and the anode and eventually augment the voltage. Combined with MFC (microbial fuel cell) system, we can measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in water through the voltage presented by MFC system and realize the conversion of heavy metal ions concentration to electrical signal. This method has lots of advantages, such as compatibility, high efficiency, instantaneity, reliability and so on.
The main idea of designing this experiment can be seen in the following flow chart.
Fig 1 Whole Experiment Flow Chart
In this project, parts were divided into two kinds. One is constitutive part, combined by various type of promoter, RBS, RibB and terminator. We constructed the constitutive parts to select a highly-expressed part of RibB. The other is inducible part with RBS, RibB terminator and promoter which can sense heavy metal ions. This kind of parts can highly express RibB so that it is practical to associate the concentration of heavy metal ions with the output of riboflavin. Therefore, putting the E.Coli BL 21 into the MFC, we collected the statistics of MFC on the condition that concentration of metal ion solution was already known. So we built the correlation model, then induced the E.Coli BL21 with the solution to be measured. It is easy to figure out the concentration by measuring the voltage of MFC. We can monitor the specific metal ions real-timely, quantitatively and swiftly through this way and more importantly, it has compatibility in the measurement of metal ion by changing the parts to detect different metal ions.

Nithin's Notes
Ran a PCR Amplification and PCR cleanup of our PCquad 3.0 Prime. Conditions were all the same as previous PCR reactions run by Phillip.
Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today affinity purification will be done on the cell lysates.
Procedures:
Below is a complete protocol for lysis and purification, though only purification was done today.
Cell lysis and Ni-NTA Affinity Purification
Introduction:  The following procedure is for lysing bacterial cells with triton lysis buffer.  For optimal activity, it is suggested that reagents be made right before lysis.  This protocol is also designed for Ni-NTA affinity purification, as the lysis buffer resembles the equilibration buffer.
Triton lysis buffer:  10mL was made.  Only 1mL was used, so the rest was stored at -20C.
50mM phosphate buffer (pH 8)
300mM NaCl
10mM imidazole (pH 7.4) (Optional for downstream Ni-NTA affinity purification)
1% triton x-100
Note:  The above can be made and stored either in 4C or at room temperature for about a month (store in the dark if containing imidazole).
Right before cell lysis, add the following:
100ug/mL of lysozyme
One Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet per 10mL
1uL/mL of 2500U/mL DNase (adjust the solution appears viscous during the lysis).
Note:  It is optimal to use the lysis buffer fresh, however this complete lysis buffer may be usable up to a month if stored in -20C with minimal thawing cycles.
-Lysis protocol:
1.  Obtain the frozen cell pellet, keep on ice.  0.09g of cell pellet was lysed in 1mL of lysis buffer.

Tim Weenink
After yesterdays horrible discovery that the I-SceI Homing Endonuclease we got from MIT was actually T4 DNA ligase we had to adjust our cloning strategy. The more primitive part without promoter was found to be the correct one, except that is was assembled with part !A instead of p(LacI). So we did that assembly again today. With p(LacI) from the delay team upstream, *T1 (downstream) and backbone pSB1C3 (also from the delay team). Both RbCl chemically comp and EC electrocomp cells were transformed.

New for this year is the WIKI and graphical design collaboration with Aalto Helsinki, where a common SLACK channel has been set up for close communication between the members responsible for the WIKI and graphical design in respective team.
Nordic iGEM Collaboration
iGEM Uppsala 2018, also participates in a common SLACK workspace for the project manager of each Nordic team,                 'something that has been proven to be very useful in the sense of advice and support from people in the same position. Besides an easy way for direct communication, this year iGEM Uppsala has participated both in the Biobrick Tutorial Weekend arranged by the Technical University of Denmark and the Nordic iGEM Conference in Lund. Both events have been very useful and fun, socially and practically. In summary, both events proved to be wonderful opportunities to connect with other nordic teams.
Another collaboration that we are planning on with other iGEM contacts is a webinar later this summer.                 This would give us the chance to train in presenting our projects as well as share our experiences from working on iGEM.                 The general public would have access to the webinar as well.

Le système de ciblage cellulaire [1,2,9]
Le vecteur cellulaire a pour but de cibler les cellules d’intérêt. Pour cela, l’ajout de protéine de ciblage cellulaire, au sein du génome du bactériophage lambda, est nécessaire. La délivrance du plasmide thérapeutique se fait en deux étapes : le ciblage de la cellule d’intérêt et la libération au sein du cytoplasme.
Le ciblage de la cellule d’intérêt
Le bactériophage lambda interagit naturellement avec sa cellule cible, Escherichia Coli, via sa protéine de fibre de queue « J ». La protéine J étant l’unique protéine du bactériophage lambda intervenant dans la reconnaissance spécifique de la cellule hôte, elle est, par conséquent, la candidate idéale à une modification permettant de modifier le tropisme naturel du bactériophage.
Pour se faire, la protéine J est greffée à une protéine possédant la caractéristique particulière de se lier de manière spécifique à l’un des récepteurs de la cellule cible. La protéine J interagissant par le coté Cter, c’est au niveau de ce dernier qu’est placé la protéine dite de fusion.

Overall project
Who said scientists don't care about microbial cultures?
This year, Valencia Biocampus team members are going to break down communication barriers among species through an artificial language based on light wavelengths, which will allow us to know more about the requirements of the microorganisms we thrive everyday in our labs. Depending on different metabolic conditions, our microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) will express fluorescent proteins that are under the control of promoters sensitive to these environmental factors. Therefore, by using a fluorimeter controlled by voice-recognition software, we are able to ask and get answers (like real-life talking!) of the microbial environment! Moreover we have a brand-new experience, related to UV-regulation, in which we force bacteria to express a gene!
Our final goal is to characterize and  completely model bacterial behavior affected by these factors. And last, but not least, our Human Practices team has an awesome story-telling script for the audience!
This is a general scheme of our project. All the experimental work is outlined and splitted up into color boxes: Modeling (purple), Human Practices (blue) and Talking Interfaces (yellow). As long as you surf through the wiki, you will find out the special case of the question “Have you taken your pill?” , which has not been actually asked to our bacteria, but plays a central role in our Human Practices work. Check our achievements to understand our project as a whole!

MIT,2012,Team:MIT#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," I would rather have the cells be underconfluent and in log phase than overconfluent and in a lag phase.
June 1st, 2012
One plate was allowed to grow for an extra day. The other was split 1:12, into two dishes to last until Monday (which they will be back at ~60% confluency). This gives us a backup plate in the event that letting a plate go an extra day means the cells are over confluent.
June 2nd, 2012
The plate that was allowed to go the extra day looks good, 80%-90% confluent, and not overgrown at all. Will Split 1:6 today, which will put back on MWF splitting schedule. Cells split yesterday will be checked on Monday... Could do either a 1:3 split from the backup plates on Mon. to get the 80-90% confluency by Wed. or simply expand our cultures from the one plate that looks good (80-90% confluent as of today). Expanded cultures from the properly confluent plate.

Cells were underconfluent and allowed to grow an extra day.
June 9th, 2012
Cells are still underconfluent. Seeded a dish 1:3, the other 1:6. To ensure an accurate 12 mL final volume, cells in the trypsin/media mixture were centrifuged at 260g for 5 mins, and then resuspended in fresh media prior to seeding. Also, I dropped our aspirating tool on accident, and the glass portion to it broke. Put it in the pickle jar sharps container. Will need to make another one, or simply use pastuer pipettes.  Also received an important email from Kenneth regarding the incubators. Information from said email is below. The water tray in the bottom of the incubator needs to be checked and filled when empty. Without water, the incubator will not be at the proper humidity and the CO2 sensor will not work properly, which means no CO2 and the media becomes too basic (purple) and cells will die/grow slowly. You can use the DI water from the white tap on the sink, no need to add anything to the water. Also, use a graduated"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the same function as progestins: preventing pregnancy. Progesterone can do so without the harmful effects that progestins cause [9] . In mammals, the progesterone biosynthesis pathway begins with cholesterol. Enzymes convert cholesterol to pregnenolone and then to progesterone. Figure 1 shows a highly simplified version of the reference pathway for steroid hormone biosynthesis in mammals from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to highlight the progesterone biosynthesis pathway [10] .
The organism we are engineering, Y. lipolytica, does not produce cholesterol naturally but does produce a cholesterol precursor: zymosterol. In Y. lipolytica however, only the zymosterol-ergosterol pathway exists. We considered engineering three non-native enzymes (circled in blue in Figure 2) into Y. lipolytica to complete the zymosterol-cholesterol pathway, due to the common pathway to progesterone in mammals starting from cholesterol. However, because ergosterol is the yeast’s preferred pathway product, navigating through the cholesterol pathway would require completely knocking out the pathway to ergosterol (starting from ERG6 on the right). The addition of those three genes, the additional genes needed to take cholesterol to progesterone, and a pathway knockout required too much engineering for the time frame of our project. The enzymes highlighted in green exist in Y. lipolytica, see the end product of ergosterol circled in pink. The enzymes highlighted with white do not exist, and would need to be engineered into the organism.
Figure 2: End of pathway leading to Steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway starting from Glycolysis, to Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, to Steroid biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica. Green highlight shows that those enzymes exist naturally in Y. lipolytica and white highlight means KEGG does not have enough evidence to show they exist in Y. lipolytica.
We needed to figure out how to synthesize progesterone in a creative way. We found that we could establish a synthetic pathway to progesterone directly from ergosterol (circled in pink in Figure 2). This was beneficial because that pathway exists naturally in Y. lipolytica. In Y. lipolytica and other fungi, ergosterol serves similar functions in fungi as cholesterol does in animal cells [11] , meaning that while the pathway does not currently exist in the organism, it is possible to convert ergosterol to progesterone. We searched through research articles and found the work"

We made the length of primer pairs longer to lower the high GC content of eryA. In addition to this, we done explore experiments about different concentration of DMSO from null to 10%.
This time, we got nothing unfortunately.
Latter, we choose mutant-enriched PCR. Extending the length of our target segment, we redesigned the primer pairs without RFC 10. During this period of time, we tried Primer STAR, GenSTAR, PCR Mix and KOD PCR enzyme and compared three-step process with two-step process [1][3].
At last, we can see the 5kb segment from the Gel Electrophoresis, which still not what we wanted.
Finally, we had to give up the idea of amplification eryA gene through PCR.
It sounds a pity.

Unit Test
Our project is deposited on github for better cooperation. So all pushed commits will be automatically tested by TravisCI shortly after being pushed so that we can see the result soon. Besides unit tests, ES Linter will help us find syntax errors and incongruous code style whenever files changed. These features guarantee our project operating normally.
BioSearch
Type anything you want to learn about a part and press Enter, in less than one second you will get the results:
The bricks are ordered by their qualities and creation date, which means you are always able to get the best and latest one to meet your need. The quality of bricks are ranked by several factors, including frequency of use, sample status, and assessments from users in forum, and so on. Each brick is displayed with a progress bar at the right bottom corner, which represents the relative ranking.
BioSearch supports multi-dimensional filtering. You can use t:<type> to limit the type of bricks:
or use n:<part name> to precisely locate a brick using its name:

ABACUS:
ABACUS is a submodule of team USTC-Software-2016's project. ABACUS is firstly developed by professor Liu Haiyan, to enlarge the functions of Biopano. The de novo design of amino acid sequence to fold into desired structures is a way to reach a more thorough understanding of how amino acid sequences encode protein structures and to supply methods for protein engineering. To overcome limitations in current computational models, they developed a comprehensive statistical energy function for protein design with a new general strategy and verify that it can complement and rival current well-established models. They established an experimental approach which can be used to efficiently assess or improve the foldability of designed proteins. To prove it, they report four de novo proteins for different targets, all experimentally verified to the well-folded, solved solution structures for two being excellent agreement with respective design targets.

HP. Interviewing Professor Shi-2
Interview with Dr. Wu
We visited Dr. Wu at the Quality and Safety Risk Assessment for Cereal Products, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, on October 8th, 2018. The interview was very fruitful. Dr. Wu stressed on the importance of the prevention of aflatoxin contamination in food from the level of national policies, and mentioned some useful measures such as timely harvest and reasonable storage. She also introduced that research institutions normally use equipment or chemical methods to detect possible contamination in food. These methods are relatively fast and reliable, yet the residues may cause pollution.
Our project tries to build a biological system of detecting and degrading aflatoxin, which is hopefully more efficient and environment-friendly. We are committed to biological methods, looking forward to understanding the pathway of aflatoxin production, directly using biosynthetic methods to interfere with its production process in order to reduce or prevent its production.

a) Peking University
On 6th February, 2018, we visited School of Life Sciences of Peking University. In Professor Qu’s lab. The researchers explained to us how scanning electron microscope (SEM) functions and introduced their present study focus. Since our project is concerned with mycotoxin contamination in food, Prof. Qu’s research program, focusing on botany study, evoked inspiration and led us to ponder on our ultimate aim of ensuring food and crop safety.
HP. Peking University
b)Tsinghua University
On July 20th, 2018, we went to Tsinghua University for a lecture by Professor Liu, who is an expert in botany. In the School of Life Sciences of the university, he brought us a lecture about the history and real examples of genetically modified plants.
In a word, Professor Liu’s lecture further strengthened our belief on our project, which is using synthesized protein to detect and render AFT-B1 harmless.  Furthermore, we also learned that the modern biotechnology is very powerful, and will become more powerful in the future.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or"
