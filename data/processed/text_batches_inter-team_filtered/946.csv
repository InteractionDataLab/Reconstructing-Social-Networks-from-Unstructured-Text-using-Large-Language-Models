ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Tar_-_-_TEXT.html," plate
We performed our experiment using rectangular 9x15 cm plates for two reasons: they allow to easily plate a long straight line of transformants that do not inhibit each other’s growth while moving towards the source (as opposed to a circular       disposition where the movement is towards the center), and they allow to make easy unidimensional and unidirectional assumptions when calculating the formation of the gradient. The medium composition has been set after multiple iterations, combining different protocols [2], also referring to the Goettingen iGEM team from 2012. Since LB contains aspartate it cannot be used for this experiment, indeed the base for the       swimming medium needs to be a minimal medium. We decided to use a modified version of M9, with 0.3% agar to allow the swimming movement. Since the plasmid has a pSB1C3 backbone, chloramphenicol was added when the agar was cooled but still       liquid. A critical step is to pour the medium when it is still completely liquid, to achieve an homogeneous distribution and thus a homogeneous movement of the bacteria. The attractant was applied on the plates by pipetting small drops of a liquid solution (10 mM) on Whatman paper stripes and then delicately placing them on one of the borders of the plate. It is recommended not to soak the stripes directly in       the solution as they would tend to form ooze on the plate.
The Gradient
The formation of a useful gradient depends on the initial concentration, on the position of the source and its dimension, on the time passed, on the composition of the diffusing medium and on the diffusion coefficient of the small molecule       itself.
We thus found it very helpful to build a model that can integrate all this parameters and provide a guideline the plating time and position with respect to the source.       The model simulates the diffusion of the selected molecule, provided the diffusion coefficient in a 0.3% agar plate, given a source of customizable concentrations and dimensions (meaning how wide the stripe is). The indicated concentrations       are representative of an upper bound of the real one, as the model only consider one dimensional diffusion.
We simulated the diffusion of 10 mM aspartate diluted in M9, on a stripe that covers slightly more than one third of the plate. In the laboratory, we set up the corresponding experiment by placing a stripe soaked in 10 mM aspartate solution in       M9 on the border of a swimming plate; we immediately plated several drops of MG1655 overnight culture on different positions on the plate. The simulation is in accordance with the experiment"

As the METU HS Ankara iGEM 2018 Team, we have submitted five parts for 2018 iGEM competition; two basic and three composite.                  Our basic part 1 includes FucO as the protein coding region and basic 2 includes GSH gene as the protein coding region. FucO                  aims to convert furfural to furfuryl alcohol and GSH aims to impart the overexpression of Glutathione for ultimately increasing                  ethanol yield and lifespan of the ethanologenic E.coli strain KO11. Our Composite part 3 includes both of the coding regions.                  All of our parts are RFC 10 compatible. FucO is obtained from E.coli K12 and GSH is obtained from Streptococcus Thermophilus. The table below shows all basic and composite parts submitted to iGEM Registry by our team.

Barcoding and Library Preparation
Each sequencing technology has its own mechanism of sequencing. Third generation of sequencing uses pores through which nucleic acid strand is pulled through to read the genetic information. In order to assure that nucleic acids pass the pore at correct speed and orientation, adaptors with motor proteins need to be attached to ends of cDNA molecules. Motor protein then anneals to the pore and pulls the molecule through [1].
In addition to adaptors, barcodes are also attached to the cDNA sample. In our application, two different samples are sequenced simultaneously using one flow cell. In order to distinguish which molecule belongs to what sample, barcodes (short DNA fragments with known sequence) are ligated to the cDNA. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis allows sorting of the reads according to the barcodes and assign them into two distinct samples.
Experiment
Initially, cDNA is treated with Ultra II End Prep (NEB), which performs end-repair and tailing. End-prep assures that all fragments end in blunt ends and that there are no overhangs, end-tailing adds non-template dAMP to 3'end, which is complementary with dT on barcodes, which are ligated in the subsequent step using Blunt/TA ligase. After barcode ligation, adaptors are ligated using Quick T4 Ligation Kit. Library is then ready to be loaded into the flow cell after passing through the checkpoint.
Results
At this stage, the limited amount of material limits ways of assuring that the library preparation was successful. Under normal circumstances, it would be possible to check quality of cDNA library with Nanodrop. But due to rather small volume and concentration, it was decided that only quantity will be measured using Qbit (as Nanodrop has shown to not being very accurate below concentrations of 30 ng/µl). Table 1 shows the usual yield in various steps.

About Me
Hi! I'm Evan, and I'm very excited to be a part of the Wellesley iGEM team this year. I'm a Computer Science and Philosophy major at Wellesley College, but I didn't start out my college career with these majors. When I matriculated, I was deciding between a major in Philosophy, English, Psychology, or Visual Art. I sort of stumbled upon the wondrous world of Computer Science by accident; I took an intro class to fulfill one of my distribution requirements and absolutely fell in love. I applied to join the iGEM team (and Wellesley's Human-Computer Interaction lab) because user interface design is the perfect synthesis of visual art, psychology, philosophy, and computer science.
My main project on iGEM is Eugenie, a project that enables synthetic biologists to virtually generate a set of genetic devices with user-specified rules. This is the top-down extension of the MoClo Planner project, which lets users design devices from the bottom up: by first selecting parts, permuting them, and then selecting from the set of resulting devices. Other Wellesley iGEM projects include ZMol/ZSeq, a 3D visualization of molecules and genomic sequences and Bac to the Future, an art installation"

Lab Notebook
We have documented the day to day progress of our iGEM project in our online Lab Notebook, which includes our wet lab experiments, policy and practices planning and outreach events.
Initial Project Discussions
We began the project with several meetings at TSL and UEA with project supervisors and all iGEM students to brainstorm ideas for this years iGEM project.
We discussed global issues and food security proved to be a recurrent and prominent theme
As we were working closely with TSL and wanted to maximise the expertise available to us, we decided on a plant based project.
We researched the global staple food crops which included rice, infected by the pathogen Xanthamonas and decided to design a biosensor to detect the presence of Xanthamonas.
Although we were aware of the reporter GFP, we wanted a reporter which was visible to the naked eye so a farmer could easily detect infection in a crop and therefore suggested chromoproteins.
The name of our project, Green Canary, represents our engagement in Green Biotechnology. The Canary is both the emblem of Norwich City, our local professional football team, and an idiom for an early indicator of coming danger.

The optical densities were simultaneously measured using a spectrophotometer at wavelength 600nm [In the graph as OD600] and our device GCODe Mini. [In the graph as V1OD_N_12H and V1OD_N_24H]. In V1OD_N_12H, the proportionality factor was found by dividing with the 12H reading, and in V2OD_N_24H with the 24H reading.
As you can see, the normalized GCODe Mini readings (red and cyan) match the spectrophotometer readings (green) almost perfectly!
Notice that the E.coli readings from the Mini form an even smoother curve than those from the spectrophotometer! This is probably because the GCODe readings were taken instantaneously, while it takes time to load the cuvette into the spectrophotometer and take a reading, allowing lots more opportunities for human error, leading to fluctuations in the actual time intervals.
At this point we were ready to try a growth curve with the GCODe all by its lonesome.
It worked perfectly! We only used a spectrophotometer at the very end, so that we could calibrate the curve to 'normal' OD units. (Data for this curve available at Ecoli-GrowthCurve-Solo1.xlsx )

Visit to the Kampfmittelräumdienst Rheinland-Pfalz
Summary: The Kampfmittelräumdienst Rheinland-Pfalz is responsible for bomb defusal in the German Bundesland Rheinland-Pfalz, were they mostly encounter unexploded ordnance. ELECTRACE would not be suitable for their work, since the aircraft bombs they mostly deal with are tightly sealed and don't leak TNT. Howvever, the head of the organization, Mr. Horst Lenz, pointed out that our application might be suitable for other types of explosives.
We visited the Kampfmittelräumdienst Rheinland-Pfalz (Bomb disposal team Rhineland-Palatinate) in Koblenz in Germany. Their work consists of the defusal and disposal of unexploded ordnance found in the German Bundesland Rheinland-Pfalz. We met with the head of the organization, Mr. Horst Lenz, with whom we discussed the search and disposal of unexploded ordnance and the possible role the TNT-sensing module of ELECTRACE could play in that.
In Germany, still a lot of unexploded ordnance, mostly remnants from the second world war, is found. When a area of land is developed into a construction site,  contractors have the possibility to screen the area for the possible presence of explosives. This screening was formerly done by the Kampfmittelräumdienst, but as of July 1st 2014, this part of their activities has been cut, a fact Mr. Lenz did not seem too sad about. Not very surprising, since this screening mostly consist of the tediously painstaking study of old photos taken by military planes.  Nowadays, this screening is done by the private companies. “It is big business.” Mr.  Lenz mentioned. “Private companies will ask between €2.500,- and €10.000,- for the screening of a single construction site, which comprises just doing historical review and taking a look on air photographs.”
Mr. Lenz showed us a large number of the photographs they have used for bomb screening purposes.  The images were obtained from the British Air Force.  Lenz: “After an air read, they flew"

Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

To each of the tubes, 10 ul plasmid DNA from each of the three cultures (from the mini-preps) was added.
The three Eppendorf tubes containing the plasmid DNA plus restriction enzyme mixtures were transferred to a 37°C incubator for 1 hour.
3) Preparing the 0.8% Agarose Gel
This procedure was carried out by first of all preparing the agarose gel and also by preparing the electrophoresis trays . Once these steps were completed the gel was then poured (all of these steps covered in the DNA Gel Electrophoresis protocol )
The only changes to the protocol were:
Two rows of wells were placed in the gel instead of one. This was to accomodate both the DNA samples from the Metal Sensor team and the Stochastic Switch team.
Once the gel had been poured and set, the gel comb was not removed neither was the gel transferred to the electrophoresis apparatus. Instead the gel within the tray, with combs still in place, was sprinkled with 1 x TAE buffer and wrapped up carefully in cling film. The gel was then transferred to the fridge for use the next day.
Stochastic Switch Team
Jess and Goksel preparing mini-prep samples
Summary
Today we did minipreps from yesterday's overnight cultures and also discovered the results from our two leftover plates for biobricks C00178 and C0062. C00178 had sufficient colonies that we could do overnights (3ml LB+Amp) however C0062 had yet again failed to transform. We followed the miniprep protocol and froze the crude extract in the -20 ready for restriction digests tomorrow. We saved all the plated that we had used and labelled them in the fridge.  Today we also had a lab clearout/organisation so that stocks can be easily found in the space we have in the fridge/freezers.

Then, at the end of the day, Heather and I headed over to the library to print out our poster for tomorrow's presentation.
Thursday, Aug 1: Today was the poster presentation! In the morning we came in and did some last minute coding to fix some functionality. Then it was time to move on to the preparation. At 2 the poster session began and we spent a wonderful 2 hours presenting and demonstrating our project to everyone who stopped by. For the most part, people were really excited, and it was great being able to show off all of our hard work - I definitely appreciate the experience! Then, to celebrate, the team went to Orit's house for a night of dinner and fun!
Friday, Aug 2: Today was the big demo day! Heather and I came into work early in order to set up the cameras and to print out the questionnaires for the students to answer. We had three sessions throughout the morning with 4, 2, and 9 students respectively. Each group was given a pre-task questionnaire, and then a post-task questionnaire. As for our demo, we decided to do a quick powerpoint introduction to synthetic biology, followed by our application. Overall the students seemed to really enjoy our app, and we are eager to compile their responses!

The run is stopped once the live base calling shows no DNA (or very little DNA) is being sequenced.
Quit Desktop Agent and MinKNOW and disconnect MinION.
To store the flow cell for a next run, follow the Wash Kit MinION protocol.
Sequence Verification
For sequence verification, the sequencing platform EZ-Seq established by Macrogen was used. This protocol is based on their instructions.
Prepare a sequencing sample in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, labelled with a Macrogen sequencing sticker (QR-code) as follows:
Component
Volume (µL)
DNA
X (~500 ng is required*)
Primer (10 µM)
2.5 (final concentration 5-10 pmol/µL)
Sterile MilliQ
10-X
* NOTE: The volume depends on the concentration of the sample.
Make sure to keep the QR-code and note down what sample it is affiliated with. Deliver the tubes for sequencing to the manufacturer and await results.
Results are evaluated in silico by aligning expected sequences with obtained sequences and calculating the match percentage.
Serum DNA Extraction
This protocol is an adaptation of the original QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit protocol .
Important points before starting
All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature (15–25°C).
Use carrier DNA if the sample contains <10,000 genome equivalents (see page 17).
200 μl of whole blood yields 3–12 μg of DNA. Preparation of buffy coat (see page 18) is recommended if a higher yield is required.
Things to do before starting
Equilibrate samples to room temperature (15–25°C).
Heat a water bath or heating block to 56°C for use in step 4.
Equilibrate Buffer AE or distilled water to room temperature for elution in step 11.
Ensure that Buffer AW1, Buffer AW2, and QIAGEN Protease have been prepared according to the instructions on page 16.
If a precipitate has formed in Buffer AL, dissolve by incubating at 56°C.
Serum DNA Extraction Procedure
Pipet 10 μl QIAGEN Protease (or proteinase K) into the bottom of two 1.5 ml"

From that protocol we keep special attention in the lysis buffer                                         which is comprised of many reductant agents. Also in an article which described                                         the lysis method for E. coli we found that his lysis buffer was exactly the                                         same as the one we previously encounter, for that we decided to give that                                         buffer a try but with modifications according to our experience such as                                         incubation with lysozyme.
Hardware
We obtained the prototype of the “skin reactor” and performed a test to                                         determine exhaust capacity of the prototype using only inclination and                                         centrifugal force. The results obtained showed that an angle of 7.5° was                                         necessary to remove most of the medium from the medium chamber. For that the                                         creation of a base would be necessary for the removal of medium given those                                         characteristics. We then proceed to modelate the base in CATIA and later we 3D                                         printed it in our school.

Summary
This week we began working way harder in the lab as deadlines approach. We                                         decided as a team the wiki order and design, as well as a name for our                                         hardware.
Wet lab
Nanoparticles standardisation was done with Bradford assay for a quick                                         encapsulation once Leptin begins production. PBS pH 7.4 was used to recreate                                         physiological medium and test nanoparticles liberation.
Hardware
The last assemblies were done and the sensors were tested and connected.
Week 38th

Results and Analysis
Different geographic locations often have vastly different social characteristics and opinions regarding science, religion, and technology. Often science and technology are viewed with scepticism or distrust, which can be attributed to a lack of knowledge about these subjects. In order to ascertain the general knowledge of high school students, the U of L iGEM team surveyed local high school students in grade 9, prior to separation into the divisions of biology, chemistry, and physics, about their knowledge of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. The survey is attached below the results, which are summarized herein. Below (Figure 1), we determined high school students’ knowledge of the broad term “genetic engineering.”
These results indicate that students have indeed heard of genetic engineering, a term that has been used for some time, generally have a favourable view. However, some individuals lacked knowledge of the term or what it is, and even those who have some knowledge of the term stated they don’t care, reflecting either apathy or a lack of interest.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and"

Figure0: Countries, territories and areas showing the distribution of Zika virus,2013-2016
Dengue is the most epidemic virus in the tropics and subtropics area. Dengue is now epidemic around over 100 countries including Africa, America, Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific areas. One research estimated that about 3.9 billion people may be infected with dengue fever yearly and 96 million people included may have serious or mild clinical symptoms. Actually, dengue can infect not only babies, children but also adults, but cannot lead to death commonly. Undoubtedly, the most effective protective measures are those that avoid mosquito bites. The best way to reduce mosquitoes is to eliminate the places where the mosquito lays her eggs, like artificial containers that hold water in and around the home. Outdoors, clean water containers like pet and animal watering containers, flower planter dishes or cover water storage barrels. Look for standing water indoors such as in vases with fresh flowers and clean at least once a week. 
Malaria is another mosquito-borne infectious disease. It is caused by four Plasmodium species: Plasmodium falciparum – malignant tertian, Plasmodium vivax – benign tertian, Plasmodium ovale – benign tertian, Plasmodium malariae – quartan malaria. All are transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria occurs mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common Plasmodium in the African continent, which leads to majority death cases all over the world. And Plasmodium vivax is more widespread that Plasmodium falciparum, epidemic both Africa and other areas. According to the report from WHO, it is reported that about 3.2 billion people (nearly half of the global population) are at the risk of malaria.

Tool Overview
Laboratory protocols often require careful and precise execution of numerous procedures to achieve desired results. However, slight inaccuracies and miscalculations attributable to human-error continually arise and often lead to invalid conclusions. For this reason, we have developed an accurate workflow that executes biological protocols in a more systematic manner. The solution we propose is the Puppeteer Biological Protocol Automation Suite.  Our suite centers on the execution of Puppeteer, a high-level protocol specification language used to programmatically describe biological protocols; it is executed on a liquid-handling robot with minimal user intervention.  PuppetShow allows users to create protocols locally, but will eventually incorporate a “Protocol Repository” that will retain version-controlled instances of uploaded protocols.  This feature will promote all forms of collaboration within the synthetic biology community, with a predominant focus on inter-laboratory protocol sharing.
Puppeteer Assembly Flow
Our assembly flow incorporates a five-layer stack as illustrated in the adjacent figure. The Assembly Planner produces an assembly plan for synthetic biological devices, with each assembly step annotated with the name of a biological protocol. Each protocol may be fully specified using PuppetShow.
The protocols are written in the high-level language called Puppeteer. The Language layer includes a Puppeteer interpreter and linker. A protocol specified in Puppeteer may contain Puppeteer instructions as well as references to previously created Puppeteer programs available in the protocol repository. The Language layer then translates Puppeteer protocols into low-level commands expressed in a Common Human Robot Instruction Set (CHRIS).  CHRIS can be produced by any high-level language, making it ideal for robot vendors to utilize. The Hardware Layer concerning the external control and robot I/O interfacing is wrapped under a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). Vendor-provided software for programming the robot may be proprietary and is used to control the robot. An interface to it is provided by a software bridge, which maps protocols"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we expected bands at 3.2kb and 800bp. Since we were not getting our BioBricks, we consulted one of our PI’s, as to why our transformations were not working. He assumed there was too much salt when we electroporated our cells, which would kill them and explained why we may not get growth on our plates. We did the math and he was right;.There was way too much salt in the DNA that we were transforming our electrocompetent E. coli with and would explain why we rarely ever got growth on transformations performed with electrocompetent E. coli cells. From then on we only transformed with chemicompetent E. coli cells. We tried to perform a transformation with chemicompetent E.coli cells with a ligated plasmid of 3BH. We did these transformations with different concentrations of DNA to see if the amount of DNA that we transformed with was the problem. There was no growth on the plates, so it may not be that the amount of DNA that was the problem.
We conducted another trial of yeast mediated cloning with many more colonies due to lack of growth in some of the samples and low DNA concentrations. Then, we tried a colony PCR on the samples but failed. We finally realized that colony PCR did not work on yeast cells due to the presence of exonucleases that degrade the primers.
Considering our poor results using Gibson Assembly, we reasoned that our experiments could be improved now that our new set of primers had come in, including one that would allow us to linearize D17 without the 1bp mismatch we had discovered earlier. Repeating the Gibson Assembly trial and amplifying with PCR suggested the presence of both pOPPY_GFP as well as D17 in each GA sample, despite digest with a 5,000-fold excess of DpnI.
No growth observed on transformation plates. By this time, other team members were doing yeast minipreps. Subsequent transformations would use the resulting miniprep samples.

Collaboration with PITT iGEM Team 2018
We have been mentored by the PITT iGEM team since our iGEM program began in September 2017.  They are veterans in the iGEM sphere and gave us  a lot of insight on what the competition will entail.  During our first meeting with them,  they taught us a plasmid game and gave us some insight on the iGEM competition.   Throughout the year, they would visit the lab and help us with some of our experiments and updating our Wiki.  In the winter of 2018, two members of the PITT iGEM team helped us with completing our salt sensor data. The biosensor from the CMUQ 2017  iGEM team was selected for improved characterization (Part: BBa_K2467002).  Dorsin and Vivian came to help us with figuring out the molarities, concentrations of the reagents, and graphing the data.  The experiment showed that the optimal salt concentration for growth of E.Coli, which is an improvement of the biosensor of the CMUQ iGEM team.  During the summer, the PITT iGEM team attended our program practices and would help us with anything that we needed experimentally and technically.  Some of the PITT team members would help us with constructing our Wiki and other PITT team members would help us with troubleshooting our experiments."

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," retracted at varying speeds or to varying distances, applying a force to the protein. This causes portions of the protein to unravel, and the distinct patterns associated with α-helices and β-pleated sheets can be seen in this data. This allows the exact secondary and tertiary structure of a protein to be determined, but also the energy profile of various conformations, which in turn tells us how the protetin folds.
For Bio-Device 1 however, the team wanted to measure how much force was required to trigger the stress activated Cpx Pathway . This was to be done by observing the culture under the fluoroscope portion of the F-AFM, and then ""prod"" a bacterium at a low force, slowly increasing the stress until a fluorescence response was seen. This would then give a direct measure of the stress threshold for Cpx, a value currently unknown in the literature. This is however, distinctly more difficult that it sounds. Firstly, it can be seen from the image that the culture were already fluorescing a little, likely due to smaller stresses in solution, although some can clearly be seen in the middle of binomial fission, which is known to also activate the pathway. The other issue was with trying to keep the bacterial cells stable enough to continually poke them with AFM tip. Normally, this sort of experiment is typically performed at the Univ of Leeds AFM facility on Giant Unilamellar Vesicles and microbubbles about 5 microns wide. These microstructures are naturally forming precursors to cells, and thus of great interest to bio-physicists . However, as trying to poke a structure 5 microns wide with a tip only 40nm at its widest is akin to throwing a needle from space onto a ship in the Atlantic ocean, experimenters usually adhere the bubbles to the surface with a binding peptide. This could not be done for Bio-Device 1 without potentially triggering the pathway, so instead, it was hoped a more viscous solution and some micro-troughs scratched into the glass slide surface would be enough to keep them steady. Again though, bacteria are very different to inert bubbles of lipids, and tend to forcibly move themsleves regardless, hence results remained inconclusive. The approach showed some promise however, and it is hoped further work will be undertaken on this at a later date.
The presence of background fluorescence in this experiment agrees with fluorescence confocal data and previous literature suggesting that the pCpxR promoter is active during early and mid-log phase of cell growth (cell division). Again, we are interesting in the possibility of using evolutionary development"

Kinetic model The relationship between residual antigen concentration and                     time
In order to optimize the antigen fixation time, we did the relationship between the remaining                         antigen concentration and time when the antigen was immobilized.
In our step of fixing the antigen concentration, we can get the reaction formula                         \(\mathrm{\alpha}\) and give the                         pattern diagram ω1, where \(A\) is the antigen and \(M\) is the reaction site concentration                         on the                         slide. Since the addition liquid fixation and treatment methods are unchanged, \(M_0\) does not                         change.
$$A+M\overset{K_a}{\underset{K_d}{\rightleftharpoons}}A-M \tag{ α }$$
If \(\theta=\frac{[A-M]}{M_0}\), that is, the position occupied by the immobilized antigen                         accounts for the percentage of all positions of the entire slide. Then by the dynamics                         relationship, we can list the relationship:
$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=K_a(1-\theta)[M_0][A]-K_d\theta[M_0]$$
If we determine a \(\theta\), that is, we want the percentage of the fixed position on the slide,                         generally the maximum concentration under the premise of disturbing the liquid crystal. It is                         given by our experimental data that \(\"

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Bioinformatic Analysis for Allergen
In order to determine if our resulting silk products can induce an allergenic response in individuals handling the silk, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of all protein sequences in the potential silk structures to assay for putative allergenicity.  Fasta sequences of the amino acid structure of five silk proteins (AmelF3, MaSP1, MaSP2, B. mori heavy chain silk fibroin (FibH) and the co-spinning module were uploaded to AllergenOnline and aligned against a large peer-reviewed database of known allergens.  The proteins were analyzed using a sliding 80-mer amino acid window, determining if epitope regions of the silk protein were markers for allergenicity.  Hits were scored on an identity threshold of 35% or higher, and verified for accuracy on a E-valu of 1e-7 or lower.    Raw results for each protein sample can be found on the following list .  Overall, the results indicate that these 5 proteins contain no sliding amino acid windows that match the thresholds required for allergenicity; thus indicate our samples are potential hypoallergenic.  This is consistent with previous published results and consensus materials analysis that indicate the poor immunogenicity of our products.

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," series of several days did we train their members in the various laboratory protocols that are commonly used in synthetic biology. This included guiding them through a workflow which included transformation, inoculation, plasmid purification, digestions, ligation, and gel electrophoresis. Though, we ensured that the training had a founding in safety culture that our team upholds.
Beyond this, when Team UAlberta had commenced the InterLab Study Protocols, Team UrbanTundra was essential to our success. We had numerous failed attempts at getting the InterLab devices into E. coli DH5a which eventually consumed our plasmid stock. However, with the help of UrbanTundra, we were able to get the devices transformed. In return, we gave them them purified samples of the InterLab devices for their their own use in their transformation protocols. We also shared our plate reader equipment and gave instruction so that they could also take their InterLab measurements. Without the collaborative relationship with Team UrbanTundra,  we  would not have been able to accomplish what we did.
Manchester
Team UAlberta collaborated with iGEM teams Manchester, Virginia, Macquarie, AQA Unesp, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo, UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB, ITB_Indonesia, KUAS_Korea, and IIT_Delhi on developing a document exploring each nation’s Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) legislation. As a team, due to the challenges we faced explaining our project to the public, we chose to focus on addressing the problem of scientific literacy.  GMOs, with its perceived harmful effects, are often the first thing people think of whenever genetic engineering and synthetic biology are mentioned. Thus, we believe that this report, which discusses GMO legislation around the world, can be a useful tool in dispelling some of the myths surrounding the development and availability of GMOs.
Summary of the Manchester collaboration
1. What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?
The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.
On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.

Overview
Our goal is to create auto-luminescent plants. To these ends, we need to find the luciferase genes that code bio-luminescent proteins and then find a way to transfer them into plants so the plant can glow and the lighter the better. Since our project involves gene transfers across different species, consideration of the different methods, plant species, and sources of genes we could potentially use was crucial to our experimental design.
1. Luciferase gene: Lux operon
The first step in creating glowing plants was to find a gene that codes for bioluminescence. After conducting literature research, we discovered several bacteria and animals that have bioluminescent systems: Aliivibrio fischeri, Alteromonas, Photohabdus, photobacteria, and fireflies. While all result in glowing, we chose Aliivibrio fischeri's lux operon, as the species is considered a key research organism when it comes to studies on bioluminescence and because its genes are easily obtainable.The lux operon is already in the registry.
2. A new part: LuxG
The lux operon found in Aliivibrio fischeri consists of the genes luxCDABEG. Each gene codes for a specific protein that contributes to the luciferase reaction. In an attempt to increase the intensity of light produced, we chose to insert another luxG gene into the plasmid, as the luxG gene provides reduced flavin mononucleotide, which is involved in the luciferase reaction.
3. Target plant: Nicotiana tabacum
Next, we had to decide which plants we would make glow. The options included tobacco plants, Arabidopsis, roses, Christmas trees, and even seaweed. While roses and Christmas trees were a popular choice since they are aesthetically pleasing and could be used as decorations, and while seaweed could create a pleasant effect if it could illuminate water, we decided on tobacco plants as they are readily available and are easier to conduct experiments on.
4. Gene Transfer Method: Agrobacterium-mediated transformation

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt_-_-_TEXT.html," tons of plastics are produced per year, the major share being polymer polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ). With annual global production exceeding 100 million tons in 2010, PET on its own has created a serious waste issue. While in Western countries less than 70% of PET production are recovered through conventional recycling, a huge amount of PET in developing countries is disposed of as unprocessed waste in the environment. This often makes it into rivers and thus finally ends up in the world’s oceans.
Recently it was discovered that erosion of PET in a maritime environment ultimately leads to the creation of nanoparticles with undesired characteristics, as these particles tend to accumulate toxic substances on their surface. There are already some areas in the world’s oceans where measurements have found the concentration of plastic micro-particles to be higher than those of plankton. This is highly alarming, especially since the adverse long-term effects of these particles are yet unknown.
In view of this growing environmental threat and serious health risk, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. So far, biological processes play no role in recycling, as its chemical properties make PET inert to biological degradation. At present there is no microorganism known which is able to digest synthetic plastics.
Our team from TU Darmstadt designed a bacterial recycling system employing E. coli that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product (e.g catechol or amino acids). The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways .
Our mission
The declared goal of our project is to generate a genetically modified micro-organism, which will decompose PET (Polyethylene terephthalate, the main component of plastic bags, plastic bottles etc.) into useful monomers. So far, PET is deemed non-biodegradable and there is yet no known way to recycle it completely. The respective process has to be designed in such a way that the outputs produced can subsequently serve as useful raw material input for other microbial systems. Preferably, these materials should become an economically attractive basis for further useful compounds applicable in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.
More information concerning the how's and who's of this project can be found in the project description .

Meeting addressed fundamental parts of a business plan. Members conducted research into various aspects of the aquaculture industry, consumer behavior, and finances in order to construct a comprehensive business plan.
Policy and Practices
iGem members Sachi and Saie presented at the The Summer Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) symposium. SILS is a program of the Office of Undergraduate Biology (OUB) at Cornell that invited undergraduates to present their summer research activities. These iGem members were able to talk about our research this summer with fishPharm.

We attempted Gibson Assembly with MBP-TEV insert and H (pSB1C3) backbone as an alternative cloning mechanism. The longer sequence will increase EcnB peptide stability.
We also received synthesized plasmids from DNA 2.0 with all EcnB inserts from biobricked Z constructs and MBP-TEV (not in pSB1C3).
Drylab
Dry lab continued with the design of labels and business cards. App development is proceeding without hurdles. The business plan was finalized.
Week 12 (August 23 - August 29)
Wetlab
We had issues with growing cultures for Gibson plates. This was likely due to poor selection on antibiotic plates, possibly due to antibiotic degradation.  We removed inserts from synthesized plasmids and started cloning procedures into pSB1C3.

HONEYBEE SILK PROJECT
Goals
The goal of this project is to recombinantly express honeybee silk proteins, with the intention of creating synthetic honeybee silk fibers.  We hope to develop protocols to efficiently produce the raw protein, process the protein into various materials, and characterize these materials.  Furthermore, by conjugating the honeybee protein with other proteins, we aim to create honeybee silk materials with a wide array of properties and functionalities.
Achievements
As of 9/18 we are well on our way to establishing a strong foundation for this project.  We have cloned five honey bee sequences into biobrick approved format, have expressed and purified honey bee silk protein. (For detailed achievements see below)
Cloning
We have successfully cloned and sequence verified five honeybee silk constructs into the igem psb1c3 plasmid backbone, in the correct biobrick format. A comprehensive list of our biobrick parts can be found here
The first sequence is just the honeybee silk protein #3 in the psb1c3 backbone.  The annotated sequence, along with further details on how we designed and cloned this biobrick can be found here. BBa_K1763000
The second sequence is the same silk coding sequence, but with regulatory elements upstream for protein expression, including BBa_R0010 Promoter and RBS BBa_B0034 .  The sequence can be found here. BBa_K1763001 along with further details on the design and cloning of this biobrick.
The third sequence is a fusion protein between our honeybee silk and the Spycatcher, protein which has specific affinity for SpyCatcher. It also contains regulatory elements like a promoter and rbs for expression. You can view the sequence BBa"

Eleanor's Transformations
Assisted Eleanor in her transformations of CB008 M3 and M6 with pTET+mfa, pAGA1+mCherry, and pPCL2+mCherry.
None of her transformations worked other than M3+mfa which had 2 colonies. I put the plates back into the incubator in case they worked.
Made cultures of M3+rtTA and M6+mfa to re-transform the following day.

Results of Eleanor's Transformations
Plates that grew colonies:
CB008 M3 pAGA1+mCherry = 1 colony
CB008 M3 mfa = 2 colonies
CB008 M6 mfa+pPCL2+mCherry = 4 colonies
Will do a Colony PCR to check plates - unlikely that plates worked
Linearized plasmids: mfa and pAGA1+mCherry
Kara advises us to not used previously linearized plasmid.
will attempt to use Jeffret's digested pPCL2+mCherry for M6.

Our Collaborations
Arizona State University
The ASU team generously offered to sequence our constructs in their lab. In sending them our constructs, we also helped them to test their measurement and identification system. Their sequencing of our CLD+ gene showed us that there was a mutation that caused it to be ineffective. They also sequenced our functional CLD- gene and confirmed that it did indeed produce chlorite dismutase.
Ingenuity Labs
As a component of community outreach, we went to St. Elizabeth Seton Junior High School with the Ingenuity Lab team to give a joint presentation about IGEM and synthetic biology. They also helped us conduct the strawberry DNA extraction experiments and team building exercises for the students. It was a great experience collaborating with their team and introducing the students to concepts from both of our projects. For more information, read our community outreach section.
EPF Lausanne
We had the pleasure of being interviewed by the EPFL iGEM team in Switzerland via a Skype call. This was a chance to get to know global IGEM teams before the jamboree. Check it out here if you want to learn more about our project and our team!
XMU-China
We participated in the XMU China team's yearly newsletter , which featured IGEM teams from all over the world in the areas of project overview, human practices, and collaboration. It was something that gave us the opportunity to get in touch with other teams who were looking for collaboration, and to learn more about other teams before the Giant Jamboree.
aGEM
Prior to the Giant Jamboree, we went down to the University of Calgary for the regional Alberta Genetic Engineering Machine Competition. We exchanged ideas and received some very valuable feedback with other collegiate and high school iGEM teams. Structured very similarly to the Jamboree, aGEM included presentations, prizes, and a panel of judges who all had experience judging teams at the Giant Jamboree. We achieved 2nd place"

The facility will also be responsible for the full design, fabrication, assembly, and quality control of the detector system: All components of the system.
Manufacturing facilities will ship cartridge components to FREDsense Technologies for addition of biological components: lyophilized bacteria and dried electroactive compounds and buffer chemicals. As these components are required in extremely low volumes (for example 100μL of bacteria per cartridge), FREDsense Technologies will have the capacity to produce these in house. As we have significant experience in growing and lyophilizing bacteria, we will also be capable of producing these components efficiently.
Shipment of cartridges to FREDsense Technologies will occur on a per-contract or sale basis depending on demand (see selling activities for details).  Detectors and cartridges will be held at the FREDsense Technologies facility based on a percentage of sales from the previous three months and projections for sales in the future. This will allow for the fulfillment of small orders whereas large contracts or batch orders will take more time to distribute to the client as they will be made to order. FREDsense Technologies staff will be responsible for final assembly of the cartridges, quality control testing, packaging, and distribution for the first few years of production, until scale-up is needed.  Detector systems will ideally be directly distributed from the manufacturer, however, if this is not possible, FREDsense will distribute the detectors as well.  At this point, we will sub-contract to a distributor.
As capacity is reached, new manufacturing contracts will be established with larger partners and different manufacturing paradigms in order to maintain profitability and efficiency during company growth.
Assumptions - Long-term storage of the product is feasible as the bacteria and chemicals are in a lyophilized state.  Bioreactor grow-up for a batch order would take 24 hours based on preliminary technical findings for our organism.  We estimate that the amount of bacteria that we would potentially need for each cartridge is 0.1mL of 1x109 cells/mL, meaning that roughly a 10L bioreactor would account for over 100,000 cartridges.  These numbers were determined based on the concentrations of bacteria used in our lab-scale system. Lyophilization may take up to two days which means sales turn around times may be affected for small orders.  It may be of value to have a set of ready-made products that could be distributed next day.
Capacity - Starting capacity for operations will be set to accommodate the production of bulk numbers of cartridges in the hundreds (involving daily operations) with the intent of increasing this production to accommodate thousands of cartridges"

Doctors’ View on Current Situation
Lung Cancer
● Early diagnosis is vital for lung cancer patients as only detection and surgery in the early stage can hold the possibility of cure. However, 2/3 of the patients are diagnosed too late and have already lost the chance of being cured. These un-surgery cases can be called as advanced lung cancer.
● Now numerous people blame the cause of lung cancer on environmental problems, but even in a good environment condition, the incidence of lung cancer is equally high. To some extent, it can be said that the leading cause of lung cancer is smoking.
● According to statistics of 2012, incidence of lung cancer has now made top of all cancer incidence in China, especially for male. Obvious correlation can be observed between smoking and lung cancer. And terribly, lung cancer maintains high mortality rate. The five-year survival rate of clinical lung cancer (i.e., the probability of the patients who still alive five years after diagnosis.) is approximately zero.
● Lung cancer patients stand for unbearable and excruciating pressure both physically and psychologically. There are also some severe complications along with lung cancer, resulting in plummeted life quality after the illness. For example, advanced patients may experience struggle when breathing, chest tightness, persistent cough, and that lung cancer can also be transferred to all other parts of the body, such as brain, bones, causing severe pain, intracranial hypertension, weakness and other symptoms.
Current Treating Situation
● There are 3 main treatments for advanced lung cancer: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
● Before targeted drug therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have an average survival period that is no more than one year, and that with other means of therapy (e.g. Radiotherapy), the period can be extended for only 2 to 3 months. Chemotherapy certainly lead to a plummet of life quality of patients. Finally, most patients lose confidence and Survival consciousness during their cure.

● In the past few decades, molecular targeting drugs visibly elongated the patient's survival periods and improve the disease control. Recently, the so-called ""four carriages"" of cancer treatment are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and molecular targeting drugs.
● Among the treatments of lung cancer, surgery is generally practiced on early patients. The early diagnosis rate of lung cancer, however, is relatively limited because all tumors had no specific symptoms at early stage. Therefore, rate of patients who are able to be performed surgery also take a minor part. To make matters worse, cancer generally"

played around with the new dialysis clips. Loaded a dialysis bag with red food coloring solution to visualize leaks.
some things we learned:
apply the clips so that they clamp down on the flat part of the fold
have ample length of tubing folded over for the clips
going up to 3 folds for the tubing is ok. The fold will still be held by the clips.
started a new dialysis, using the Snakeskin dialysis tubing and dialysis clips.
we cut 15 mm of tubing for 10 mL of silk solution. This was waaaaay too big. The dialysis clips allow us to be a bit more conservative on how much tubing we use per mL solution.

1st change: 6:25 pm
2nd change: 1:00 pm, May 13
3rd change: 7:00 pm, May 13
4th change: 2:00 pm, May 14
Note: no leakage observed. Good sign so far.
centrifuged the previously dialyzed silk
note to self: just use a more powerful centrifuge. It isn't worth it to split up the sample into microtubes to spin in our table top centrifuge.
ended up with 25 mL of silk

1. The 2-step PCR products were tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel. However, the band sizes of both gBlock 2 and the whole construct were wrong though they showed similar bands.
2. New gBlock 2 had arrived and resuspension with TE buffer was done so that the final concentration became 10 ng/uL. The fragment was then tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel but the band was invisible due to the low concentration of gBlock 2 in the well.
3. PCR was performed to amplify the new gBlock 2 using Q5 polymerase. 2 temperatures were used for the 30-second annealing step: 59.9 degree Celsius and 61.5 degree Celsius.

Approach
Cellulose to Cellobiose
In the endeavour to engineer E. coli to utilise cellulose as it’s only carbon source, inspiration was drawn from the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team project, who developed two BioBricks containing the cenA and cex genes. In this project, the α-hemolysin transport system was utilised by creating HlyA-tagged endo- and exo-β-1,4-glucanases, using a peptide linker. To implement this system in E. coli, heterogeneous expression of hlyB, hlyD, cenA-hlyA and cex-hlyA was required.
To achieve  this, DNA synthesis of cenA and cex was ordered, each tagged with HlyA. The genes encoding HlyB and HlyD were retrieved from the part BBa_K1166002 by phusion PCR. Using the resulting PCR product, the following construct was composed for the degradation of cellulose into cellobiose, as illustrated in Figure 10.
Figure 10. BioBrick , containing the genes cenA, cex, hlyB, and hlyD controlled by PenI-regulated promoters.
Cellobiose to Glucose
The Edinburgh 2011 iGEM team team created a BioBrick with the bglX gene, which is endogenous to E. coli, in the endeavour to increase the efficiency of the degradation of cellobiose to glucose. However, it seems that the enzymatic activity of the periplasmic β-glucosidase has faded as a result of evolution, rendering E. coli incapable of surviving solely on cellobiose. Thus, even though E. coli can absorp cellobiose, it is not able to survive with this as it’s only carbon source.
As a solution to this, a part containing the cep94A gene was synthesised, with the intend to enable E. coli to survive solely on cellobiose. Thus, a construct containing cep94A controlled by a LacI-regulated promoter, was composed, as illustrated in Figure 11.

Staining
All of the constructs were transfected into HEK 293FT cell. We stained mitochondria with Mitotracking dye and fixed the cell. Under fluorescence microscope, we could see the position of the mitochondria and the GFP. By merging the image together, we could determine whether MLS is targeting GFP into mitochondria.
Transfected cell was stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Invitrogen), a rosamine-based stain, to stain the mitochondria. When they entered live mitochondria, they would be oxidized and bind with peptide to give a fixable fluorescent complex, which can be observed under fluorescence microscope and be retained after fixation.
The manufacturer’s standard protocol was used with staining solution of final working concentration 200nM, and was incubated for 20 minutes under a humidified atmosphere, containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C during staining.

Collaborations
There are three collaborations our team  with other teams.
Collaborate with  the team TUST_China
What help did we give them?
TUST_China shared their improved Tetracycline HPLC Protocol; They hope that we can help them take water samples and measure the concentration of tetracycline in water; further help TUST_China to improve the mapping of tetracycline pollution levels in waters in China.
After a few days of measurement, we obtained the results of tetracycline in the waters near the Beijing University of Chemical Technology and sent it to TUST_China. It can be seen that tetracycline pollution in Beijing still exists.
What did they help us?
Due to the lack of experience in measuring fluorescence values in our laboratory, we can't correctly grasp the time of fluorescence measurement, and the fluorescence plate is not enough. Our laboratory microplate reader is old and cannot guarantee accuracy, so in order to save time and less Taking a detour, we designed a quantitative experiment and then sent it to TUST_China to commission them to help us measure the fluorescence values of different fatty acid gradients. We designed four control groups. The first group only added 50 ul of 20% arabinose solution as a control; the second group added 50 ul of 20% arabinose solution, and after 1 hour, 100 ul of different concentrations of fat solution were added, and the fatty acid concentrations were 25 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 400 mM, respectively. The third group only added fatty acid solutions of different gradients, the concentration was the same as that of the second group, and the fourth group was the blank control group.
TUST_China helped us to analyze the fluorescence values of the bacterial culture after eight hours of cultivation as follows:
After receiving the fluorescence value measured by TUST_China, we can analyze the data of the group. The fluorescence value of the second group is higher than that of the first group of arabinose"

Also, she asked us how we organize our fundraising. There are two possibilities for sponsoring: financial support or donations in kind. Due to the fact that Merck KGaA sponsors us every year, we usually focus on the latter. For financial support we set up letters very early every year and send these to possible sponsors. We suggested to the team to already do this for next year’s competition.
The last topic she was interested in was concerning the team structure and how we organize a team of about 30 members. For our three student team leaders it is all about communication with the members, the lab groups, the lab leader, last year’s members and our instructing professor. The team leaders must stay on top of things and arrange duties clearly to avoid two people working on the same task.
We hope the team can profit from our advices just like we did last year from iGEM Stockholm and wish them the best of luck for their first year at the Jamboree!
iGEM Düsseldorf
Over the years, it has become a pleasure for us to design postcards and send these to Düsseldorf. They collect them from many iGEM teams and send these to all teams designing a postcard. It is always great fun to see how other teams designed their postcards.
Thank you, Düsseldorf for spending time organizing the opportunity to exchange information about the teams’ projects in a fun and innovative manner. As always it was a pleasure for us!
Have a look at all the postcards !
German and European Meetup
Again this year, iGEM TU Darmstadt was part of the German Meetup (Marburg, June) and the European Meetup (Munich, July). During both meetups we enjoyed having poster sessions, exchanging project ideas, finding possible collaborations and hearing talks of experts in the field of synthetic biology.
Meetups are a great opportunity for us to present our project to a broad and interested audience, to get in contact with other iGEM teams and as a preparation for the poster sessions in Boston. Discussions about our project were very helpful to obtain other perspectives concerning our project and gaining a lot of impressions and ideas on how to improve our project. Therefore, we thank Marburg and Munich for hosting and organizing these meetups. It was a pleasure to participate and to learn a lot from the other teams."

Data Sources
During our project, we needed many data. We used data of protein-protein interactions for signal transduction pathway deciding, protein sequence and domain description for modified FGFR design, gene sequence for modified FGFR sequence synthesis, and structures or sequences of antibodies and FGF binding domain of FGFR for structural alignment. These data were acquired from Uniprot, PID, NCBI and RCSB PDB.
Uniprot
Uniprot provides sequences of many proteins and domain description of well-researched proteins. Key advantage of using Uniprot is domain description: to design engineered protein for detecting Mycobacterium without knowledge of function of each part of protein. Tuberculosis antigen MPT51 is impossible one. Uniprot provided the information of location of FGF binding domain of FGFR, which is replaced by our single-chain antibody 16A1. Uniprot also provided sequences of some antibodies to make single chain antibody sequences.
Site URL: http://www.uniprot.org/
PID
PID (Pathway Interaction Database) provides the interaction networks between protein and protein or protein and DNA through certain signal transduction pathway. This Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and protein-DNA interaction (PDI) data helped us to port Human signal transduction pathway which is activated by FGF to fission yeast. Without knowledge of PPI and PDI through FGF signal pathway, we must undergo many trials and errors of adding and removing of proteins and promoters to form working signal transduction pathway. With the data from PID, we decided to port the FGF->FGFR1->STAT1->GAS pathway from human to fission yeast.
Site URL: http://pid.nci.nih.gov/
NCBI
NCBI provides biologists with many data. We used protein sequences and DNA sequences from NCBI nucleotide database and protein database. DNA sequence is very important to us because gene sequence of original protein is required to synthesize novel engineered protein. Even we don't synthesize gene, we should know the sequence of gene because BioBrick requires not only nucleotide material, but also its sequence information. NCBI also provided us with sequences of some antibodies to make single chain antibody sequence, and many Journals through PubMed service.

Samples were extracted and purified from the gel, however nanodrop results showed extremely low concentration for HydA. It was decided this would be repeated. Afterwards, HydA and HydB N-terminus were ligated into the pSB1C3 vector and frozen for later transformation. More J04450 was inoculated and mini-prepped as a source of vector. HydC/Fdh, HydB C-terminus and HyaA was successfully ligated into pSB1C3 and digest confirmed a mix-up in sample labels however bands did correspond to correct gene inserts.
A practice tri-parental conjugation trial was conducted following protocol, using samples obtained from a PhD student in the lab
We conducted experiments to practise growing bacteria for creating anaerobic growth curves and to practise using the gas chromatograph. We grew wildtype MR-1 and double knock out (∆HydABC,HyaABC) Shewanella strains in anaerobic conditions for 24 hours in hungate tubes then analysed the headspace gases using gas chromatography to calculate the hydrogen yield.
Week 7 15.08-19.08
Due to the uncertainty of the identity of these potential BioBricks, HydC/Fdh, HydB N-terminus and HyaA plasmid DNA samples were sent for DNA sequencing confirmation. The results proved that these samples were successful BioBricks, but that samples had been mislabelled, samples were subsequently correctly labelled. The frozen samples of ligated HydA and HydB N-terminus were transformed successfully into α-select E. coli and incubated overnight. A colony from each was used to inoculate LB, incubated overnight and mini-prepped the following day.
We conducted a practice arabinose induced protein expression trial using samples from a PhD student in the lab. SDS-PAGE gels were set up and used to practice analysing protein expression. The tri-parental conjugation of RFP (J04450) Biobrick into S. oneidensis was set up for the following week.
We grew MR1 and ∆HydABC,HyaABC Shewanella strains in anaerobic conditions for 24 hours in hungate tubes and analysed the amount of hydrogen produced using gas chromatography. This was to serve as a control value for our later experiments.

ZJU-China,2013,Team:ZJU-China#HumanPractice#TheTale#Chapter one_-_-_TEXT.html," something familiar on Little Dot. He knew deep in Little Dot’s heart, it was pure. “Then let’s go.”
Little Dot jumped forward with strive. But little prince’s step was much bigger than hers. Hence, the little prince squatted down and put his hand on the ground.
“Come on, just tell me the direction.”
Little Dot was moved by the goodness of the little prince. They walked along a track, back to the setting sun, to Little Dot’s transparent home which was built by glass.
“Wow, it is really beautiful here. But, why do all of the flowers face only one orientation?”
“They are the sunflowers. And the sun is what their pursue only throughout their whole life.” Little Dot explained detailedly.
“I love the twilight. Shall we sit down and watch it for a while?”
“Yeah.” Accompanied by little prince, Little Dot was delighted.
In silence, the little prince watched the setting sun. It should be the first time for him to enjoy the beloved scenery in such a bright mood.
“Can we see the setting sun many times in one day on your planet?”
“No, but you can see it again tomorrow.”
With time going by, the sunlight became softer and softer, and the dark sky was inset with twinkling stars. The little prince lay down and fell asleep quickly. Maybe he was just tired after a long tour, and his spirit was low after so many farewells.

Miniaturized microbial fuel cell (mMFC)
Traditional microbial fuel cells are bulky and inefficient. They are costly and less likely to be used in the industrial scale. We are fully aware of this issue, so we came up with the idea of miniaturized microbial fuel cell (mMFC).
According to our literature review, interests toward designs of the mMFC have been increasing over the last decades. Various models have been built and proved to be very successful [1, 2, 3]. For example, Shogo Inoue and colleagues have demonstrated that MFC can be as small as the size of one cent US coin (Figure 2) [1].  Even though the volume of their MFCs is smaller than 50 uL, the current produced is increased considerably  that up to 12 mW/100〖mm〗^3 was recorded regardless of modifications on both the MFCs and the bacteria.  In Figure 2, four MFC designs which are different by building materials and chamber volumes were compared [2]. There is no doubt that mMFCs can perform better. They produced about 300 times higher power densities than that of the bigger models.
Recently we came across the Bielefeld team who share the same interest and passion about MFC as a potential source of green energy. We get in touch and know that they also work on the mtrCAB complex, so we immediately see this as an opportunity for collaboration. We ask them to help us build the miniaturized MFC (Figure3) as they have facilities and materials for construction. We thank them for their generosity and wish them success in their iGEM project.
The MFC that they have sent us has 2 chambers, which in turn are divided by the cathode and the anode. Each chamber is 2.3 cm long, 2.3 cm wide and 1.5 cm high. The volume of each chamber is 7.9 cm3. The volume of the whole MFC is 15.8 cm3.

ZJU-China,2012,Team:ZJU-China#humanpractice.htm_-_-_TEXT.html," year, ZJU-China had tremendous ideas about human practice and actually did research about it. With the spirit of share and fun, here comes our HP creative idea workshop, aiming to provide brilliant and workable thoughts about iGEM human practice for future teams, and trying to develop insights of a real effective human practice. Needless to say, we even try some ideas of our workshop. Well, it went well!
 
Let’s take a look at what we tried this year! ZJU-China held a special event called ""Scaffold in your eyes"" in campus, and attracted a lot of attention. ZJU-China created a cute love story to illustrate our main idea of project, then we made an animation of this story, ""Scaffold in Syn & Bio's love"", in which we even create our own song (with the tune of Jason Mraz ""I'm yours""). It is so awesome and so fun, definitely worth seeing! The video received more than 2200 clicks so far, and we are so happy to see the comments like ""Well, iGEM seems fun!"", ""Your project is interesting"". Additionally, ZJU-China thought ethical thinking is also crucial, and apart from the safety sheet we undergraduate researchers have to think about, we left the question directly to our freshmen in their first English Speech Contest.

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," still have a lot of time to figure out what I would like to do after. Nevertheless, I would for sure pursue a master degree in the either Biomedicine or Bioentrepreneurship.
Why did you join iGEM?
I discovered iGEM when looking at prospective universities, some of which had an iGEM team. I have to say, I was a bit surprise to discover that KI nor any university in Stockholm had not participated into this very cool competition. When I heard that a team was going to be built up here, I jumped on the occasion !
If you could ride a dinosaur into battle, what kind would it be and why?
It would be a Ceratopsian. Because not only the horns of its face would look badass but they would also help me fight the enemy.

+ Three questions to Linnea
What are your plans after university?
No idea, but after iGEM i will an awesome party with all amazing people I have worked with in iGEM!
Why did you join iGEM?
I got interested in synthetic biology during a course in gene technology. A few weeks later I came in contact with the Stockholm iGEM team and off course I applied!
What food item/meal describes your life, and why?
The spice/herb Perforate St John’s-wort would describe my life. It’s found indigenous in Europe but gan be grown in more temperate places of the world. (I like being on vacation). It is used as a antidepressant (I like having fun) and is traditionally used to fought off evil (doing iGEM cancer detection). And it’s a good spice for making Brännvin. (I like crayfish parties.)
Maximilian Karlander
Studies Biotechnology B.Sc at KTH Royal Institute of Technology
+ Three questions to Max
What are your plans after university?
To work with medical biotechnological applications, like detection or therapy of advanced diseases.
Why did you join iGEM?
As it is a fantastic opportunity to try working in a real biotechnological/synthetic biology project which actually focuses on my areas of interest. Also it is a great compliment to the, in comparison, rather awkward bachelors project we do at KTH. No offence against the projects themselves, but you only get that far with a purely theoretical project.
