TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," addition, we as well as did the trails to measure the impact of yields of BC from other impact factor as ethanol and citric acid etc..(Glu/Gly = Glucose/Glycerin)
We designed the table below and followed the steps to process our experiments, expiring different ratio of incubation  and carbon source. Moreover, we dried the BC from day 7 culture medium and measured both the weight and thickness to obtain relative data.
The comparison of weight and thickness of BC showed that on the condition of equivalent carbon source and inoculated ratio of G.xy and E.coli is 4/1, the yields of BC will at least advance 11.5% compared to other groups. At the same time, we as well as discovered that the capacity of G.xy secrete BC has been significantly improved  with the ratio of glucose and glycerol is 3/2~4/1.
After setting up the inoculation level and the range of carbon ratio,  we moved forward to optimize the carbon source through RSM. During this process, we collected a series of data which based on the yield as main target and  the pH residue as co-factor, the data is present below:
The finally optimize formula which has already reached the ideal ultimate pH and visibly  improved the yields of BC is :
formula
Glu(g)
Gly(ml)
50%EtOH
Predicting Final pH
Target
15.11
9.53
0.05
4.36114
this optimized formula has similar carbon ratio to what we have measured  in the culture medium of  previous experiments, therefore we ultimately set up the carbon ratio as glucose/glycerol=3/2 of our co-culture medium.
There is what we have gathered after utilized 3/2 medium in the co-culture system based on the former experiments:
Compared the pH residue of single G.xy culture and co-culture during the fermentation, obviously approximately 15h after inoculation, pH of co-culture started to significantly drop while the yields of BC from co-culture clearly outnumber the yields of single G.xy culture.

The graph above shows no peaks at 137 and 81 (left).  (right) The instrument: Proton Transfer Reaction - Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer
Further statistical tests were carried out using ‘R’programme in order to arrive at conclusive results. The data obtained from the test had a non-normal frequency distribution (positively skewed) which was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Therefore non-parametric tests (Spearman correlation and Kendall tau tests)were used for statistical analysis
The non-parametric test used included; Spearman correlation and Kendall tau tests.
Samples 1,2 & 3 = RFP plates
Samples 4,5 & 6 = 10.2 plates
Samples 7,8 & 9 = 5.1 plates
Correlation was made between each of the RFP plates and the limonene biobrick/pBS1C3 plates (there were 9 plates in total; 3 RFP and 6 limonene biobrick transformant plates) in the following order:
a) Samples 1, 4 and 7
b) Samples 2, 5 and 8
c) Samples 3, 6 and 9
After carrying out both tests (Spearman and Kendall) on groups a,b and c, p-values were < 0.05. As shown below (Spearman and Kendall respectively);
a) Between 1& 4 - p-value= 6.412e-10 and 2.53e-07
Between 1 & 7- p-value = 9.82e-13 and 4.558e-08
b) Between 2 & 5- p-value = 1.534e-09 and 3.1e-07
Between 2 & 8- p-value = 3.579e-12 and 5.655e-08
c) Between 3 & 6- p-value=8.359e-13 and 3.81e-08
Between 3 & 9 - p-value=3.566e-12 and 7.004e-08
Thus the null hypothesis (There is no correlation between the RFP plates and limonene biobrick/shipping vector) was rejected.

Type of Innovation. Biolink aims to improve a technological process by partly changing technology used, thus realizing a Technological Process Innovation. As the improvement builds upon the existing biofilm formation process, without   any radical changes, we label it as incremental. The innovation aims to increase productivity and reduce costs of the entire production/research process. We argue that effects are not directly noticeable by biofilm removal products’ end-users.
Innovation Process. Because it involves advanced technologies, innovation will continue in an industrial and/or academic setting. We perceive three main actor groups enabling innovation:
Academia: the foundation of our project. The academic network can provide knowledge and finance to help kick-start and incubate innovation in the beginning. Within a business incubator, our project can reach a mature enough phase to     begin industrial development.
Industry: By industry we refer to any industrial sector that utilizes (or is affected by) biofilms in some way relevant to our project. Collaboration with industry provides an application-oriented direction and financial support. Moreover,     co-development with a company offers Biolink access to a larger pool of shared resources, and helps distribute risk.
3D printer producers provide us with a necessary enabling technology. We collaborate with them regarding 3D printer technology, integration with biofilm formation and analysing if market requirements can be fulfilled. An alternative     to contracting 3D printer producers directly would be including students from Industrial Engineering in our project. Through this faculty within TU Delft, Biolink can gain future employees that could form a 3D printing department within our business,     removing the need for external collaboration.
Adoption at organizational level. Following the innovation phase, we plan to market our product to companies with whom co-development was done. Pioneer companies who invested in co-development are best prepared to adopt our solution and   continue to support it until it becomes profitable. Successful adoption of the new technology will encourage other companies to consider our services. This offers an incentive for business growth, expanding service breadth (different companies will   want customized solutions) and specialization.
The SWOT Analysis highlights what internal and external factors can influence the evolution of Biolink. These factors mostly affect Biolink at strategic level (how the company performs on long term). Strengths and Weaknesses refer to   internal characteristics of Biolink as a company and our capabilities of performing operations. Opportunities and Threats are external factors that might influence our progress.

Project Description
1. Methane to methanol
Back to sub-goals
Since the C-H bond in methane is very strong and requires expensive high tech equipment1 we want to explore the possibilities of bioconversion of methane. Methanotrophs are single-cell organisms that can oxidize methane and use it as their sole carbon and energy source2. To date there are two enzyme complexes known that can do the task of breaking methane; soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), and the membrane bound particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO)1–3. Both enzymes break methane with the following reaction:
Other than that they both can convert methane to methanol and require oxygen for the process, are they structurally very different. Most methanotrophs express pMMO, whereas sMMO is less often present. pMMO is expressed at high copper levels, which makes sense as it uses copper in the core of the enzyme to break the strong C-H bond in methane. At low copper levels however, sMMO is expressed which uses iron-ions in the enzyme core for breaking methane.2–4 The methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (M. capsulatus (Bath)) is one of the most studied methanotrophs that has both pMMO and sMMO. In our project we used the sMMO operon of (M. capsulatus (Bath)), more information about sMMO (insert link to scroll down). Last years iGEM (2014) team Braunschweig, Germany cloned the sMMO genes of the methanotroph M. capsulatus (Bath) for the purpose of expressing them in Escherichia coli (E. coli). We chose to build on to their project and got their six cloned sMMO genes Bba_K139"

Collaboration with Tec-Monterrey Team
We met the Tec-Monterrey team thanks to the fact that they got in touch with us through social networks. As we share a language with this team it has been easier for us to relate and thanks to it, 2 collaborations have come out:
Computational modeling of structures of interest
This has been the most important collaboration with this team. Our team has a member with knowledge of prediction and editing computation of biological molecule structures. They asked us if we could obtain the structure of 3 proteins of interest for their project and perform some animation in which the protein was observed from different points of view. To obtain all the structures of the proteins, the procedure explained in the Computational improvement section was followed:
Protein Structure Predicion
The 3 proteins were the following ones:
CAS1 and CAS2
These two proteins often form a complex and have been studied on numerous occasions. The animations are the following:
RT EC86
This protein is a retrotranscriptase. And yet it has not been so studied and its structure had to be predicted.
Mentoring in the wiki building
For the reason that in our team there is no one specialized in web design and wiki building, nobody had the necessary knowledge to start with the formation of the wiki. That's why we took advantage of the fact that we already had contact with this team to ask them to mentor us in some decisions when building the wiki. He was asked for help us in understanding how to upload the different files, about the operation of the templates and the scripts.
Mentoring of Valencia Team
For the reason that in our team there is no one specialized in web design and wiki building, nobody had the necessary knowledge to start with the formation of the wiki.  Knowing it is not a trivial task, we decided to contact an experience team in iGEM such as  the Valencia UPV and take advantage of their experience to help us building  and working  with the wiki.
They answered us and  offered  to mentor our team about  building the wiki, as it was a great opportunity to make a collaboration between teams,  we happily agreed.
We schedule a meeting via Skype with two of their teammates in charged of software ( Héctor and Blanca) who guided us through the main concerns we had at the moment:
- A general explanation of how the media wiki platform works.
- How to upload the different files.
- The operation of the templates and the scripts.

We even want to find a kind of bacteria that is suitable for transformation so that it can combine the functions of blocking and emulsification.
3. Introduction To FY-07
So Enterobacter sp. FY-07 is exactly the one we are aiming to engineer. What characteristics make FY-07 suitable for us?
First, it is facultative anaerobic, which makes it possible that it can grow under anaerobic condition. The reservoir is in anoxic state, but the absolute anaerobic state cannot be maintained during the reservoir treatment, so the best strain is facultative anaerobe. Besides, another advantage of facultative anaerobe is that it can be cultured in aerobic condition to shorten culture time because aerobic metabolism is faster than anaerobic metabolism. Second, it is easy for genetic manipulation. Similar to E.coli, it has fast growth and clear genetic background (sequenced). Third, one of its most outstanding features is that it is separated from oilfield and able to produce cellulose naturally under anaerobic condition. It is important because we have already confirmed that cellulose is able to block water passages through physical simulation and profile control experiments at our instructor's Lab. Interestingly, its cellulose yields in stone crevice are higher than that in shake flasks. This is more beneficial for cellulose production in the oil reservoir that is sponge-like, therefore takes effect in blocking.
4. Our Design
To combine the functions of blocking and emulsification, our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 so as to controllably produce cellulose and rhamnolipid.
Rhamnolipid, a kind of biosurfactant with the ability to emulsify oil, has three important characteristics. Surface activity. It can promote capillarity by reducing the water surface tension. Interfacial activity. It can break the water-oil interface and mix them by reducing interfacial tension. Emulsify property. It can stabilize the water-oil mixture, promote emulsification. So how to achieve our goal? RhlAB is the essential gene in rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway. And bcs is the essential gene in cellulose synthetic pathway. We can see that the Glucose-1-phosphate is the common intermediate metabolite. So it will be great if at first the cellulose is produced to block the existing channels, then with the"

At A Glance
This year, we have disseminated two worldwide health problems: heart attacks and strokes, and its possible clinical solutions. Due to their complexities as well as components of mechanisms and treatments, our project poses a broad perspective and approach together with our policy & practices activities.
Here, you can take a look at the main components of our project design.
The Problem
Ischemia is the restriction of blood supply to tissues, generally caused by the blockage of a clot due to the reduction or inhibition of blood flow. This process results in the shortage of oxygen and nutrition vital for metabolism and survival of cells. Since oxygen is delivered to tissues only via the blood, insufficient blood supply cause tissue cells to starve. Especially for the heart and brain, irreversible damage is highly likely to  occur in as little as 3–4 minutes at body temperature.
Ischemia is related to the most serious conditions of today's medical problems. The well-known heart attack, which is responsible for most of the deaths worldwide, is actually an ischemic condition. In addition to this, the loss of a specific region of the brain because of poor blood perfusion is associated with ischemia too and is famously known as stroke. In fact, every year, about 1.5 million Americans have heart attack causing 500,000 deaths. A heart attack occurs every 20 seconds which results in a death approximately every minute.
As it can be assumed, one treatment of ischemia  is removing the blockage. However, this has the possibility of making the situation more chaotic. Today, it is possible to dissolve the clot ingredients with specific medications. However, adapted tissue to hypoxic media can be poisoned from oxygen. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage due to the induction of oxidative stress rather than restoration of normal function.
This new state may cause some unwilling reactions which have the ability to produce toxic chemicals called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are some oxygen intermediate products which have an absence of one electron in their covalent bonds. This makes them ultimately undetermined. By means of this, ROS can disrupt almost every cellular structure including DNA, cell membrane and organelles. Because of the nature of ischemic conditions, the final solution should include the restoration of every negative outcome due to ischemia.
Our Approach

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," participants agree that different, specified      submission interfaces should be designed for contructs, promoter,      RBS, CDS and terminals is needed during Registry of Standard Parts. But, there are very strong and valid arguments against it such as,      losing the flexibility of the registry will not allow future submission      of unclassified parts.
We suggest keeping the parts submission interface as is, until     these concerns are addressed.
75% of participants agree that Out-dated, un-available      and not-characterized parts in the Registry of Standard Parts should      be removed to an archive after the consent of the designer.
“It would be great to see some sort of organization like this! I     agree that unavailable parts should be followed up on and removed if     necessary. I also think that parts which are not sufficiently documented     should be highlighted in some way. Once these parts are identified,     teams can actively characterize them as part of their projects or as     side projects.”
“Think about these things: (i) who decides when a part is out-dated,     and how can that person know that an old part cannot have a novel use     in the future? (ii) likewise, an uncharacterized part may be both characterized     and used in the future”
We suggest building a backup system, such as an archive, to sort     out the rarely used, un-available and un-categorized parts until they     are in line with the enforced standards.
91% of participants have same opinion with us, which      is that standardization of the nomenclatures used for each different      composition of parts is necessary.

2. If the external pH=2,5 and internal pH begins pH=4.2 ± 0.1. GDAR system will activate for acid resistance.
3. GadC is a transmembrane protein. The external pH begins to change from neutral pH to acidic pH, C-plug (is GadC’s subunit) will open. Then glutamate will take inside.
4. Glutamate in cells convert to GABA by GadB/C that’s glutamate decarboxylase isozymes These steps are as follows:
*This step contains pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes that replace the α-carboxyl groups of their amino acid substrates with a proton that is recruited from the cytoplasm.
*HCl that diffusion from outside dissociates H+ and Cl-. This H+ is used and CO² is released by the agency of GadA/B isozymes than this is the last stage of glutamate changes to GABA. Besides this is the most important and the last step for acid resistance
5. If H+ leaves HCl it is staying back Cl and it will be export from the transport of chlorine channel.
6. The emitted CO² is taken out by diffusion.
7. Finally, the uncovered GABA is thrown out from the transmembrane protein GadC.
Design
In this section, our aim is to synthesize the TlpB protein in our E.coli so that It can penetrate the stomach mucus layer, where our pathogenic bacteria, H.pylori, resides.
Tobenhance the production of our protein TIpB, we aim to assemble our TIpB gene with T7 promoter which is a fast and strong promoter whilst designing our parts.
To control the system, we decided to add a Lac Operator, where LacI protein can bind, between TIpB gene sequence and promoter. We searched for an expression vector which includes Lac Operon and found that peT45-b has the properties.
When ordering our genes we added RFC10 prefix site to 3’ end and RFC10 suffix site to the 5’ end of TlpB gene and also added BamHI and XhoI restriction site sequence on the Pet45-b for cloning.
We planned to clone TlpB gene we ordered as described above to the Pet45-b vector with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes.
When this cloning is achieved succesfully, there will be a construct which has the order T7 Promoter-Lac Operon (LacO)- HisTag-TlpB and also there are"

Origin
In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.

Architecture
Error creating thumbnail: File missing
Simulation iteration scheme
The simulator is designed to be highly modular. The simulator's core contains almost no functionality and the missing functionality is provided by plugins. This design allows for an extension of the simulator's functionality by the addition of plugins written by someone else. Plugins are loaded on demand by a simulation file, so unnecessary functionality is never used.
Simulation is computed by stepping over independent iterations. Each iteration is defined by a time step and all modules and objects (provided by plugins) are updated. A module is a unit that is updated in each iteration and provides some global functionality (e.g. diffusion). Only one module of the same type is allowed to be in a simulation. Objects are simulation entities that provide some local functionality (e.g. Yeast cells).
Objects within a simulation are driven by a physical engine ( Box2D ) so interactions between objects look almost realistic. The physical engine uses different time steps (engine is designed for games and generally expects a simulation step around 33 ms) than are used by the simulation and thus the physical engine uses coefficients to convert units between those two systems. The reason for separation of the time steps is that different simulations can require larger time steps (seconds, minutes, ...) - cell growth is a slow process that takes hours and having the same time step does not make sense in the context of the simulation.
The simulator is written in ISO C++11 that provides good performance but is a quite difficult language to pick up. There is also Python language support for scripting purposes of dynamic parts of a simulation.
Visualization
The CeCe simulator has the ability to visualize a given simulation ( OpenGL ). Final scene visualization is done by a combination of modules and objects visualization (if they provide it). The visualization is fast so a powerful graphics card is not required. Even an integrated GPU is able to render the visualization in real-time.
The underlying models
Default simulator package contains several plugins that offer additional functionalities, which are described below. More detailed overview of how the simulator has been used in our project can be found on the modeling page.
Diffusion
The diffusion plugin is used to simulate diffusion where regions with high concentrations spread to regions with lower concentrations. Our model is able to account for this by distributing a grid cell concentration between surrounding grid cells. The following formula is used to compute the signal distribution matrix (in our case it's 3x3):
$$M_{i,j} = \frac{1}{4 \pi D dt} \cdot e^{\frac{d_{i,j}^2}{4 D dt}}\;i,\"

TJU_China for Jilin_China
We helped Jilin_China with an examination between Indigo synthesis and tryptophan. They used monooxygenase TfdB-JLU to degrade 2, 4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase and found that there is some blue matters when culturing bacteria. According to literature searched, they suspected that TfdB-JLU can catalyze benzprole or tryptophan to synthesize indigo. So we designed a test to confirm this guess.                  We cultured their bacteria in LB fluid medium. When its OD600 values reached 0.4, we divided the culture into seven test-tubes. Next, we added 0.2mM IPTG in each test-tube. Then, we added different concentrations of Trp solution, as shown in figure 1. Then we compared the color of the culture after re-incubation for 16 h. The result is shown in the picture. It is obvious that the higher concentration Trp we added, the darker the culture turned to be. Thus, we got a conclusion that tryptophan can catalyze Indigo synthesis within certain range. More Indigo can be produced with a higher concentration of tryptophan.
Figure 1. The result after adding different concentration of Trp.
Jilin_China for TJU_China
We went through the iGEM teams in recent years located in China and found that iGEM16_Jilin_China’s project was about Bifidobacterium longum, which we were to use in our project this year. So we turn to iGEM17_Jilin_China, wishing to be provided the strain, promoter HU and replication origin pMB1 gene that were used in B. longum but not in stock in Biobrick part registry. Fortunately, they were genuinely excited to help us. Samples made last year (one strain and two genes) are activated, renewed and mailed to us. In return, we sent Tianjin’s special local product,"

Integrated Human Practices.
One very simple way to ensure that your scientific work is applied in a responsible way, is to first find out how the public responds to your specific topic and analyze why they do so. With that knowledge in mind, one can then start designing his or her work in a way that, if it may change the world, it will be in a truly beneficial way. We went ahead and gathered information on the attitude of the European population towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and also on how it may be changed to a more positive one.
For example, Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Stroebe from the University of Groningen in Netherlands, held a speech on the public’s attitude towards GMOs. He referred us to the work of Dr. Joachim Scholderer.
The view of the European population on the use of GMOs is very ambivalent. There is distrust of information supplied by big companies and a distinct desire to preserve the natural state of the environment among them. This approach is very sensible but in some cases can stand in the way of a reasonable discourse on applications of GMOs. We believe that since most companies use GMOs to slim their processes and increase their market value, the European population just does not see any utility for themselves. Therefore, to make our project useful not only in the lab, but as well to the society and the environment, it has been a major goal to design our work to have a positive effect for every person.
D.I.V.E.R.T. is a method to incorporate random mutations into a target gene without mutating the rest of the genome. This way, very big libraries of all possible random mutations can be assembled in little time. These libraries can then be screened for improved properties to pick out the best mutant for specific applications. If selection pressure is applied to the cells while D.I.V.E.R.T. is active, evolution should be sped up significantly and beneficial mutations are accumulated tuning the gene to enhance the desired property.
To showcase the power of this application in a way the public"

Besides these Dutch iGEM meetings and the Discovery Festival, we also collaborated with Wageningen and Amsterdam on a molecular level. Many times our transformation of E.coli failed, so we ran out of the backbone biobricks for Bacillus subtilis. Luckily Wageningen and Amsterdam we’re so kind to provide us with their bricks. Thank you guys!
iGEM Uppsala
At the beginning of August we received the chromo proteins amilCP (blue), amilGFP (yellow) from iGEM Uppsala 2011 ( https://2011.igem.org/Team:Uppsala-Sweden ). We hope we can use BBa_K592009 and BBa_K592010 for the coloring system we want to use in B. subtilis.
iGEM Cambridge
Together with iGEM Cambridge we want to develop a sporulation and germination protocol for Bacillus subtilis. The whole idea of Bacillus spores that can be stored and used only at a desired time point is the same goal iGEM Groningen and iGEM Cambridge want to achieve, therefore a collaboration would be very advantageous.
iGEM LMU Munich
This iGEM team is also working on B. subtilis and therefore an ideal partner for testing each other’s constructs. They sent us 6 plasmids and 4 promoters and we are using them for testing. Hopefully we are able to return our constructs to them soon!

In this way Edible coli can also be a great supplement for vegans and vegetarians, as well as for pregnant women, children, and many others.  In addition, Edible coli is very environmentally friendly, as it can grow with cellulose as carbon  source. Cellulose is found in plant material and is not degradable by humans. Most people in the world  have access to cellulose, so with an Edible coli as help, can plant material be converted into protein and fat  rich food.
Our idea to ensure access to food around the world, was extended with the design of a biogenerator. The main idea was to create a constant food producing tank that can be scaled and used for several different purposes - it can, for instance, be placed in a village in Africa to support  the inhabitants with proteins and fats.
The biogenerator is formed as a tank containing Edible coli. The bacteria will grow and produce large amounts of proteins and fats that can be tapped directly from the tank. Of course will the bacteria be dead  as the tank includes an autoclave.
The tank is only expected to be started once after which, the food production will be  continuous as long as cellulose is added.
A detailed description of the biogenerator can be found in our Business plan. Click here.
Edible coli is a revolutionary, fantastic bacterium that can help solve worldwide problems with under- and malnourishment. With Edible coli and a biogenerator tank in every village, people will no longer suffer from  lack of proteins and fats.
Furthermore, as the bacteria grow very fast and it is a cheap resource Edible coli can also be thought of as  the food source of the future.

phusion PCR- mutagenesis protocol for precoelenterazine (PCZ)
rationale: patent filed by ward et al claimed that a 1bp mutation in WT GFP chromophore region results in PCZ formation, which then forms CZ (in E. coli). We decided to use EGFP because it is more sable and expresses better in mammalian cells.
Designed and ordered primers to introduce the mutation.
We have pRRL-CMV-EGFP-mODC as a template.
Designed 4 primers (2 pairs) to introduce the single bp mutation.
Ran a gel after PCR to make sure correct sized bands formed after mutagenesis.
Once we clone out PCZ, we can put that gene into pENTR/D-TOPO .
We now have pENTR/D-TOPO-PCZ-mODC. Next step is to add a promoter source.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Modeling#Model I_-_-_TEXT.html," the distance in which the two reactant molecules, here ampicillin and beta-lactamase, react. This is the case, when they are in very close proximity. D is the sum of the diffusion coefficients of the two reactants in the solution. In our case the solution is the periplasm. The term diffusion describes the movement of a substance in a solution; the bigger the diffusion coefficient, the larger the diffusion velocity.  The angle α restricts the reaction area of the enzyme to its active center (see opening in figure 4). So a reaction between beta-lactamase and ampicillin only takes place, when ampicillin meets the active center of beta-lactamase.
Finally, the equation for the diffusion rate kdiff must be multiplied with the Avogadro constant NA to gain the unit [(s*M)-1].
Rmin was computated under the assumption that beta-lactamase and ampicillin react when they are in close vicinity and that the molecules are nearly spherical. Therefore, the minimal radius of a sphere that could contain the given mass of protein was estimated using the formula from (Erickson 2009):
for V in nm3, M in Dalton and Rmin in nanometer.
For beta-lactamase we obtained 2.0277 nm and for ampicillin 0.4649 nm.
To compute the diffusion coefficients we used the program WinHydroPro v1.00 PUB  [Ortega, 2011]. We received 2.852*10-9 for beta-lactamase and 1.237*10-8 for ampicillin. The angle α was computed with the open-source program PyMOL (PyMOl 2013). α was determined to be 25°.  In the end we computed the reproduction rate in dependence of the ampicillin concentration in the periplasm, adapting the formula of Potsdam's:
where n is the ampicillin concentration in periplasm. The time point 20 minutes was chosen, because the division rate of an E. coli cell is around 20 minutes.
Experimental validation
A theoretically implemented model must always be validated with experimentally measured data. Therefore, we designed and conducted an amount of appropriate experiments. Firstly, we performed a beta-lactamase PCA colorimetric assay, and, secondly, a cultivation experiment. The cultivation experiment was used to measure the beta-lactamase concentration with the Nitrocefin assay over time. The experiments were essential to adapt model I.

Conclusion:
There is no significant difference in the pattern of normalized fluorescence values between using O.D. and particle count, as illustrated in Figure 4 and 5. The normalized fluorescence values of the devices are consistent with their respective promoter strengths, with device 1 (BBa_J23101) as the highest fluorescence value (i.e. 1791 a.u.) and device 3 (BBa_J23117) as the lowest fluorescence value (i.e. 162 a.u.). However, cell quantification by colony-forming units failed to reproduce the modeled cell concentration by silica beads. This may conclude that the two methods, CFU cell count and silica beads, may not be able to produce a consistent value of cell concentration.

We chose the production of
3HPA
as application to show the functionality of the Marburg Collection and as proof-of-principle for our metabolic engineering workflow.  However, our goal is not to produce high amounts of
3HPA
, but rather to show that V. natriegens can be used as test chassis for rapid testing of many pathway variations to find the best one. The next step would therefore be to evaluate, if the pathway with its genetic composition can be transmitted to other organisms to see if the route still works.   Besides that, there are many other compounds of medical and economical relevance, which still can’t be produced biotechnologically.   The production of the anticancer drug taxol involves for instance 19 enzymes and is therefore a very challenging pathway with lot of bottlenecks and tunable reactions ( (Croteau et. al. 2006) ).   We think it would be beneficial to use V. natriegens as chassis for testing this challenging pathway or parts of it.  Its short doubling time and genetic accessibility will accelerate the process of enzyme engineering and finetune expression levels or gene combinations.  Another crucial aspect, that has to be tackled is the universality of our workflow.   We involved biosensors for product screening but for many metabolites there are still no known sensor proteins.   There are three possibilities to circumvent this issue.   The first is to find new biosensors, what is complicated, because many compounds, especially drugs for medical purposes don’t occur in the nature, therefore it is unlikely that there are still proteins binding specifically to these compounds.   The second possibility would be to engineer proteins to become drug-specific sensors. The third possibility is to upscale
LC-MS
techniques to enable larger sets of measurements and faster screening.
LC-MS
has an unbeaten accuracy but its bottleneck is the velocity.   The average time needed for one sample lies between 1 and 10 minutes, making measurements of large sets of samples impossible.   Furthermore
LC-MS
requires high amounts of buffer. However, as mentioned in the Labautomation-section [soll"

Demux SIMULATION 2 - tetR, lacI, cI, GFP and RFP
Demux SIMULATION 2 - luxI, luxR, lasI and lasR
Comments: GFP steady state value (0.8709 arbitrary units) is comparable to GFP value in SIMULATION 1. This value is much lower that RFP steady state value (362.11 arbitrary units), confirming that the selected output channel has a significantly higher output value.
CONCLUSIONS
The reported simulations show the qualitative behavior of our two systems, predicted by our mathematical model in response to specific inputs. Results are compatible with systems' expected trends. Amplitude and time scales have no physical meaning because we considered dimensionless equations, but our goal was to study relative values at steady state, in order to check on simulated curves whether system on/off values could be distinguished or not.
Moreover, the mathematical model described so far is a good scaffold for future parameter identification, that will have to be performed in order to characterize our physical devices. To reach this goal, ad-hoc experiments will have to be performed on both final and intermediate devices to collect as many data as possible and an optimization algorithm will have to be used to compute parameter estimations, given the model and the acquired data.
Finally, sensitivity analysis can be performed to highlight the parameters that play the most critical role and to study the impact of their variability on systems behavior.

Collaboration
For this year’s collaboration we mentored the iGEM teams Rheda Bielefeld and Hamm-Lippstadt. It was a pleasure to introduce them to the iGEM competition, help them with general lab questions, and talk about their project and research area. We also collaborated with the iGEM team Duesseldorf  in analyzing the sequence of a BioBrick. Throughout our project we had worldwide collaborations and met numerous teams. It was a pleasure to interact with so many people from various cities and countries and to talk about their and our experiences during iGEM and their projects as well as their and our lives at a university.
Highschool Team Rheda Bielefeld
The high school team Rheda Bielefeld is the first Bielefeld High School team which takes part in iGEM. As a first step in the iGEM competition, members of our team supervised and supported the team while participating in the InterLab study. We invited the team into our laboratory for three days and supervised them in the execution of the experiments. Unfortunately, the first time conducting the InterLab study resulted in unsatisfying results. Due to wrong results, we repeated the InterLab study experiments and ensured that they have matching results, which can be integrated in the overall result of the world wide InterLab study. Besides supporting the team in the InterLab study, we organized a workshop, introducing them to the basics of CSS and HTML as a preparation for a successful wiki.

Pictures below display the results from the 5th and 6th cultures. The 5th and 6th samples were taken from BFS667 transformed with pgfp-rrnb. The 5th one does noo have any IPTG hence no GFP whereas the 6th one has lots of GFP with sporulation. Hence we can conlude that sporulation was triggered by our biobrick. :) We managed to get the results we expected. Congrulations to everyone in the team!

Data Analysis
World Heart Day takes place on 29 September every year which focuses on creating heart-healthy environments this year. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the world today: over 17.3 million people die from cardiovascular disease each year. According to REPORT ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES IN CHINA 2014, there are 290 million people suffering from cardiovascular disease in China and one in every five adults suffering from it. An estimated 3.5 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease, namely 9,590 death every day. People find out that 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is caused by coronary heart disease and its complications such as heart failure, valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease, which can also lead to sudden death. However, the current standard treatments like coronary artery bypass surgery, intervention and drug therapy can only delay the development of the disease but not cure it. These three treatments are also have some shortcomings such as the high risk of failure, limited treatment effect and a wide variety of side effects.
Facing the grim situation of cardiovascular disease, we wish to solve a particular problem of cardiovascular disease through the methods of synthetic biology. Before designing project, we read a lot of literature and statistical reports of cardiovascular disease. Then we read all iGEM projects in health and medicine track in the past five years and analyze the types of diseases and their treatments that were concerned in different regions each year. We analyze the following five topics from Health and Medicine track of interest to us: cardiovascular disease, cancer, detection or fighting against pathogens, drug carrier and obesity. It has played a very important role in our project designing that allows us to propose a specific project design idea by combining the design concept of synthetic biology and the current situation of the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The following is the analytical report of the projects of these five topics.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," to bind again. With help of chains and nodes, it is possible to model any complex with arbitrary architecture. Simple and inaccurate modeling of biological process could not keep pace with the development of synthetic biology and undoubtedly, our Chain-Node model provides a possible solution to the imbalance.
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
A simple example, tetR dimer, is shown to illustrate our simple modeling idea (做一个tetR2的模型放在右边做为配图，否则右边太空了). It has two chains with each containing only one part, tetR. Dimerization of tetR will create a node to indicate the bound state of two parts. To explain more clearly, bound parts are also considered as nodes so that in this example, all nodes are organized in a tree structure, which includes two children (leaf) nodes and one parent node. We will conform to this convention in our wiki.
To know more, users are suggested to read this One-Minute Introduction to have an intuitive idea and deeper understanding of our modeling system.
Modeling with Templates
Modeling manually of biological system is widely used for synthetic biology modeling but it requires an overall understanding of the biological network. It is difficult for even professionals to provide such large amount of data. The underlying reason making modeling so difficult is that the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur through different mechanisms. Based on this. we are always seeking feasible ways to implement our automatic modeling idea. The automatic does not mean modeling without any information provided, but however, there indeed exists a minimal data set to enable the automation.
Similar to C++ programming language, we introduce templates to allow generic description of species and reactions of a certain pattern. It is essential to implement our automatic modeling idea since
to share the same
Automatic modeling of biological system, Similar reactions happen for similar reasons. For example, the repression of pTetR promoter by TetR dimer can happen on many different DNA molecules with pTetR, regardless of what other biobricks is constructed on the DNA. With this thought, we add the part of Substituent , which can replace inactive parts of Species in Reactions , making it more general, and actually turning it into a reaction template. Having substituent, a pTetR TetR binding reaction is re-interpreted as the binding reaction of ANY DNA with pTetR(Figure 2) with ANY protein with TetR-dimer binding site. Modeling with templates allows us to describe reactions of new complex even without rewrite the reactions and"

This creates the potential for it to produce everything from the exterior of the habitat to the softer interior products such as furniture and clothes. And as long as you have a few dormant spores, you can continue to grow more materials by simply activating them with sufficient oxygen and nutrients.
Stanford Brown RISD's proposed Mars Habitat, made of mycelium that is grown within a light-weight mold. Rendering by team member Emilia Mann.
The versatility of mycelium as a material, and its self-growing abilities, paired with the fact it is completely biodegradable, means it has the potential to completely revolutionize the housing and manufacturing industries on earth. With a few modifications, our habitat design could be brought to earth to build eco-friendly houses that require minimal effort to assemble. We also took advantage of these properties in the creation of products beyond our habitat – creating furniture items and filters. These prototypes created in our lab, most notably our stool (see images below) demonstrate the potential for its use on and off planet, as an alternative, eco-friendly alternative to plastics and other soft goods. To see more about our research of the industrial potential of this material visit our human practices page with the section “Sustainable Industrial Design”.

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which serves for the information exhibition and exchange globally.     For instance, there are obvious misunderstandings about the words which     are predominantly used for regulation process. We have noticed that,     the terms “inhibitor” and “repressor” are being used as equivocally     in the part information pages. Like the lactose inhibitor protein, a     widely used DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, that have been labeled     both as “inhibitor” and “repressor” at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory elements. To sum up, we investigated all input elements for     promoters and classify these elements in terms of their function, affect     and required input element for them. So, we suggest that terminology     used for regulation of transcription should be defined clearly on iGEM’s     website and correct use of terminology should be enforced.
The second group of parameters was collected under the title “Output”,     which refers to products of functional genes. In contradiction, the     term “reporter” has also been described within the same list. Reporters     are also genes whose products, can be used for screening as an output.     According to our group, the usage of the term “reporter” for genes is     unnecessary and cause extra complexity for information distribution     and gives rise to discrepancies. Instead of using the term “reporter”,     predefined “gene” description should be used for genes, which can function     as reporters. The special information which is related with the characteristic     of that gene should also be presented on part info web page.
Furthermore, the same terminology “reporter” was used for both atomic     parts and composite bio-bricks. Also the overall image descriptions     for these were defined as “reporters”. We want to point out that using     same nomenclature for both atomic genes and for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both atomic     parts and for whole constructs is not a good practice. Instead, we are     suggesting the usage of other available terminology for the parts listed     as reporters, which most of the constructs, now known as reporters,     can be grouped into, such as “protein generators”, “composite parts”     or “inverters”.
Devices are whole constructs which are functional and have specific     and distinct functions. But, as we have observed"
Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia#other microalgae_-_-_TEXT.html,"bAI gen is a chloroplast's gen. The reasons    why we chose to transform chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas    reinhardtii are exposed in the next table:
Table 2: Comparison of nucleus manipulation against chloroplast manipulation
Strain selected:
With the intention of avoiding the use of    antibiotics at selection of transformed cells we decided to employ    the photosynthesis-deficient mutant strain ac-uc-221 (CC373) of C.    reinhardtiii.
The ac-uc-2-21 is a deletion mutation in the    chloroplast atpB gen, which results in a clean, non-reverting    acetate-requiring phenotype. This strain was originally obtained    from the culture collection of the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center    at Duke University, NC, USA
The use mutant strain CC373 enables the selection    of transformed cells employing vectors which carry the DNA of    interest between plastome homologous regions and atpB gen. The    atpB gen allows the restoration of a complete atpB gen copy. Then    transformed cells will be able to grow in a culture medium without    acetate and high light conditions while not transformed will not    do.
Vector selected:
To introduce our construction and complement the    deletion mutation ac-uc-2-21 we chose to use plasmid pCrc +157 (Inger    Lill Anthonisen, 2002). This plasmid has between its has    between inverted repeats homologous to plastome, regions XhoI and    XbaI restriction sites flanking 5' rbcL (el promotor), uidA gen    and 3' UTR from psaB (to stabilize transcripts).Apart it has atpB    gen.
This plasmid has between its two regions with    inverted repeat sequences homologous to plastome, targets for    restriction enzymes Xhol and Xbal. Between these targets there is    the uidA gen flanked by the rbcL 5' UTR and the psaB 3' UTR (this    last stabilizes the transcripts). Out of these sequences it has    the atpB gen.

To outreach the concept of what synthetic biology is, and the understanding of how people apply synthetic biology to improve lives, and the awareness of all these advances’ physicochemical, medical and socio-ethical implications.
Introduction
Our team, NTU-Taida, has been involved in outreaching synthetic biology and human practice so far. Be specific, we introduced bioengineering, biotech and iGEM competition to high school students, undergraduate medical students, and doctors. To spread the understanding of synthetic biology more efficiently, we established a blog sharing some news, reviews and our works. We also collaborated and discussed with other team in Taiwan and the US. Additionally, we surveyed the students’ and doctors’ interest in utilizing synthetic biology in medical routine and research. All these activities are summarized below:
Mini Symposiums with College and High School Students
During this summer, we shared our ideas and the iGEM competition to college and high school students who expressed interest in bioengineering and basic molecular biology.

Therefore, if the synthetic biology aspires to define itself as an engineering discipline, than is the aim of knowledge-making necessarily non-substantial [6].

Third meeting - Procedure
After asserting that the synthetic biology follows an ‘intentional epistemology’, we analysed the conceptual procedure of the synthetic biology. In view of the fact that the synthetic biology aims to create life, a consistent definition of the phenomena of life is needed, in order to have a reasonable goal ([7],[8]). Interestingly, the conception of life in the synthetic biology matches with the settled purposes [9]. The understanding of life is adjusted to the notion of things that humans can make, modify and comprehend. Thus, the synthetic biology approaches biological systems as technological systems ([10],[11]). In this context, the analogical transfer from technological properties into the realm of the living can be understood as the epistemological program from synthetic biology. Then this transfer promotes the aim of creating life, as it provides an understanding of life which makes it possible. In short: within the synthetic biology, we encounter living beings as if they were machines.

Ashlee videotaped Clay and Sam's presentation to the Science-U highschoolers.
Worked on presentation and put finishing touches on the slides. Prepared activities and set up room in 11 Life Sciences. The presentation went extremely well. We had a well behaved group of kids and it was nice to be able to see some of the faces that I (Sam) have been working with all summer. They really enjoyed it and we got free t-shirts for our time. I think we may have inspired a few people to become future scientists! Purification of yesterday's digestion product, ligation, transformation, plating.
Wednesday, July 30, 2014
Ashlee picked 2 colonies from the L6 plate for overnight growth to make cryogenic storage and to plasmid prepare. We are going to save the original L6 plasmid as long as possible because it was sequence confirmed. Emily digested the Lambda Red Recombinase system with XbaI and ClaI restriction enzymes.
No colonies observed again, so the transformation was redone using the initial ligated G4 (7/16) and the one that was prepared previously this week. Sequencing results from Monday confirm G2.3 and G3.3 as correct.
Thursday, July 31, 2014
Ashlee and Emily plasmid prepped one of the previously picked colonies.  This was then digested with XbaI and ClaI so the Lambda Red Recombinase system could be inserted.  The other picked colony was used to make cryogenic stock for potential use later.  A Rescue PCR was done on overlap region 3 and ran on a gel for purification. All 4 PCR reactions failed.
There were several colonies on the plate that were transformed with the old G4 ligation, but only 2 on the plate that had the new G4 ligation. Two (2) colonies from each plate were chosen and inoculated so that could be mini-prepped tomorrow. Cultures inoculated with streaks from G2.3 and G3.3 for preparing cryo stocks. Four cultures inoculated with G5.4 (from 7/18 plating) to"

What is iGEM?
International Genetically Engineered Machines ( iGEM ) is an international Synthetic Biology competition, organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where over hundred students from the greatest universities in the world compete.
iGEM is based on the simple concept of gene standardization, Biobricks . Thus, each gene becomes simple to use and simple to arrange in order to make the engineering of living matter systematic.
The main objectives are to promote the development of open-source tools for biological engineering and thus contribute to the development of a society that uses biotechnologies.
For us, iGEM is above all a tremendous professional and human experience. Students have to conceive a R&D project, organize and lead an interdisciplinary program, work as a team, communicate and promote our work internationally.
Back to top
Why are we participating?
iGEM is a Synthetic Biology competition, in which each team has to create an innovative project and develop it in a laboratory. This project is interdisciplinary, it demands rigor and organizational skills when working. This envelops all the key points of our curriculum:
- Innovation,
- Multidisciplinarity,
- Project management,
- Autonomy in our work,
- Scientific communication,
- And fun!
iGEM is also the opportunity to share our common interest with young scientists from around the world, meet our future partners and take part all together in the development of our discipline.

The ""DVS"" Project
Within the framework of the iGEM competition, we have chosen to develop a project focused on health. Today, even though therapeutic products are becoming more and more efficient, they are becoming equally more and more fragile.
With this in mind, we have decided to develop a process enabling the protection of biological active ingredients, mainly nucleotide types. This process exists already; it’s what we call a vector . It can be biological, such as viruses, or chemical, such as polymeric nanoparticles. Whatever the nature of the vector, they raise many problems: stability, targeting, membrane passing, and immune reactions.
This is why we have tried to"
INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"To test their algorithm they created a tool that iGEMers can use. The idea is to let people draw different mazes so they can test them.
Our mazes:
The robot is mainly going in circle and can’t find the exit when the way is too small. It’s easily trapped. It would have been interesting to have a bigger space designed for drawing.
Combination of two projects about cholera
Done with: Grenoble Team
We met the Grenoble Team to talk about our respective projects as they are both dealing with the cholera disease.
We designed a device using synthetic communication between 2 micro-organisms to detect and kill Vibrio cholerae in water. This device is user-friendly and can treat water before consumption thus avoiding cholera epidemic.
iGEM Grenoble designed a pathogen sensitive detector: SnapLab, a portable kit that will detect cholera. The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera. One of the biggest advantages of the project is the fact that it can provide an energy independent solution available for physicians and on-site helpers to provide a relevant diagnosis. On the other hand, this solution is ready to use, avoiding all the preparation steps required in a laboratory.
Both teams were really aware that the crisis management must be enhanced to reduce the lethal cases of a disease that shouldn’t kill anymore! Our solutions are complementary and can really help locals NGO. Indeed, we provided a really helpful solution to decontaminate infected waters (one of the biggest vehicles of transmission) beforehand, while iGEM Grenoble can detect and monitors the evolution of an outbreak by providing an easy way to diagnose that disease. Both projects are complementary as one act to avoid epidemic to start and the other one enables a precise detection of the bacteria.
We could imagine a whole device integrating both project: the Croc’n cholera project of the INSA-UPS_France team does not integrate any tangible detection that could be compensated by the SnapLab. On the other hand Croc’n cholera leads to Vibrio cholerae destruction while SnapLab remains a detection tool.
In the end, it appears that a combination of our projects can reduce the length of an outbreak because we propose to find the sources of spreading and on the other hands to facilitates the access of healthcare by providing a good diagnosis solution.
Survey
From: Greece team
We made a survey about the cholera disease to know if people are aware of this disease as it does not occur in Western Countries. We already had many answers in France and the Greece Team proposed"

NTNU_Trondheim,2015,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"0.025). This was found (by trial and error) to be a suitable density of cells for confocal microscopy.
Cell cultures were then put on ice and transported to the microscope.
For each biological replicate, 1.5 μl of the sample was put on a rectangular cover glass of thickness 1.5 (served as a suitable object glass for confocal microscopy). A small square-shaped cover glass of thickness 1.5 was put on top of the sample. To reduce bacteria moving and being pulled towards the edges of the cover glass, its edges were sealed with nail polish.
For each prepared microscopy sample (biological replicate), three images were obtained to serve as technical replicates. These three images should be taken at different xy positions in the prepared microscopy sample.
NOTE: The small volume of 1.5 μl ensures a short enough distance between the glasses (to work well with the z section size set by the pinhole size, see below), so that all bacteria between the glasses in a given xy(z) frame can be in focus and thus their fluorescence be detected by the microscope.
Acquisition of images by confocal microscopy
A Leica SP5 confocal microscope was used with the following parameters set in the LAS AF software: Argon laser (power 20 %) excitation line 488 nm (set to 6 %), hybrid detector (HyD, Leica) set to filter and detect emitted light between 495-600 nm, pinhole size 399.99 nm (with a corresponding z section thickness of 2.897 μm).
The objective used was HCX PL APO CS (63x magnification, water immersion, numerical aperture 1.2, XY resolution 163 and Z resolution 290 at 488 nm).
Look into the microscope to focus in on your bacteria (bright field).
For live view, set the format to 512 * 512 and speed to 400 Hz, and press ‘Live’.
Adjust the focus with the z-position wheel, and when a good view of the bacteria and their fluorescence has been found in live view, stop the live view to scan the image. The following parameters were set in the LAS AF software to acquire the images: bit-depth of 12 (found under the configuration tab), acquisition mode xyz, zoom 1.25, speed 100 Hz, format 2048 * 2048 (pixel size 96.15 nm * 96.15 nm, image size 196.83 μm * 196.83 μm), line average 3.

Our goal was to screen for peptide aptamers using a bacteria-based system. This system can be used to study protein-protein interactions. We used the bacterial two-hybrid system which is based on the reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase. In order to detect the rise in intracellular cAMP we used a Red Fluorescence Protein (RFP) reporter system with a cAMP-activated promoter, PcstA.

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

        (2)  Oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, abbreviation OAH, is the target gene segment of these experiments. The main function of OAH is to transfer oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid; thus the oxalate acid reacts with the calcium ion to form calcium oxalate that preserves the relics. The target gene segment is synthesised by IDT Inc. after found in gene pool.

This viewpoint strongly contrasted with the current Dutch legislature, which forbids the (possible) release of GMOs in the environment, and would therefore render the application of the ELECTRACE system impossible. The call was made that the current GMO policy needs to be reconsidered, possibly by providing the opportunity for case-by-case approval decisions.
The point was raised that the legislative discussion is largely technocratic, but that in order to reach acceptance of synbio in society, the discussion should be conducted at a societal, ethical and even emotional level. This currently goes wrong, since although the questions asked are on the societal, ethical level, the answers given by the scientists are largely technical. Various strategies to raise the acceptance of synbio were discussed.
One of the most interesting findings of the discussion was that, in order to reach more acceptance, (synbio) innovation should not be stand-alone, but incorporated in processes. When synbio innovations are used to solve important issues, this would increase the acceptance. In this context, it was mentioned that the synbio solution should clearly be better and cheaper than other (non-synbio) solutions. A demonstrable benefit for the end user is essential.
In order to reach aforementioned problem-based development of synthetic biology, it is necessary to bring together the people with the problem, investors, scientists and commercial parties to develop an application. The call for such a interdisciplinary platform was widely supported and one of the main conclusions, not only of our own discussion but also of meeting as a whole.
Another interesting topic raised was the way synbio should be communicated to the general public. When selling ELECTRACE, should you focus on the fact that it uses synthetic biology or on the application? In this context, a comparison was made to the introduction of nanotechnology. Possibly hazardous nanoparticles are an ingredient of suntan oil, but this is not stressed, and public concerns are not an issue. However, there is a thin line between “not stressing” and deliberately selling false information, and therefore this might not be the best approach.
Another approach would be to strive for total openness; this is the open-source development approach used by iGEM and the scientific community. Several drawbacks of this approach were discussed. Firstly, following the proverb “Let sleeping dogs lie”, stressing all the scientific details might provoke protests that otherwise wouldn’t happen. Next to that, and more importantly, open-source development might inhibit commercial development, since it does not fit well in the current business models.
In synthetic biology communication, framing was found to be a big issue. The term GMO was found to be so “contaminated” in"

The settings of the rotary evaporater: ~160 millibars, waterbath temperature of 25-30°C
Furthermore, there were measures to be taken to protect the solution from direct sunlight: blinds down, aluminum foil wrapped around the waterbath
Afterwards we transfered the Methanol solution into a separating funnel and added another 100ml of aqua dest..
By means of adding chloroform we created two phases. The lower (chloroform) phase with the solved Phycocyanobilin was separated and put into another rotary evaporater flask. This step was repeated three times in order to get all the Phycocanobilin into the next step
Then the chloroform was completely removed in the rotary evaporater (same settings as before), the pure (?) Phycocyanobilin in the flask was solved in 60 ml DMSO, transfered into a new flask and frozen at -20 °C.
Picking of transformated (pGADT7 and pGBKT7) E.coli cells on antibiotic selection plates
Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: pGADT7 and pGBKT7 are plasmids containing the transcriptional activation domain or the DNA binding domain of the transcription activator Gal4. pGADT7 contains the transcriptional activation domain of gal4; we want to clone the the first 100 residues of Pif3 (BBa_K365000) into this plasmid. As a result we have a fusion contruct of Gal4 and Pif3, which is nescassary for the light-switchable promoter system. pGBKT7 is for backup, if the ordered biobricks are not working.
Operational sequence:
A E. coli colony was picked for each plasmid and was transferred in a tube containing 4 ml of LB-medium containing antibiotics (Amp for pGADT7 and Kan for pGBKT7).

NEU-China,2017,Team:NEU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"For us:
Teammates of NKU_China helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor Rho-OR1D2.
Abstract
During the competition, we realize that proper collaborations with the above team is                                         necessary, which make our project progress more smoothly. In addition, frequent communication                                         allows us to know about the progress of other teams to determine whether we need                                         to speed up the pace of the experiment. But we found that the Chinese teams rarely                                         establish a cooperative relationship with the igem teams in other countries, which                                         may be due to geographical relations. However, we still believe that cooperation                                         with foreign teams is necessary for we can understand each other's experimental techniques                                         to improve our own projects. In any case, we are very grateful to the above team                                         for our help and we hope that our friendship can last forever.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"cover Team, 2014). These algae were a product of synthetic biology. Palm kernel oil is considered to be an important cause of deforestation of tropical rain forests (Strom 2014) and therefore Ecover was looking for more sustainable alternatives.
However, Ecover received a lot of criticism from the Environmental Testing & Consulting (ETC) Group and Friend of the Earth (Rerimassie & Stemerding, 2014). The basis of the criticism was the fact that “synthetic biology” was perceived as “not natural”. As a result, on the 27th of June 2014, Ecover announced that they want to have a science-based discussion, to establish how to responsibly use biotechnology.
As the above example describes, discoveries within the field of synthetic biology can raise complex issue points when discussed with societal stakeholders. Considering their ethical concerns early on can smoothen the road of research and development.
The Ecover example showed that people might perceive synthetic biology tools as unnatural. It is true that one of the goals of synthetic biology is to engineer new organisms with functions that are not found in nature. This is a difficult issue to tackle, but we think that the choice of words and way of phrasing used to describe a certain process is decisive for public acceptance and in the end failure or success (described as well by iGEM Gent team 2013). For example, when Ecover described their solution as “sustainable”, they were criticised by opponents that did not associate this term with synthetic biology.
In the case of iGEM, for every team’s project introducing a new problem-solving technology, there may exist several yet unknown, potentially harmful consequences. Although synthetic biology is based on rational approaches, the new developed strains might have negative effects on the environment or human beings (Rerismassie, Stemerding, 2014). This however is a characteristic of progress, independent of the field of research and discovery, for example nuclear energy. For this reason, risk assessment is an important part of innovation, also in synthetic biology. In biotechnology, these types of concerns are related to the biosafety issue. A specifically sensitive issue relates to releasing engineered microorganisms in the natural environment. As an example, we can take the “oil eating” bacteria proposed by team TU Delft 2010. To mitigate the issue, synthetic biology comes up with the idea of a kill-switch, to reduce the risk of unwanted side effects on the environment. The iGEM team of Paris Bettencourt took up a similar idea, and Wageningen 2014 incorporated"

This was in preparation for the Clotho tutorial I am going to give to the wet team at 1pm.
In the morning we had a group meeting the main issues I wanted to raise were:
The help files are still in bad shape. They need to be cleaned up more. I asked everyone to continue cleaning up their help files. If they think they are done, ask me individually.
I talked about the wiki entries. Various levels of detail and quantity of material. In general they are good. Keep up the good work. Wiki entries remain a weekly requirement.
In the afternoon we have a dry run of the plug-in tutorial at 5pm. We are going to run through what Richard put together.
Please continue to give me feedback on bugs in new version (Thien found a bug during the meeting with images in help).
The other major thing going on today are that I have to pick up Lesia. I asked the team to please make sure to help her with:
Learning how to edit and use the wiki
Set up netbeans, CVS, and check out and run the code
Make sure she knows about the google calendar and email
Richard can introduce himself and teach her a little about plugIns
Make sure she knows how to get to the key card office and where Jontae sits
The individual presentations are going to take place next week. Here are the assignements:

We split up into two groups to transform bacteria with the ligation reaction from yesterday. One group was using electroporation and the other chemical transformation. We incubated the bacteria overnight.
For the afternoon we split up into different groups preparing us for the individual roles that we will take in the team.
DIYbio
We discussed about the principles of DIY biology and the barriers preventing people from participating in biology. We were inroduced to the concept of the microcontroller Arduino.
Software and Automation
We talked to Synthace founding member Rob Stanley. Automating lab work cannot start early enough! We later talked to computational biologists about software methods for modelling biological systems.

Wednesday 17th
This morning we discovered that the RFP insert did not really fluoresce. At least not in red. We picked colonies to grow overnight in order to check whether something went wrong in the ligation or if the biobrick was not working. This could be done on Thursday through an agarose gel of the recombinant DNA.
In the afternoon we went back into our groups from yesterday.
DIYbio
We headed for the Biohackspace in Hackney and started doing manual. We 3D printed the parts and soldered everything together to make a spectrophotometer. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work. But being in the Hackspace was definitely worthwhile.

Towards the beginning of the evening we drove towards the fantastic sand dune of Pilat, Europe’s biggest sand dune. After an exhausting climb we celebrated by drinking a well-deserved beer and watching the sunset.
Tuesday was the last day of our stay in Bordeaux. After a short tour through the city, the team had a crepe lunch and said their goodbyes. David drove the team to the Bordeaux airport for what would be a hectic journey back to the Netherlands.
In conclusion:
- The Bordeaux team had a clear outline for the extraction and quantification of their target molecule from the cell mixture.
- The Bordeaux team learned the theoretical basis behind HPLC and how to troubleshoot a bad separation.
-  The Groningen team gained insight into the ethics of GMO use and what tools can be used to investigate that.
-  Both teams gained a list of experts who could be consulted for issues regarding ethical use of biomass, GMO-related ethics, and chemical processing of cellulose.

SDU-Denmark,2015,Team:SDU-Denmark#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". Therefore we decided to perform the experiments with another brick, which also contained PcstA; BBa_K1135002. In this brick PcstA will initiate transcription of the gene encoding GFP.
Figure 2: Transcriptional activity of PcstA during growth measured by RNA levels.
Generally during the exponential phase of the bacteria, they have a high level of transcriptional activity. However, levels of 5S rRNA are relatively constant at all times. The transcription of gfp increases as the cells enter exponential phase between the two OD600 measurements 0.1 and 0.3. As expected, very low levels of gfp can be detected in the negative control. This strain lacks the ability to generate cAMP, and thus very little transcription is induced. The small amounts of gfp could be explained by leakiness of PcstA or that CAP alone initiates some transcription.
In the setup with WT, LB it is quite clear that the amount of gfp rises, compared to WT, LB+0.2% glucose. Transcription is clearly affected by the presence of glucose. One measurement WT, LB OD600 = 0.8 stands out. The result is not readily explained, but is probably due to some error. But the tendency of the results correlates with the knowledge of the invert relationship between glucose and cAMP. Glucose signaling will repress adenylate cyclase-activity, thus intracellular levels of cAMP will be low in high-energy states, and little transcription of gfp will be initiated.
Figure 3: Northern blot of gfp-mRNA induced by cAMP
We also tried to measure RNA levels induced by cAMP. This experiment was performed in two adenylate cyclase deficient strains; MG1655ΔcyaA and BTH101. In this setup, 1 mM cAMP was added to the medium of exponential cells and samples were subsequently collected at specific times. However, levels of RNA did not seem to be affected by cAMP. But this is probably not due to insensitivity of PcstA to cAMP. The most reasonable explanation is that cAMP failed to activate transcription of gfp, because the molecule were unable pass the cell membrane. However, RNA levels were at best slightly increased after approximately 8 minutes (see figure 3). To study the direct effect of cAMP on the promotor, one must use a different approach.

Due to the lack of laboratory equipment, the affiliated primary school of South China Agricultural University did not even have the opportunity to conduct a very simple experiment. With this in mind, we have prepared interesting experiments such as ""The Changing Color of Anthocyanin with the Change of PH"". We also take this opportunity to give pupils a biological science in order to develop their interest in synthetic biology.
Basic Experimental Training Courses
Guangdong Country Garden School is the first IBC international school in China, and the school encourage sthents to participate international competition such as iGEM.Last year ,some studennt in it took part in the 2017 Guangdong iGEM High School United and achieve sucess.This year our team communicate closely with the class majored in economic and biology.We introduce the theoretical knowledge about synthetic biology to them, and help them to conduct the simple basic molecular manipulation.We wish to stimulate their interest in Synthetic biology and instill new life for the next iGEM competition.And after this,they aslo do the public education and investigation according what they have learned from this activity to give the public a deeper impression on transgene.
This course includes:
1.Explain basic synthetic biology concepts
2.Teaching basic molecular experiment skills
·Explain the principle of experiment
·Experimental operation guidance and practice
·Extracting red fluorescent protein particles
·Prepare agarose gel & verify
·Hot hit conversion
·Flat line

Bielefeld-Germany,2010,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," mutagenesis by error-prone PCR (EP-PCR)
In order to detect novel substances (e.g. capsaicin) with the VirA receptor, the first step was to create a mutagenised library of virA variants, which could subsequently be screened for new binding characteristics. Plenty of different strategies for mutagenesis of DNA are known, including the use of nucleotide analogues, bacteria containing mutator genes, the mutagenesis with UV light or chemicals and inaccurate PCR ( Cadwell RC and Joyce GF, 1992 ).
When designing our strategy we rejected the use of bacteria strains with high mutation rates, since the changes in base sequence would occur all over the transformed plasmids. Thereby some mutations would also take place in the backbone of the plasmid, or might even been found in the standardized BioBrick prefix and suffix. We also excluded the possibility of using UV light or mutagenic chemicals, due to reasons of safety and minimizing the exposure of toxic substances.
In our experiment we wanted to alter only the part of the plasmid coding for the VirA receptor, while using a not harmful and thereby safe technique. Thus, our method of choice was inaccurate PCR that allows the exclusive variations of a distinct region of a plasmid, which is defined by the location of the upstream and downstream primers. This mutagenic method of PCR, called error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) has been described and improved a lot in scientific community ( McCullum EO et al., 2010 ).
The basic principle of this technique uses the natural high infidelity of the taq DNA polymerase, which can even be increased by special changes in buffer conditions compared to standard PCR. These alterations may include the unequal distribution of dNTPs (5 mM purines, 25 mM pyrimidines) as well as an increased amount of MgCl2 and the addition of MnCl2. The total rate of base exchange can be adjusted by the number of PCR cycles, since mutations will accumulate during the exponential amplification of the sequence ( Wilson DS and Keefe AD, 2000 ). The experimental conditions of the performed error-prone PCR are described in the section “protocols”.
Directed mutagenesis
After the identification of the 100 amino acids linker region responsible for VirA ligand binding ( Compare VirA-Receptor ) we compared this region with well characterized capsaicin receptors derived from animal model organisms (TRPV1). The conserved receptor region is shown in the figure beneath.
The species-specific sensitivity of TRPV1 can be ascribed to"

The most important part of the class, however, was to encourage excitement and new ideas about synthetic biology in as many different people as possible not necessarily associated with biology or engineering.
We posted materials to the official stellar site , but our daily plan and protocols were organized on our openwetware page .
The Class
In an effort to introduce our fellow Bostonians to the world of synthetic biology, we wrote the curriculum and taught a two-week class for any person from any background with interest in getting their feet wet in basic synthetic biology. Thanks to generous donations from EMD-Millipore and New England Biolabs and support from the Chemical Engineering, Biological Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments at MIT, we were able to budget twelve students to each have their own mini synthetic biology projects. The Knight Lab at MIT was kind enough to let us use their labspace. We had a number of applications for the class, and accepted a wide array of students including freshmen exploring different majors, architecture students, and Ph.D candidates from Boston University.
Our lectures and discussion sessions were open to anyone who wanted to join, even if we could only finance 12 students in the lab. Because the class was for people of all experience levels, our first lecture started as an explanation of the most important biological mechanisms. Building on the basics, the second lecture introduced synthetic biology both within the context of iGEM and as it is understood in some of the most significant synbio laboratories. The third lecture explained, at a high level, intricate circuits and systems in many chassis developed in labs at MIT and Caltech, and the greater applications of such research. We brought in guest lecturers, such as Prof. Douglas Densmore of Boston University, to talk about their work in different approaches to synbio, and had students read and explain important scientific papers to practice finding and comprehending the significant conclusions in dense academic papers.
When we felt like the basics of synthetic biology had been covered, we were keen to explore its public perception as well as the possibilities of its future. In the last week of the class, the lectures were replaced with involved discussion groups on topics from the ethics of synthetic biology to its public image to the problem of intellectual property. We challenged the students to choose one intriguing paper in synthetic biology, present it, and then craft their own experiments to extend the research in a new and exciting way.
The class as a whole was a rewarding experience for us. Not only did we reach out to people far"

Some argue that the open-source system of synthetic biology and the Parts Registry is problematic, especially with the increasing number of patents of genetic sequences? Do patents impede scientific exploration in this field, and are their benefits/problems with either system?
PROOF OF CONCEPT
As a proof of concept, our team arranged a miniature conference of our own, to examine how this could be done with regards to an ethics exploration. This year, we discussed some of the issues based on an article by Michael Specter (“A Life of Its Own”, published in the New Yorker) in Second Life.  After the reading, the team went into SL to talk about some of these issues, in order to provide a short trial of how conferences may be run. For future iGEM teams, we can invite guest speakers, who have either expertise in the field of synthetic biology or are somehow involved in the iGEM competition, and discuss with them some of the ethical issues mentioned above in the list. As well, other individuals can freely attend such conferences and participate.
Our first Second Life Ethics Conference involved members of our team, and can be viewed here in 4 parts. It was held in the form of an informal discussion, but we recognize that there are different formats that can be utilized, depending on number of participants and presence of guest speakers.

Prof. He was surprised by our visit. He said it was commendable for us to consult biosafety problems. Half an hour of happy communications, Prof. He patiently answered our confusion, and gives a lot of new aspects to think about the perspective of bioethics.
Prof. He emphasized the signification of biosafety awareness, and the real biosafety is supposed to be reflected in each step of the operation. As a development team for biology software, it is our responsibility to remind the users to follow safe and reliable design principles and to warn the users of dangerous operations. This proposal from Prof. He gave new inspiration to us.
Inspirations on our project
After the consult to Prof. He, we realized that we have more responsibilities of biosafety warning and guiding. What’s more, it would be better if we establish a way of communication with users. We’ll finish this goal by improving our interactive interface with users.
Figure 5: Group photo with Prof. He Zhumei.Thanks for giving advice on biosafety.
Consulting Microsoft staff about Information security
Motivation
We developed a software this year. The software may collect users’ information of interests, account, and activity on the website, and use the information for further functions. It’s our responsibility to protect user privacy. So we need to learn and follow relevant policies.
Practices
We consulted Mr. Li Yuzheng for related software policies and practices. Mr. Li majors in software, and has worked in Microsoft Research Asia. He told us that it is necessary to write a software statement, and show the statement to users when they first use our software. Only when users agree to provide their private information can our software collect and use it.
Figure 6: Photo of Mr. Li Yuzheng. Thanks for giving advice on software statements.
Inspirations on our project
According to Mr. Li's advice, we checked our software again, made sure that we never collect users' private information without agreements, and wrote a software statement with the help of legal professionals. See statements .
Consultation on intellectual property issues
Motivation
In our project, we hoped to collect and show some excellent iGEM projects posted on igem.org and research papers published in academic journals, in order to enrich our integrated database and offer better resources to users. Although we’re non-profit all the time, we are still supposed to consider intellectual property issues.

In our About Our Lab , About Our Project , and the Final Safety Form we described how we handle chemicals, microorganism and waste in our laboratory, and how we think our organism and bioreactor will be used by other people.
During the competition period we have collaborated and discussed about safety issues with many iGEM teams, but also with people from community labs and the industry.
Risks of our Biological Project
Our project falls into the category of metabolic engineering and our genetically modified cells are not intended for any use outside of an industrial facility. On the other hand, handling genetically modified organisms and methanol in a production facility does require several safety measures.
Not only did we discuss biosafety throughout our project, but we were also very aware of working responsibly and safely with methanol in our growth experiments. Learn more about it on our safety form .
Risks and Chances for Methanol in the Industry
Methanol is an important part of the chemical industry as it is used for plastics, paints, glues, and pharmaceuticals. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel, as gasoline blends, and in fuel cells. But methanol belongs to “Flammable Liquids” Class 3.2 (Primary Class) and “Toxic Substances” Class 6.1 (Secondary Class) [1] so it is quite dangerous to handle. Problematic situations especially occur when methanol gets out of a continuous, closed system or when it gets transported to a different facility.
Consequently, there is the need to advance the methanol generating industry with a low proximity conversion system. This system will convert the methanol into a universal, complex, easy to handle and safe carbon source which is suited to be the starting point for a huge variety of industrial processes. As a result, the safety risks of using methanol are decreased remarkably while maintaining the high energy capacity of methanol.

Use of Modern Devices in the Lab
Even though biological laboratories in Germany are tightly regulated, biosafety is still a major concern to the public.
One question that we wanted to answer was: Are touchscreens a good idea in the lab?
tubefront is designed to be used with modern devices such as phones and tablets. But what about contamination risk when people use touchscreens in the lab? And how does it compare to computers with a mechanical keyboard?
To find out, we did a simple experiment: Sampling of microbes from keyboards and other surfaces in the lab.

In this way we hope to evoke their passion to biological science, passing on knowledge and enthusiasm to them, which might encourage them to work hard and try to make innonations in this field in the future.
It seemed that they were very interested in our project and synthetic biology. Some of them asked questions about our project about the details and others communicated a lot with our team members after the lecture. We were glad to share our ideas and experiences with them. We wish they could improve their knowledge and ability during their courses and maybe next year, they will take part in the iGEM competition for themselves.

More importantly, these workspaces and this filesystem was implemented such that it will be expanded for cloud services in the future.

After the user has designed the microfluidic chip, they can then move on to select hardware components to match their needs. They would need to first input the volume of liquid they would like to dispense, and the precision they require. Neptune would then search through its database of servos and syringes to recommend hardware combinations to the user based on complex calculations involving torque, the range of pulse-width modulations, the bandwidth-delay product, and so on. Consequently, users are provided with a large personalized list of items that they can choose from. The user can then map the hardware to the dispensers on the chip that they just designed. The mapping allows Neptune to calibrate the dispensers for the experiment. The user is then provided with an ordering list consisting of all the parts that they need for the experiment. The ordering list would include the new hardware that the user has just selected, some predetermined items such as a roll of 3D printing support, and also some variable items like the number of 6-32 screws for instance. These would be calculated using the user's choices and the chip at hand.
To ease the usage and to help the user put all the pieces together, Neptune's Assembly Page takes the user through a step by step process where they can make and connect all the pieces required to control the microfluidic device. Currently, the users can download all the file required to 3D print the infrastructure of the hardware we suggest to them in the Build page. However, moving forward, both the Build and Assembly page would allow for the user to input their own servo and syringe combination into Neptune. The ability for the user to create custom 3D printing files are currently in development. Aside from that, the Assembly page includes descriptions on how to create the infrastructure, mill out the microfluidic chip, connect the Arduino to the hardware, and set up the system for control.

Sequencing results came in and showed a positive result: everything was built in for the CT33 construct.
July - Summer of Troubleshooting
We decided to take some different approaches to the Gibson Assembly of 14-3-3 like freeze drying and resuspension into reduced volumes to obtain high gblock concentration.  We decided to take another approach for the 14-3-3 construct: add a dimer with a GFP to a vector with a dimer already present in the lab via double digestion and ligation. The CT33 construct showed some trouble during the purification. The CT52 gBlock could not be delivered, so we decided to exchange CT33 present in a vector with CT52 via double digestion and ligation. For the expression of CT33, we started to optimise the arabinose concentration.
