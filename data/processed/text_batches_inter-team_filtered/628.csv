UC_Berkeley_Tools,2008,Team:UC Berkeley Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". Once this process has been done Clotho can now work on data in a unified framework by which developers and users can speak the same language about design. The Clotho Data Structure is shown as (#6) in Figure 6 . A more specific view is shown in Figure 7 .
To begin, the Clotho data structure has both Objects and Fields. It has a finite set of objects defined currently in a manner very similar to PoBoL . These objects include:
BioBricks
DNAs
Samples
Plates
People
Formats
Families
Each object has a number of fields that can be assigned to it. An example of some of these fields include:
Nickname
Short Description
Long Description
Author
Sequence
The number and types of fields associated with the object depend on the object itself. The data structure is modular so that the number and types of objects can increase or decrease as well as the field number and type. Fields are also designated as data or references. Data fields are information about the object while reference fields are pointers to other objects.
The Clotho Data Structure becomes functional when real world data is assigned to the Clotho Data Structure. This is a syntactic binding process where database tables are assigned to Clotho Data Objects and their fields are assigned to Clotho Data fields. It is in this way that potentially un-organized data becomes organized.
Bindings are kept in a binding file and have the following structure:
<Database table>;<Database field>;<Pobol Object>;<Pobol Field>;<Data or RefKey><Ref Table> Examples: Samples;Plate_id;Samples;Plate (ref key);RefKey;Plates BioBricks;Nickname;BioBrick;Nickname;Data
When Clotho wants to perform operations on data, it no longer has to understand anything about the original data source and only rely on its standard data model. This is true also of plug-ins to Clotho. Plug-in developers need not learn about the structure of any external data sources but only develop algorithms and tools which speak to Clotho. Clotho has leveraged a PoBoL like organization to make it as accessible as possible to a larger community.
For more detailed insight into the semantics of the Clotho Data Structure you can check out the java doc here .

Jamboré
Figure 1: Jamboré attendees
On July 18th, three Brazilian teams that would attend Giant Jamboree for iGEM 2015 assembled at Universidade de Sao Paulo, Campus São Carlos. The event was organized by Brazil-USP team, and was played by stream. The teams Brasil-USP ,     UFSCar-Brasil and UFMG-Brazil presented their projects. Besides our Bug-Shoo project, team Brasil-USP presented RubberBye, where E. coli bacteria is modified to degrade rubber. Team UFMG-Brazil presented LeishMANIA,     which proposes engineering the protozoan Leishmania to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Common problems for all teams such as difficulties in obtaining sponsorship and bureaucratic issues that hampered the importation of biological material have been discussed     (Wiki link).
Figure 2: Brasil-USP Team
Figure 3: UFSCar-Brasil Team
Figure 4: Ana Sifuentes, from iGEM Foundation
The meeting also was attended by a representative of the iGEM Foundation, Ana Sifuentes. She addressed aspects of the competition, related problems commonly faced by Latin American teams (lack of sponsorship and bureaucratic issues, mostly) and clarified our doubts on these subjects. There was also a brief presentation on the importance of mathematical modeling.
Figure 5: Round table discussion members: Dr. Paulo Lacava, Ana Sifuentes and Dr. Francis Nunes
Finally, there was a round table discussion on Synthetic Biology challenges, biosafety and biosecurity issues. During discussion, Dr. Paulo Lacava and Dr. Francis Nunes, both UFSCar Professors, and Ana Sifuentes from iGEM Foundation, shared their expertise   and interacted with audience.
Jamboré was an important moment to discuss our project and submit it to critical review."

Overview
As a tutor game aimed at improving the understanding and facilitating IGEM and synthesis biology, iGAME itself is exactly a great way of human practice. With iGAME, people do not feel any distance to synthesis biology any more. Actually, it is time for everyone to join this trend to be as cool as Sheldon’s new biologist girlfriend.
However, we do not stop here. We paid great effort to the safety issue and we have been dedicated to improving the knowledge of synthesis biology from classes and tried to share the part we contribute to the worldwide. We innovatively plot a new way of spreading the spirits of IGEM by starting our own community and we will never stop sharing and communicating.

Our work
Our team has a strong belief that the best science is performed by working in groups. In this manner, collaboration between groups is highly attractive to us. Given some circumstances this is difficult for us to perform. We identified that the lateness of wiki updates was a significant problem and did not make collaborating easier. While the wikis are very open, we felt more could be done to improve communication and sharing between teams.
The Macquarie team wanted to be involved in collaborations. Our geographical location makes this difficult. We still wanted to work with and contribute to the community. To meet this goal we wanted to survey the community. We wanted to see if other groups want to work together and what their view on the iGEM experience was.
Our survey consisted of only nine questions and was mainly interested in the individual's perspective of collaboration.
We would like the thank the following teams for being involved in our survey, if you would like to participate then click here . Our initial results will be presented at the Asian Regional Jamboree.
General Comments
We would like to express our gratitude to all teams that participated in the survey. The Europeans were most actively involved and far exceeded the responses from the largest region, Asia. This may have been a result of the impending wiki freeze. The survey received 123 responses with all regions participating. The overall feedback we received was positive and we look forward to trying to implement some of the ideas proposed by the other teams.
Wiki Updating
In our experience we had found significant trouble in learning what other teams were doing. We believed this is due to teams spending a considerable amount of time in the lab, as well as the potential that they are working on the site offline and then pasting all the data as the freeze approaches.
The number of surveys filled out by teams from the Asia region was lower than expected considering it is the largest region. The surveys also contained contradictory information. Some members from the same team stated that the"

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#topsecretIPpage_-_-_TEXT.html," Donation to the public domain was a popular option, indicating that many students support the BioBrick agreement and are keen to contribute their parts to it.
Responses to this question support the need for guidance for iGEM teams on IP issues. Possible explanations for this the larger than expected (29%) group selecting 'adequate' include: evidence of a Drunning-Kruger effect whereby people overestimate their level of knowledge; underestimating the significance and relevance of intellectual property law to synthetic biology; or a genuinely adequate understanding amongst students.
The graph below shows that profit is the least important considerations to students, but all others ranked more or less equally overall. The most important factor overall was benefit to society.
+ -
In the process of putting together our report and our guidance for iGEM teams, our team, in collaboration with the event organisers Philipp and Bethan of UCL iGEM, ran an intellectual property workshop at the Young Synthetic Biologists Conference 2.0 for other iGEMmers interested in the issue. The event was a great success; teams attending said 'I hadn't really appreciated just how big an impact this area of law could have on scientific development and particularly on synthetic biology - it's given me a lot to think about!'. We had a great time and there were some really interesting and insightful debates and comments - thanks especially to iGEM Cambridge for their passion on this topic!
Another team member stated, 'I don't think our team had really put much thought into the IP ownership of our project - it's definitely something we should consider though, as we would want to be able to stop anyone using our project for potentially harmful research'. 'I always thought IP was kind of a binary question - you either patent something, or you give it away.  But there are so many options in between. It's a very nuanced area of law, I think that's the main thing I hadn't really appreciated, there are lots of different ways you can share or protect your ideas'.

Government Policy
Legislators have the difficult task of balancing a number of diverse and often conflicting intellectual property consideration. On the one hand, the government must incentivize innotvation - IP is an essential means of achieving this, as demonstrated by studies showing how patents can positively influence innovation by a margin of 15-25%2 .
The flipside of this is the responsibility of the government to prevent the creation of monopoly and to ensure that ideas are shared so as to maximize productive research. Again,"

Education & Public Engagement
A.  Education
    Based on our idea “Science for all”, we vigorously engaged ourselves into education and science advocating activities. All events have served for our final goal in long run: creating a science culture for all generations in our community in the future.
On June 22th The first station: Tian-E-Hu kindergarten
I. Science speech
    In this section, we introduced probiotics to children, and talked to them about the relationship between probiotics and our daily food, including yogurt, pickle and others. We also explained how probiotics work in our intestines. They showed great curiosity and asked us lots of questions about probiotics. We answered them patiently in an understanding way.
 
II. Drawing bacteria
     In this section, we asked the children to image how bacteria look like and draw them down. What they have drawn showed their rich imagination and understanding about our introduction.
     In summary, what we have done in Tian-E-Hu kindergarten enabled these children to understand the probiotics, and inspired their interest in science.
 
On July 8th The second station: the youth palace
     This section was meant for adults and teenagers. We made some display boards, which articulate and connect fundamental ideas in genetics, synthetic biology and iGEM without technical vocabulary and dense detail. Parents whose children was engaged with our other activities can come and listen. We got great feedback from them. They asked many questions and learned a lot in this section. This is also a mutual understanding between our project and its potential consumers.
 
B.  Communication with related Companies
    Eager to know market demands and trading policies, as well as solving problems encountered during the experiments, we went to visit several biopharmaceutical companies. In the process of communication with the company's R&D personnel, we first introduced our project and raised our questions, and then they provided us with some suggestions. In short, by communicating with corporates, we have gained a lot and what we learned played an important guiding role in the follow-up experiments.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2017,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," goal than ever before. Mars, our interstellar neighbor, a planet with the same heat-range as that of Earth, has become the prime target for human expansion in the cosmos. However, before we can even think to achieve this vision, there are a number of considerations that must be accounted for. Of those include a problem that must be solved, and is essential in order to allow for life to thrive on the Red Planet - perchlorate contamination on Martian soil.
In 2008, NASA’s Phoenix lander identified traces of perchlorate salts in Martian soil, ranging from concentrations of 0.5% to 1%. What does this mean? Well, perchlorate is a highly toxic substance that, at high concentrations, imposes negative health effects.
Perchlorate Health Effects and Locations
The main exposure pathway of perchlorate for humans is through the ingestion of contaminated drinking water sources. After ingestion of high doses of perchlorate, perchlorate ions inhibits the thyroid gland’s uptake of iodine which disrupts the functions of the thyroid gland (Srinivasan and Viraraghavan 1426). Consequently, this leads to a decreased production of thyroid hormones, this is recognized as hypothyroidism. As the thyroid plays an important role in metabolism and growth, both neurologically and physically, disruption of its function can lead to adverse health effects for a human being in all stages of growth. For fetuses and infants, thyroid hormones are essential for the development of the central nervous system (Patel et al. 1). In children and adults, thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.
Ultimately, perchlorate is a chemical that must be addressed before considering to colonize Mars. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh confirmed that certain conditions of mars, especially in the presence of perchlorate, which enhances the bactericidal effects of UV lights, makes it nearly impossible for microorganisms to survive on the surface of Mars (Wadsworth and Cockell 1). Utilizing engineered E-coli. in a regulated bioreactor system is our proposed method of remediating martian soil for perchlorate. We believe that developing a system to remediate the toxic martian soil brings us a step closer to developing an environment on Mars that is comparable to earth, ensuring that mars can eventually sustain life.
Research into biological methods to remove and remediate perchlorate contaminants here on earth may prove equally as useful. On earth, perchlorate is a chemical substance that is found both naturally and in manufactured products. Generally, perchlorate contamination is a"

Dale-Chall formula: $0.1579*(\frac{difficult\;words}{words})*100+0.0496*(\frac{words}{sentences})$
The Dale-Chall formula includes a collection of non-difficult words. We used the updated word collection to calculate                 the readability, using an online calculator [2-3]. The score of the index can be converted to grade level                 (Table 1). Familiar jargon, i.e. SMORE, iGEM, DNA and other repeating names, are excluded, given they have                 been thoroughly introduced. A simple word in the collection is used to replace them in calculation.
Below is an example of readability change in our project description. We have referred to simple guides on writing                 readable sentences [4-5], but we also developed some tricks through the process. The change was subtle and                 perhaps hardly noticeable. But it greatly benefits the reader in a long passage, as proven by our own reading                 experience.
Original text (readability = college graduate):
“Although recombinases 1 have been widely adopted in developmental biology to study vital genes 2, 3 their potential in genetic engineering to produce dynamic constructs 2 has yet to be fully exploited.”
1: “Recombinase” is a jargon in biology. Most readers are unlikely to understand.
2: This detail is irrelevant for non-biologist readers.
3: Unnecessary use of a complex sentence further decreases readability.
High readability text (readability = 11th or 12th grade):
“For years, researchers have used recombinase proteins 1 to genetically modify organisms 2 . However 3 we noticed 4 the potential of these proteins                 in genetic engineering is not fully exploited.”
1: “Recombinase proteins” uses the least amount the word to explain that “recombinase” is a protein, a substance                 relatable to most readers.
2: Details at a right level to inform the readers about the context, i.e. scientists use them to change organisms.
3: Breaking the long sentence apart.
4: The use of “we” makes the sentence more engaging. Active voice makes the sentence easy to read. Also, the                 use of short words increases readability. This is especially important in scientific writing, where long                 words are common.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Tools#Microfluidics#HowTo1_-_-_TEXT.html,"MS or poly(dimethylsiloxane), informally known as silicone, is a cross-linkable elastomer. In layman's terms, it is a transparent rubber-like material.
PDMS chips: the four rectangular transparent blocs
It is used for the fabrication of microfluidic chips for many reasons:
Being flexible, it is easy to cast, and conforms to imperfect surfaces.
It accurately reproduces micro-scale patterns.
It is transparent down to UV light, allowing easy optical microscope observation and enabling fluorescence techniques of UV-range absorption.
It is non-toxic, allowing on-chip cell culture.
It can seal reversibly or irreversibly to itself or glass, allowing the fabrication of multi-layer devices, and strong bonding to glass slides.
Its surface chemistry can be controlled.
It is oxygen permeable, allowing air to diffuse out of the channels through the chip when the channels are filled.
﻿For more information on PDMS chip fabrication: Mcdonald, J.C. et al. Fabrication of microfluidic systems in poly (dimethylsiloxane). Electrophoresis 21, 27–40(2000).
Making the Chips
MITOMI chips are two layer devices. A thick upper layer is imprinted with the flow channels (those that will contain reagents) and a thin bottom layer is imprinted with the control channels (used to actuate on-chip valves). The role of each layer is explained further in Part II .
Casting PDMS involves mixing a precursor and a curing agent (sold as the Sylgard 184 kit by Dow Corning), degassing, pouring into the mould (or spin-coating onto the wafer for the thin layers), and partial curing at 80°C. After curing, holes are punched through the flow layer, to allow plugging in of external tubing (again, see part II). The two layers are then superposed and aligned by hand, so that the valves from the control layer overlap the correct channels on the flow layer.
After alignment, curing is finalised. This fully solidifies the chip and ensures a strong bond between the two layers. After curing, holes are punched through to the flow layer. For most chips, the last step is to bond them them to a glass microscope slide, following a plasma surface treatment if strong bonding is required. In the case of the MITOMI chips, they are instead aligned onto a spotted array from a DNA library. At this point, the chip is ready to use.
The specifics of each step are explained in our protocol for MITOMI chip fabrication. The process is illustrated on our"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

If there is room at the sides of the plate after this initial zigzag pattern has been made, one can make even more smaller zigzags that borrow cells from the original zigzag pattern.

Jamie indicated that hairpins and self-complimentarities should not be a problem in our primers, especially since they can be expected for primers with Biobrick restriction sites.  He suggested that we run a control PCR reaction without any plamid DNA to see what kinds of PCR products will be made just with the primers we use.  Granted, we expect these unwanted PCR products to be small.
Took yeast cells out of incubator at 1:45 pm.  Made two glycerol stocks of each strain (W303_1a and W303_1alpha), each from the same culture/colony.
Also, took plates out of incubator around 1:40 pm.  With the exception of PCYC, they demonstrated few if any isolated colonies. However, it looks like it will be possible to take at least one isolated colony from all plates but p413_GPD. Replated p413_GPD in order to isolate more colonies.  Placed in incubator around 11:40 pm.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2015,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," detect the desired production of butyryl-CoA  in lab strains of E. coli by LC/MS. We are now planning to troubleshoot a method to monitor the production of the butyryl-CoA and also gearing up to test the individual CDSs for function. We also conducted an experiment in a probiotic strain known as E. coli “Nissle” (aka Mutaflor ®). These cells were incubated with a cocktail of gut microbiota in anaerobic simulated gut conditions. We observed an LC/MS peak that is close to but does not correspond exactly to that of the desired butyryl-CoA. Further investigations are now needed to determine if is a derivative or if this is experimental noise. The gut conditions are more likely to be successful as the cells will primarily be metabolizing acetate, the input to our pathway.
Making constructs to express inducible branching and debranching enzymes in E. coli
AIM:
We aimed to ligate the E. coli glycogen metabolic genes GlgX and GlgB into the standard pSB1C3 plasmid vector with and without an IPTG-inducible promoter . GlgX is a glycogen debranching enzyme which cleaves α-1,6 glycosidic linkages in glycogen to remove branches. GlgB is a glycogen branching enzyme which cleaves α-1,4 glycosidic linkages and re-anneals the cleaved linkage back onto the main chain through an α-1,6 linkage, therefore creating a branch. Creating parts with the promoter allows us to investigate the effect of the expression of these enzymes on E. coli glycogen in an inducible system. Basic parts with just the enzyme coding sequences were also generated so that they can be used to build other composite parts in the future.
METHOD:
To achieve the cloning, we digested the various DNA components ( GlgX or GlgB sequence, pSB1C3 and IPTG-inducible promoter ) according to the restriction digest protocol with the relevant restriction enzymes to create compatible ends. The digestions were then run on an agarose gel and gel extracted to yield the digested DNA components. These were ligated and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. A colony PCR was undertaken and liquid cultures of colonies with the correctly-sized inserts were prepared. The plasmids were purified by plasmid prep and sent for sequencing. After sequencing, a mutation in the terminator codon of the GlgX sequence was discovered and this was subsequently corrected with"

BioBrick Assistant:
BioBrick Assistant will get the BioPart in the form of XML from the official website when the user inputs keywords. Then we extract the important information by using Actionscript XML processing functions in the form of a table.
Google API:
When the user inputs the keyword, it will be searched on Google. Then we parse the returned HTML, and save the title, author, abstract, and URL of the literature, which is convenient for the user.
Layout Algorithm:
1. Even Layout: First we calculate the border region which the user selected, namely the minimum and maximum of X and Y. So that we can get the height and width of the area. During the process, the number of nodes is gotten. Then we select the value of m and n as below: m, n are integers, m / n is closest to the width / height and m*n is no smaller than the number of the nodes. After m and n are set, the nodes will be arranged that the horizontal interval between horizontally adjacent nodes is width / m, and the vertical interval between vertically adjacent nodes is height / n.
2. Plasmid Arrangement: the arrangement of the radius of the circle size is in proportion to the number of nodes selected. Node will be sorted according to the type and arranged on the circle.
3. Force-directed Arrangement: Imagine that we assign each node with a positive charge, those nodes are mutually exclusive, and the repulsive force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Imagine that every edge is a spring, the force it applies on the nodes at its ends is proportional to the length of the spring. By calculating the force applied to each node, we can determine the direction and magnitude of its displacement. This process is called an iteration. After fifty times of iteration, all the nodes will be in steady state. We make their positions now their final positions for arrangement. The parameters of gravitation and repulsion are determined by experiments. The advantage of the algorithm is"

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Top_-_-_TEXT.html," of the diffusion term leads to acceptable solutions throughout a wider parameter range.  However, the result shown in the video is not satisfactory. No chemicals are simulated, the assumption here is that the type  B cells are directly repelled by type A bacteria, apart from the problem that this is biologically impossible the resulting  wave is quite small and would probably not be recognizable on a Petri dish. The next step we took  was to use a model closer  to what is possible in nature and include the repellent leucine in the simulation. An additional simulation including logistic   growth with a high growth constant ($\gamma = 0.008$) and leucine production can be played by clicking the corresponding   button above.   This simulation shows that high bacterial growth rates are quite detrimental to pattern formation.   Another video with a lower growth constant ($\gamma = 0.002$) shows more promising results, but the wave could be more  pronounced. The last simulation can be played above.   This one included leucine and AHL it is thus equivalent to the Keller-Segel type model shown in the first box  and the discretization provided in the second box. Hereby, including AHL which increases cell motility at the center of the  plate where the colonies are initially placed the model to produces a satisfactory large wave.   Fortunately the reproduction rate can be adjusted by choosing the temperature or the growth medium accordingly, therefore  it should be possible to achieve the low growths needed for pattern formation in the lab.
Zero flux and periodic boundary conditions have been implemented. The boundaries are the edges of the domain on which the   equation system is solved. Here the domain ranges from zero to eight centimetres, which is the diameter of a Petri dish.  With zero flux boundaries  the first derivative is set to zero at the boundaries, which means that neither bacteria nor chemicals are allowed to pass   trough the boundary. Periodic boundaries connect pairs of boundaries to each other, which means that cells leaving at the top   of the boundary appear at the bottom,   cells leaving at the left boundary reappear at the right and so on. In the continuous context these boundary conditions have   been implemented to allow comparisons with the hybrid model, where these boundaries are also used.    Finally simulations have been done using the parameters given in the table below:

Of course, the transfer of energy between trophic levels is notoriously poor. If non-ruminants were able to obtain more energy from plant matter, the net effeciency of energy transfer would be raised reducing the volume of food required in a diet. In addition, polysaccharides such as cellulose form viscous gel-like structures that trap starch, proteins and fats which would otherwise be accessible to the animal's digestive enzymes and transport systems.
We therefore propose that to demonstrate The E.ncapsulator's versatility, we will enable the production of cellulase enzymes by the system.

Sequencing results of isolated DNA from the liquid cultures the 1st attempt (top) with mutations for the amino acidsat position 149, 150 and 154 and 2nd attempt (bottom) with mutations at 69 and 73. Inserted mutations are indicated by the triplets consisting of N and K, whereby K stands for guanine or thymine, N for any possible base. Only in the mutated regions no distinct peaks are present. G: guanine, C: cytosine, A: adenine, T: thymine.
In order to examine the property of the generated chemoreceptor J23100_TAR_QClibrary the transformation efficiency was determined. Due to the fact that the first liquid culture of TAR_QC library only revealed 105 clones (attempt a), a repeat of the 2nd round of the library (attempt b) was carried out to increase diversity and resulted in the same diversity. Isolated DNA of attempts a and b were merged to gain a final diversity of 2x105, covering 6% of the theoretical diversity which would be 3.26 (Fig. 13A). The comparison of the sequencing chromatograms between the original and the mutated sequence excerpts indicated high quality of the TAR_QC library, because only the expected mutation sites had been changed. Every sequence of the isolated liquid culture DNA, which was not targeted, remained the same (Fig. 13B).

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#team:amsterdam#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," dilution rate and passage of fumaric acid from the rumen, which are in vivo factors that do not occur in vitro. In vivo, cattle were fed about twice the amount of fumaric acid (20 g/kg DMI) to cattle as that used in the more recent study (12 g/kg DMI) and, surprisingly, methane production decreased by 23%. However, in that study, only two animals per treatment were used, and methane measurements were made using ventilated hoods, which are known to be problematic. Also note there were differences between basal diets in the studies. This influences the microbiomes and may affect the outcome of the study. The figure below shows the theoretical framework made by iGEM UNL, that demonstrates the diversion of hydrogen away from the methanogens and to the process of fumarate production which in turn produces succinate and propionate. It is known that the higher the propionate to acetate ratio, the less methane the cow produces (Mcginn et al. , 2004).
Figure 3. The theoretical framework of  the effect of fumarate on methane synthesis in the ruminants. The synthesis of succinate out of fumarate competes for H 2 with the synthesis of methane. With a reduced concentration of substrate H 2 for methane synthesis reaction, less methane will be formed. (Adapted from Morgavi et al. (2010))
Strategies to overcome the problem of anaerobic production
Another way to get fumarate into in the microbiome of cattle would be to have bacteria produce fumarate in a bioreactor, and then dry and directly mix them with cattle feed. This way, there is no need to extract fumarate from the cell mixture and we also overcome the problem of anaerobic production. We could try to test different types of microorganisms and see which would be the most efficient and cost-effective at producing fumarate. Once the cells have produced enough fumarate, we, dry them and feed them to the cattle. We could compare the proposed E. Coli mutants, that produce fumaric acid and cyanobacterial cells from iGEM team Amsterdam that produce fumarate and see which one is more efficient at producing and delivering fumarate. As we aim to reduce greenhouse gasses in both our projects, we think it would be sensible to define the most efficient producer as the one that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into f"

1.SNP Treatment
In the preliminary experiments, we treated HEK 293 cells with 10umol/L sodium nitroprussiate (SNP), a NO donor, for different time periods. Cellular concentrations of cGMP were examined using a commercial Elisa Kit. As shown below, cellular concentration of cGMP increased after SNP treatment and peaked at 20 minutes. We used this condition as a positive control in our later experiments.
Fig.1  cGMP concentration after treated with 10umol/L SNP
2.sGC Overexpression
Construction:
Lentivirus vectors carrying the α or β subunits of sGC were created using the scarless golden gate assembly. The sequence encoding a fluorescent reporter was inserted after the antibiotics-resistance gene, rather than directly after the alpha3 and beta3 gene, to avoid any potential influences on the function of the part.
Vector Map of Alpha3 subunit
Fig.2 Lentivirus vector cointaing guanylate cyclase 1 alpha3 subunit gene
Vector Map of Bata3 subunit
Fig.3 Lentivirus vector cointaing guanylate cyclase 1 beta3 subunit gene
Confirmation of DNA Sequence：
We confirmed the construction of hGUY1A3 gene and hGUY1B3 gene encoding the α and β subunits of sGC, respectively, into Biobrick format flanking by required restriction sites ( BBa_K1720000 and BBa_K1720001 ).
Transfection：
HEK293 cells were transfected with the designed devices. Vectors carrying α subunit of sGC was inserted with mCherry gene as a reporter (red) while vectors carrying β subunit of sGC was inserted with EGFP gene as a reporter (green). Both red and green fluorescence were observed under fluorescence microscope. The transfection appeared to be successful!

Project Description
The Problem
     At its core, synthetic biology is the practice of genetically engineering novel organisms to perform a particular function. However, recent review studies estimate only 10-25% of published scientific results are reproducible. A 2014 survey conducted by the University of Michigan Biological Software Team confirmed that the repeatability problem exists in synthetic biology, with every scientist surveyed reporting prior struggles with replicating protocols. The majority of these scientists indicate unclear language and missing steps are the greatest contributors to the irreproducibility of synthetic biology protocols. A follow up study was conducted by this year's Software team, resulting in similar conclusions. ProtoCat 2.0 is designed to address both of these issues by making it easier for scientists to share troubleshooting techniques and submit edits to existing protocols.
The Solution
     Every respondent indicated that they would use a database to browse and download protocols, with over 85% indicating that they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed. ProtoCat 2.0 is a free database of crowd sourced protocols designed to make existing protocols more repeatable and enable more accurate computational models of biological systems. We believe this can most efficiently be accomplished with a commitment to open source protocols and a broader more active community of digital troubleshooters. ProtoCat 2.0 works to establish such a community by giving anyone with an internet connection or smartphone access to a repository of synthetic biology protocols collected from all over the world. Additionally, ProtoCat 2.0 encourages the development of higher quality, more repeatable protocols by allowing users to document trails, rate, review, and edit existing methods, and easily locate related protocols.

Project Description
Our project aims to produce a group of BioBricks organised into three modules; one each for Red, Green and Blue ( RGB ) light. To demonstrate the system we will control the production of Cyan, Magenta and Yellow pigments, but we will also be inputting a system where future teams could have any gene as their ""output"" gene. We are using the CMY pigments, but you could potentially use the RGB light to control the transcription of anything.
The ultimate aim of our project is to use ( CMY ) pigments to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph or coliroid .
We will be building upon the work done by previous iGEM teams, most notably Texas/Austin 2004, Edinburgh 2010 and Uppsala 2011.
If you would like to see any of our initial brainstorming - please feel free to follow this link ( Brainstorming )
The Camera
Bio-Photography is the application of genetically engineered bacteria to act as the light sensor of a camera, replacing digital sensors ( CCD/CMOS ) or photographic film. The surface area of bacteria is on the order of microns, much smaller than a digital sensor, giving bio-cameras the potential to produce images with far greater resolution than current digital photography offers.
We aim to produce the world's first colour bio-photograph by producing Cyan, Magenta and Yellow pigments in response to Red, Green and Blue light. We plan to combine this system with a lens to focus the image onto plated bacteria to form the world's first colour bio-camera.
Colour system
To produce the full colour spectrum requires all three primary colours . This is because any colour can be produced by mixing the primary colours but primary colours cannot be produced by mixing any colours.
In our system we are using two sets of primary colours. Red, Green and Blue for light and Cyan, Magenta and Yellow for pigments. This is because light and pigment mix differently; light is additive and pigment is subtractive:
Light and pigment produce colour in"

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling.

TERRA Adapter
Creating the TERRA Adapter
The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip that is capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip running the experiment into the intended lab vessel. The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as users don’t need to design a chip that both performs both a biological experiment and proper output selection. For droplet-based experiments, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulators per output. In continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output and an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs, but no pressure regulators.
After both discussing with Fraunhofer and Phenomyx about the lack of standardization in the microfluidic industry and evaluating the advantages of making our system compatible with commercial microfluidic chips, we made the output selection mechanism its own chip - the TERRA Adapter. Output selection is a necessary part of TERRA because the system needs direct control over when the output of the microfluidic chip is dispensed. This control is vital because the flow into the chip is continuous, whereas output must be noncontinuous. The TERRA Adapter allows for great flexibility in the experimental chip as it can be either user-designed or bought commercially, and does not require a built-in output selector.
Output Selector with Pressure Regulators
The first features resembling a TERRA Adapter were the valve-based output selectors used the initial versions of our proof of concept chips. An output selector is a combination of two valves and two ports that work in tandem. When one valve is open, the other is closed. This means the input only goes to one of the two outputs at any one time. When the valves are actuated, the liquid is redirected to the other output. Using this concept, our simple two-valve output selector system controls when an input is flowing to waste and the output nozzle, allowing direct control over when the output is dispensed. The output selector used in the 4-Pressure Regulator chip is identical to"

Application: Oil Sands
The primary platform of our project is monitoring watersheds that may be affected by seepage from oil sands tailings. In order to move forward with this application, it is crucial to understand current monitoring methods, their limitations, and critically assess the viability of our device for deployment for this purpose.
In 2011, the Water Monitoring Data Review Committee (WMDRC) prepared a report for the Government of Alberta that evaluating existing data on the contamination of the Athabasca watershed in Alberta by oil sands extraction processes. They focused on the limitations of water monitoring systems in place at the time. They recognized that due to fluctuations of chemical concentrations over time and space in aquatic systems, the quantity of data is a large limitation in arriving at any definitive conclusions about environmental impacts. Data collection can be limited by duration and temporal frequency of sampling, spatial range and distribution, detection limits, precision, and specificity, as well as consistency of measurement. They recommended that oil sands water monitoring be focused on the “status and trends in key pollutants over time and space,” including PAHs and arsenic. They highlighted that weekly and monthly sampling is inadequate to account for short-term “pulses,” so timing is key. Another major improvement that they suggested was to improve the sensitivity of lab measurement for PAHs and trace metals.
In early 2012, the governments of Canada and Alberta initiated a new oil sands monitoring plan with the goal of being “scientifically rigorous, comprehensive, integrated, and transparent.” The primary purpose of oil sands monitoring is to be able to assess the long-term effects of oil sands monitoring on the environment by collecting data more frequently over time and space. Specifically, water monitoring is focused on assessing the nature and extent of contamination from oil sands waste in the Athabasca watershed"

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," livelihoods. They did, however, ask that if we gave them a product that it would be thoroughly tested. They additionally requested that the product be sold with a very in-depth explanation of what is was, so that beekeepers could truly understand the product and use it with confidence.
Beekeepers were concerned that the construct would change the taste or appearance of the honey. This is because, as they explained to us, there is a ranking system for honey on the international level. Albertan honey is considered very high quality because of its mild taste and light colour. This is particularly popular in Japan, which is known for its high quality standards for food products.
Application: Each time meeting with beekeepers, we provided an explanation of our project and remained in contact with them through its duration. If we were to turn this project into a business and actually sell this product, we would take their ideas into consideration. We would do this by providing a detailed explanation of what we are doing. We would also continually test the product to address concerns of long term effects.
To address issues of the honey’s quality being reduced we attempted a biome experiment. This experiment was unsuccessful, so we asked researchers about how they thought our construct would affect the honey. They responded that they were sure that the construct would not change the colour of the honey.
Question: Do you mind that the product would be a GMO? We thought this would be an important question to ask as many people are not fans of GMOs often due to personal belief.
Quote: “Something that engineered or bred to actually reduce the problems of Nosema… its either that or we're not going to have any bees anymore.” - Randy Beaton
Answer: En masse beekeepers were not concerned about GMOs. Commercial beekeepers in particular understood that GMOs are an important part of food production, and that all crops are, to some extent, genetically modified.
Application: This means that our product would likely be well received.
Question: If we were to make this product what would be the best way to use it? We thought  this question would be important to ask; if we were to make a product we wanted to be widely utilized.
Quote: “beekeeping industry has overcome a lot of adversity … beekeepers keep going, they are resilient, they work with that they have.” - Ursula Da Runga
Answer: Beekeepers suggested making a product similar to the way Fumagilin was used. This meant that our construct would need to be able to be fed to bees.  This was also a common way to distribute Fumagilin.

Later we did PCR to amplify the backbones of ADF-3 and ADF-3+ (both with pBAD). But we made some errors and added the wrong primers.
The next day we repeated the PCR, and the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3 had the right size. Then we send for sequencing ADF-3 and ADF-3+. Later we realized that we sent the wrong sample of ADF-3!!
We also transformed some E. coli with backbone with pBAD of ADF-3. The following day we did colony PCR to these E. coli, but we did not obtain the desired  results. Then we cultivated the E. coli transformed with the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3 in 200 mL of LB with 1nM of arabinose.
August 20 – 26, 2012
We did colony PCR of 3 colonies transformed with the backbone with pBAD of ADF-3, but the results were negative. The next day we did colony PCR again, but this time with other method:
1)    Put 100 mL of bacteria in eppendorf tubes of  2µl and heat at 95ºC for 10 minutes.
2)    Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes.
3)    Do Colony PCR with the supernatant as the template.
Unfortunately, the results were negative.
And we became the results from the sequencing. ADF-3 is incorrect (as we expected, because we sent the wrong sequence), and ADF-3+ is a bit weird. Bernardo never trusted the PCR band of this sequence anyway…
The next day we sent for sequencing ADF-3 (this time the right sequence). Some days later we became the results from this sequencing, and it were negative. This is  terrible!
Finally, we prepared the materials for the community outreach activity for Penta UC, the Talents Development and Study Program at Catholic University. And we participated in this activity. More information in Human Practices/Community Outreach.
August 27 – September 3, 2012
We transformed pBAD_ADF-3 in pSB1K3, and pBAD_ADF-3+ in pSB1K3.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Off Targeting_-_-_TEXT.html,") designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 10). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 10: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets. A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the E. coli DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site. B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ for the four simulations (Figure 11). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected"

He made clear that our first encounter with bacteria is essential for the proper development as babies;  the first encounter is at birth and it depends on the way the baby is born (natural o C section). Usually babies born in a natural birth have an advantage in terms of the microbiome compared to those born by c-section. Another vital factor is the correct feeding, during the first months of life a baby should be fed with breast milk, then specially developed formula and when the baby is able to eat solid food a balanced diet should be included, unfortunately many parents feed their children with food of low nutritional value and high in carbohydrates, which is not recommended, he also told us that he has seen many father that give soda and  highly processed food which not only contributes to obesity, it also creates the ideal environment for an imbalance in the child's microbiome. Finally we asked him if he considers that Lactobachill would be suitable for pediatric patients, which he answered that as long as it includes proteins and is low in sugar, it should be suitable for them; he reassured the usage of  Lactobacillus rhamnosus as the microorganism used for Lactobachill.
José Rogelio González García is a physician from Toluca, Mexico, he is specialized in gastric surgery and laparoscopy; he resides and works in the same city.
We wanted to validate our project so we asked his professional opinion, he told us that he thinks it is an interesting project but in order to figure out if it could be used as a treatment for depression and anxiety we must perform studies in animal models and after that perform clinical trials to determine if its a product that could benefit more than harm the population.
Irma Pamela Acosta Méndez is an internist and geriatrician, chief of medical students in the hospital of Penjamo, Guanajuato; she also works in Abasolo, Guanajuato.
We wanted to know her opinion about the psychobiotic and if she would consider the use of Lactobachill  as a preventive treatment, maybe even as a adjuvant against depression and anxiety. She thought that it was a good idea because of the increasing numbers of people dealing with depression.                           She, like the other health professionals, emphasized that we had to make sure that Lactobachill was suitable for human use.

Knockouts: One last run of the germination assay on our triple and quadruple mutants. All results of these assays can be found compiled on our data page .
10-14 September 2012
To clean up our Sporobeads from vegetative B. subtilis cells we tried three different methods: French Press, sonification and lysozymes. A great difference was observed after the treatment with lysozyme ! Furthermore, the lysozyme did not damage our fusion protein, as GFP fluorescence was still obtained in microscopy!
PlepA was fused into the finished vector pSBBS3C-luxABCDE to evaluate this BioBrick vector and compare in to the version where there is still one forbidden restriction site in it.
For the Suicide switch, PspoIVB-ecf41Bli aa 1-204 in pSBBS4S, and PydfG/PsspK/PspoIVB in pSBBS3C-luxABCDE were brought into B. subtilis.

All of our CotZ-GFP variants were examined with fluorescence microscopy! The brightest spores derived from our B 53 strain (containing Pcotyz-cotZrep-gfp-terminator).
We worked more on the knockouts aspect of the GerminationSTOP module. We ran another germination assay for our triple and quadruple mutants. Plates of our spores diluted at 10-2, 10-4 and 10-6 show NO GERMINATION for our mutants, and plenty of germination for the WT168 positive control! We will try plating undiluted mutant spores to see if any germination occurs at higher concentrations.

Singapore SB7.0 conference
The Flight
At about 12:00 we met at the Duesseldorf airport, with our bags packed and ready to go. Being about 2 hours early, we had absolutely no trouble getting through the check-in and security. After that we met up with Rocio a PhD student from our university who coincidentally was also going to the SB7.0 and spend the last hour before boarding eating something small and talking about the trip.
Because we were supposed to fly with an A380, we were a little disappointed when we realized that there was just an A330 waiting for us but after a pretty fast boarding we were ready to leave for our first destination — Dubai.
The food as well as the service on board were outstanding and so the hours until landing past in no time.     When we reached Dubai international airport we were already pretty exhausted but while we were rolling to our gate we got our first glance at the A380 in the flesh. That thing looks like a building with wings.
The time we had to spend at the airport between flights passed pretty quick even though it was getting late and we were getting pretty sleepy – no wonder when you’re on the go for over 10 hours. When we queued in the boarding line we realized that we were going to fly with an A380 after all and seeing a man made construction like this getting ready for take-off and then actually leaving ground with you in it, is something we will probably never forget.

ABSTRACT
Our project aims at developing a self-regulatory system for the degradation of virulent factors. We plan to integrate quorum sensing and qsdA to create this system of self-regulation. Quorum sensing will be used to detect the presence of high cell densities and to activate qsdA upon detecting high cell density. qsdA, acting as a repressor, will degrade the signal molecules needed for quorum sensing and thus turn off quorum sensing as well as itself. It will reactivate upon the reactivation of quorum sensing and this cycle of self-regulation will persist. This prototype system is meant to test the application of this system but the main goal is to introduce this system to pseudomonas aeruginosa as a means to prevent the harm that it causes.
The quorum sensing regulatory gene circuit is meant to target pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa that use quorum sensing as a means for regulation of virulent factors. However, our hope is that by creating a new paradigm for fighting virulence in pathogenic cells will provide insight for future works and endeavors.  This system is meant to not be only restricted to pseudomonas aeruginosa but to be altered to fight virulence in other pathogens.
PHASE I
LUX OPERON
AHL or Acylated Homoserine Lactones belong to a class of autoinducers. These autoinducers act as chemical signaling molecules that gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria use as a way of communicating with one another. Additionally, this form of communication is used to regulate various physiological activities and more specifically virulence.
The detection of these autoinducers involves diffusion into the cells and binding to receptors. However, the binding autoinducers and receptors does not usually occur until a threshold concentration of autoinducers is reached. High concentrations of gram-negative and grampositive bacteria is often accompanied by a high concentration of autoinducers and so detection of these autoinducers is achieved in the presence of a high concentration of autoinducer producing bacteria [1]. This cell-cell communication in bacteria is a process called quorum sensing, which allows for bacteria to respond to fluctuations in the"

Lenz: “After an air read, they flew over the area to take pictures and investigate if they had done there work right.” The images, which were of surprisingly high quality taking into account that they had been taken seventy years ago, showed parts of Germany just after being bombarded, displaying impact craters and destroyed buildings. In these pictures, one has to search for small dots indicating unexploded bombs. It is nearly impossible to deduce the presence or absence of bombs from these pictures with an acceptable degree of certainty. Lenz mentioned he felt “like a shaman hovering with his hands over the pictures to pick up signals” when he was searching for bombs on these pictures.
When it is suspected that a certain area contains bombs, the Kampfmittelräumdienst goes over there to thoroughly search the area for bombs with the use of a magnetometer. “Magnetometers sense changes in field lines of the earth’s magnetic field due to the metal in the bomb. A larger bomb has more influence on the magnetic field, but depth, position and shape also matter.” When a signal is picked up, the metal object has to be dug up. The signal often does not match with what is found: “Sometimes you expect a hand grenade, and you find a 250 pound bomb!” However most of the times a suspicious signal just comes from an iron bar or something like that.
Yet, the use of a magnetometer pose several difficulties. Altough, they can detect signals up to a depth of approximately 5 meters., much of the bombs lay at depths of around 10-15 meters and therefore cannot be found in this way.  Lenz: “Although I’m not really convinced of the number, it is said that 30% of the bombs is missed by magnetometer searches.” “Current methods are not that satisfying that I can go to sleep well. Words like ‘maybe’ and ‘possibly’ are not in use by EOD specialists, because it is a matter of life and death.”
When a bomb is located, it has to be dug up. This is not without danger: “Some time ago, in our area of operation, more precisely in Ludwigshafen, a 500 pound bomb was hit with a drill, leading to the deflagration of the charge, which lifted the 80 t drilling device about 50 cm into the air. The machine operator was injured by glass shards. In Euskirchen (which is in Nordrhein-Westfalen, so another"

Integrated Human Practices: We did a very meaningful Human Practices and in our Human Practice page, we have clearly documented how some of the HP determine and greatly improve our design and project!
Improve a Previous Part or Project: CcaS is a very important part in our light control system and we found it in iGEM Parts Registry BBa_K608102. CcaS worked with CcaR to achieve the light-sensing. We have optimized the codons to eliminate the illegal restriction sites to make it meet the RFC10 standards, which allows the standard assembly possible! And we put CcaS and CcaR together to make it a whole functional pathway BBa_K2789001. We verified this part successfully and documented it on the registry. We submitted this part to iGEM hq and this part greatly improve the previous part BBa_K608102!
Model Your Project: Modelling played an important role in our basic design(which control signal to use) and provided us a suggestion on how to further improve it. Besides, We simulated a long-term growth curve of co-culture of bacteria and algae, which helped us to confirm the stability of co-culture and the parameters of growth control of symbiotic biofilm of bacteria and algae!
Demonstration of Your Work: To verify that our system can work, we have verified the different parts separately and combine them to some extent!
1.verify the light control system
 (1).verify the light-induced promoter-CcaS/R system and promoter cpcG
 (2).verify the light promoter+ Not Gate
2.verify the phosphorus accumulation and release protein-PPK,PPX,PPN

By developing tools to genetically engineer Yarrowia lipolytica we aim to create a versatile cell factory, which in the future will be able to produce almost any desired product ranging from complex therapeutic proteins to high value chemical compounds. Besides diversity of products cell factory based on Y. lipolytica offers a wide range of substrate tolerance.
We aim to demonstrate this versatility of our Y. lipolytica strain as a cell factory by producing heterologous proteins. Our first attempt is the production of humanized, Renilla reniformis GFP (hrGFP), followed by proinsulin. To achieve both of mentioned ideas we apply the pSB1A8YL plasmid, cloning workflow and codon optimization algorithm developed by our team.

Relevant legal risks often occur in areas such as: early R & D contractual agreement, rights attribution, patent and trademark acquisition, use, maintenance, transfer, license, infringement, cyber squatting, fraudulent use and so on.
Risks of business activities. The biotechnology industry is heavily regulated. For example, individual consumers of the product efficacy and side effects of different reactions, easily lead to product liability complaints, litigation and claims, and even lead to public relations events, improper handling will lead to significant losses.
Critical Thinking about Law Related to Gene Technology from Professor Zhipeng He.
Zhipeng He, an excellent professor of Jilin University School of Law, who has written books in law, and is good at teaching and scientific research of Law, shared with us three law principles.
From his perspective, which is profound and thought-provoking, firstly, while there are phenomena in the society, it is not to say that there must be some law concerning the very kind of phenomena. It is the maturity of the society and the consensus we reached contribute to the forming of law. Any kind of radical law is not mature response to the society phenomenon.
Secondly, it is the development of life that leads the development of law. No vice. Thirdly, genetic research is a matter of hot dispute, however, the focus of law should be concerning relevant technology and social more. All in all, the law is passive.
Who can tell how the law will be in the future? We guess no one.  However, Chinese scientific research needs a more effective ethical regulation urgently. The more we human being have in technology, the more we are exposed to danger. We need the law so that we prevent mistakes happening again after we have done something wrong. But only the practice and real situation in the near future can better promote the development of law of gene technology. And when that day comes, the development in gene editing and therapy techniques may have greater breakthrough. We will be not dare to welcome that day, and with our efforts, the gene therapy/technology can make progress in law.

However figure 6 shows that there is no inducible fluorescence generated by these bacteria. This indicates that further work is necessary to stimulate effective expression of both the LUX components and mKeima from the same operon.
Future plans
iGEM headquarters recently published a paper demonstrating the challenges in expression of fluorescent proteins, BB_K2060001 or BB_K2060002 . Sadly we ran out of time to conduct further analysis but might would recommend the following experiments:
1. Induce expression at lower temperatures (18C or 22C) at varying concentrations of Arabinose (nM-mM range)
2. Addition of arabinose at different times in the bacterial growth cycle.
3. Vary timings post growth to allow for protein maturation
We hope that future iGEM teams will take advantage of the availability of these biobricks as potentially very useful tool for the analysis of gene expression. With increased time the development of these tools will be of benefit for the entire iGEM community.

We are currently working on a project that will use an engineered strain of E. coli to increase the synergistic effect of enzymes. As a proof of concept we will attempt to use this system with 3 enzymes that are associated with the degradation of cellulose, namely; endoglucanase, exoglucanase and B-glucosidase. One of the possible applications of this system (synergistic breakdown of cellulose) is the creation of a biorefinery. We envisage the possibility of taking waste (such as agriculture and paper-waste) and converting it into products found in food such as sweeteners and vitamins.
What is your immediate reaction to this?
Spontaneously I am absolutely positive about this. Biorefineries will be a key element of meeting future challenges and approaching more sustainability. However, I am not able to assess whether it is promising for modifications of E. coli.
As the director of the Office of Technological Assessment at the German Bundestag, what questions would you have for us with regards this application?
a. Would you have any immediate concerns?
b. If, hypothetically, a bio-refineries network was to be implemented, what regulations, if any, do you think would need to be put in place?
(a) It is not a joke: my office has been requested to work on a study on SB some months ago. Work is in progress. In case of interest please contact Dr Arnold Sauter working at TAB. Concerning your project: E. coli are, as far as I know as a non-biologist, not welcome in many areas of human life. My immediate concerns would affect possible release of modified E. coli with new properties to the Environment not knowing about possible impacts and side-effects (a typical bio-safety issue).
(b) It depends on the knowledge about possible side effects as well as about hazard and damage scenarios which will be available at that time. According to the state of knowledge and the degree of uncertainty and ignorance different risk management strategies should be applied. Probably, the Precautionary Principle (which was established in the EU at the occasion of GMO) will have to be applied. It allows and requests precautionary measures in a broad range with different degree of intervention, depending on the degree of evidence of risk. In any case, careful monitoring of possible side effects will be necessary, accompanied by continuous assessment of the knowledge available"

E. coli ethanologenic strain KO11 clonings:
In our biochemical assays, our aim was to see the effects of our parts on ethanol production, cell growth, and lifespan by using KO11. Since KO11 itself had                  chloramphenicol resistance in its genome, we needed to use another antibiotic resistance. Thus, we inserted our composite parts to pSB1A3 backbone (carrying                  Ampicillin resistance) as well and did the transformations to KO11.
For ligation, first composite part’s (only FucO) insert to vector ratio was 1:3, second part’s only GSH) was 1:2, and the third part’s (Both FucO and GSH) was 1:1,5.                 We’ve transformed the ligations to KO11 competent cells and grew the colonies on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol at a final concentration of 150 µg/ml and                 ampicillin at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml. After obtaining KO11 colonies, we’ve done colony PCR and in the end, we recultured the best result giving colonies                 for plasmid isolation. Chosen colonies were the 3rd colony for both composite part 1 (figure 13 and 15) and 2 (figure 14); and the 2nd colony for composite part 3.

Composite part 1 (FucO) in pSB1A3 PCR Confirmation with plasmid:
After plasmid isolation, PCR with FucO left and VR primers was conducted to check the orientation of our composite part 1 to pSB1A3 backbone, and the                  expected band length for that confirmation was 754 bp (figure 16). 8th well in the image below (obtained from the plasmid isolation of the 3rd colony)                  confirms the orientation.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," high school students are familiar with the phrases: biology, DNA and genetic code, however they have rarely               encountered “synthetic biology” or the “iGEM” competition.
To help promote the high school iGEM platform and encourage young entrepreneurship, we collaborated with “MadaTech” – The Israel National Museum of Science, Technology and Space. Through this collaboration, a group               of students from a Mexican high school was hosted at a “MadaTech” lab, where we introduced them to the world               of “synthetic biology” and the “iGEM” competition. Moreover, they learned the basic concepts of operating a               microscope, while examining samples from different sources (hair, onions and more). Also, they learned about the               bacteria surrounding us.
This meeting proved to be successful, the students came up with some unique ideas for iGEM projects and               learned about the qualities of the microscopic world.
To see more about the activity, look at our ""Do It Yourself"" booklet at the high school students section.
Or, see the presentation presented during the activity.

""Science at the Bar"" nights were an excellent and successful tool to promote science and knowledge among young adults.               As the name implies, a scientist was hosted and gave a lecture at a local pub in Haifa city – ""Junta"". Through the lecture               the audience was introduced to the scientist's field of study, while getting hands-on information, regarding the cutting               edge research performed in the lab.
We arranged three nights, with different scientists who spoke about their research. Each of the scientists works in a               unique and a innovative field, with little information known to the public including ourselves!
On the first night, we hosted Prof. David (Dedi) Meiri from the faculty of Biology, Technion.
His lecture ""Is cannabis the antibiotic of the next century?"" focuses on the effects of               medical cannabinoid (cannabis) on different types of diseases, such as cancer, epilepsy and diabetes. This lecture was in such high demand that we decided to invite Prof. Meiri to speak again.
On the second night, Prof. Avraham Haim from the faculty of Natural Sciences, Haifa University was hosted. His lecture ""Is green really green? The complexity of solutions to environmental issues"" focuses on light pollution – the effects of lights and the LED lamps on our sleeping cycles and our daily lives.
Lastly, we hosted Prof. Meytal Landau from the faculty of Biology, Technion. Her research ""Medicine, bacteria and Particle accelerators"" focuses on recent advances in cutting edge drug research"

All the teams were involved in the drafting of the proposal; we shared our ideas and experiences in order to get a proposal as complete and useful as possible.
1.- We argue that the best is to include in the customs act a guide to clearly classify the products for what they are (Proteins and DNA are not present in the product list). This guide should content also the documentation and the package needed for each classification. The provider should include an engagement letter assuring that the material shipped is safe. In order to achieve this, the Official Mexican Norm NOM-087-ECOL-SSA1-2002 of environmental-health-waste disposal protection should be modified and extended. It is also proposed an official norm for the label of the package:
Complete name and abbreviation of the product.
Classification in risk levels (Material Safety Data Sheet)
Storage and transportation conditions.
</p> <p> 2.-  In order to keep control, agreements must be established between customs offices and Universities, Investigation Centers and Companies recognized in México. All this should be done with strict attachment to the articles 4 and 5 of the Cartagena Protocol, the Agreement of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers of Trade. </p> <p> Our purpose with these points is to make a standard for the shipment of this kind of material. This will ease the job of the customs officers because the only thing they have to do is check if the requirements of the guide are correct and the destination of the material (Academia or Private Research). By doing this, customs officers will be less likely to unjustly or unknowingly retain important research material (which is the main cause of biotech material to remain stuck in the border). This will in turn make the process easier for the companies sending the material because they’ll know what to address in order to get the shipment delivered in time and form. </p> <p> For our second approach, we contacted two lawyers of our university, Dr. Donato Cárdenas and Eloisa Fernández, who are currently articulating the ideas into a proposal with all the necessary requirements and working simultaneously with our local congressman to address the proposal. This part is essential because if we really want to make a contribution of high impact, we need to work interdisciplinary. The vision and contribution of the lawyers and politicians is very valuable because it allows us to understand the nature of lawmaking and all the things that have to be done in order to create an"

UC_Davis,2015,Team:UC Davis#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," used in a practical setting. The wet lab portion of our project focused on:
Discovery of an enzyme that met all of our criteria,
Identification of an alternative substrate that would enable practical use,
Our wet lab effort can be broken up into five components:
1. Enzyme Selection
2. Chemical Biology Substrate Screening
3. Enzyme Engineering
4. Prototyping in Real World Waste Water
5. Future Directions
        ↥
The need: A FabI enzyme that can show nanomolar inhibition using triclosan
(Why nanomolar inhibition? Work done by Chalew and Halden showed that levels of triclosan leaving waste-water treatment plants was up to 9 nM, which happens to also be the toxicity threshold level for algae. [18])
Strategy 1a: Scan the registry to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
We first scanned through the iGEM parts registry for existing BioBrick Parts that code for FabI. We found Bba_K771303 from the 2012 Shanghai Jiao Tong University iGEM team, however we were unable to find enzymatic characterization data on the part. We therefore proceeded with our literature search for FabI enzymes with inhibition data. Strategy 1b: Alternate candidates were found by mining the literature to find characterized FabIs with inhibition data
Triclosan inhibits type 2 fatty acid synthesis (FASII), an essential pathway in the Bacterial and Eukaryotic domains by interacting directly with the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) [3]. Evidence that we could use the enzyme to detect triclosan came from binding studies and crystallographic data initially from Heath et al. They showed that triclosan binding increases the enzyme’s affinity for NAD+ and triclosan’s role as an effective inhibitor is due to the formation of a stable ternary complex between FabI, triclosan, and NAD+ [4].
The basis of our biosensor, therefore, is to use triclosan’s mechanism of action as an inhibitor of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) in order to detect it. To screen a representative subset of FabI’s from all available domains of life, we mined the literature and found every characterized FabI with published inhibition data. We found all living organisms except for the Archaea, who synthesize lipids based on isoprenoids, have a fabI gene [5].
Unlike the other enzymes of the FASII pathway,"

Kinetic model of the Pathway
Summary
In order to determine the practicality of our solution, we are applying kinetic modeling to investigate how much time our engeneered E. coli cells will take to convert a certain amount of ammonia to nitrous oxide. For ammonia concentrations typically encountered in wastewater, our modelling shows that our transformed E. coli cells will be able to do this within less than 15 minutes.
Methods
The reactions of the pathway we are trying to integrate in E. coli are:
We constructed a kinetic model of our transformants based on literature research. To describe product formation by the enzymes we used the Michaelis-Menten approach (also the iGEM team from Taipei in 2012 was looking into kinetic modelling of Nir and Nos):
Some of the necessary parameters can be found in literature, they are listed in Table 1.
It is necessary to know or estimate the enzyme concentration if kcat values are used. Based on a paper we found that gives typical protein concentrations in E. coli [4] we chose to use four different enzyme concentrations in our model: 100, 500, 1000 and 100 000 enzymes per cell corresponding to low, medium, high and very high concentrations of enzyme.
To be consistent in units we converted the vmax value of AMO and HAO to a kcat value in the following way: In [5] the amount of HAO in cell extract is given as 2.6% so for our conversion we assume 2% of the protein mass corresponds to AMO and another 2% correspond to HAO, summing up to 4%. This leads to a value of 39.75μmol min−1 mg of enzyme−1 . The molecular weight of AMO is given in [6] as 283 kDa and the molecular weight of HAO is given in [5] as 189 kDa."

Any person that lives in Israel knows the complexity of this country. Diverse population and multiplicity of cultures and religions are among the main causes for this complexity. Living in the same country forces us to bridge the differences in order to find a common ground, on which we can build a shared life.
Technion iGEM team has decided to take advantage of the iGEM competition in order to try and create a shared platform for all of Israel citizens.
This platform is:
Project Goals
(1) Progressing Arab-Jewish relations through the medium of science
(2) Reaching a wide range of people from the Israeli society
(3) Making synthetic biology more accessible to the public
(4) Merging science and art from a unique stand point
Different Languages, One Science
About 21% of Israel citizens are Arab. The main languages in Israel are Hebrew and Arabic, which is the second official language of the country.
We believe that Safie, the product we are developing can serve a wide range of people, so among our main goals in the three languages project is presenting our bio detector in an easy and accessible way:
Social Media
One of the most powerful tools today is social media networks. Using the social media as a platform is not a new concept in iGEM, but we are taking it one step further, using Facebook to address the public in not one, but three languages.

The donator earns nothing, only the satisfaction of having contributed in a project; this funding form is an act of solidarity. In general, this kind of funding is more specific to the association’s donation.
The reward: A natural or a legal person gives money in exchange of reward. This kind of transaction look like to the triad of Marcel Mauss present in his essay “Essai sur le don” translated “Essay on the donation”. This essay discuss of the donation observed in archaic societies. The reward involved three-fold triple obligation: give-collect-pay back. The project manager could offer different types of reward:
- If the willingness of the project is to product something and not a service, the donor could receive a product in exchange of his contribution.
- The reward may also take the form of gifts, goodies or promotional products, to give some examples.
Bank loan: A natural or legal person gives bank loan instead of to finance a project. In return, the money borrowed has to give back, with or without bank interest. 
The equity: It is an investment: the natural or legal person co-finance the project by the acquisition of shares in the companies involved. This last funding for is an exchange regulate by a contract between the stakeholders.  Naturally, the contract has to be in concordance with the law of state. In this context, the term Cowdequity is used.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," their gel proved to be resistant to dextranase, an enzyme specifically for the degradation of dextran, they asked us to try dissolve it under varying conditions.
There are two questions to be answered:
What conditions are ideal to dissolve the dextran gel while ensuring survival of embedded bacteria?
If the gel can be dissolved while embedded bacteria stay alive, what are implications for biosafety?
iGEM Eindhoven sent us their gel, and we developed strategies to dissolve it. Eindhoven told us that they were able to dissolve the gel at very low pH, which would not be a feasible environment for bacteria contained within. Based on this information, we set up two moderately acidic conditions: An Aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid at pH 3, at which E. coli is able to survive, but that is not realistic in most environments in which the gel would be used, and a solution of lactic acid at pH 3.6 1 . E. coli produces lactic acid both naturally, and at higher rates in our project 2 . While we do not think that a pH of 3.6 would occur evenly throughout the entire gel, overproduction of lactic acid may lead to locally raised lactic acid concentrations that come close to our artificial condition.  Additionally, we set up two basic conditions: the agarose-dissolving buffer from Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit at pH 8, and an aqueous solution of NaOH at pH 9.
Results
We incubated 190 mg gel pieces at 37 °C in 1 mL of aqueous solutions of NaOH, HCl, lactic acid and the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit Binding Buffer for 2 hours and checked for decomposition.
After two hours, the gel piece in aqueous NaOH-solution seems to slowly dissolve as indicated by a decrease of mass (165 mg after 2 h). In aqueous HCl-solution the gel seems to be stable (no change in mass after 2 h). In Thermo Fisher GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit Binding Buffer the gel seems to soak in the solution but not to decompose (215 mg after 2 h). In aqueous lactic acid solution the gel seems to be stable (no change in mass after 2 h).
After 24 h the gel pieces were weighed again. In aqueous NaOH-solution the gel further dissolved as indicated by a decrease of mass to 150 mg. In aqueous HCl solution the gel seems to be dissolving at a slower, but measurable rate to 170 mg."
