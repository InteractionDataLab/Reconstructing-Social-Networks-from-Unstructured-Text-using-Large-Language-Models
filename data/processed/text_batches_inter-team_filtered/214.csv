Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#Transcriptomics#cDNA Conversion_-_-_TEXT.html,"DNA hybrids, which would decrease efficiency of RNase Cocktail, which is more efficient in digesting ssDNA. RNase H was therefore added to address this issue but clearance of RNA from samples did not significantly increase. Even more confusingly, digestion did work in some of the samples despite the content/treatment being identical.
Conclusion
We have managed to successfully synthesize complementary DNA to our mRNA samples, which unfortunately did contain undigested RNA. A protocol needs to be developed that assures all of the RNA has been removed from the sample prior to the preparation of the library. Moreover, additional troubleshooting needs to be performed to determine why the digestion is not efficient.

The transformation did not grow. We must pick new colonies and sequence confirm they have the right Gibson CBA parts in order to resupply our stock of Plasmid 1. This will be used as the backbone for the insertion of dCas9 and Lambda Red Recombinase.

Picked 10 colonies for overnight growth from the second 4-part CBAR of Plasmid 1, which was digested with Dpn1 to ensure no contamination by original plasmid DNA.
Sam digested gblocks and pFTV again using Cla1 and Pst1, purified, then ligated them together, purified again, then transformed cells and plated them.

Plasmid prepared 10 colonies. Digested them with AatII and XbaI, which are restriction sites only contained in the final Plasmid 1. These 10 digests were run on a gel, of which 4 showed the correct bands at approximately 1 kb and 3 kb.
No colonies observed on plates from Sunday. Attempted to use ligation product from Sunday to transform another batch of cells, because of sudden fear that our electrocompetent cells may not be good. Not enough ligated product remains to attempt this.

Ashlee and Emily prepared tubes of primers and four purified digestion products to send for sequencing.  They continued their work on the website and tried to find more html help for certain aspects.
Goal of the day is to transform some more cells, and use different ratio of insert to backbone during ligation in hopes of getting colonies to grow. Attempted to re-ligate digested GFPs and pFTV but not enough remains from Sunday to attempt this. Calculations ran for re-doing digestions and ligation. Digestions completed. RBS calculations from 6/26 analyzed, found that even using no initial condition (only N's followed by Pst1), sufficiently high TIR can be discovered.

Another example from the northern part of Ghana was that most men would rather sell a chicken instead of eating it with the intention of buying alcohol.
Prof. Armah refered to the problems considering malnourishment as localized. Cultural and educational practices where mentioned as issues in relation to the application of GMOs. According to Prof. Armah the  rural areas of Ghana did not take interest in synthetic biology due to the lack of education. Objections to the use of synthetic biology were not linked to religion or culture according  to Prof. Armah. Thereby GMOs might not be rejected based on religious and social reasons, but on the fact that the population might not embrace a foreign initiative.

On the 8th of September a commercial about our project aired on the website and Facebook page of the University of Southern Denmark. We made this commercial in collaboration with the communications department of the University of Southern Denmark, specifically a producer named Anders Boe. It was seen 27,526 times, which is equivalent to 16% of our hometowns population. The click-through rate was around 10%, which is much greater than the average rate of videos on their Facebook page. The commercial led to random people, including doctors on the hospital of Odense, asking team members about the project and about GMO in general. With all this in mind it seems fair to state that the commercial was a smash hit of our human outreach and our engagement in the social media. In combination with our easily recognisable logo and our human outreach initiatives, we have been using our social media as a platform to show interest in synthetic biology and for sharing our work.
After seeing the commercial a local newspaper reached out to us to bring an interview in their Saturday special Newspaper article from Fyens.dk (Danish) . In collaboration with the student media RUST and Beton TV we have been featured in their magazine and a video of our attendance in Boston will be shown on their Facebook page briefly after our return. This is done to ensure an awareness of the iGEM competition among the students on the University of Southern Denmark. We hope this will inspire a lot of students to apply for the iGEM team next year, since it is a hallmark of the SDU-Denmark team to be interdisciplinary.
The effort put into our social media strategy and our goal of following it has paid off. Social media has shaped our outreach and made it possible for us to talk about iGEM and our project to people we did not know. Several times our outreach has led us to public discussion of GMO and solar panels due to persons contacting us, wanting to know more.

High school students during the streaking workshop
Workshops
We organized four different activities in the lab:
Streaking colorful bacteria on agar plates
Learning how to streak bacteria on agar plates by drawing something with bacteria (E. coli) expressing Calgary’s chromoproteins. Each student had a plate (chloramphenicol resistant), a choice of 5 colors (more than one could be used on the same plate), and their endless supply of imagination.
Loading agarose gels for electrophoresis of various DNA fragments
Learning what is an agarose gel, its composition, how fragments migrate with the current, how we can predict the size of a fragment with the gel and examples of moments when electrophoresis is really important for us. And finally each student loaded a gel with different DNA samples in order to observe how it migrates.
Microfluidic workshop
The students were able to learn more about the basic principles of microfluidics and why it is such a useful tool in synthetic biology. A quick look at the standard dimensions of common biological objects first allowed them to see that a microfluidic chip is perfectly sized to host bacteria and yeasts, which are the 2 types of microorganisms used in our project. The advantages of microfluidics over classical analytical methods were then discussed such as the low amount of reagents required and the high spatio-temporal resolution that allows very precise analyses. Before learning more precisely how the MITOMI chip works, they also got a quick introduction on the fabrication process of microfluidic chips and were shown masks and wafers. The presentation ended with a small demonstration of the loading of a chip using a green dye to show the size of the channels.
Signal detection and processing
Introducing the Raspberry Pi, a cheap and mini computer, demo of how it works and examples of projects made with it. We then explained the need of taking infrared images and the problem that arises from doing that (mainly the need to excite the IFP with the correct wavelength). We then did a brief introduction to programming and the new role it's taking into education, to illustrate it we did a demo of visual programming and explained how it is used to introduce children to programming languages in a fun way.

Safety Questions
According to the WHO biosafety is the prevention of unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, whereas biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins.
Key Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety?.
Our system primary goal is hydrogen production. This gas is known to support deflagration (combustion at a subsonic velocity) when its concentration in air ranges between 4% and 70% (1), and several cases of spontaneous ignition have been reported (2). For the iGEM competition, our work will be focused solely on small containers with our bacteria (petri dishes and flasks with a capacity smaller than one liter). These containers pose a low combustion risk. However they will be handled with care, avoiding direct exposure to ignition sources.
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of public safety?.
Yes. Our project includes the development of broad host-range plasmids, which include antibiotic resistances (e.g. gentamicin). However these plasmids are intended for use only in laboratories, under controlled conditions. This ensures that resistances won’t be horizontally transferred"

Fig.4 Highly specific recognition and covalent conjugation with Spychatcher and Spytag.
We used this feature of Spytag and Spycatcher to design a handy tool for protein purification. In the magnetic bacterium AMB-1, Spycatcher-Mms13 fusion protein is expressed and the Mms13 part can tightly associate with the Magnetosome. As a result, the Spycatcher in the fusion protein is anchored in the Magnetosome, which can be isolated from AMB-1 bacterial through sonication and centrifugation. Due to fast growing and easy genetic engineering of E. coli we utilize it to produce recombinant proteins of interest with a Spytag at either the N- or C- terminus. To easily release a captured recombinant protein, we add a cleaving site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease between the protein of interest and Spytag. Now the isolated magnetosome linked by Spycatcher can be used to specifically bind to the Spytag tagged recombinant protein in bacterial lysate of E. coli. After Spytag and Spycatcher form an irreversible covalent bond via spontaneous isopeptide linkage, they can be brought down together with the Magnetosome in a magnetic field. Extensive and stringent washing can be applied to remove proteins of nonspecific binding and the protein of interest can be released by cleavage of TEV protease.
Fig.5 Steps to purify protein in a new way
One caveat in the design above is that the TEV protease is still present in the final elution of the recombinant protein. The following two strategies can be used to circumvent this problem.
First, in the design shown above, we can express a TEV protease-Mms13 fusion protein in AMB-1; thus, the TEV protease can be easily removed after it fulfills its task. Second, we can use a self-cleavable sequence, intein, to replace the TEV site. In this case, the recombinant protein can be released by DTT(DL-Dithiothreitol)-mediated cleavage.

Furthermore, the phosphorylated cellulose dissolved in phosphate buffer, while cellulose was insoluble. Moreover, the cellulase activity assay showed the highest activity for the phosphorylated cellulose, expected to be due to solubility. As a negative control cellulose was chosen, which showed significant less activity.

Outlook
An ambitious system we want to design for security is an artificial black box which people should work with by keys. The general idea to get the information from a working system is extracting the plasmid from the bacteria and sequencing the working parts. In this way, there will be less security. The bacteria will be a white box for everyone who gets it. Here the black boxes are necessary for the proteins or plasmids that may be harmful. So we are trying to design a bacteria that not easy to work and be extracted and sequenced.
Ligand control working system
The first step, the controllable lysis system are introduced in the bacteria. And an operator system is employed as a switch to the lysis system. The lysis system will start without the ligand. A large library of specific interacting protein-ligand pairs with one template operator system can be built with computational design and directed evolution. In this way, only the owners of the bacteria know what the key is. So the bacteria itself will not grow and work, and at the same time the information of DNA is also destroyed by the lysis system. Our software can give a regulatory network to make the operator system stably open and close the lysis system.
Engineered codon system
The second step, the plasmid is restricted to work in the specific bacteria only, as it is hard to block the process of plasmid extraction and transform. A library of tRNA synthetases is necessary to change the translating processes to make the plasmid can not work in other bacteria. In this way, it is necessary to construct a platform to select tRNA synthetases mutation. A cell-free system is necessary, as the mutation may lead to the chaos of whole cell. And a time-dependent protein expression system can be designed by our software. And the plasmid can only working in a ligand-controlled specific cell environment.
In this way, we can construct a new platform to protect some harmful or potential harmful genes or systems.

Wednesday, July 2, 2014
Ashlee worked remotely on the website and is awaiting sequencing results. Plasmids with all four junctions correct (ColE1, KanR, Overlap 1, and Overlap 2) will be used to re-attempt the insertion of dCas9.
Colonies observed on plates with G1 and G4 transformed cells. More plates made, more centrifuge tubes autoclaved. Rescue PCR ran to increase stocks of gblocks. Unfortunately, very faint bands are noticed. Decision to lower annealing temperature next time to increase output. Salis lab manual updated with protocol for making antibiotic plates. Six colonies from each plate of cells that grew used to inoculate a culture.
Thursday, July 3, 2014
Ashlee updated the Notebook and Project pages. She added shortcuts to the Notebook page to make it more user-friendly. She is also constructing more figures to display the design process and ""Plasmid 1"", ""Plasmid 2"", and ""Plasmid 3"" constructs.
Realized mistake of adding six individual colonies to the same culture. Never, ever do that again. That was really stupid. Inoculated six individual cultures with one colony each, as it should have been done the first time.Prepared more electrocompetent cells. Plasmid prepped the 12 tubes (six each of GFP1 and GFP4, the cells that grew from transformation on 7/1. Streaked plates with media from the 12 cultures.

Michigan,2011,Team:Michigan#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," when purifying digests, and this must be tested-especially since a J04500, a 220bp segment, is pushing the 200bp limit of the kit.
∴Increased resolution of the undigested component of pSB1K3 would be useful.
J04500 and J04450 refer to the inserts, not the part itself. The important component of J04450 is the plasmid, pSB1K3. This is a typo on the drawing. While the bands representing J04500's plasmid pSB1K3 (~2200bp) do possess an uncut component, it appears very small. The worrying line corresponds to the insert around 200-300bp (J04500.) While this is likely the correct length when the prefixes and suffixes for assembly sandards are taken into account, the band itself is very faint; obviously, a large amount was lost in the purification process. As only 20µL or so of this sample remain, it remains to be seen if this amount is enough for use in a ligation.
Two significant amendments were made to the gel protocol this time:
∴As the DNA ladder solution is EXTREMELY concentrated, which is part of the reason for the terrible, splotchy bands in the previous gel. It was diluted down 20-fold to a concentration of 50ng/µL. This stock is very functional and resides in the freezer.
∴An 8-tooth comb was used, as it seems to produce more precise and easy to measure bands. This should be used as standard unless many samples are used.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

Warsaw,2010,Team:Warsaw#galTest_-_-_TEXT.html," I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Justyna Lesiak I am a student of Master Degree in Molecular Biology at the Univeristy of Warsaw, but I spent last semester at Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. Now I am working in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology and in the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. I am not focused on one topic, and I always wanted to do lots of new and challenging things in the science area, however I must admit cancer researches are one of my very favourites, as well as human mitochondrial diseases. In my spare time I like to listen to classical and chamber music, read books, do irish dancing (I admire reels and hornpipes) and horseback riding.
Milena Bazlekowa Hi everyone ! My name is Milena and I study biotechnology at Warsaw University. Actually, I'm on my way to get a Bachelor's degree in molecular biology. I am very interested in application of biotechnology in medicine. I work on a project held by Department of Virology which investigates interactions between viruses and bacterias. My research is focused on comparison E.coli's and N. gonorrhoeae's VSR (very short patch repair) of DNA after bacteriophage's attack. I'm also a member of Students' Society of Genetics and Epigenetics. Actually, I'm on an internship at University of California in San Diego where I work on neural plasticity and nerve growth factors which can be used in a gene therapy concerning spinal cord injury repair. Apart from cloning, I love computer graphics, art and Mexican cuisine :). I like drawing, taking photographs and travelling.

in vitro transcription measurement of T7 terminator with no signal(upper left), nonsense signal (upper right) and two different designed signals (below)
in vitro transcription measurement of positive control(upper left and T7 terminator with three different designed signals (remaining traces)
Furthermore denaturing Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) confirmed that there was no observeable termination of transcription. The addition of a signaling sequence led to a significantly lower increase in fluorescence, which can be attributed to the fact that both DNA sequences, switch and signal, compete for RNA Polymerases. However, there is almost no difference between the designed signals and random sequences, which is not a big surprise since there can be no antitermination if the terminator itself does not work.
Possible explanations for the contradiction between our results and those of Kang and coworkers might be the experimental set-up and the RNA Polymerases we used. Different variants of T7 RNA Polymerase might respond in different ways to terminator structures, and the termination might be influenced by the presence or absence of cofactors, depending on the purification methods used in producing the Polymerase.
This set-up offers a lot of possible experiments for the future, which we would have loved to conduct with a just a bit more time...
E.coli System
Compared to the T7 System, the E. coli RPO system produced poor increases in fluorescence, indicating little RNA synthesis. It was shown that the presence of a terminator decreases, as expected, the production of downstream RNA.

in vitro transcription measurement of positive control (left), Switch TrpTerm (center) and switch HisTerm(right)
This result was also confirmed by denaturing PAGE. However, due to the poor changes in fluorescence we were not able to actually characterize the behaviour of our switches in vitro, and the small RNA concentrations did not allow a quantitative interpretation of our gels.

Modeling Bacteria
Let´s get a closer look to the modeling of our Bacteria constructions.
Are you hungry?
The first model we did addressed our glucose-sensitive construction. We carried out three different experiments changing the carbon source, to see its influence.  First we used glucose (1) as the only carbon source. Then we added galactose (2) as an extra carbon source. Finally we put sodium acetate (3) as an extra carbon source instead of galactose. The use of alternatives to glucose is explained because  in previous tests we observed that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth. With the experimental data we fitted the following repressible Hill-like function.
And we estimated the following parameters for the 3 different conditions.
In figures 1, 2 and 3 we plot the models and experimental data for the three experiments with glucose (1), added galactose (2) and added sodium acetate (3) respectively. IPTG was added to all the experiments to induce expression.
Figure 1.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations.
Figure 2.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Galactose added to the medium.
Figure 3.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Sodium Acetatee added to the medium.
It is interesting to notice how the Hill coefficient increases  when adding Galatose and Acetate. From here we can hypothesize that having another source of carbon  makes the promoter more sensitive to changes in the glucose concentration, as the slope of the Hill function gets larger. Also the constant K decreases, which tell us that less glucose is necessary to de-activate the promoter when there is another carbon source.
Compare this results with Are you hungry? results .
Are you hot?
When analyzing the Heat Shock promoter, we decided to model the static transfer function of the Fluorescent Intensity as a result of the Temperature following the Hill-like equation:
In order to estimate the parameters of this model we performed a heat shock experiment.
Our first analysis corresponds to a heat shock applied during 10 minutes at different temperatures, ranging from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density (OD) were measured at t1=60 min and t2=120 min after the application of the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and"
SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," including two parts:""Spreading scientific knowledge to countrysides"" and ""Giving courses for high school students"".
6.1 Spread scientific knowledge to countrysides
Social justice is an important question that we are concerning about. As we all known, China is a developing country and those people in countrysides can hardly get as much information and knowledge as those in cities. So after we did the education work in several high schools in Guangzhou, we decided to do the best we can to spread our knowledge to farmers and students in countrysides. We had sent our educational handbooks to farmers and schools in countrysides such as Qingyuan, Shaoguan, Maoming and Zhaoqing, which are located in Guangdong Province.
The first thing we've done is sending handbooks about modern agriculture to farmers in these remote places. The handbook contains a lot of information about modern methods of cultivating the local specialty crops, including protocol of cultivating watermelon and pitaya fruit in modern way. It's possible that we can help some people in countrysides who is eager to get more information on agriculture, and they might generally accept modern agriculture or even genetically modified crops.
Now that we need to use our knowledge to help people in countrysides, we think we'd better offer lessons for next generation, so our teammates have joined teams who are going to give courses in primary schools in countrysides and mainly worked in sending basic and interesting biology lessons. Those kids are very fond of us and maybe our lessons will actually influence their life and utilize the new knowledge to change their fate.
6.2 Giving courses for high school students
We also gave courses for high school students from Guangzhou NO.47 Middle School, Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School. Our courses mainly focus on the advance research in biology these years, especially in synthentic biology. We've also introduced iGEM to them and showed them how to take part in iGEM as a high school student. After that, we also built up a good relationship with a high school group from Guangdong experimental High School and Guangdong Guangya High School.
According to the feedback from our students, they have a better understanding of biology after our lessons. It's quite a good experience to communicate with middle school students and to teach them what we've obtained in taking iGEM competition and doing biological research.

Collaborating  with other iGEM teams is an essential part of the iGEM process, and also lots of fun! Check our different collaborations down here:
Brazilian iGEM WhatsApp Network :
After organizing the Brazilian Meet-Up, Jamboré Brasuca , a group in the application WhatsApp was formed together with members of 6 different synthetic biology “hubs” in Brazil, with teams UNESP-Araraquara and team Amazonas_Brazil . Moreover, the hubs of UFMG, USP-EEL and Esalq/iGEM, and Guilherme Kundlatsch, iGEM “ambassador” in Brazil  are also actively participating. On top of this, people from nascent synthetic biology hubs are always being added. It is really exciting to see the community growing strong!
The group has been used for sharing and solving issues from the bench to hotel reservations in Boston, deadline reminders and sharing surveys. And, of course, sharing ""memes"" and other iGEM related puns, to make the intense lab work more fun. It was great to have this direct channel of communications uniting teams as far as 2600 km (!) from each other, but still inside Brazil.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#publicengagement_-_-_TEXT.html," House (2017, April 22):
Open house is an annual event in IIT Delhi that is being conducted for the past 13 consecutive years, it aims to provide an insight into path-breaking research work and student projects in IIT Delhi. This year it was conducted on 22nd April. ‘iGEM IIT Delhi’ has been participating since the past four years and this time it was a real treat to the eyes of the connoisseurs. We presented our project to technology enthusiasts, students and colleagues from other technical Institutes, school children, industries and the general public. We also introduced them to synthetic biology and iGEM. It was a great motivation and encouragement to the students,  colleagues, and school students to develop a greater interest in the field of Synthetic Biology. Especially school students were excited to participate in iGEM as a ‘High School’ team from India.
Tour of stalls:(2017, July 21-22):
Tour of Stalls is IIT Delhi’s annual club orientation, which has an annual footfall of nearly 1000 students. This orientation was attended by the first year students and high school students. We ensured proper exposure of first-year students to synthetic biology and its multi-disciplinary aspects by setting up a stall at the Tour of Stalls. The students were also shown the team video, which excited them for joining the club.
Ethical Scientific Practices and mentoring IISER Mohali iGEM team (2016-2017):
A Ph.D. student, Mr. Mahendra Sahare, doing a humanities project under a Supreme Court lawyer, Dr. Naveen Thayyil, has been in collaboration with iGEM IIT Delhi for the past two years. Together, we have worked on the aspect of ‘Ethical Scientific Practices’. Also, on his recent visit to IISER Mohali, he came back with a collaborative offer for iGEM IIT Delhi to mentor IISER Mohali and help in the establishment of iGEM club there. On our return from the Giant Jamboree 2016, our team members gave a presentation scheduled there, initiated their team and thereafter our team mentored the iGEM Mohali team.

We have to admit that Biopano may show you wrong gene route. However, it provides you with direction of studying the relationship of two fields. It not only makes your goal for experiment designing clearer, but enables you to understand the connection inside body is so close as well.
While offering function services, Biopano serves as a platform for collaborative network building. You can define new nodes and arcs yourself and sign in with your Google or Baidu account to upload the network you build to our database. You can also invite several companions to complete a project together. Common biological software, such as Cytoscape and Netscience, doesn’t provide a good platform for communication, while Biopano enhances the communication of biological areas by data sharing.
Biopano, your right hand for biological research. Get it now!
Future Work
It is undeniable that we still have a lot to do to improve Biopano in many aspects in order to make it even better. We need to think more and develop it as we can. In the future, we hope to:
1. Integrate more data in it. Currently, Biopano only integrates data of E.coli k-12 from Regulon DB, KEGG and Uniprot, and our data in regulatory interaction lack accurate numerical data to indicate its strength. etc. Therefore, not only will we update the existing data in the original species, we will also make complement of high-throughput data through other databases and papers, as well as expand information of other species, so that more biological researchers can benefit from our software.
2. Normalize users' rights, improve quality of data. With the increase of the number of users, the data synchronized every day become not only massive, but also in many different forms, and some of them have nevitable errors or redundant information, or there may be different kinds of comprehension of certain regulatory relations. So we want the machine to automatically recognize the validity of the data submitted by the user, and establish a evaluation criteria of credibility. Thus, only those reliable users will be selected, and only their data can be synchronized to the main database, and the redundancy or errors will be eliminated, and they also continue to enhance the credibility and value of the main database.
3. Enhance network analysis functions. When we add the high-throughput kinetic data for biological networks, we can build a variety of mathematical models on the network and carry out quantitative simulation analysis. For example, we can put the nodes that are closely related to one another together in a group"

Berlin,2014,Team:Berlin#Project cn_-_-_TEXT.html,", it should be possible to use high frequent oscillating magnetic fields for cell lysis or even use rotating magnetic fields for self-stirring cultures in bioreactors solving scale up limiting issues like tip speed.           Nature is the world’s most skilled engineer and has naturally occurring magnetotactic bacteria such as Magnetospirrilium magneticum. Under certain conditions, these organisms form magnetosomes, which are chains of magnetite nanoparticles. These function as an intracellular compass for the cell and even allow them to orientate along earth’s weak magnetic field.           As previous iGEM teams have shown, synthesizing fully functional magnetosomes in E. coli is highly difficult as more than 60 highly regulated genes are involved[4]. The Berlin iGEM team came up with an alternative strategy that does not rely on the formation of magnetosomes.           By knocking out the iron efflux transporter gene FieF and the iron uptake suppressor Fur, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. In order to create ferromagnetic crystals, we will use intensive high-throughput growth medium optimization to discover the best conditions for the formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli.            We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to achieve nanoparticle synthesis. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used by any research lab or iGEM team in the world in order to remote control the cellular movement.
Involving the Community
Although there are several scientific institutions located in Berlin which are conducting research in synthetic biology, there has never been an iGEM team from Berlin before. This is even more surprising as Berlin with its vibrant bio-arts and diy-biology community seems to be the perfect location for successful iGEM projects.           As an interconnected workforce, our team incorporates members from various scientific, cultural and creative backgrounds, which makes our team able to address complex issues from various persepctives. So far, iGEM Berlin consists of students from biotechnology, history, design, medicine, theoretical physics, informatics, and more.            So far our diverse team has been able to make valuable connections into the bio-arts scene of Berlin, working together with think tanks such as the Hybrid Plattform, as well as EU advisor Markus Schmidt and his Biofaction AG. Supported by the Hybrid Plattform, we organized a"

The effect of this procedure depends on the citizens' awareness of water resource protection and government policy popularization should be the key point in the whole procedure. By public media propagation, we can let citizens familiar with the way to save water. The modern scientific treatment method of waste water, for example, our rotation bioreactor of waste water treatment, we believe that this is the only way to make everyone in our society to be involved in the protection to our living environment.
Part 3：Interviewing a VP in bioethics
On 10th Oct ,Our research team interviewed a professor of bioethics ethics teacher Ruipeng Lei who has served as a researcher of bioethics project for many years and has rich experience on the issue of security of synthetic biology projects, and she gave opinions in some aspects about the safety issues of pilot project. The following is an interview with professor Lei.
Synthesizing a new engineering bacteria by synthetic means which can not be produced in the natural environment, as a means of protection to the environment, is a very useful attempt, but in such a study, the safety issue is a very big concern. For this project, first you need a clear understanding of the physical and chemical properties of engineered bacteria, in the early study,we may be concerned more about this project to develop bacteria to reach a certain function, such as the degradation of fluoride and copper, etc. But when we are ready to put this experiment into use in real industrial environment, we can not just consider a functional engineering bacteria, but also consider whether the engineered bacteria in  water will cause new pollution. These should be considered in experimental stage, otherwise operational impact on the environment will be irreversible.
First, the security issue can not be speculated which must have solid evidence. We need to have a complete evidence to prove such engineering bacteria is non-toxic for scientific research must be evidence based. Recent years, in the field of bioethics, it has a great change,for strategic technology assessment, including safety assessment. In the past it is a presumption of innocence strategy, that means in previous studies as long as there is no conclusive evidence of its harmness it can be put into the environment, and the effects are irreversible. But now we turned to the presumption of guilty strategy. There must be conclusive evidence that the object of their study is safe, which requires the experimental session should be fully considered the impact on the environment. Thus this approach can ensure more reliability and safety research.

Human Practices
Tuebingen provides a unique platform for discussion and research in Synthetic Biology.
Tuebingen is a town with one of the oldest and most renowned universities in Germany and worldwide. With every third inhabitant being a student, Tuebingen provides an excellent basis for research in science. At the same time, Tuebingen is a hub of the ecological movement in Germany, raising critical thoughts and opinions about specific fields of research, especially about synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and animal experiments.
We participated in Human Practice projects allover Tuebingen, Germany, and Europe.
We, the iGEM Team Tuebingen, try to counteract these tendencies and improve the communication between the scientific world and the public. To accomplish this, we organized and attended multiple events. Starting off with the Science Slam in Constance and the “Summer and Science” symposium of the jGBM in Marburg and the Symposium of Molecular Medicine in Tuebingen . These events gave us the opportunity to present our project to a student community in the life sciences. Therefore, it was also possible to get useful input for the realization of our project while getting a broad view on our project from multiple standpoints. In addition, we got valuable feedback from other iGEM teams and participants. Two of the events we attended, the iGEM Meetup Germany in Marburg and the “European Experience 2016” in Paris , gave us the opportunity to get feedback and new ideas about our project from experienced iGEM teams.
Human Practices do not only work outside of lab but also include in this year an integrated approach. We invited a high school student, with interest in natural sciences to join us with our work in wet lab for a two-week internship . This approach combines the effort to support the interest and curiousness of a high school student with the opportunity to educate him in synthetic biology. At the same time, our team gained profit from this cooperation by being challenged with the task of explaining our work and answering some fundamental questions, which gave us a new perspective on our project.

However, sometimes the results are surprisingly different and we have to face up to new challenges, what is equally exciting. I'm convinced that participating in iGEM will allow me to realize my dreams.
Attributions: I was involved in “open reading frame project”. To check the importance of codon optimization in protein production I designed different variants of fluorescent proteins and measured the fluorescence during 6h culture in three different media. I was also responsible for creating and organizing workshops for students. Thanks to those workshops we have spread synthetic biology among over 230 high school students!

About me: For me iGEM competition is a great chance to learn something new and meet fantastic people with passion. It gave me a great opportunity to develop and improve my skills. Synthetic biology is an excellent way to create something new which will be useful for other scientists. Achieving pre-peeled goals gives me a lot of satisfaction.
Attributions: My main tasks in our UAM_Poznan team were optimization of open reading frame project and creation of our wiki. I created different versions of two fluorescent proteins and after obtaining them, I was involved in 6 hours measurements to check how they are expressed in E. coli. Second most important challenge was to create our wiki – hope you enjoy it ;)

Biosafety
Biosafety deals with the prevention of unintented exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release [ WHO ].
Figure 1: The three main parts of our safety system
Biosafety to us means minimizing the risks concering the team working in the lab, the general public and the environment. Physcomitrella itself does not pose any risks to the health of the researcher or the general public, since it is endemic to many parts of the world. In the lab, we are able to cultivate our moss in bioreactors in which the flow of substances is tightly controlled.  They can even be used for the production of therapeutic proteins, as done by the greenovation company. For usage in a sewage plant, such reactors could be upscaled and special filter systems could be applied to ensure that no moss can escape into the environment. However, our long-term goal is to use moss filters in polluted environments but at the same time ensuring the highest level of biological safety.
We believe that the main biosafety-issues that have to be addressed regarding our project are
toxicity of recombinant proteins
toxicity of degradation products
transgene pollution (vertical and horizontal gene transfer)
In order to minimize the aforementioned risks, we have taken several  measures, including a light-triggered killswitch, non-sporulating Physcomitrella strains and the evaluation of the genetic parts that we are using in terms of safety.
Toxicity of recombinant proteins
The most obvious safety threat is that the recombinant proteins might be toxic and thus have a negative effect on the environment. This is the foundation of our safety consideration - that the products from all parts and genetic circuits must not cause harm by themselves. All our eff"

The alternative modelling is done to further prove that the TAR-binding kinetics toward ligands will also follow the mass-transfer principle. The polynomial regression is used since it give the biggest R2 (smallest deviation)
Auto-phosphorylation of CheA

This graph also closely follow the Langmuir Hill principle, even though the formula linearization and conception is not as simple as the aforementioned process, since autophosphorylation process has more elaborate steps, which is:
The process above has more elaborate formulation of model in which the final model will roughly constitute of this equation:
x = time
x = initial time
K = total constant of reactions
When one sees the formula, it can be roughly estimated to form a similar ln graph with similar shapes to the Langmuir-Hill approximation too, therefore the final and simplified model of the autophosphorylation process will be fitted to modified Langmuir-Hill equation by trial and error and iteration to achieve the highest R2.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM"

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," be used outside the lab, in beehives, which is in close contact with nature. To get a better idea of the viability of our idea, and what it is like to request permission to use an engineered microorganism outside of the lab, we looked at the questions that are asked in such a request (link to website of RIVM) and discuss some that peaked our interest in the movie. Some interesting questions we had not thought about, such as “how can a genetically modified microorganism be recognized among natural relatives?”. Another interesting aspect of the application of synthetic biology is responsibility: if our engineered bacterium would be commercialized, who would be responsible for any adverse effects? In our opinion, scientists are responsible for thoroughly and objectively investigating and reporting possible risks. Companies in turn should monitor whether the technology is sufficiently researched. Companies should also make sure that user manuals are correct and clear to understand, even to people with little experience with comparable technology. Users of the product, the beekeepers in our case, are responsible for using the product in the intended way only and following the user manual provided with the product.  Our movie ends with some open questions regarding safe by design, both in general and within our project. Examples are “what should be done to actually realize the insights that are gained by safe by design?” and “should there be more focus on the positive aspects of using a genetically modified microorganism when judging a permission request?”. We don’t know the answer to these questions, but think they are important nevertheless.

The movie we made in collaboration with the RIVM.
September 20th - RIVM meeting
Concluding our collaboration with the RIVM, some members of our team, as well as the other Dutch iGEM teams attended a meeting organized by the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “making safe progress in synthetic biology”. During this meeting, researchers, policymakers and policy advisors brainstormed, discussed and presented their ideas about how synthetic biology should be handled in the future. We gave a short presentation about the topic of our project and how we integrated “safe by design” through toxin specificity, controlled expression of the toxin and confinement of our product to the beehive. During a short information market, we got to talk more in depth with people who were interested, presented the movie we made for the RIVM and the Resource from the future that was made in collaboration with Synenergene.

We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

Cooperation with industry
Interview with Sunfire CTO Christian von Olshausen
Sunfire
The sunfire company was one of the reasons to go for our project. We first met them at the researchcenter in Jülich, where they convinced us with their efficient technical conversion of CO2 and water to Methanol and other fuels. With such an efficienty, area independend way to get a sustainable, high energy chemical, it was a natural decision to find a way to integrate it into the bioeconomy.

Cargill
Early in the project we visited a production plant of Cargill. They process around 2.000 tonnes of maize each day. There main products are starch, sugar and a prestep of vitamin C. We got an excellent impression of the current starch industry in europe and globally, inkluding resources, prices, products and customers. Though they were interested in our project, they didn't want to sponsor us because of the difficult reputation of genetic engineering especially in the food industry. However, they helped us with all our questions regarding the starch industry throughout the project.

Located in Aachen, there is a Life Sciences network called MedLife. Resulting from the fusion of a biotechnological and a biomedical network, the represent several memebers from the industry and universal research. Together with several partners they especially support Start ups but also global player like Bayer or Philips. We started to collaborate with them to get contact to possible sponsors, but soon recognized the immense greater potential. With their support, we could not only find new applications for our product, but also found a great way to connect community labs with other partners in the Life Science. They even invited us to their smmer event, where we met a lot of interesting people and partner for the future.

KU_Leuven,2015,Team:KU Leuven#Modeling#Hybrid_-_-_TEXT.html," y$     the distances between grid points in the x and y-direction     respectively, and $D$ the diffusion coefficient, the     condition for stability is given by (27).
$$     D \cdot \Bigg( \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y^2} \Bigg) \leq \frac{1}{2}     \;\;\; \text{(27)}     $$
When computing the solution of the hybrid model this     requirement forces us to spend a lot of CPU time solving     partial differential equations that could be better spent     simulation the agents. Therefore an implicit      alternating direction implicit (ADI) scheme was implemented.     ADI schemes are unconditionally stable, which     allows us to take large time steps with the PDE solver.     The difference from a      To derive the scheme we first reiterate the partial differential     equation (4).
$$ \frac{\partial C(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}=D \cdot     \nabla^2 C(\vec{r},t)+\alpha \cdot \rho_A(\vec{r},t)-k\cdot     C(\vec{r},t) \;\;\; \text{(4)} $$
We could use a fully implicit scheme by taking the field     values on the right-hand side at $t+\Delta t$, but there is no way to     reshape the resulting matrix to take on a banded form and hence     no efficient solver is applicable to compute the field values     at the next timestep.      The trick used in ADI is then to divide the timestep $\Delta t$ in     two half timesteps and take only one dimension implicitly at a time,     and leave the other dimension in its explicit form. In the subsequent     half timestep, the dimensions are switched (hence alternating).     For example, if we take $x$ implicitly in the first half, we obtain     (28a).
$$ \frac{C^{n+1/2}-C^{n}}{1/2 \cdot \Delta t}=D \cdot     \Bigg( \frac{\delta^2_x C^{n+1/2}}{\Delta x^2}     +\frac{\delta^2_y C^{n}}{\Delta y^2} \Bigg)     +\alpha \cdot \rho_A^{\bar{n}}     -k\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \big(C^{n+1/2}+C^n \big"

For this reason we designed FW primers (J23103_K_FW and J23110/117_K_FW and T7_K_FW) for our colony PCR, which can just bind, if the new promoter sequence is included in the plasmid. Until all colonies from the promoter J23110 ligation were red, we had some white colonies for the pT7 promoter in pSB1C3 backbone. So we picked a positive colony and plated it for plasmid isolation.
We plated colonies on new plates, which weren't red from the transformation of pSB1C3 + pT7. We can't do colony PCR on this plasmids, because the resulting parts would be smaller than 100 bps.

The data demonstrates that after treatment with French Press and ultrasound (sonification) the number of spores compared to the untreated samples were increased. We assume this to be an experimental artifact, since it was not always possible to distinguish between mature spores and cell debris during counting. However, a huge difference between the number of vegetative cells and spores was observed for lysozyme-treated samples as visualized in the pictures below (Fig. 1). Because the lysed vegetative cells, it was easy to recognize the mature spores.

Next, we tested the fluorescence of Sporobeads after lysozyme treatment. This analysis revealed that lysozyme did not harm the gfp-fusion proteins, since fluorescence was not altered (see Fig. 2).

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," knocked out in Arabidopsis thaliana the plant loses its ability to sequestrate sodium and thus is more sensitive to salt stress [35].
Fig.7:The Arabidopsis thaliana proton sodium antiporter is integrated into the vacuolar membrane of S.cerevisiae in addition to the alteration in the native system of the organism.
Overexpression of AtNHX1 led to an increased vacuolar Na+/H+ transport rate that was higher than the relative increase in AtNHX1 protein abundance and increased accumulation of sodium in       the vacuole of Arabidopsis thaliana. Through that, the salt tolerance was increased, confirming AtNHX1 plays an important role in salt stress response [28,29,36]. We decided to use this channel       and integrate it into the vacuolar membrane of S.cerevisiae. But while overexpression of AtNHX1 increased its Na+/H+ transport rate, the still relatively low Vmax of this transporter is limiting       the application in terms of fast hyperaccumulation of sodium in the vacuole [30].
Through DNA shuffling, it was possible to generate a mutated channel - called AtNHXS1 - that showed an about two-fold increased Na+/H+ Vmax while the K+/H+ exchange activity was not       significantly altered when compared to the native form of AtNHX1. The channel is still localized in the vacuolar membrane but the plant cell accumulated more sodium than the native       strain with AtNHX1 [30]. AtNHXS1 consists only of 4 transmembrane helices, the C-terminus and the 5 nearest transmembrane helices of AtNHX1 where deleted, resulting in the increase in Na+/K+        selectivity ratio described previously [30].
AtNHXS1 also shows two mutations (L29P and S158P) in its amino acid sequence that might be responsible for the increased sodium transport activity and thus enable increased sodium       sequestration in the vacuole (Figure 8) [30].

Best New Application
As our project title “Finding Flavi” implies, we assume that our Dengue-specific detection system and prediction model can be applied to other flaviviruses. In our detection system, since we use fluorescence protein which can be substituted for any other color more viruses can be identified by matching it with different colors. This system is high-throughput, cost-efficient, highly sensitive and has the potential to be widely used in the market.
Our prediction model works robustly and the accuracy increases in proportion to the amount of input timescale data. We successfully predicted the change in the number of patients in a specific area and also corrected the gap between actual data and predicted data with environmental factors.

DTU-Denmark,2015,Team:DTU-Denmark#Project#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," while the rest of the barcodes can be designed for amplification with a specific primer. By using different barcodes, it is possible to design one oligo chip for multiple MAGE experiments. The thymidine allows amplification with an uracil-containing primer. In these primers U is substituted for T in the primer. The barcode can then be excised from the oligo using USER enzyme, DnpII, and a guide primer[25]. Despite the low cost of this method, it comes at a price: Oligos are delivered as a single mix of all the oligos and they are each in the picomolar range. This requires extra processing and amplification steps before the oligos can be used in a large-scale MAGE experiment.
Figure 5. Schematic represenation of MO-MAGE Oligo Processing.
Oligo design
While the recombination frequency of MAGE can be increased by doing multiple cycles, care should be taken when designing oligos to ensure high efficiency for each individual cycle, see Figure 5. There are several parameters that can be optimized to increase the recombination frequency: The oligos should target the lagging strand of the replication fork, as this improves efficiencies by 10-100 fold. In addition, the folding energy of the oligo should be considered, as it may form hairpins if it is too low, preventing incorporation. The frequency is also dependent on the length of the oligo, as shorter oligos are less efficient due to their lower hybridization energy to the chromosome, while longer oligos have a higher tendency to form hairpins. 70-90-mer oligos seem to be the most efficient in E. coli [22].
Designing many optimized oligos for MAGE experiments is a time consuming task. Considering a 90-mer oligo with a single mismatch and 15nt homology arms results in 60 possible oligos all with different secondary structures and consequently different recombineering efficiencies. Much of the time spent on designing oligos can be saved by using tools such as MODEST  [27].
Oligo mediates recombineering
The described λ Red recombineering system has been exploited in E. coli over the last few years, but the technology has not been adopted for genome editing to the same extent in other microorganisms. Application of λ Red recombineering systems has been described in Bacillus subtilis [28] Instead of 90-mer oligos, long single stranded DNA fragments of approximately 2,"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," of increasing red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression correlated with the strength of the promoter, as seen on Figure 2.
Figure 2. Cultures of E. coli TOP10. From left to right: WT, the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , the two medium promoters, BBa_J23110 , and BBa_J23106 , and the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 .
On the basis of the data obtained by fluorescence microscopy, the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23102 , was chosen to control the photocontrol device. For still inexplicable reasons the photocontrol device emerged difficult to clone with the strong constitutive promoter. Although the molecular cloning of these parts was optimised several times very few successful clonings were accomplished, and the few times correct assembly was obtained, the BioBrick was not reproducibly purifiable. By sequencing, it was deduced that a region of the plasmid containing both the promoter and the BioBrick prefix had vanished. To circumvent this inconvenient cloning two other promoters, that are constitutive in E. coli, were examined, namely the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated, BBa_R0073 , promoters. By performing fluorescence microscopy on composite parts of the promoters controlling yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), BBa_I6102 , and BBa_I6103 , respectively, the expression levels were assessed. The obtained results revealed that the PenI-regulated promoter facilitated very strong expression of the marker gene, whereas the expression controlled by the Mnt-regulated promoter was noticeably lower. Based on these findings, the photocontrol device was placed under the control of the PenI-regulated promoter instead of the strong constitutive promoter from the constitutive promoter family. As it turned out, this cloning likewise emerged difficult. After several attempts, it was decided to focus on the other aspects of the dormancy system.
Regulation of the OmpR-dependent Promoter Required a Low Copy Vector
The first construct containing the genes required for the light-induced dormancy was designed as shown in Figure 1. As the conducted modelling clarified, the necessity for stringent regulation of the RelE and RelB expression, the properties of the OmpR-regulated promoter were studied thoroughly. To assess the functionality of the OmpR-regulated promoter in practice, a reporter system containing the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RFP was cloned into the E. coli strain MG1655 ΔompR. The phenotype of the resulting cultures revealed a dysregulation of the OmpR-regulated promoter."

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Experts Session
One of our private sponsors is Lupin Limited. On Oct 31, we went to Lupin Research Park in Pune. We gave a presentation to some of the industry experts and researchers working in TB research. They gave us valuable feedback on the feasibility and relevance of our project. They suggested that we should consider attenuating bacteria before making their replication faster as an added biosafety measure. They also talked about extrapulmonary tuberculosis
Survey
We decided to reach a bigger audience and created a survey to collect data and suggestions from experts in field for safely implementing our project. Also we would like to address the social stigma associated with genetic engineering. We shared this survey on our social media accounts (facebook and twitter) and also sent it to our IISER community(different IISERs in India) via email. We also circulated it to different pharmaceutical companies and iGEM team PIs.
Biosafety Module
One of the major concerns raised by many of our audience was the accidental chances of the device getting released into the wild. In order to ensure the biosafety of the module in cases of such accidents,  we are planning to incorporate a biosafety module in our device. The biosafety module involves a Nuclease, which chews up the DNA and RNA of the host when activated. This nuclease will be under the control of a highly repressed promoter, repressed by a protein R. This protein R will be under the control of an inducible promoter. Our device will contain the inducer for this inducible promoter which will cause the transcription of gene R and in-turn will inhibit the production of nucleases. So our constructs will be stable in our device. In case of plasmid getting lost into the environment, the gene R won’t be induced and thus will cause the expression of nucleases which will digest the DNA of the host organism including the detection device, thereby ensuring the biosafety of the device. As of now a possible candidate for R gene is Gonococcal nuclease. It will be under the control of p(TetR) promoter. TetR coding sequence will be expressed under the control of pLac promoter which is induced by IPTG.

Digestion of G2.3,G3.3 started with Sac1. Double digest not possible because 12 nucleotide spacer isn't sufficient to use bulky and tightly binding HF enzymes. Solution is to do one digestion, purify, then digest again with the other enzyme.

Ashlee sent the L6 prepared plasmid for sequencing, just to check whether the latter part of dCas9 was inserted. If the complete system was not inserted, we would not be able to use this plasmid as a template to create the overlap 3 region. We ran the digestion of the L6 backbone on a gel and it was the correct size, 9.5 kb. We also made Kan 30 plates and made new DNA ladder aliquot. Ashlee ligated the Lambda Red Recombinase system into the L6 backbone for an overnight, 18 hour ligation.
Cultures from yesterday were plasmid prepped: 4 cultures of G5.4 (7/18 plating), 2 cultures from new G4 (7/29 ligation product), 2 cultures from old G4 (7/18 plating), one culture G2.3 and one culture G3.3 (both 7/18 plating). All plasmid prep successful. Analytical digestion of G5.4 (7/18 plating), G4.1 and G4.2 (7/30 plating), G4.1 and G4.2 (7/18 plating), G5.3 (from 7/18), G1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6 (from 7/27 plating), G5.4 (7/18 plating). Analytical digestion is shorter (~3 hours with HF enzymes) and will be used to check for correct bands. G2.3, G3.3 digested with longer digestion protocol to prepare for dRBS insertion. This isn’t possible with a double digest because of the short spacer between the two sites, so a sequential approach is used. Then, G2.3 and G3.3 ligated with the annealed dRBS oligos. DNA purified, then cells transformed.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!

Another similar “suicide” containment system uses streptavidin (BBa_J36841) (Kaplan, Mello et al. 1999; Urgun-Demirtas, Stark et al. 2006). This protein binds very tightly to biotin, a required co-enzyme for many metabolic pathways. This makes biotin unavailable and causes cell death. Kaplan et al. reported cell counts were reduced 99.9% in eight hours after their system was activated by absence of pollutant to degrade.

Clotho Framework:
Clotho implements the current biosafety standards as outlined by the NIH and the CDC. Whenever a new part is instantiated, Clotho BLAST's its sequence against a databank of known virulence factors and pathogens and returns the RG number of the highest match. This framework ensures that every part in Clotho has a RG value associated with it. In addition, when composite parts are made by joining basic parts, the composite part is also assigned a BSL number. Finally, all strains in Clotho have a risk group.

Characterization from recent research has shown numerous attractive features intrinsic to the S. pasteurii bacterium, including
Robust function of its urease activity, even in 100% salt water 1 .
Its ability to utilize waste products and proliferate from cheap sources of nutrition (ie. Corn steep liquor, vegemite, etc) 2 .
The success of mutagenic experiments to increase urease function 3 .

Correspondingly, the motivation to investigate the transformation of S. pasteurii comes from several key benefits that would be accomplished if we were successful:
The ability to confer antibiotic resistance to the cell culture, opening the door to
More rigorous genetic controls cell culture fidelity**
Allowing continued selection in directed evolution experiments
The ability to introduce traits that will strengthen the bacterium profile for extraterrestrial space travel
With a successful path to genetic recombination, we could add this organism to our list of powerful chassis’s, for use both terrestrial and cosmic use.
**During the course of our cell culture of ''S. pasteurii'', we frequently encountered contamination of our media-rich culture, despite our best attempts at sterilization techniques under the UV hood.
The risk involved in this project selection was the existence of good reasons for the lack of published articles on S. pasteurii transformation. But in the words of Microsoft’s blue monster, we decided that we were going to either go big or go home.
Experiment Design
Through all of the research we scoured, we found only one mention of the genetic transformation of S. pasteurii, from a symposium done by a then-undergraduate student in Arizona State University. In it she documented a seemingly successful transformation of S. pasteurii using protoplast transformation, giving us hope of its feasibility. Through fortuitous email correspondence, we were able establish contact with Alicia, who had had went on to become a practicing attorney. She kindly faxed us her old lab notebook sheets. We are still in awe of her organization skills.
Several methods of transformation were available to choose from:
Soil Transformation- relying on the natural competency of the bacteria to transfer genetic information
Protoplast Transformation- Digestion of the cell wall with lysozymes, followed by induction of DNA uptake by PEG 8000.

Dr. Jun Yang found a worm that could eat the plastic and we are really interested in the two bacterium which are able to degrade PE. We contacted Dr. Jun Yang by email and sent our scheme about these two strains to him. After the correspondance, we fixed a time and interviewed him in BUAA. We departed for BUAA in the early morning by Uber, intercity train and subway. We demonstrated our ideas by slides and raised many questions to him. He answered our questions patiently and put forth some improvements on pur ideas. Also he told us some practical tricks in the experiment. At last we promised that we would try our best to help BUAA build their iGEM team if they intended to have one.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Purdue,2015,Team:Purdue#TheProblem_-_-_TEXT.html,", represent the challenges that must be circumvented to have efficient pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials.
Multiple strategies have been investigated to deal with the issue of cellulase inhibition by lignin residuals. One main strategy is to find molecules that will preferentially bind to lignin and block cellulases from doing so. One candidate for such a molecule is bacterial expansins, which have been found to have a high degree of binding with lignin compounds (Kim et al, 2012). Bacterial expansins are thought to have evolved as a method for soil bacteria to form biofilms around plant roots to participate in symbiotic rhizosphere interactions (Georgelis et al, 2015), which would explain their high affinity for lignin. Another candidate lignin blocker is the compound BSA, which was shown to improve glucose production when applied to an enzymatic mixture (Ko et al, 2015). One possibility for stopping inhibition by lignin is the production of these lignin-blockers in conjunction with production of lignin breaking down enzymes. In a completely different route, protein engineering has been applied to cellulases to lower their affinity to nonproductively bind to lignin. Succinylation and acetylation of T. reesi cellulase resulted in twofold cellulose conversion without lowering the km of the cellulase when placed in an ionic liquid (Nordwald et al, 2014).
Lastly, the interactions of lignin and its byproducts with cellulose breaking down enzymes is still not fully understood. A recent study showed that the addition of laccase, a detoxifying agent that was originally thought to increase cellulose conversion, actually lowered the glucose output (Oliva-Taravilla et al, 2015).
The 2015 iGEM project has focused around designing a microbial pretreatment system to couple with a recent synthetic yeast biodigestion platform that internalizes nearly all of the biodigesting reactions inside the yeast cell (Wei et al, 2015), including the breakdown of cellobiose to glucose monomers via β-glucosidase. This way, lignin can be broken down without inhibiting the fermentation of glucose. The project centers around expressing termite-based lignin-degrading enzymes in a synthetic yeast cell, which has not been done before in enzymatic pretreatment. Finally, the performance of the individual enzymes and combinations of them will be compared to determine the most effective enzyme cocktail.

Background
Leveraging a Xenobiotics Approach against Bacterial Contamination
Engineering Microbes to Produce Tagatose
Using a Co-Culture Bioreactor Design
Focus 1: Background
After our team determined that we wanted to focus on problems in bio-production and manufacturing, we needed to do extensive research about problems and solutions and how we could innovate within existing parameters.
Why Does Our Project Matter?
We believe that as aware citizens of a global community, we have an obligation to help further progress with sustainable, renewable energy. However, we believe that resolving the economic differences between fossil fuels and green energy is key to opening the door for alternatives. Successfully leveraging the approach of xenobiotics will allow for the engineering of many currently limited resources, in which organisms serve as easily controlled, cost-effective centers of synthesis and manufacturing. Ultimately, we want to expand our project as a sustainable platform that is versatile and modular, meaning that it can produce a variety of substances when needed.
Challenges
Some of the biggest problems in bio-production that we wanted to solve included the following:
Bacterial Contamination [ICON]
Even within the biofuel process, there is still concern for lack of overall efficiency. One of the primary concerns is microbial contamination. To deal with this issue, farmers often use expensive antibiotics, an option that leads to antibiotic resistance and ultimately, an ineffective product. Bacterial contamination often occurs because non-host organisms can also metabolize the glucose from the crops, eventually outcompeting the native strains. This also leads to additional costs in biofuel production.
Allocation of Resources
Because bio-production relies on crops as a starting point for production, farmers face a difficult choice between allocating the majority of their crops for fuel production vs for human consumption. This food vs. fuel debate is complicated by the world’s changing demographics: as the world’s population approaches 8 billion, farmers must decide if growing food consumption outweighs needs for energy consumption, or vice versa.
Guiding Questions
After determining the problems that we wanted to tackle, we set out to answer the following questions through our wet-lab work:
What sort of bioprocessing technology can we implement to achieve economic parity with fossil fuels?
How can our approach best use existing resources or completely eliminate the need for crop-based feedstocks?
How can we decrease or eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination in large-scale fermentation processes?
What organism(s) would be most ideal for our project?
How can we implement a solution that is scalable and thoroughly designed?
Focusing on a broader scale, we decided to commercialize our"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!

Expression system
As we need to drain FPP constantly (FPP is toxic to the cell in high concentrations), the idea is to produce a color or the direct precursor (Phytoene) at all temperatures. We want to express the enzymes of the FPP producing pathway constitutively, independent of temperature. There is a need however to 'tune' this expression to the consumption of the color pathway. In practice this means the eight enzymes necessary for FPP production will be expressed in one operon under the same promotor. However, the required strength of the promotor and ribosome binding site will have to be determined experimentally. The color enzymes (from FPP to lycopene, B-carotene and zeaxanthin) will be expressed seperately and under regulation of the RNA thermometers. As we will obtain three colors, this would mean two switches, for instance at 27ºC and 37ºC in the case of constitutively induced lycopene production. This means red colonies will form at all temperatures below 27ºC. However the enzyme for B-carotene production would be switched on (by loss of secondary structure of the RNA element) at 27ºC and between 27ºC and 37ºC E. coli colonies will be orange. Above 37ºC the zeaxanthin enzyme will be turned on and colonies will have a yellow color. If the basic molecule will be phytoene, there is room for three RNA thermometers, for example 27ºC, 32ºC and 37ºC. This would give the temperature scheme of:
T < 27ºC: 'E. coli color'
27ºC < T < 32ºC: Red
32ºC < T < 37ºC: Orange
37ºC < T : Yellow
Results
The first gradient PCR have been performed on the genes, the E. coli genes all worked correctly (see lab notebook entry of August 19th ), while still some work has to be"

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Model#Larginine_-_-_TEXT.html," with the arginine pathway. However, the publication was a useful guide when it comes to estimating parameters of our model.
Because of the reasons mentioned above and because we wanted to have a simplified model which focuses on the part of the arginine pathway we were going to modify in the lab, which models the pathway at a protein rather than gene level and which is easy to use by scientists without an expertise in modelling, we decided to develop our own model. We chose to build our model using Simbiology because of its user-friendly interface with a number of build-in options for testing and further use of the model.

Overview of the model
As you can see in the diagram below (Fig. 1), our model describes the metabolic pathway in which arginine is obtained from glutamine and glutamate acetyl-CoA, and includes the inhibitory feedback loops. The green species are the metabolites of the pathway, the yellow circles the reactions producing them. The blue species are the enzymes and enzyme repressor complexes at each stage of the reaction, the red circles represent the repression. The orange species is argR, which is responsible for most of the repression.
Dashed lines were used to indicate species which do not get used up in the reactions, e.g. enzymes, and"
Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Adeno-associated Virus (AAV-2) was chosen as the topic of our project. At that time she proposed to do the cloning in the AAV-2 that is for sure to handle under biological security level 1 and to prepare everything for work under biological security level 2 to satisfy the precaution principle. The precaution principle was realized and all viral vectors that contained a modified capsid were handled under SII conditions until proven harmless. In August the planing of the project was completed, summarized in an Biosafety application30 and handed to the department for biological security who approve the application in an official BSL1 confirmation31 official BSL1 confirmation for our project.
Risk management
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our project was designed in a way that it avoids any serious safety issues as far as possible. When working with infectious particles a minimal risk for the researcher is allways present. This risk was minimized by restricting the transduced genes to fluorescent proteins and prodrug convertases that are already proven not to harm human cells in the absece of the corresponding prodrug. A potential danger for the public or the environment was minimized as much as possible by following strictly the rules of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and the abdication of using randomized insertions in the capsid and of replication potent viruses. Minimizing the risk for team members and the society was was allways one of the major concerns, especially because worries about undergraduate students manipulating a virus could arise. The security concept will be explained by quoting and explaining the six guiding principles for safe manipulation of Gene Manipulated Organisms (GMOs) as summarized in Kimman et al. ; 2008 18 .
1) Hazard recognition and identification Risk assessment has been done and all legal regulations were considered as described in the last paragraph.
2) Biological containment Biological containment means the usage of organisms with ""reduced replicative capacity, inefectivity , transmissibility, and virulence""18. For our project only replicative deficient viruses were used, additional all modifications aimed to have a specific targeting of the resulting viral vectors for a specific cell type. This gain in specificity requires it to cut off the braod natural tropism resulting is an less infective virus copared to the wild type virus.
3) Concentration and enclosure All working steps for the preparation of viral vectors were carried out in a BSL II laboratory and within this laboratory work with the AAV was restricted to a separate Laminar flow cabinet type II. Cell culture and storage of the"

This morning we check yesterday's transformation result, it turned out we got transformed cell for all three strains.
we patched the colonies on LB+EM+CHL+Starch plate to check whether the pGFP-rrnB:kinA part were integrated in amyE part or not.
After 6 hours grow on antibiotic and starch plate, we got some right colonies.
Microscopy Test to characterize KinA
We inoculated 6 cultures for the microscopy test from haloless colonies since tehy were transformed with our biobrick. We inoculated them into MM competence medium overnight

Fig. 5 2D Pressure field distribution on the cell layer for 108KHz stimulation, and 251700 transducer-culture medium interface pressure.
As the distance between transducer interface and cell layer may vary a little due to device configuration error, Pressure distribution patterns in condition of +-0.2mm distance error were also simulated to show the effect of distance error on pressure distribution pattern.

Fig. 6 Pressure distribution of cell layer caused by 108KHz transducer, and its interface pressure were all set to be 251700Pa. The Transducer-water interface and cell layer were set as A 0.8mm, B 1.0mm, C 1.2mm respectively. The pressures of the center of cell layer were 1.35*10^5Pa, 1.40*10^5Pa, 1.48*10^5Pa respectively. So the error of distance for no more than 0.2mm may cause about 5.7% pressure change on the cell layer.
1.1MHz ultrasonic Pressure Modeling
The pressure distribution of 1.1MHz ultrasonic transducer was also modeled. Unlike the model above that merely gives a pressure distribution in a certain power. This modeling gives a function between input voltage and ultrasonic pressure distribution pattern. The influence of distance error was also discussed in this modeling. The transducer we use had been calibrated that U=23V, I0=1.9W/cm2 3mm far from transducer surface.

1.3 Environment Consideration and Assessment
1.4 Application for Our Seek & Degrade System
1.5 Perspectives of Atrazine
Overview
We have designed a system which can seek and destroy herbicide atrazine by two reprogrammed bacteria. To bridge the gap between laboratory and industries, we interviewed several companies which produce herbicide, such as Zhongshan Chemical Industry, Changxing First Chemical Industry, Xintong Chemical Industries and so on. Our primary goals are:
We aim to search the information of the history and the development of herbicide ,especially atrazine;
We try to find out the process of producing atrazine in industries and their consideration of environment;
We try to develop a functional way to apply our system to the industry;
We want to measure the effect of transgenic crop on the atrazine.
History and Development of Herbicide
Until 2007, 0.56 million herbicide are made in China, including 0.26 million export, and 0.3 million on domestic market, which increases eight times compared with 1978. The form below characterizes pesticide produced in November 2012 in China,"

When the sequence of a sigma factor is inserted into Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000(ecf11) and Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5(ecf20), a sigma factor might be expressed, but not in plasmid form.
CTC
We handled cell line which is no chance for multiplication outside laboratory because of its frail character. No dangerous gene was expressed when we assayed because we checked only expression of promoter.
Both counter and CTC projects are confined to BSL1 and do not contain high risks parts compared with present BioBrick parts.
Advisors
On doing experiments, we handed in our plan of experiments to Professor Wakamoto, Ikeuchi and Ishiura, the bosses of the laboratories in which we conducted our experiments. These professors confirmed that our project observed the regulations. Professor Wakamoto provided us with almost all the materials for our experiments, Professor Ikeuchi provided us with a fluorescence microscope, and Professor Ishiura provided us with experimental facilities for the CTC detector project.
Our all experimental operations were under Professor's control and permission.
