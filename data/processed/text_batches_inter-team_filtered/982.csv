UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

Project Design and Wet Lab Work: The frontrunners of the wet lab work were Roshan, Sriram, Harsheel and Yogesh. Each step was discussed before and reviewed after it was done, within themselves and with our guide Prof. Agneyo Ganguly. Our research scholars Ms Swagata and Ms Shikha deserve special thanks for showing us the road and driving on track every time we lost our way.
Community: The workshop presentation at the Institute of Genetic Engineering (IGE), Kolkata was delivered by three student members of our team - Adarsh, Chetan and Pruthv. We would like to thank Professor Amit Chakravarty (Director, IGE) and Professor Sudipa Chakravarty (HOD, Microbiology Department, IGE) for this opportunity to conduct a workshop at institute.
Two of our student team members - Adarsh and Dipasha, also visited West Medinipur, Kolkata to teach the students about food spoilage and its reasons. The students were, in a very simple and lucid way, explained about the concepts of Synthetic Biology and its applications.
Guide Book: The content of our “Guide Book on Food Spoilage” was primarily curated and organized by Jugal and Karan, two of our student team members. The final formatting, layout designing and structuring was done by Roshan, Varshit and Harsheel. We learnt a lot in the process of making this booklet and hope it benefits as many people as possible.
Surveys: We launched two surveys – One essentially revolving around the theme of “Food Spoilage”, and the other targeting the experienced iGEM teams around the world, so as to gather useful and critical information to “Guide the Beginner” iGEM teams. We would like to thank all the people and iGEM teams across the world who participated in our surveys and helped us gather the data we needed  for our analysis.
Wiki Creation: The style, theme and development of our iGEM wiki were responsibly handled by two of our student team members – Satyam (Web-Wizard) and Sanjay (Designing-Maestro)

Metallothioneins (metal-binding proteins) and metal transporters
1. Background
Heavy metals such as Cd(II) and As(III) used in industry and urban are deposited into the land and ocean. They are taken into our body through drinking water, fish and crops, which are causing serious problem against human health. To get rid of them from contaminated soil and water is a serious issue we need to solve and think about.
Today, proteins called metallothionein that can bind to metal ions are reported. By using such property of metallothionein, we have decided to make a metal ion cleaning device. Our metal cleaning system will work like this – we will make an E.coli that can produce metallothionein inside the cell. It will also synthesize transporters to take in metal ions from its surrounding, to make the metal cleaning faster and more effective. The absorbed metal ions will bind specifically to the metallothionein, which will then be collected inside the BMC (bacterial microcompartment).
 
What are metallothioneines?
We will focus on two metallothioneins, each paired up with transporters. Team Groningen in iGEM2009 has introduced fMT (an arsenic binding metallothionein) and Glpf (arsenic transporter). We will further use and characterize their parts in our metal cleaning E.coli to collect arsenite. A new metallothionein that we will introduce this year in iGEM, will be SmtA (Cadmium binding metallothionein) and MntH (Cadmium transporter).
SmtA is found in Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 and has been reported that the cyanobacterial strain expressing SmtA reaches a higher OD550 in a cadmium containing medium.
The E.coli K-12 derived MntH (yfep) are transporters that are highly homologous to the Nramp protein family (metal ion transporters), and are known to be able to transport a variety of metal ions including Cd2+ [2]. A study"

Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication (EID) Méditerranée
Interstate Organization for Mosquito Control. The EID (Entente Interdépartementale de Démoustication / Interdepartmental agreement for mosquito control on the Mediterranean coast) is in charge of the fight against mosquito epidemics, which is recognized as a mission of public interest for the Ministry of Health in France. Therefore, EID is acting by delegation of authority, in a similar level as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US. We had a skype meeting and mail exchanges with Dr. Gregory Lambert, a medical coordinator and entomologist at EID. These interviews have allowed us to gather the opinion of field experts and to design our project so that it would best address the needs of professionals. This input enabled us to better take into account the mosquito's lifestyle and optimize our device’s safety features with regard to local populations. Dr. Lambert's professional opinion on the current methods used in the field, the materials for trapping and detection, safety procedures, protocols, coordination with the state and the health representatives, prevention of the public, data processing, and much more was extremely helpful while working on the practical application of our project in the field. Every aspect we discussed was an opportunity for us to both enhance our project and to benefit from constructive criticism about our device. Dr. Lambert told us that the method they used has been adapted to the current situation in France, but that our Mos(kit)o solution could be used in addition, or even completely replace theirs in the future, because it would be more precise and more adapted to such epidemics. He proposed to test our device in the field as soon as we develop a functioning kit, and he said that he was eager to stay informed about our future improvements.

Tn5:adapter DNA complex formation
From previous result, we learned that:
More negative control should be done to confirm integration
50µM adapter concentration was too high. In this experiment 10µM and 25µM adapter will be used.
50% glycerol might be too high. As the transposase already contain glycerol. No addition glycerol will be added in this experiment
Two different amount of Tn5  was loaded with adapter DNA by following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

Motivation
The deimmunization of a protein is the act of utilizing position specific point mutations to decrease the chances of immune reactions. Artificially inducing point mutations simply by chance is a risky act, which is likely to impair the protein's folding capabilities and in the worst-case completely destroy the protein structure. Amino acids involved at important protein sites such as its active site are usually evolutionary conserved. Therefore, it is of great use to examine naturally occurring point mutations.
Multiple sequence alignment
Investigating diverging sequences with similar evolutionary backgrounds allows us to find naturally occurring mutations. A prerequisite for the determination of evolutionary conserved residues is a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). A multiple sequence alignment characterizes the alignment of three or more biological sequences of similar length. MSAs can be created by popular webservices such as Clustal Omega. For example, we created a MSA for BoNTC with Clustal Omega using various related sequences like BoNTA, BoNTD or even artifical sequences like eBoNT. The resulting MSA is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Multiple sequence alignment of related proteins of Botulinum toxin C. The red box marks a single aligned amino acid position, for which the module computes whether this position either is highly conserved or variable.
Implementation
To easily find evolutionary highly conserved or very mutative residues we developed EvoCS using the popular programming language Python. EvoCS parses the MSA file and computes preserved residues or residue classes for each residue position. The conserved amino acid or class assignment is decided by a user customizable threshold (0 \(\leq\)  threshold \(\leq\) 1). If the number of occurrences of a residue or residue class surpasses the total number of sequences times the threshold it is considered a preserved residue. We differentiate between ten different residueclasses: Negative '-', alcoholic 'o', tiny 'u', positive '+', aliphatic 'l', aromatic 'a', charged 'c', small 's', polar 'p', turnlike 't', and hydrophobic 'h'. Classes containing less amino acids are preferred. This allows subclasses (ex. '-' \( \subset \) 'c') to be chosen instead of their supersets.
Moreover, the gap percentage of each residue is calculated. A higher gap percentage indicates more evolutionary insertions of amino acids. Since they're unlikely to be evolutionary conserved they have to be ruled out. For example, considering a MSA of 10 aminoacids, where two sequences contain an E at a specific position and all other eight"

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#labblog_-_-_TEXT.html," Integrases enable to build biological XOR logic gates by switching twice a terminator. Indeed, every integrase can switch the terminator only once. Thus if the colony produces only r or only s, the terminator is switched only once, so the terminator is OFF, and GFP and QS1 or QS2 are produced (depending on the colony). If the colony produces r and s, the terminator is switched twice, so it is ON and it blocks expression of GFP and of the quorum sensing molecule.
Rule that will be computed by all cells : an XOR gate between the signals from the 2 cells above. Biologically, integrases p and q are able to bind sites around a terminator and switch this terminator, thereby turning off the effect of the terminator and enabling gfp transcription. If p and q integrases are both present, the terminator is switched twice and comes back to its initial state, gfp is not transcribed.
We need to  :
find orthogonal quorum sensing molecules and orthogonal integrases
discuss with microfluidics experts to check if using microfluidics is possible and presents advantages in our case

BSSE Openhouse Day
Saturday, May 10th
Sharing our iGEM and synthetic biology interest with the public
On May 10th the public in Basel had the unique chance to get an insight into many different scientific laboratories and the work done there. It was the joint open house day of D-BSSE of ETH (Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering) and the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. The many different labs opened their doors to the public and many scientists were present to give interested people some details about their daily work. So did the ETH iGEM team 2014. The team was present with a poster showing the history of iGEM, the previous ETH iGEM teams with their projects and general information about synthetic biology. Additionally there was a slideshow giving a best-of photo collection of last years jamboree. The goal of this day was to inform the public about synthetic biology in general and specifically about the spirit and the many different projects of iGEM. Many people showed strong interest in truly student driven projects and are curious to follow our team wiki for the next months.

The leading enterprise of Zhejiang province.
Its pickle products once won the prize of ""the best agricultural products"", rewarded by the Department of Agriculture(Zhejiang).
Fig 3. The change of nitrite contents in various pickle food
We were invited to the headquarters of Zhejiang Qiumei Food CO, LTD, visiting the integrated producing shop. Up there, we acquired the information of pickle's productive process.
After understanding the principle of pickle's production, we successfully found out the main reasons that influence the generation of the nitrite during the pickling process. The main ideas of our findings from the notes taken from the manufacturing plant visit and the data of pickle's mother liquid are summarized below:
The plants require nitrogen in order to produce proteins— the sole source of nitrogen of the plants is the mineral N in soil, which is known as the nitrate, which would be converted into nitrite by the nitrate reductases in the microbes.
The concentration of nitrite in the fermentation liquid has shown a drastic changing curve through the course of months.
(According to the Chinese standard, pickles' concentration of the nitrite cannot exceed 20 mg/L)
Fig 4. ChineseFDA's standard for nitrite/nitrate in food
Former Solution
As aforementioned, the pickled factory currently uses ascorbic acid to manage the nitrite problem. However, this solution may still have some defects.
The ascorbic acid is commonly used as a reducing agent in food production, which is able to reduce the toxic nitrite and convert it to the nontoxic nitrate. The plant has to gain the food grade Vitamin C at regular intervals. The price of ascorbic acid is not inexpensive; therefore, it would raise the cost of pickle's production in some ways.
In the actual operation, it is quite difficult to measure the precise concentration of nitrite. As a result, the added quantity of Vitamin C is hard to control.
Our Solution
See our results of ( fusion enzyme ). We also did a ( business study ) concerning the possible market for our product.

DTU-Denmark-2,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly_-_-_TEXT.html,"pnI treatment or by gel band purification(2).
Previous studies have demonstrated a high level of correct assembly and directionality of fragments (2,3) and although we did not make such analysis ourselves it was in general our perception that this was the case, as of the more than 25 different Plug 'n' Play assemblies performed we encountered no more than two false-positives.
It is well known that mutations can be introduced during PCR. To minimize mutations the x7 proof-reading polymerase (4) that are fully compatible with the Plug 'n' Play standard should be used. The x7 proof-reading polymerase helps lowering the risk of introducing mutations.
The design of the system
The system was designed based on the most common categories of biological part in the order; promotor, gene of interest (GOI), tail sequence (TS), terminator, marker cassette, and vector backbone. The standard marker cassette consists of a promoter, a gene, and a terminator. Short sequences are such as ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are meant to be integrated in the forward or reverse primer of the desired part when amplifying it by PCR. An example of this can be found on this page .
The system is dependent on the assembly of the custom-made linkers on each part. The parts with linkers are synthesized by PCR amplification of template DNA using primers designed with an upstream extension of 8-9 additional nucleotides with a single deoxyuridine residue directly upstream the part. In order to assemble multiple parts while having a flexible system the linkers have an adenine in the 5' end and a thymine in the 3' end. Furthermore, it is important that the linkers of the different parts are not identical to ensure the directionality and correct order of the biobricks.
Illustrated below, are the sequences of linkers between the parts, which are generated from the overhangs (linkers) on the PCR products.
The linkers are responsible for the flexibility of the system in that it for instance is possible use any promoter, since they will always have the same linkers. In the Plug 'n' Play system the coding sequence(s) can either consist of one gene of interest (GOI), called a module, or a GOI and a tail sequence, which could be any given DNA sequence of interest.

We re-ran the 1% agarose gel for GAD and FldHC-TPH1with 6ul of DNA but to our dismayal, we did not see two bands on the gel, rendering our experiment inconclusive.
In the afternoon, we did PCR cleanup of GAD,KAT,FidHC-TPH1, Pyear-TPH1, pSB1C3(3)and pSB1C3(4) USING PROMEGA PCR cleanup kit. We had yields ranging from 30-50 ng/ul.
For transformation of these effectors into our plasmid pSB1C3, initially we carried out digestion of 5ul of GAD and Pyear-TPH1 and 6.7ul of KAT,FldHC-TPH1 with XbaI and Pst. We also double digested our plasmid with the same enzymes. The digested samples were all incubated for half an hour and heat shocked at 80 degrees for 20 minutes. Ligation carried out at 1:5 molar ratio.

Plan for Test #1:  To test the activity of our activators and repressors, we would grow out an overnight culture of yeast cells that have successfully  been transformed with both a synthetic transcription factor and its respective reporter.  Thee cultures would have an amount of galactose and methionine that will remain the same for all subsequent tests.  We would then count the cells in these overnight cultures in the morning, dilute them, split them up into well plates with an equal number of cells in each plate in media with differing amounts of galactose or methionine (water would be added as a control and to maintain the same volume in each well).  We could also centrifuge the cells before putting them into these wells to remove traces of the previous media.  Perhaps two washes would be sufficiently rigorous to ensure that the concentration of input in the media is what we would want it to be with high confidence.  Then we would grow the cells in these wells for 4 hours or so to get them back into log phase in their respective media.  After this, we would take their fluorescence measurement using a plate reader, perhaps taking out samples at different time points during the log phase.
Realized that regarding further yeast transformations for Test #1 that we will have to wait until we insert Z0842 (LexA activable reporter) and Z0507 (Zif268-HIV repressor reporter) into pRS306 in order to actually get them into yeast cells.  Thus, we cannot run basic tests of the LexA activator or the Zif repressor until this is done.  We already have two of the activators transformed into yeast.  This leaves four more possible transformations that we can do right away:
LexA repressor + LexA repressor reporter (Z0412 + Z0418)
null repressor + LexA repressor reporter (Z0411 + Z0418)

The samples were run at 100V for 30 minutes. No RFP insert bands were not observed on the gel. We thought that this was due to the low concentration of DNA loaded. Therefore, we ran more on 1% LMP gel; 6uL of sample 1 and 8uL of sample 2. However, there was still no band observed. The remainder volume of the two samples of digested pET29b-RFP vectors were stored in the -20°C freezer.
We thought that the reason why no bands were seen may have been due to improper digestion and decided to digest more pET29b-RFP vectors to isolate the backbone for ligations. More overnight cultures of DH5α pET29b-RFP were made. The vectors were isolated by miniprep, digested sequentially, and then run on LMP gel. Bands indicated that the digestions did not seem to work. Sam performed miniprep of more pET29b-RFP vectors for overnight cultures in three separate tubes labelled A, P, and S. However, only the tube labelled S recovered bands. The vector was digested and run on a 1% LMP gel, but the bands did not show the correct size of predicted fragments.  We decided to wait until next week to continue experiments to isolate the pET29b backbone out of the pET29b-RFF.

As shown on the diagram     2, there are four interactive tasks BioGuide can do, where the device     and Biobricks graphs are utilized. Upon clicking a node on a devices     or Biobricks graph, that node changes in size and color and the various     functions shown on the flowchart can be performed then after.
Graph Modeling
Graphical Modeling for Bio-Guide
Introduction
Graphical Modeling Theory has been applied to construct four different     graphs where relations of atomic parts, devices and systems and the     functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented     for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of     iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks. Each graph comprises     a set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges. In the set of nodes each     node represents a device, while in the set of edges each edge represents     the input-output combination of the nodes. These graphs are directed     graphs as the edges are created according to input-output combination.     All compatibilities between a regulator and a promoter of an edge is     created, where the source of this edge is the device with the corresponding     regulator and target of the edge is the device with the promoter in     concern.
Fig. 1: A node representing a device
Fig. 2: Arrow representing an edge between two nodes
The atomic structures used in our graphical model have been represented     in Figures 1 and 2. A node is represented with a solid circle where     the label, the part/device ID according to iGEM standards, of the device     is marked on the foreground. The blue arrows between nodes connect the     related devices, representing the input-output connectivity. End style     of the arrow helps us to determine the direction of the node, like in     Figure 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.
Directivity
All the four constructed graphs build for BioGuide are directed graphs.     So that, for every edge there must be a single source and a target.     There is no single edge which is bidirectional. In mathematical form     this can be represented as:
If an edge e has node v as source and node w as target then the edge     can be expressed as
For a directed graph the combination (v, w) is totally different     from (w, v). Therefore,
The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,    "

Conclution
    We studied for a time before doing interlab, and spent one-two day preparing experimental materials, such as preparing E. coli DH5α and several culture media. After full preparation, we started the experiment. In the first experiment, our antibiotics failed, causing too much bacteria to colonize the plate.The second time we had a problem with the competent cells, so the bacteria did not grow after the plate was painted.The third time, we reprepared the competent cells and replaced the antibiotics, and the experiment went well.
1. The final concentration of chloramphenicol is not clearly defined in the experimental protocol. Although we have made the experiment proceed smoothly based on experience, we believe that accurate antibiotic dosage requirements are still necessary;
2. Regarding the use of the plate reader: although there are some descriptions in the experimental protocol that explain the experimental design and a simple explanation of the plate reader, we used the plate reader incorrectly at the beginning of the experiment, leading to a invalid data. So we still expect more instructions on the setup and use of the plate reader;
3. Regarding the preservation of competent cells: we have transferred the competent cells position between buildings due to the change of the laboratory position, which took about 10 minutes. And in the transformation experiment, the competent cells stayed outside for too long. These improper storage of competent cells made the bacteria grow very unsatisfactorily after plating. Therefore, the preservation of competent cells is very important.

mRNA and gRNA production/degradation rates
For mRNA degradation we considered the mean half-life of Refs. [5-6] and subsequently computed the degradation rate. In Ref. [6] the mean half-life is explicitly stated, while we computed ourself the mean half-life of Ref. [5] from different E. Coli strains (since our strain is not present). Note that for an exponential decay, the half-life \(t_{1/2}\) is linked to the lifetime \(\tau\) by             \[               t_{1/2} = \tau \log(2)             \]             and the lifetime \(\tau\) is in turn linked to the decay constant \(\Gamma\) by             \[               \Gamma = \frac{1}{\tau}.             \]
For gRNAs we use the same degradation rate of mRNAs.
The estimation of mRNA/gRNA production rates is more complicated as it depends on promotor characteristics. Here we assume for simplicity that all promotors are of the same kind, the only difference being the number of copies of the plasmid they are in (low-copy, medium-copy, and high-copy). We assume that within a single cell we have 5, 30 and 300 copies of low-, midium- and high-copy plasmids respectively. In E. coli we consider a weak promoter starting a transcription every 35 seconds and a strong promoter starting a transcription every 6 seconds. This means that the production rate is of 10 mRNA per minute. Now, if we suppose that the cell volume for E. coli is approximately 1µm3 and in S. cerevisiae is 60µm3 [1] we can compute the production rate of mRNAs within the whole cell. We have that GFP and dCas9 are encoded in a low-copy plasmid, while mRNAs are encoded in a medium-copy plasmid.
dCas9 and GFP production/degradation rates
For E. Coli, we found a polypeptide chain elongation rate of 12-21 amino acids per second (BioNumber 100059, [8]). Since the DNA coding for dCas9 fused with the \(\omega\) subunit is 4374bp (see BioBrick BBa_K1723000 ), the total number of"

Right at the start of our project we wanted to understand everything to do with current TB testing. Understanding the Tuberculin skin test, how the test is implemented in the field and some of the current issues with testing are all things we needed to appreciate. To do this we met with Richard (Dick) Sibley, director of a veterinary practice in Devon. Dick has worked directly with bTB, attending multiple Mycobacterium conferences and also focusing the work of his practice towards tackling bTB.

Richard Sibley
Principal Vet and Director of West Ridge Veterinary Practice Ltd
We decided to visit a veterinary practice where we met with the director, Richard (Dick) Sibley, a highly respected vet with over 30 years experience across a wide range of veterinary practice. Dick and his practice have worked extensively with bTB, ranging from testing cattle through to offering bTB free programmes to farmers. After we outlined the concept of our Riboswitch, he explained more about the current bTB detection system, recent research into the disease and the work his practice does to tackle bTB. Below are the main points that Dick made us aware of at the start of our project.
Persistency and Contagiousness
Dick introduced some important concepts to us as a team. Firstly was the R0 value of bTB in cows. R0 is the disease reproduction number and is a mathematical way of explaining how contagious an infectious disease is. Although it can be hard to determine exactly, current research estimates the R0 value for TB in cows ranges from 1.0 - 4.91, 2. This means one infectious cow has the ability to infect up to 4 other animals meaning the transmission rate can be extremely high. Combine this with the close conditions farm animals are kept in, bTB spread throughout a herd is fast. Under the current bTB testing law, if a farm experiences a breakdown it has a 60 day period until a second test is conducted. Any false negative individuals that have been left in a herd from the first test won't get a chance to be detected for 60 days - more than enough time for those individuals to transmit the disease.

Currently, Thomas pursues the master program Molecular Biosciences with major in Molecular and Cellular Biology. Beforehand, he acquired his bachelor in Molecular Biotechnology at the Technical University of Dresden, already with focus on genetic engineering. In his opinion, the fundamental modification of the living world by synthetic biology is the only chance of mankind in the final war against the machines. Thomas took the opportunity to participate at this early stage by joining Heidelberg's iGEM team. After several weeks of wet lab work, he moved to the graphic design front and aims for an appealing presentation of an ingenious project.

Xiaoting finished her Bachelor studies in Molecular Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg and she will go on with her Master studies in Molecular Biosciences (Major Cancer Biology), which is a cooperation between the University and the German Cancer Research Centre. During her studies Xiaoting got highly interested in gene therapy due to several internships at the German Cancer Research Centre, different departments of the University of Heidelberg and Imperial College London. In her opinion, synthetic biology can revolutionize gene therapy by creating non-existing parts which will reduce side effects and increase the efficiency of gene therapy methods.

Figure 4: A curved microlens array (Xie et al., 2015)
The biologically produced microlens will be much smaller than the microlenses used in the aforementioned research. This will benefit the efficiency. However, it is expected that the optical properties of the biological microlenses will be different compared to regular microlenses. As conservative estimate, we hypothesize that the increase in efficiency with the biologically produced microlens is 20%. This efficiency increase we consider, without taking unnecessary risks or too much optimism, at least viable.

19/24
Several different herbicides exist. However, there is one which works similar to glyphosate. This herbicide is called glufosinate-ammonium and inhibits the enzyme glutamine synthetase. This enzyme catalyses the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia and plays a central role in plant nitrogen metabolism.

Magnetosome Toolkit
One amazing thing some bacteria do is to fabricate nano-scale magnets from soluble iron. They can use these magnetic particles, aligned in chains, to sense and navigate along the earth's magnetic field. In order to bring these fabrication and sensing capabilities to future iGEM teams, we created the Magnetosome Toolkit : a set of 18 genes from the essential mamAB operon of Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1. We extracted these genes from AMB-1, and used our pGA vectors to efficiently BioBrick and sequence verify constructs of all 18 genes. We have also begun to characterize these genes, with some exciting results . The ultimate goal of this toolkit is to enable future iGEM teams to generate magnetoColi: E. coli with magnetic properties.

POST 3 | A History of Intellectual Property, and Why it Matters to Synthetic Biology: PART 1
As we begin to delve into case studies in synthetic biology, one thing should first be made clear: Intellectual property protections, in the form of trademarks, copyrights and patents, are an old system that has served to protect many types of ideas – books, poems, manufacturing processes, tools, machines, computer programs and architecture designs – and genetic parts are just the newest addition to this list. Indeed, it would not make sense to dive into intellectual property (IP) protections in synthetic biology without first painting a picture of the IP landscape and history in the United States.
In this blog post, we will explore the history of IP protections in the United States, specifically putting emphasis on how and why these IP protection have changed and evolved over time. As you will hopefully come to see, synthetic biology IP protections are emerging as a natural next step in how IP protections adapt to meet new technologies, economies and societal changes. We can (and hopefully you will!) learn a great deal more about IP in synthetic biology simply by studying the history of IP in the United States.
While our discussion on IP law will be framed in the context of the United States, it is important to consider the history of IP laws in other nations throughout history. As will be made clear, IP laws have grown, evolved and changed significantly since their first implementation. The earliest known patent law was instated in Venice in the year 1474.

Model
The whole cell model is the combination of the Quorum sensing, Integrase and XOR modules. The model shows the behaviour of a single cell in response to incoming signals. The model enables us to understand the effect of leakiness, cross-talk and their combinations on the whole system. All the simulations here are described for a red cell .i.e. a cell producing LasI and GFP when it is ON.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#testMarkus-1_-_-_TEXT.html," using an ELISA test or a PCR based method are expensive and require a high level of expertise [11, 12, 16].
In conclusion, the current need is a simple detection method which could be applied to grass samples to be able to check if a pasture is secure for horses to graze on. Therefore we have analysed the possibility of developing the second worm buster by studying fluorescence in grass samples. Our results were promising since the fluorescence was clearly visible in the grass!
The Global Worming Problem and Society
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will help solve the physical problem, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved [6]. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Raising Awareness
We have attacked the problem at several angles to raise awareness for our project. We have performed a market analysis of the problem and sent out questionnaires to better judge the severity of the problem. We’ve even been published in a local swedish magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
Financial perspective
The equine industry includes many areas like stud farms, breeding, slaughter, trading, training & sports stables, and riding schools [18]. In Sweden the equine industry has a turnover of 450-500 million EUR and horses graze around in fields that in total correspond to 600,000 football fields [17]. There are approximately 350 000 horses is Sweden (2016) which gives Sweden a larger horse/person ratio than many other European countries [18, 19].  A large amount of money is spent on horses within and without the borders of the EU, so this is clearly a global problem.
Even though all the available data points at a high demand for our product, more data is needed to predict how an eventual new GMO product would be perceived. That is why we have worked on the market analysis and economics modelling. The result from these decides if the eventual solutions actually will be possible to implement in real life.
Uppsala 2018 is on a mission for the future of iGEM

Modeling approach to the project
As the title of our project states, “DNA is not enough”. There are several upper-level regulation systems in higher organisms. Our main idea was to use one of them to tune the expression of genes and device a tissue-specific gene therapy approach.  The miBricks project consists basically of two ideas. The first is tuning of gene expression using shRNAs/miRNAs and the second is specific targeting of tissues. We intend to tune the expression of a gene by manipulating the binding affinity of a miRNA/shRNA towards the transcript of this gene which results in different expression levels. In order to do this, different binding sites for the miRNA/shRNA are introduced in the 3'UTR of the gene of interest. These binding sites differ from each other in terms of certain sequence-based features. By computational methods, we predict the binding site that should be inserted to achieve the level of expression desired. Targeting of specific tissues is achieved by introducing binding sites for tissue-specific endogenously-expressed miRNA into the construct, thus causing knockdown of a gene based on its presence or absence in the tissue.
Apart from several bioinformatic tools, our team developed two independent models:
The Neural Network Model takes inspiration in the biological nervous system to predict its results. It is the appropriate strategy to model complex processes and it is able to learn from experience. Neural Networks generally require a big amount of"

In March 2004, Aliso Viejo, California , almost considered banning the use of foam containers at city-sponsored events because dihydrogen monoxide is part of their production. A paralegal had asked the city council to put it on the agenda; he later attributed it to poor research. [23] The bill was pulled from the agenda before it could come to a vote, but not before the city received a raft of bad publicity. [2]

Tongue-in-cheek warning sign in Louisville, Kentucky
In 2006, in Louisville, Kentucky , David Karem, executive director of the Waterfront Development Corporation, a public body that operates Waterfront Park , wished to deter bathers from using a large public fountain. ""Counting on a lack of understanding about water's chemical makeup"", he arranged for signs reading: ""DANGER! – WATER CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF HYDROGEN – KEEP OUT"" to be posted on the fountain at public expense. [24]
Occasionally, petitions on the UK Government e-petitions website on this subject have been closed or rejected. [25]
In 2007 Jacqui Dean , New Zealand National Party MP, fell for the hoax, writing a letter to Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton asking ""Does the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs have a view on the banning of this drug?"" [20] [26] [27]
On April 1, 2010, a Canadian Conservative Member of Parliament, Andrew Scheer , used the DHMO hoax as the basis for an April Fool's Day ""media release"" on his web site, in which he claimed to have presented a bill to ban the substance from all federal government buildings. [28] Scheer became Canada's speaker of the House in 2011.
In February 2011, during the campaign of the Finnish parliamentary election , a voting advice application asked the candidates whether the availability of ""hydric acid also known as dihydrogen monoxide"" should be restricted. 49% of the candidates answered in favor of the restriction. [29]
In April 2013, two radio personalities at Gator Country 101.9 , a station in Lee County, Florida , told listeners dihydrogen monoxide was coming out of their water taps as part of an April Fool's Day prank and were suspended for a few days. [30] [31] The prank resulted in several calls by consumers to the local utility company, which sent out"

Latest updates
We implemented an in-game tutorial for the Gene Network Game.
During the Asia jamboree, we demonstrated our software to participants from other teams, and we noticed:
the meanings of symbols on constructs are not commonly known,
some of participants were not familiar with the dynamics of protein concentration.
So we made guides to provide background knowledge and made it easier to use for beginners. Additionaly, we documented some instructions in the in-game tutorial in addition to the tutorial videos.
You can get the PDF version of the tutorial here.
We improved the stage editor.
The GUI is refined. Now you can see the graph of regulation relationships.   Also we documented instructions for the editor, the principles and backgrounds of the model in the in-game tutorial described above.
Overview
Gene Network Game is an educational puzzle game.  Players aim to create proper gene networks from given promoters and genes.  Through this game, the player can learn basic knowledge of gene networks and can be helpful when trying to understand other team's constructs and eventually to create their own construct.  This game is also usable as a tutorial for modeling & simulation.
At the beginning of the stage, the player has some promoters and genes in his inventory. Using this inventory, he/she aims at creating a network capable of reaching a certain output protein concentration (Left). A stage is completed when the player aligns genes in the correct order and the outputs level is achieved (Right). Completing successive stages, the player will learn ideas from ""What are promoters and genes?"" to ""Genetic oscillators and toggle switches"".
The game is also implemented with a stage editor.  In the editor, you can assign promoters and genes, adjust parameters (copy rate, degradiation rate etc.) and create your own stage.  The editor is designed so that you not only to enjoy your own stage but it can also be used as a simple modeling tool which enables you to obtain preliminary knowledge about conducting modeling and creating simulations.  It will be a first step towards using more technical modelig software such as Matlab.
Background
Planning Biobrick construction"
TU-Eindhoven,2017,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," blocked the functionality of the last monomer, leading to a functional valency of 3. The structure of this construct is shown schematically in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Mutation of the last 14-3-3 pocket to make it non-functional
The second construct needed for our project is the protein CT33. CT33 is a H(+)-ATPase derivative and can bind into the pocket of a 14-3-3 monomer. This interaction is relatively weak, but can be increased excessively by adding a small molecule, fusicoccin, that acts as a stabilizer. This means that CT33 is a very nice basis for a construct to combine with 14-3-3 for forming a network after inducing the system with fusicoccin. As the C-terminus of CT33 is necessary for the correct folding of the protein, it was not possible to design one protein out of multiple CT33 parts. The solution we found is to use a Strep-tag® II together with Strep-Tactin®XT. Strep-tag® II is mostly known for its application in protein purification, just like a His-tag. The Strep-tag® system is based on the strongest non-covalent interaction known in nature, the interaction of biotin with streptavidin. The Strep-tag®II consists of eight amino acids (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys). This peptide tags exhibit high affinities to the resins Strep-Tactin® and Strep-Tactin® XT which are specifically engineered streptavidins. Strep-Tactin®XT is a protein with four binding sites for Strep-tag® II. We used Strep-Tactin®XT to create a construct consisting out of four CT33 proteins, leading to our second construct, which has thus a valency of 4. The CT33 construct is schematically shown in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2: Assembly of the CT33 construct with Strep-Tactin®XT to get a valency of 4
When combining these two constructs in presence of an inducer, network formation can occur. The network formation is depicted schematically in Figure 3.

\[  Pe_L = \frac{Lu}{D}=Re_LSc   \]
The ratio for Péclet number (Pe) is as follows, where L is the characteristic length scale of the system (~200 nm for a gas vesicle), u the local velocity of the fluid and D the mass diffusion coefficient.
For a typical gas vesicle particle at room temperature (T = 273K),
L ~ 500 nm
u ~ 10 nm/s
RH ~ 20nm
Substituting these numbers, we get a Péclet number on the order of 10-3, which implies dominant diffusive effects when gas vesicles are allowed to settle at the equilibrium concentration profile. In such a case, we require a model that can account for the behaviour of floating particles in the highly-diffusive regime.
Illustrations: Qualitative solutions to the model
Collaboration with the IISc BANGALORE TEAM
Illustration 1: Uniform initial profile with exponential boundary conditions. Assuming the initial mixing is uniform, this is the most natural way in which we expect the concentration function to evolve on the boundaries. The exact initial and boundary conditions are taken such that they satisfy each other nicely. The contour plot below shows how the profile evolves over time. The legend on the right shows the relative magnitude of concentrations present in the plot.
Illustration 2: Exponential initial profile with exponential boundary conditions. Such a situation can arise in the event the particles have settled down due to gravity initially but start floating instantaneously at t=0. While quite unrealistic, this solution might be useful in cases where the gas vesicles have been reversibly denatured but are allowed to float up after removing the denaturing agent. The plot below shows how the profile evolves over time.
Illustration 3: Linear initial profile with exponential boundary conditions. This is the most unlikely of the three cases we've dealth with till now. An linear initial profile is almost impossible under normal conditions unless some kind of external agency maintains it. Even then, we've tried to solve the equations to show how the concentrations will evolve for such a case.
Illustration 4: Uniform initial profile with quadratic boundary conditions. While not usually encountered in nature, saturating inverse quadratic solutions are given here for demonstration purposes. The first of them is obivously, the uniform initial distribution.

The qPCR did not yield an result. In the following, qPCR was not referred to as a option for phage detection during the PACE runs.
As an alternative quantification method, DotBlots were tested. Due to too much noise during detection, they were not considered as detection method as well. For further information, please have a look at Catharina´s weekly report.
Thursday: PACE device was cleaned and autoclaved in order to change strains of split-polymerase PACE.
Friday: PACE device was build again and installed for usage (have a look at the provided video). Stock was thawn and a culture with S1030 + MP1 + Jin177 + Jin172 was grown. Inoculation of the turbidostat was performed and culture was grown until OD 0,6 - 0,8. Thereby, the last phase of our Dickinson-PACE experiment was started.
Saturday: PREDCEL - phage related dis-continous evolution concept was designed together with Tobias Stadelmann. Tobias tested the new experimental design by using a 50 ml S1030 + MP1 + Jin69 culture. Culture was prepared using LB-Medium, Cmp, Amp and 25 mM Glucose. The culture was grown until OD 0,6 - 0,8 and separated into nine 5 ml cultures (in 14 ml PP tubes). Afterwards, they were infected with different amount of phages (10 µl, 100 µl and 1 ml) to evaluate which of the amounts has to be used for following experiments. Beyond that, the infected cultures were centrifuged after different amounts of time (20, 30 or 60 min). The supernatant containing the phages was then transfered into a new 5 ml culture.
General concept of PREDCEL:
Idea: Using PACE in an experimental design, suitable to be carried out by every iGEM Team.
PREDCEL describes a manual implementation of PACE.
The incubation of E.coli with phages in a reaction tube (max. 14 ml) using a normal incubator should be performed.

1. Collaboration on Media Analysis of gene technology related information  with NYMU-Taipei
Motivation with passion: Our team believe that media is the most efficient way to promote the knowledge and popularity of gene technology /synthetic biology(GTSB), not through sporadically independent advocate or educational activities .  Thus, we are curious and concerned about what gene technology related information in the media that the Taiwanese people are exposed to and whether the Taiwanese people can understand the information.  Thus, we told the NYMU-Taipei team about our idea to consult them.  NYMU-Taipei revealed their passion to iGEM and ambitiously suggested that we should do something for iGEM to support its influence on synthetic biology worldwide.
Goal: Thus, we decided to work together to conduct a large-scaled media analysis on the gene technology related information to make"

Safety
Prior to the start of laboratory work, team members competed safety training courses offered by the University including courses in biosafety, bloodborne pathogens, and hazard assessment.  These courses, along with instruction from our lab technician, prepared us to work safely during our experiments.
Our project utilized lab strains of E. coli DH5-alpha and eukaryotic HEK293T cells. These cells were handled appropriately for their risk level 1 statuses with the use of biosafety cabinets. Risks associated with possible infection and disease related to the cells were also managed. With respect to applications outside laboratory environments, extensive literature review informed how risks could evaluated and controlled.

System evaluation
From figure 2, we can conclude that the system responds to our                     expectations, but it seems necessary to use a metric to evaluate its                     performance. So to interpret the performance, we will measure the error by                     dividing the result of the difference between final (copy number = 100) and                     initial (copy number = 5) sfGFP, with the initial sfGFP.
The E of the system in figure 1 was proven experimentally [1] to be equal                     to 0.52. This information was used in the robustness analysis section of                     the parameter estimation.
Cooperativity comparisons
The binding of TALE to the DNA is done through Hill's kinetics as mentioned above and cooperativity n shows how strong the repress is.
Figure 2: The gene of interest transcription                         rate expressed as the maximum transcription rate multiplied by the                         repressive Hill Function, relative to the TALE repressor concentration                         for n = 1, n = 0.5 and n = 2. Maximum production refers to a single                         plasmid.
We noticed that as we increase n, the steepness of the curve increases.                     Then we wanted to prove via the model, that n must be 1, in order for the                     system to function correctly. It is worth noting that the values ​​of all                     the parameters for this experiment will not be used. Although TALE has been                     found to have n = 1, different cooperativity may refer to different kinds                     of repressor and their association with different promoters. The assumption                     is that different cooperativities n will be due to a change of the promoter                     and thus the parameters that will change are kon koff and the maximum                     transcription rate of sfGFP, aGmax.
We got the results from 3 robustness analyses, for n = 1, n = 2, and n =                     0.5, using 10,000 different sets of parameters in each. The parameters of                     the model to be varied are the kon,koff of the TALE-DNA binding and maximum                     translation rate aG. The range obtained was based on what was used in the                     sensitivity analysis and is 0.001 to 10. Through this procedure we                     calculated the average sfGFP production for different copy numbers.

8/21/13
Although we got a decent band for our DspB PCR product, the amount of product and the concentration was low enough that we decided to run another cycle of PCR on the product to get more product and increase the concentration of our product.
Our PCR tubes were labeled:

DspB Control
8/23/13
We prepared and ran our PCR product on gel, however there was a problem with the gel and the ladder bled out, so we will re-run our product on gel again.
We also replated Bacillis subtilis on an LB plate and placed it in the 37 degree incubator.
8/28/13
Ran the Purelink Genomic DNA minikit with B. subtilis to prepare it for PCR and ran the product on a gel. Both samples gave a strong band so we definitely have a DNA template for running the PCR.

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," SynBio developments are not compromised, such as having better communication and cooperation between the SynBio community and society in general (Schmidt 2009) in order to ensure that the biosafety and biosecurity components are integrated in molecular and synthetic biology research. On this matter, it has been proposed that, by fostering both social intelligence and public knowledge about science, the contribution of science to benefit society is assured (van Doren & Heyen 2014).
In fact, progressively, more initiatives are being presented for the above reasons. For example, the SYNBIOSAFE project and the SynBio Engineering Research Centre (SynBERC), funded by the European Commission’s Seventh Framework Programme and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) respectively, aim to ensure a successful scientific development while gathering information about the risks and achievable strategies to minimise them (Calvert & Martin 2009).

Christian made 3 transformations; GFP, OMPA, and INP fused with YFP into TOP10 cells. GFP and OMPA were successful on AMP plates while INP fused with YFP needed to be re-plated on CM plates. The plasmid stocks of these genes are in our box in the freezer. Christian and Rebecca also made LB-AMP plates and tested them. LB-amp plates in the fridge were also tested. Cody performed a purification of PSB1C3. Cody performed a ligation of PSB1C3 and Erwinia and PSB1C3 and Xanthomonas as well as a relegation of PSB1C3 for control.

As signified by their high power to influence our project and interest, the aforementioned stakeholders-experts we contacted are mostly Researchers, University Professors and Clinical Doctors.
4. Finally, we've created a Risk Map to better understand the risks of the project in order to define areas of improvement in our method. You can find our risk map here .
The Risk Map showed us the areas on which we could improve our project. These are the possibility of false prediction of miRNA candidates for our classifier circuits based on conventional bioinformatic methods and the concern about a possible environmental ecosystems disruption. We moved towards the mitigation of such problems through extensive modeling of our classifier and by establishing several levels of safety . We also propose that a future treatment should be carried out in a controlled environment under the supervision of highly-trained clinicians.
Analysis
After a thorough examination of the literature, we've concluded that current methods of evaluation and reshaping of synthetic biology projects according to the stakeholders' feedback are limited and face the following problems:
-Socioeconomic and ethical issues are often dismissed [ 3 , 4 ]
-Upstream public engagement, often a proposed tool for integration of users' opinion in the design, is impaired by the complexity of synthetic biology as a whole [ 5 ]
-Multi-criteria analyses using stakeholders' judgement to assess an idea are not causally connected to the integration of this feedback in the technical, safety, ethical, societal aspects of a project [ 6 ]
Inspired by the work of Cummings & Kuzma et al., 2017 [ 1 ], we have developed a new methodological contribution to the field, termed OSIRIS (Optimized Societal Impact & Risk Integration System). OSIRIS constitutes a robust system that is capable of outlining risk factors and concerns in various fields and sectors, by analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from a multidisciplinary panel of experts with diverse perspectives and affiliations. The OSIRIS can assess, but is not limited to, the following factors:
-Health risks
-Health benefits
-Environmental risks
-Uncertainty
-Risk Manageability
-Commercialization potential
-Public concern
-Ethical dilemmas
It is a tool aimed to enhance risk governance by summarizing predicting risks and it is expanded in order to evaluate risk manageability and provide optimal solutions. We consider it a significant boost for iGEM teams to investigate and manage risks and safety parameters in a quantitative way and a robust screening tool to prioritize information collection, hazards identification and expert's opinion integration to the workflow of synthetic biology innovations.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#landmines_-_-_TEXT.html," methods for landmine detection.   To familiarize ourselves with the current methods in use for landmine detection and to understand better the upsides and downsides of these methods, we got in contact with different organizations that are active in this field.
The results of the interviews with Mr. Justin Brandy,senior adviser at Norwegian People’s Aid Mr. Justin Brandy , Ms. Suzanne Oosterwijk , Programme Officer Security & Disarmament at PAX, a Dutch peace organization (which was until recently known as IKV Pax Christi), Luitenant Kolonel (Lieutenant-Colonel) Bergman , commanding officer centre of expertise at Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie (EODD) in Soesterberg and Mr. Horst Lenz ,head of KampfmittelräumdienstRheinland-Pfalz (Bomb disposal team Rhineland-Palatinate) in Koblenz in Germany, helped us to gain a broad picture about the methods currently used for landmine detection and to asses their benefits along with opportunities for improvement.
Manual mine detection is one of the most common methods used. For instance, NPA relies primary on manual demining, using metal detection methods. This proved to be a cost-effective method compared with other possible alternatives. Usually, in countries where this organization is active the labor is quite cheap and this represents also a productive way to put people back to society.
Apart from this method, dogs are also used for landmines detection. NPA has a very large dog programme, being one of the leaders in using the canine detection. There are several advantages of using dogs. A mine-dog can find a mine buried as much as 6 metres deep in the ground or that have been laying buried for over 40 years. Next, on average can find a mine 20 times faster than a mine-clearance worker using a metal detector. However, dogs have several limitations, mainly due to the environmental conditions (eg. heat as well as the terrain). To overcome the dog usage limitations, there are experiments with loose free range dogs. Moreover, one organization is using rats for detection. The idea is similar as the dogs for the detection method.  However, “at the end the day they are back to one man detection” meaning that manual demining is still required.
Figure 1: Mine Detection Dogs [9]
More sophisticated methods for landmines detection are also available. For example, there is a tool sensor which uses a ground penetrating reader and a metal detector. The main disadvantage of the method represents the"

Basically, we are a self-funding team. Three of our team members paid the registration fee of $3500 at first, and then our college became willing to give us a experimental funding of $5000. And we paid the rest.
We are an independent group. We raised our own idea, we modified our idea, and we troubleshot the problems we encountered. And the reason we can technically survive without help from outside is we have talented core members, especially Mr.Jiang, who read mountains of papers and found solutions to many obstacles.

Duesseldorf (Lab)
The iGEM Team Duesseldorf, that was just founded this year, contacted us, because they were planning to work with yeast and were interested in a vector that we made RFC compatible last year ( BBa_K1680014 ). We had not only this particular vector, but also some sisters of it, as well as some of the pTUM vectors that were generated by Team TU Munich in 2012, in our freezer and were happy to provide them.
By sheer coincidence, two of our members were travelling to Duesseldorf a week after Team Duesseldorf had contacted us, so we could even bring them our collected yeast vectors in person and make sure that they could immediately use them for their experiments.
Our team member Nicolai von Kuegelgen hands over our parts and vectors.
Duesseldorf (Human Practice)
Collaborations are not only useful in Lab environment when the use of specific tools and materials can be shared, but also in Human Practices ideas can be realized much quicker and easier when teams are collaborating. To reach more people about synthetic biology, the iGEM team Duesseldorf approached eight other German iGEM teams, including us, with the idea to design different kinds of postcards which cover specific topics of synthetic biology, especially those that have or may have an influence on our everyday life. This format was excellent for collaboration with many other teams as each team only had to design one postcard, but these postcards reach a much bigger audience as they are distributed among eight iGEM teams all over Germany.
Post cards educate about different interesting topics of Synthetic Biology.
The covered topics are very diverse, from the recombinant production of Insulin to transgenes. All postcards together show the range of possibilities in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Our postcard covers the topic of gene editing (see below) and shows probable applications of genetic engineering today and in the future.
In summary, this collaboration achieves multiple goals of human practices. The series of postcards can educate a broad range of people with"

High school students in an iGEM environment
A Social Experiment
This year, for the first time, we carried out a bit of a social experiment: we invited a substantial number of local high school students to join the team. In the end, the team is composed of five high school students, in grades ranging from 10 to 12, and four undergraduates, one from each academic year and none with previous iGEM experience. The idea is two-fold: firstly, to extend the reach of the iGEM experience to a different audience of students, effectively expanding the outreach of synthetic biology; and secondly, to see if the different background and perspectives of younger students would have an impact on the nature of the science done.
Although we expected that the HS students would have formal coursework background, there were several unanticipated obstacles. One was school schedules. High school classes run until nearly the end of June, limiting the participation of the HS students during the initial phase of the project. Another was logistics and transportation. Generally the HS students neither lived on campus nor drove a vehicle, complicating their availability especially for after-hours lab sessions. However there were also unanticipated benefits. The younger students brought a level of enthusiasm which readily overcame any differences in background. Moreover, the undergraduates and HS students bonded during lab hours and discussions of topics ranging from religion (adherents of most of the world’s major groups were present) to card games and beyond.
As a result of our social experiment, we generated an iGEM handbook for high school students joining iGEM teams. This handbook is designed to help high school students understand what is being performed in basic laboratory techniques and provide a solid background information. It will also help them adapt to work in a synthetic biology lab as smoothly as possible. This handbook was written as peer-to-peer information, written by high school students for high school students.
Overall, the effort was demanding but positive, and something we will recommend all iGEM teams consider in future years.

Digestion of FlhD/C with pstI
Exp. 1
Methods: digestion and gel electrophoresis
protocols: RD1.1
Notes:
To verify the restriction site at 822bp in the FlhDC gene, FlhDC PCR product from Taq PCR was digested with pstI restrction enzyme. Samples were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel. Generuler 100bp DNA ladder was used as marker. Undigested FlhDC PCR product was used as control.
Results:
Gel electrophoresis:
Analysis:
Lane 2 and 5 contains the samples cut with pstI and shows a small DNA fragment below 100 bp. This seems to be primer dimers since the uncut bands lie at the same position as the cut. The experiment has to be made again.

Mutagenesis of PTS2
Imagine you need different protein concentrations in your artificial compartment. What to do? Take our modified PTS2 sequences with varying import efficiencies.
To characterize the import efficiency for the site-directed PTS2 firefly luciferase was used. Luciferase is a luminescent protein which can be split in a C- and a N-terminal part. Only when combined, luminescence can be detected. To measure the import efficiency the two parts will be expressed and imported into the peroxisome in a separated way. The smaller part (Split2) of the split luciferase will be brought into the peroxisome first via the PTS1 dependent pathway. The other part is imported via the respective modified PTS2 sequence. The better this sequence is recognized by Pex7, the stronger the luminescence of the assembled luciferase can be detected in the peroxisome. There is a chance of split parts of the luciferase assembling in the cytosol if the import is too slow. To avoid wrong conclusions of the luciferase localisation, we designed a negative control experiment. It includes a split luciferase similar to the one used in the initial experiment, but without the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Consequently there will be no import into the peroxisome. If we subtract the luminescence of the negative control experiment from the luminescence of the main experiment we can define the degree of import.
In addition to a directed approach according to Kunze and colleagues we also want to perform a random  mutagenesis experiment to alter the five variable amino acids of the core region of the PTS2 sequence in an unbiased manner. The aim is to generate a library of different peroxisomal PTS2. The 15 nucleotides are assembled by chance. In the DNA synthesis this sequence will either be described as [NNN]5 or [DNK]5. N stands for all four nucleotides mixed, K for either G or T and D for A,G or T. The “DNK” composition prohibits two out of three termination codons. Additionally with this library the amino acid frequency is improved towards a balanced ratio in between the different kinds (Dueber) .
Each approach could generate up to 415 DNA sequences, which is roughly 1,07 billion. On the level of the amino acid sequence there are 3,2 million possibilities, since each residue can be taken by 20 different amino acids.  For the assay we therefore need a high throughput method.

UChicago,2014,Team:UChicago#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," an optimized promoter, a reporter, and one or more mutators.
As the mutation rate of our construct increases, the rate of tyrosine production increases. However, in a feedback-regulated system, the transcription factor will bind to the desired molecule, in this case tyrosine, and cause the transcription-factor-regulated promoter to decrease expression. Thus, the mutation rate will decrease and the plasmid will decreasingly express a reporter gene. In order to observe low levels of expression, we chose mCherry, a strong variation of RFP. Human vision is most sensitive to red light, so using RFP would allow us to scan for low fluorescence and we would also be able to eye-ball whether or not the construct was working. We used part BBa_J06505.
For our promoter, we chose to use ParoF, a TyrR-regulated promoter that was found most-effective in response to tyrosine concentrations by Keasling and Chou (not sure if we’re doing footnotes, internal citations, etc). We received primers from Keasling and PCRed the promoter from wildtype E. coli. We designed universal primers to PCR-out the RBS--mutators from the IPTG--GFP--Mutator construct. By PCR-ing out active mutators, we reduce the amount of site-directed mutations we had to make. Additionally, by creating universal primers that can PCR-out an RBS and any of our mutators, it is easier to ligate additional mutators into our ParoF--mCherry construct to create combinations of mutators, our ultimate goal.
Generic Promoter--RBS--mutated TyrR
The sensor module requires a generic promoter and a tyrosine-sensitive transcription factor
TyrR is a transcription factor that binds to tyrosine. As the tyrosine levels increase, the mutation rate will begin to decrease because the ParoF promoter in the actuator module is regulated by TyrR dimers. We optimized TyrR through site-directed mutagenesis. Point mutations E274Q and N316K have been shown to increase TyrR’s ability to repress ParoF in the presence of tyrosine and thus increased the effectiveness of our system. We chose an IPTG-inducible promoter to allow us to control the expression of TyrR and thus control the efficiency level of our sensor module. We used part BBa_J04500.

Phase 1
In this phase, we produced the precursor to our project, zeaxanthin, in E. coli using a biobrick submitted by the Tokyo Tech iGEM team of 2010. After successfully inserting the genes into our cells, we then characterized this biobrick by optimizing the conditions required for sufficient cell growth and expression of zeaxanthin, as seen on our characterization page .
Phase 2
To successfully produce the components of saffron - i. e. crocin and safranal - it is necessary to ensure that the genes required produce their proper proteins. To do this, we grew up cell cultures, extracted the proteins from the cultures, and then ran SDS-PAGE gels to identify the proteins produced. Using this method, we clearly identified that our genes were properly producing their proteins.
Phase 3
To finish off the project, we wanted to actually make the red crocin and safranal, and then characterize production of these components in our cells. Due to time constraints, we were unable to finish the entirety of this phase and create our final desired product, as seen on this page , but we were still able to successfully clone in and express the genes necessary to take this final step. With more time, this project could be brought to completion.

     1.Training for iGEM
The iGEM program requires the interdisciplinary abilities. To approach this purpose, we designed a series of trainings including computer programming, biological experiment skills, etc. (The following photographs illustrates the process) The collegiate team from Zhejiang University provides an opportunity which shows us how the biological experiments run.
     2. Pre-research of project
We distributed questionnaires and conducted survey in order to learn about the current knowledge of local peoples towards cultural artifacts in Hangzhou. The following diagrams are analyzed by the data. According to the data, the current situation of protection and renovating towards cultural artifacts and synthetic biology does not have bright prospects. The lack of attentions in civilians can cause the enormous negative effects on research and the practical usage, so we organized a series of activities to publicize the cultural artifacts in Hangzhou, the synthetic biology.(more details in Publicity)
     3.Publicity
(1)To acquaint students synthetic biology, our team’s human practice group publicize this subject several times during the summer break in our city including the danger and benefits of transgenosis food that was familiar and relevant to the citizens.  Furthermore, we upload the basic synthetic biology knowledge in our school’s official website for months and update the latest information or the experimental knowledge at a time period.
(2)We hold a presentation in our school to introduce the iGEM to our successors. It consists that the general ideas of iGEM, the specific parts which are totally different from the biology competition in China, the judgements, also Q&A section and the advantages of taking this competition. Our team leader Andrew Luo gave an excellent lecture.
(3)As we mentioned before, to introduce local citizens the importance of cultural artifacts in this city,  we sent out the specialized post cards with 7 different kinds of landscape seals and our team seal in order to publicize our project and the local artifacts protection at the same time.

Virginia,2017,Team:Virginia#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," characterize the behavior of certain promoter elements in Pc. denitrificans. Our initial plan was to tie a standard GFP coding sequence to a termination sequence and ribosome binding site. Next, we worked on creating composite biobricks by using restriction digests on the prefix of this construct. Digested promoter sequences for VhB, Mn-SOD, and a T7 constitutive promoter will all be tied to the same RBS, CDS, and termination sequence, thus direct comparisons between promoter activity can be made. We measured promoter activity as a function of fluorescence emitted by transformed cells. The measurements will be made using a fluorometer or comparable equipment. Samples will then be compared to control untransformed bacteria. We used a qPCR detection system to measure fluorescence of transformed cells using the protocol and guidelines set by Utermark and Karlovsky (2006).
Circuit Design
The finished device will carry the coding sequences for amoABC, HAO, Cc554, and Ccm552 from N. europaea (Fig. 4). All ammonia oxidation genes from N. europaea are iGEM BioBricks and make up the composite part BBa_K1067005. The amoABC gene cluster encodes the proteins for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), a heterotrimeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia into a hydroxylamine intermediate (DTU-Denmark; Arp et al 2002). HAO encodes hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), which oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite. The genes for cytochromes A and X (as annotated in BBa_K1067005) encode for Cc554 and Ccm552, two c-type cytochromes. Cc554 accepts an electron from HAO and donates it to Ccm552, which then donates the electron to quinone or other more terminal electron acceptors. Together, these genes catalyze the conversion of ammonia into nitrites. The denitrification circuit will be placed behind a strong RBS and an Mn-SOD oxygen-inducible promoter (BBa_K258005).
Figure 4: Ammonia Oxidation Circuit: Our circuit for ammonia oxidation is mostly derived from BBa_K1067005. RBS sequences and an oxygen-sensitive VHb promoter have been added upstream of the coding sequences (CDS). An additional promoter has been added at the midpoint to minimize the risk of premature RNA polymerase drop-off.

Composite Parts
Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Composite Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."
