Notes:
Cut out as little gel as possible, i.e. cut out as close to the band as possible. This will ease the gel extraction.
DNA Extraction
Then, to extract the DNA from the gel, use the Qiagen gel purification kit. Follow the included protocol.
Supplementary notes
Weigh each sample on the microbalance, after taring with an empty tube.
In the elution step, when you have to centrifuge the column in a new Eppendorf tube, the tube's lid cannot be closed. Leave it open in the centrifuge, oriented towards the bottom right (i.e. behind the tube, as the platter rotates counter-clockwise).

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

A second part will attempt to explore the known concerted action of the parasites. Seasonal encystation and emergence of larvae occurs in a coordinated fashion, so the hypothesis is that the encysted strongyles react to a signaling compound. To find possible candidates for this compound a strategy is employed in which samples of infested host tissue are run through a battery of tests, and occurence of compounds is compared to a control of healthy tissue.
In our project we hope to perform studies to locate and identify this molecule. Since deworming drugs have no effect on encysted worms and killing of the relatively few grownups would induce cyst bursting, it would be important to figure out what the signaling molecule is for further study.
Modelling
Grass Sampling
Methods for detecting a strongyle infected field do exist, but they’re both tedious and time consuming. Our aim is to build reproducible and reliable models based on real world behaviour to reduce the area needed to sample. These models are based on the location and expected movement of the strongyles once outside of the horse.
Economic Modelling
A good model is a great tool to study the simplified behaviour of a real world problem. Often it can be more practical, time- and cost efficient to study the model of the real world system. We aim to showing the economic impact of strongyles and anthelmintic resistance.
In order to truly understand the expected market, cost and reach, we are opting for a predicting market analysis.
Global Worming and Society
Integrated Human practice
As you can see these little worms can cause a lot of harm. While we hope that our practical work will at least will contribute to the solution, all of the problems that come with these worms cannot be solved in a laboratory.
The strongyles harm the horses but the collateral damage is extensive - sentimental value, resistance against anthelmintics, the effect the drugs has on environment and the noteworthy economics are all involved. These are all aspects that make the issue bigger than it appears at first glance.
Raising Awareness
We’re attacking several angles to raise awareness for our project.  We plan to perform a market analysis of the problem, send questionnaires out to better judge the severity of the problem and to participate in local radio shows. We’ve even been published in a local magazine, explaining the problem and raising awareness locally.
As our team is partly international we will try to spread the questionnaire to other countries besides Sweden, in hope of getting results reflecting the extent of the issue of strongyles on a bigger scale.

The Importance of Collaboration
The iGEM Competition stresses the importance of collaborations between scientists and encourages teams to significantly collaborate with one or more iGEM teams. Collaboration is an important component of scientific research in general, as it teaches will-be scientists to exchange ideas and assist others in their innovations. Our team has collaborated with several iGEM teams as well as a team of undergraduate researchers outside of the iGEM Competition.
University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM Team
Our collaboration with the University of Minnesota (UM) iGEM team began when four UCSC team members Skyped with two members of the UM team. During the meeting, we exchanged information about our projects and our progress on them, and we noticed that the human practices portion of UM’s project was lacking; with our strong background in outreach and human practices, we helped UM develop their own. Four of our iGEM team members met the UM team at their lab in Minnesota. When talking with them, we realized that their project had much more potential value than they were aiming for; we advised their team to reach out to areas affected by their project target (mercury ion pollution), and to speak with  environmental regulatory groups in Minnesota to gain insight about potential users. We also suggested they start a crowdfunding campaign so their entire team can attend the Jamboree in Boston, since they had not considered that to be an option. We believe we significantly helped the UM team by mentoring them in these various aspects of their project.
iGEM Team in Montpellier, France
We discovered an iGEM team in Montpellier, France through the iGEM Troubleshooting & Collaborations Facebook page created by iGEM Thessaloniki. Their project, Vagineering, aims to create a non-hormonal contraceptive. Our projects both address inadequate access to contraception, so we were interested in collaborating with them. UCSC team members Skyped with the Montpellier members and discussed our projects and progress. We suggested that the Montpellier team spend more"

7/15/13
These results gave us some very useful data.  We saw that LB broth worked better for growing phage than M9 in this experiment.  By comparing the supernatants of the liquid cultures, LB showed one plaque at 10^-8, and M9 showed zero plaques below 10^-6.  However, the lysed bacterial pellet for LB had many plaques at 10^-9, while the lysed M9 pellet had 2 plaques at 10^-9.  This shows that there are more than 10 times the amount of phage inside the bacteria than outside.  This is good, because any phage inside the bacteria are progeny phage which must have been exposed to the mutagen as they were assembling. Next, we will run the phage through a sucrose or CsCl to try to isolate fractions of large phage and image them. We also need to refine our EM prep technique.

SDU-Denmark
Welcome to the wiki for the 2017 iGEM team of the University of Southern Denmark! Our project this year focuses on green energy through bioelectricity in the form of a bacterial solar battery. This device will be constructed to contain two cultures of genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). A photosynthesising E. coli will produce a carbon source in the form of cellulose, by fixating carbon dioxide through Calvin Cycle and harvesting energy from sunlight. When switched on, the second E. coli will break down the formed cellulose by secreting cellulase through the cellulase secretion system. Once cellulose is broken down, cellobiose can enter the second E. coli and be broken down to glucose by introduction of periplasmic beta-glucosidase. Electrons will then be harvested from the anaerobic glycolysis of glucose to facilitate an electrical current. The electron transfer will be mediated by bacterial nanowires retrieved from Geobacter sulfurreducens.
Our device will be designed to resemble a leaf, in which way it can contribute to a better city ambience when integrated into an urban environment. For the implementation of our device in an urban environment, we will collaborate with city planning experts, with focus of implementation of our device into our home city, Odense. This way, our device can be optimised to reach its full potential and thereby fulfill the needs for a greener future.

Hi
Welcome to our team, SDU-Denmark, from the University of Southern Denmark. We are bla bla bla, in the Presentation-section you will be able to say meet our team members, all the wonderful people who contributed to our project, the interesting collaborations we were able to make during the summer with other iGEM teams and lastly a list of what we did this year to complete the criteria required for a gold medal.

The event gave us great insight on what matters to the community, and we even got ideas on how to expand the sensor in the future!
Launch Party
To kick off the iGEM season, and raise some money for jamboree, we held a team launch party. For the fundraising, members of our team collected, and in some cases created, items to be auctioned off at the party. We ended up with a beautiful auction, consisting of a serene hillside painting by Brendan Studebaker, one of our instructors, an amazing drawing on a papercut backdrop by Heidi Xu, a team member, and a stunning framed photo taken by Ian Gutierrez, a team member. During the event we spoke to guests about what our project was, and received input on how to make it even better. Since it was still the beginning of the season, it was the perfect time for us to talk to the community about what they wanted to see in an arsenic test.
Our App
This year, our tech savvier team members created an app to introduce our project! The goal of the app is much like the goal of our project: to make something that anyone can use. It’s a simple design that introduces the sensor in an engaging and entertaining environment. Hearing the words “synthetic biology” can be scary for some people, so it was important that our app be as accessible as possible. You play as our plasmid, out on an adventure to test samples. The goal is to get as far as possible while avoiding the towers of unknown DNA. Players can go for a personal best, or compete with their friends for the high score!
Social Media
Over the course of this iGEM season, members of our team have kept the community up to date with our project, through social media! Having an active digital presence helped us to stay in touch with what iGEM teams, and team members, from around the world. We started off the year with a team blog. It had detailed weekly updates about everything we were working on, but it didn’t allow for much communication with viewers. We switched over to an Instagram, and found much better results! Reaching nearly 40 posts this year, the account kept us in close contact with almost 100 iGEM teams that we wouldn’t have met otherwise. Every week we posted a “Meet the Team Monday” to spotlight the achievements of someone on our team. For every long day spent in the lab, we made a post to remember"

A highly specific test will have lots of false negatives but few false positives. Switch to high sensitivity .
The sensitivity and specificity of a screening tool depend on the cutoffs used on a Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and as one increases the other is likely to decrease. Depending on the type of screening we want to do, we can alter the cutoffs on the ROC curve.
For a high-risk screening (e.g. heavy smokers for NSCLC), we would set the cut-offs at 100% sensitivity so it would always pick up NSCLC, and compromise on the specificity which would be at 84%. For mass population screening, we would use a 100% specificity cut-off which would cause the sensitivity to be 56%. The cutoffs here are based on Hennessy et al.'s ROC curve for miRs-15b-5p and 27b-3p in diagnosing NSCLC. [3]
The ROC curve for the two miRNAs we are using is shown here. The area under curve (AUC) of 98% represents the accuracy of the test.

The choice to use high specificity for mass population ensures would minimize false positive rates for cost efficiency necessary for population wide screening. However, the low sensitivity means that some people with cancer may not be referred for further testing, and are thus left untreated. Through using many miRNA signatures in tandem, we would try to reduce the rate of false negatives.  The goal of mass population screening is also to pick up as many people with a cancer, as early as possible, not everyone, meaning the lower sensitivity would be acceptable.
In the case of high risk screening, the low specificity (and thus higher false positive rate) is less problematic than it may seem, as the ratio of positives to negatives in the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset"

Tip: Store plates inverted at 4°C in a dark room or wrapped in aluminum foil to preserve light-sensitive antibiotics. Do not store for longer than 3 months as antibiotics may degrade.
Antibiotics
Bacterial strains carrying plasmids or genes with antibiotic selection markers should always be cultured in liquid or on solid medium containing the selective agent. Lack of antibiotic selection can lead to loss of the plasmid carrying the genetic marker and potentially to selection of faster-growing mutants!
Tip: Prepare stock solutions of antibiotics separately from batches of liquid or solid media, sterilize by filtration, aliquot, and store in the dark at –20°C. Recommended stock and working concentrations for commonly used antibiotics are shown in the table Concentrations of commonly used antibiotics.
Tip: Before adding antibiotics to freshly autoclaved medium, ensure that the medium has cooled to below 50°C. Ampicillin (sodium salt)  50 mg/ml in water  –20°C  100 µg/ml (1/500)

Upon going to Kosuri lab, it was found that ampicillin plates were already available.  Fasih mentioned that they may be a few months old.
Conclusions: If access is available, the Yeates strain will be streaked on Sunday evening to allow for protein expression throughout next week.  A meeting with Dr. Kosuri should be made in order to outline the experimental approach.
Intro: Today Nithin, Phil, and I got certified to work in Sri's lab. Amp plates and other materials are in the iGEM cabinet in the cold room. I designed primers to express the cage within the iGEM vector to minimize transformations. Researched protein expression stuff.
iGEM Expression Primers:

handle-iGEM prefix-T7 promoter-RBS-spacer-gene
suffix
gene-his tag-double stop codons-iGEM suffix-handle
The primers had -25 kJ/mol homodimer association and other pretty bad secondary structures. However, the sites of interest were the restriction sites from the iGEM suffixes etc, so there isn't any redesign we can do. Oh well...

Mass action kinetics
Mass action kinetics is the assumption that the rate of reaction is proportional to concentration of the reactants. We chose to create a mass action kinetics model as we could use relatively few parameters. Reducing the number of parameters, whilst keeping the model representative of the system, made it easier to understand the effect of varying each parameter. We built the model in MATLAB first, and later ported it to JavaScript to make it a better design tool for the biologists and better communicate how the model works.
Graph interactivity
We spent a long time reviewing previous teams models. A problem we found was that most models weren’t communicated in a way that was engaging and easy to understand. We’ve tried to explain our model in a way that someone with no experience in modeling could understand.
We’ve used interactive graphs on this page - when you get to them you can drag the sliders to change parameters and see how they affect the system.
We initially ported our model to a webpage so the design team could try out new stuff when they were designing our toehold switches. This turned out to be very useful for both of us. We decided to make it look a lot nicer and improve its compatibility with different browsers so we could put it on the wiki.

These bacteria, in place of MotA and MotB proteins, use homologous membrane proteins PomA and PomB. These proteins function as Na+ channels and ensure that the necessary energy for flagellar rotation is generated as Na+ passes along the channel. Furthermore, in bacteria that use Na+ channels to power their flagella, there are MotX and MotY proteins which are localized in the outer membrane These two proteins stabilize the binding of PomA/B proteins to the motor Flagella that work by Na+ have greater speed and rotational power that those that depend on H+.
Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the proton-driven bacterial flagellar motor. The flagellar motor consists of a reversible rotor made of FliF, FliG, FliM and FliN and a dozen stators, each of which consists of MotA and MotB. FliF forms the MS ring within the cytoplasmic membrane. FliG, FliM and FliN form the C ring on the cytoplasmic face of the MS ring. OM, outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan layer; CM, cytoplasmic membrane.
Both MotA and PomA proteins have 4 membrane-spanning region, a huge cytoplasmic fold and a C-terminal end. Yet MotB and PomB has only one membrane-spanning region.

In work by M. Homma et al, a host of chimeric proteins were generated by combining different parts of the stator proteins (MotB and PomB) from the two systems mentioned above. .  Many experiments were done to show the activity of the chimeric stator proteins and to identify the most effective of these.  According to their data, the most effective protein was (PotB59)(PomB7E) which was generated by combining the N-terminal tail of PomB with the periplasmic C-terminal tail of MotB. . In order to understand how effective this protein worked, many experiments were conducted with this chimeric protein in combination with MotA and PomA.  According to results from these experiments, the most effective rotor system was PomA/PotB59. This st"

d. (Problem) Are any proteins known to associate (chemically) strongly with Ag43? This question has significant impact on the diversity of proteins to which cellfifuge can be applied, if certain proteins of interest associate rather strongly with Ag43, some fraction of it will be removed with the Ag43, reducing yield.
e. (Problem,  Offshoot) Is it possible and if so, how can this system be implemented in gram positive bacteria and eukaryotes? This is of special importance if cellfifuge is to be applied to produce proteins with post-translational modifications.
f. (Suggestion) The arrangement of the cells in a cluster (aggregated because of Ag43 expression) is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration while calculating the drag force on the cluster and as a result, will affect the sedimentation coefficient of the cluster (the ”rate” at which the cluster settles down). This parameter was included as a part of our model of Ag43 sedimentation because of an SVCE faculty’s opinion.
Some of the issues we raised during the meet about the other team’s ideas:
The afternoon session consisted primarily of a discussion on troubleshooting protocols such as 3A assembly, more specifically, verifying restriction digestion, eliminating self-ligated products etc. Troubleshooting protocols – inputs from our iGEM team towards the SVCE team:
a. Ampicillin plates should be incubated only for ~16 hours (degradation of Amp, appearance of satellite colonies after that point). Working on a plasmid with a Chloramphenicol resistance in the backbone is preferable to Ampicillin.
b. Verifying Restriction Digestions before 3A assembly: Gel electrophoresis results were inconclusive - one of the digested fragments was only 100bp smaller than the undigested fragment and the resolution using normal sized gels and ladders was not sufficient to see this difference clearly; also, the 100bp fragment expected was not seen.
We suggested running the gel for a very short period of time (~15 minutes) as the 100bp fragment may have been run out of the gel due to the passage of current for a long time.
A PCR with appropriate primers (anneals to regions on both sides of the restriction site, cannot anneal at the annealing temperature after digestion due to a shorter region of annealing with each digested fragment compared to the undigested fragment)  was also"

ACC deaminase
High levels of ethylene, produced under stressed conditions, can inhibit certain processes such as root elongation. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, which regulates ethylene production by metabolizing ACC (an immediate precursor of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants) into α-ketobutyrate and ammonia，simultaneously enhances plant growth and biomass by P solubilization and uptake particularly under stress condition by heavy metals. In our project, we aimed for increasing ability of transgenic plants expressing the bacterial enzyme ACC deaminase to accumulate heavy metals.
Summary
We hope to establish a sustainable, regulable and reusable project to solve the soil polluted by heavy metals. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria have important functions. In our project, we used the mechanism of the alliance between microbe and plant, by manufacturing Bacillus megaterium, which is a kind of phosphate-solubilizing microorganism exists in the root system, forcing it enhance the plant remediation from two aspects, accumulating heavy metals and defend adversity stress. To achieve the goal of spatial specificity, we make most of the expression system which is regulated by root organic acid. We also used MBP (metal binding protein) and ACC deaminase to make accumulation of heavy metal in root system’s soil success. Finally, heavy metals will"

, which is almost twice the threshold value at which E. coli would no longer grow. However, in this project we only need the ​E. coli to survive in the sugar water. This only needs to be as long as the worker bees require to pick the BeeT-cells up and bring them to where the Varroa destructor are. The question we try to answer is: does our chassis survive in the sugar water, and if so, for how long?
Modeling E. coli Survival
In order to make this model a technique called Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) was used to describe the relationship between the metabolism of the E. coli and the osmotic pressure of the sugar water. FBA is a mathematical method that can be used for predicting reaction fluxes and optimal growth rates of species using genome-scale reconstructions of their metabolic networks. In this case we used it to specifically predict the effect of water efflux on the total amount of ATP the cell has available for maintenance. The model used as a base for this analysis was iJO1366 3 from the BIGG database . We modified the model to represent an E. coli in a sugar water-like environment using CobraPy 4 . We also changed the objective of the optimization such that the ATP-maintenance reaction should be maximized. Then we ran the model 1000 times whilst sequentially"

Meanwhile, among all the orthogonal SynTF-SynPro pairs we constructed and test, our favorite ones were SynTF(S)-PIP-SynPro(S)-PIP;4* and SynTF(S)-ZF43-8-SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;8*. The combining results in pink rectangles show that they are both with low leakage, and the thresholds were far separated (PIP: -71 folds; ZF43-8: -8 folds) (Figure 5C , S2D, E) . So far, we have characterized and obtained two promising SynTF-SynPro pairs to use in the Stripe module.

At least 20,000 cells were analyzed for each condition in both histogram and each grid in the heat map. Data are recorded by FACS at 24h after co-transfecting.
Conclusion
First, we have established a cell model with heterogeneous surEGFP expression and characterized the expression pattern of two HCC cell line (Huh-7, SMMC-7721) with different GPC3 expression level as our physiological model. Second, we engineered a functional SynNotch and proved they can generate response upon binding to their corresponding ligands. Third, we have mathematically modeled our transcription network in the Stripe model, and confirmed our design will generate tri-response with one heterogeneous antigen. Fourth, we used two approaches to wire SynTF-SynPro pair. We constructed, characterizes a set of pairs and obtain two optimal SynTF-SynPro pairs. We are still one step away from demonstrating the feasibility of SynNotch-Stripe experimentally, and we are doing it right now. We believe it is a promising platform for the next generation"
Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," as the bacterium won't divide instantly when reaching a specific mass. There will be a time-lapse before the bacterium can divide.
For our simulations, we set the default parameters found in the Indisim simulation on the growth of bacteria on agar plates, but these parameters can be modified by the user.
Plasmid loss
Bacterial plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements that can be transferred from one bacterium to another.  We chose with this model to implement the horizontal and vertical transfer of genes between these bacteria.
The vertical transfer of genes is the transmission of a plasmid from a cell to its daughter cell after division. During the division, it is assumed that the daughter bacterium can fail to receive the plasmid with a given probability p : this phenomenon is known as segregative loss.  As the probability is directly taken from data from the scientific press [4] , and as its source doesn't take into account the copy number of plasmid, we also chose not to.
Horizontal gene transfer, also known as conjugation is the direct transfer of genetic material between two bacterium located near each other. Conjugation happens for each plasmid-bearing cell at each time-step. If there is a plasmid free cell in a neighbour square, conjugation can occurs at a rate also taken from press to fit experimental data. It is also considered as an instantaneous event, thus being a simplification of the real process.
Figure 4: Segregation loss
Figure 5: Conjugation at rate c
We also consider plasmid cost for a bacterium. Indeed, when there is no antibiotic in the environment, plasmid-free bacteria have an advantage over plasmid-bearing ones.
4.  Assessment
Our actual version
Our actual version implements in a simple way bacterial growth and plasmid transmission and loss. A graphical interface allows the user to set different parameters and to run a simulation which outputs a figure plotting the number of bacteria as a function of time (as you can see below):
Figure 6: Simulation using the Indisim-method based on bacterial growth. Parameters were : simulation time = 600 min, time-step = 4.19 min, initial number of bacteria = 10000. Others parameters were the ones set by default.
Furthermore, we also tried to put to the test the data given by the simulation. We used for that experimental data [5] of different densities of donor bacteria and recipients on agar slides at stationnary phase in function of initial cell densities.
Unfortunately, the figures obtained were not conclusive. We"

Transformation and integration into the B. subtilis chromosome
Validation of chromosomal integration
Next, we transformed the correct plasmids to (self made) competent Bacillus, as described in the protocol section. For plasmid pGFP-ncl08 and pGFP-agr, bacillus was plated on chloramphenicl (5 microG/ml) and for plasmid pJWV021-ncl08, bacillus were plated on kanamycin (5 microG/ml). Next day, Bacillus transformants were subseqently streaked to single colonies on selective agar plates. To check for correct integration of the pGFP-ncl08 and pGFP-agr plasmids at the amyE locus, single colonies were streaked on nutrient agar plates containing 1% starch. If a double crossover event occured, cells are not able to produce AmyE and will not degrade starch, thus no 'halo' around the colony. 2 individual colonies without an halo were grown and stocked and used for later analyses. To check correct integration of the pJWV021-ncl08 plasmid in the Bacillus chromosome, single colonies were streaked on minimal medium plates containing either glucose or sucrose as the sole carbon source. If the plasmid integrated correctly at the sacA locus via a double crossover, cells cannot utilise sucrose anymore and will not grow on the minimal plate containing sucrose, but will grow on the glucose plate. Again, 2 correct transformants were selected"

For the second day of the Judd School trip the team led a synthetic biology talk for the students there and recorded a few more interviews. We received very positive feedback about the board game and the school asked for their own copy.
The morning lab team tested the cells that they cultured overnight, but the OD600 was lower than expected, and transformed the competent cells.
We also released part 1 of our ‘Meet the Team’ videos, signalling the start of our YouTube channel.

We checked on the competent cells transformed the previous day and all the colonies expressed strong fluorescence however the interlab parts had not worked.
During researching for data to put into our powerpoints for the Big Bang Science Fair we found that all the data on public perception of synthetic biology was rather out of date.
We decided to set up a synthetic biology survey which we intend to leave it running for the duration of our project and then analyse the data we have collected.
We Skyped Westminster and Purdue and now we’re setting up follow up talks with both teams to try and sort out potential collaborations.

Most of the day was spent preparing presentations of our project ideas for an upcoming meeting with academics. We focused on the PAF idea, the genome integration idea and the kill switch idea. The viral-vector fungal killswitch idea was scrapped as there were too many potential flaws for us to iron out in the ten week process.
We met with last year’s Exeter iGEM team and discussed our ideas, what we’re doing for human practises and just general advice they wanted to give us.

Bearing that in mind, three of our team’s members, Elissavet, Asteris and Charis applied to participate in the 1st Volos Summer School of Human Genetics organized by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. All three of them got accepted along with 17 MSc students and PhD candidates and headed to Volos, Greece in May.  At the 1st Volos Summer School of Human Genetics, our wet lab members attended lectures about analysing large scale data, conducted genome-wide association studies, took part in biostatistics workshops and familiarized with tools such as PLINK and various R packages. All in all, the summer school was a great opportunity for us to gain new skills but also to discuss with other scientists across Europe about our project and the technical hurdles we encountered in our modeling approach.

Vector construction
To synthesize astaxanthin and delete antibiotic resistance selection marker gene, six gene expression cassettes were assembled into a TAC-based binary acceptor vector, designated as pYLTAC380MF-BBPC (Figure 1), by multiple rounds of gene assembly cycles using our marker-free TransGene Stacking II system, in which contained four genes (CrtI, PSY, BKT and BHY) under the control of 4 different endosperm-specific promoters for astaxanthin biosynthesis, and two genes (HPT and Cre) for marker-free deletion.

(B) Restriction analysis of a series of multigene constructs containing different numbers of genes (from lanes 3 to 6). Arrows indicate the different insertion genes.
Rice transformation
The multigene construct pYLTAC380MF-BBPC was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by electroporation. Then the Agrobacterium cells were co-cultured with embryogenic calli induced from mature seeds of Indica rice varieties Huaguang1 (HG1) as described (Lin et al., PNAS, 2003, 100: 5962-5967). Regenerating calli were selected in the presence of 50 mg/L hygromycin and subsequently transferred to rooting medium containing hygromycin. After further culturing for 3 to 4 weeks, transformed plants were transferred to soil in a greenhouse.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html," AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 show higher fluorescence maxima in presence of ATP.
To analyze the functionality of our small molecule sensor system, we amplified all constructs, including, Spinach2, c-di-GMP Spinach2 and ATP Aptamer Spinach2 sensors by PCR and transcribed them in vitro successfully. The RNA was analyzed for its specific binding to a small molecule by a highly sensitive fluorometer. Figure 4 shows the results of the fluorescence measurements. All Spinach2 systems show fluorescence maxima at 500 nm in presence of the ligand. The original Spinach2
Paige2011
was applied as an internal control and shows the highest fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4A). As another internal control we tried to reproduce the data for the c-di-GMP Spinach2 system (Fig. 4B). Indeed, highest fluorescence maximum for the c-di-GMP Spinach2 system was measured in presence of the ligand. Thus we were able to reproduce the data shown by Kellenberger et al. In addition, we observed a new second peak for the c-di-GMP Spinach2. The second maxima appears at Em= 552 nm. The red light shift also exists in the spectrum of the c-di-GMP Spinach2 without ligand with a lower peak. Finally, we analyzed the fluorescent properties of our new ATP Aptamer Spinach2 constructs (Fig. 4C). The Spinach2 containing the Szostak ATP Aptamer shows the lowest fluorescence of all three ATP Aptamer Spinach2 variations. The JAWS-generated ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 show higher fluorescence maxima in presence of the ligand. Due to its perfect fluorescence properties we applied the ATP AptamerJWAS1 for further studies.
Common Techniques of Sensing Small Molecules in Biochemical Reactions
Analyzing biochemical reactions depend on radioactive labeling. Yet, many laboratories try to avoid the usage of radioactivity since it is connected to affect the health. Our established ATP Aptamer Spinach2 sensor system enables the sensing low concentrated small molecules like ATP within in vitro assays. In this context the change of ATP concentration during the in vitro transcription reaction is an attractive target to study. NTPs are genially consumed by a RNA polymerase over time. To monitor the decrease of ATP during a successful in vitro transcription, we applied thin layer chromatography first (Fig. 5). To analyze ATP and not GTP/CTP or UTP by the TLC, the remaining ATP was converted to AMP"

Problem:  Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
Since the entry into force of the Stockholm Convention in 2004 the insecticide Dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan (DDT) is only allowed for the abatement of disease-carrying insects such as the malaria carrying Anopheles dirus mosquito [ La-Aied Prapanthadara et al.,1996 ]. This measure was the consequence to the devastating consequences for the ecosystem by the widespread use of DDT, which continuously grew due to it's strong insecticidal properties. Despite the regulation in 2004, DDT still poses an environmental threat today due to its stability and capacity to accumulate in tissue [ Turusov et al.,2002 ].
Current Solution
The simultaneous degradation of mixed insecticides like DDT can be achieved by mixed insecticide enriched isolated cultures in media and soil such as the mixed fungal population (white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium). The degradation efficiency of DDT can be enhanced by using carbon (mannitol) and nitrogen (sodium nitrate) in the liquid media. Based on the disadvantages which bring along the diverse strategies like chemical treatment, incineration, and landfills the development of the so called soil microflora method leads to a positive effect concerning to the detoxification of pesticides. The poor fungal growth in the media and concomitant biodegradation of insecticides is caused by toxicity exerted by high concentrations of the substrate which explains the low degradation at high concentrations.

In context to prove the bioaccumulation and to develop an effective methode of removing DDT, we envision the usage of the cytoplasmatic GST 1-1, also known as DDT Dehyrochlorinase. Along with the creation of transgenic Physcomitrella patens plants ( PF-13 ) we used the biobrick from the Caltech iGEM team 2011 .

OVERVIEW
NUSGEM is delighted to have interacted with so many teams around the world! We believe that collaborations have made our project more meaningful, and we are excited to share with you about our collaborations with the following teams!
TEAM CUHK-HONG KONG: WETLAB CHARACTERIZATIONS
NUSGEM initially wanted to explore using RNA aptamers as a reporter system for our stress promoter (PhtpG1) and blue light repressible promoter. However, we faced many difficulties in constructing our aptamers reporter system and we could not get a successful construct for many months. However, we read that the Team CUHK was working on aptamers. Hence our team leader, Nanda, met up with them in Hong Kong.
Nanda (far left) with the members from CUHK iGEM team
After an exciting discussion in Lee Woo Sing College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, both teams saw a great collaboration opportunity between us, discovering many aspects of our projects which we could collaborate in - wetlab, modelling and hardware.
Selfie on a beautiful Sunday morning!
The two teams concluded our meeting by agreeing to keep in contact, and we continued to discuss intensively on our collaboration even after Nanda returned to Singapore. Eventually, we decided to collaborate on wetlab!
As the CUHK team worked on a RNA-based project, they were urgently looking for a particular strain of E. coli, BL21 Star. It is an RNase-knockout strain that will allow them to maximize RNA production. They asked whether our lab has this E. coli strain - we do! Without any hesitation, we shipped the strain over to them.
On the other hand, NUSGEM needed help on RNA aptamers constructions. Team CUHK kindly offered their expertise by redesigning our RNA aptamer constructs, as well as designing suitable primers to increase the chances of successful construction. In addition, they incorporated the RNA aptamer that they aimed to characterise, tRNAL"

About Our Lab
1.Chassis and Organism
The chassis organism is human bladder cancer cell line 5637 and T24.The organism used for control group are Hela（cervical carcinoma cell) and HFC (human fiber epithelial cell).
Experiment environment
We handle the biological material in Ultra clean bench and Cell Culture Laboratory. For protective equipment, for example, we use a board to protect ourselves from the X-ray when we are doing gel extraction under the gel imager.
Rules and Regulations on safety
1.Link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution
The college of Biology and Life Science has clear regulation about the safety of biology labs including the pre-training courses on safety manipulation before experiment in the labs,docunmenting record in the labs etc.We have Laboratory And Equipment Department at our institution which is responsible for our biological safety.The officers have inspected our laboratory and gave us suggestions about biosafety, which were already fulfilled as request. Regulations of laboratory safety and environmental management of Shenzhen University
2.Regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories
Safety management method for gene engineering in China
Risk of Project
1.Potential risk and solutions
If the experiment did not proceed carefully that result in the leak of the culture medium, the bacteria may breed at a considerable speed especially for the human cell culture medium and serum we would use in our lab.Thus it will contaminate the lab.To prevent this,we instruct every student to learn the lab regulations and they are asked to check the vessels and dispose the waste well before exiting from the lab. Referring to the case that people carry the extraneous bacteria into the lab without disinfection, we have strict hygiene standard which requires all entrants to wear the lab coat and disinfect before experiment.
2.future work and risk solutions
If the system develops well in the future,it could be injected into human body to cure the bladder cancer. When doing so,though our system won't hurt normal cells,the translation of effector gene before termination codon may cause burden to normal cells.To reduce these risk, when we designed the mutation site,we choose the site as far as possible close to the front.

UAB-Barcelona,2009,Team:UAB-Barcelona#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," is important to note that a certain process can be described in more than one way.
• A biological object can be investigated with different experimental methods.
• Each biological process can be described with different (mathematical) models.
• A mathematical formalism may be applied to different biological instances.
• The choice of a mathematical model or an algorithm to describe a biological object depends on the problem, the purpose, and the intention of the investigator.
• Modeling has to reflect essential properties of the system. Different models may highlight different aspects of the same instance.
This ambiguity has the advantage that different ways of studying a problem also provide different insights into the systems. An important disadvantage is that the diversity of modeling approaches makes it very difficult to merge established models.
Stochastic Processes
The use of differential equations for describing biochemical processes makes certain assumptions that are not always justified. One assumption is that variables can attain continuous values. This is obviously a simplification, since the underlying biological objects, molecules, have discrete nature. As long as molecule numbers are sufficiently large this is no problem, but if the involved molecule numbers are only on the order of dozens or hundreds, the discreteness should be taken into account. Another important assumption of differential equations is that they treat the described process as deterministic. Random fluctuations are normally not part of differential equations. Again, this presumption does not hold for very small systems. A solution to both limitations is to use stochastic simulation approach that explicitly calculates the change of the number of molecules of participating species during the time course of a chemical reaction.
Steady States
The concept of stationary states is important for the modeling of dynamical systems. Stationary states are determined by the fact that the values of all state variables remain constant in time. The asymptotic behavior of dynamic systems is often stationary. The consideration of steady states is actually an abstraction that is based on a separation of time scales. While fast processes often reach a quasi-steady state after short transition period, the change of the value of the slow variables is often negligible in the time window of consideration. Thus each steady state can be regarded as a quasi-steady state of a system that is embedded in a larger non-stationary environment. Although the concept of stationary states is a mathematical idealization, it is important in kinetic modeling since it points to typical behavioral modes of investigated system and the respective mathematical problems are frequently easier to solve.
Modeling global transcription
The activity of every bacterial gene depends on the concentration of free RNA polymerase, [Rf], and on the promoter-specific Michaelis-Menten parameters, Vmax and Km, that determine the RNA polymerase"

Alice recorded an episode of ‘Desert Island… Science?’ with Professor Chris Lintott over Skype. Professor Lintott is the second academic outside of the university to participate in our YouTube series, and is best known for his work as a presenter on the BBC show ‘The Sky At Night’.
In preparation for the upcoming deadline on 12.08.16, the biologists wrote and uploaded our project title and abstract to the iGEM team page (as they have a better technical understanding), and we settled on our track being ‘Measurement’.
Today’s lab team was Dan, Eloise, Jack, Pablo and Joel. All the overnights from yesterday grew successfully, so they made glycerol stocks of, miniprepped and carried out qubits of the cultures. The pJET reverse GFP was sent off for sequencing.
The DNase1 and Lysozyme, however, did not grow any colonies despite the positive and negative controls both being successful. The lab team redid Modular Cloning and transformations of DNase1 and Lysozyme.
The sequencing results came back for Killer Red and Killer Orange, confirming the mini stat contained the right DNA products. Killer Orange was transformed into an inducible strain, and they intend to do the same with Killer Red. The mini stat showed significant colour differences in the chambers, indicating different rates of growth of the RFP plasmid in types of LB media (no salt had the least fluorescence).

Our team t-shirts and hoodies/sweatshirts arrived from Supply Line Solutions, and they look fantastic! It’ll definitely make the team look more like a team at Westminster, acting as a type of informal uniform.
The lab team for today consisted of Dan, Eloise, Jack and Pablo. Pablo carried out qubits on reverse GFP to determine DNA part concentration, then began Modular Cloning on reverse GFP using the pJET parts. They transformed the Killer Red 3 strain into BL21DE3 (a strain of competent E. coli cells), Lysozyme and DNase1 into DH5α E. coli cells.

Dear friends,
We are so glad to have you here. On this page, we will take you back to all the stories that happened this summer. You are going to see how ECHO grows from a simple idea to a complete project and eventually turns into reality. You can also find out how our team grows from 18 individuals to one collective.
In the first chapter, you are going to see how the idea of ECHO first popes up. And then the four essential consisting parts are being told from chapter two to four. To make our story complete, we will introduce you the final destination of our bacteria-- the two loaders we have chosen. As for the final chapter we would like you to know more about our amazing human practice as well as the conclusion of the entire project.
Now follow us to start the amazing trip.

On the first day of blazing June, which happened to be the International Children’s Day, ECHO was brought up by Kairan Zhang. But at that time, ECHO has only one part, the acoustic reporter gene (arg). We found it extremely interesting since nowadays researchers often use fluorescent proteins or beta-galactosidase as reporters. But what if we develop a brand new reporting system that involves unique characteristics? Is it possible that we can use this to conquer an existing problem?
With this ultimate goal in mind, we go on brainstorming over and over again. And we came up with all these amazing ideas listed below.
Detection of intestinal flora
Pharmacological research
Detection of metabolism
However, none of these listed above really struck us. Until one day, we came across an article the author has used the args on imaging in vivo using ultrasound. We immediately realized that the most suitable application and the biggest advantage of args is imaging in vivo and this is exactly the key point of diagnosis in modern medicine.
After connecting args with ultrasound, we did tons of research about human diseases and at last we chose colon cancer as our target disease for the multiple reasons. First, colon cancer has a high morbidity both in China and the rest of the world and its existing diagnosis method, colonoscopy, has limited accessibility for public due to its painful process and great expense. If a cheap, convenient and noninvasive screening method is developed, and is affordable for most people, there is a great possibility that the morbidity of colon cancer can decrease greatly.

What is horizontal gene transfer?
Introduction: Cells, Bacteria & DNA
In every cell, we can find genetic information. Genetic information interacting with environment shapes bacteria's life.
Let’s look specifically at bacteria. A bacteria is unicellular organism that contains genetic information carried by DNA, and is organized in a condensed form called a chromosome.
A small part of it can exist as a plasmid: a small circular fragment that can be easily exchanged between bacteria. This is for example how bacteria exchange antibiotic resistance: they exchange mobile elements containing this information.
Bacteria are living organisms so they are able to feed, move, and reproduce. All these functions are encoded in the bacteria’s DNA. A bacteria will reproduce by dividing: it will grow a bit, duplicate its genetic information, and then split in two identical clones.
Horizontal gene transfer is the exchange of genetic information between organisms, that is basically sex.
A general explanation of horizontal gene transfer
A Bacteria can pass some fragments of its genetic information to other bacteria. HGT can happen in 3 different ways, called: transformation, conjugation and transduction.
Transformation: Once a bacteria dies, its limiting membrane loses its integrity and its genetic information gets degraded into smaller fragments. These fragments can remain in the environment for a long time. If they come in contact with a living bacteria, they can sometime penetrate the living bacteria and be integrated to its chromosome.
Conjugation: Two living bacteria come in direct contact via a type of bridge called a ‘pillus’. Through this pillus, one of the bacteria can give its plasmid to the other bacteria.
Transduction: a phage, which is a virus that operates in bacteria, will take some genetic information from a bacteria and transfer it to another bacteria (just like a mosquito can transmit a disease from one human being to another when it feeds on them).

Design Level
You should choose what level you focus on. Generally, there are four levels: parts level, device level, system level and abstract level respectively. The former three levels should be designated before design for a certain database should be selected to link. They are aimed at real application by using practical materials. The last level is rather general and mathematical. It doesn’t link to certain database while providing topology information only.
Parts Level
Since, the function of parts can only display when they are in device with other kinds of parts. Thus, this level is to serve the device level that details about parts could be retrieved while designing a device. Details about kinetic laws and kinetic parameters these parts play in biochemical reactions are needed.
Device Level
Devices are composed by basic parts and fabricated in a special manner. The function may vary be inserting different parts of same kind like promoter to the same place in device. This way is actually means to change the kinetic parameters in order to change the response of the device. Both static and dynamic transfer functions are needed to describe each device in order to be inserted or replaced in the software for simulation and design purpose.
System Level
Systems are usually composed by devices while details of parts are not emphasized. The system level is an extension of device level, but focusing on much complicated ones even the entire cell, organism and ecosystem.
Abstract (mathematical) Level
Topology is crucial for a network even if the kinetic laws are not that clear. Here, we do not care what concrete parts we use but rather mathematical and graphic form. It is universally significant and instructive for design process.
Design Type (sub level)
After you choose what design level you focus, there are four types of sublevels to select. We define these sublevels because the users are unnecessary to run the every design step that we give prior for an entire design process but some certain functions. Given these information, users could quickly start their design without wasting additional running time. Though our software runs relevant functions according to your input, it will be helpful and clear for the users to know what sublevels fit their"

Figure 5: Chemotaxis test with WT Bacillus subtilis. The upper well contains attractive compound and the lower well contains medium without any attractive compound.
Results were not as clear as in the previous assay (Figure 4), but halos around the wells with glucose at 250 mM with and without tetracycline were observed. With N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) as the attractive compound, halos were observed for a concentration of 25 mM with tetracycline and for a concentration of 250 mM without tetracycline, thus suggesting that our B. subtilis 168 strain is attracted toward NAG and uses it to grow.

4. Capillary test between two tubes also called the tubes test
After the experiment of the plug-in-pond, we decided to construct a system by welding two Eppendorf tubes with a glass capillary and using an electric burner.
Figure 6: Photography of the first tubes system
We tested this system with a fuchsin dye and water and we were able to observe the diffusion of fuchsin dye towards water. However this construction had a leakage next to the welding seam that we could not stop.  Thus, the Toulouse 2014 iGEM team asked the help from the INSA glass blower, Patrick Chekroun. He designed two systems composed of two tubes linked by a capillary.
Figure 7: Scheme of the tubes system
This new system was tested with the fuchsin dye and the assay was made with WT B. subtilis and N-Acetylglucosamine as the attractive compound.
NB: We could not see any diffusion of the fushin dye from one tube to the other. We made the hypothesis that it was not visible by sight because of the small diameter of the capillary.
The following strategy was used to avoid disturbance due to pressure and liquid movement through the capillary:
- The first step was the addition of Wash Buffer until the capillary was full to prevent the presence of any air bubbles which could have impeded diffusion.
- Then, the tube 2 was plugged and maintained with the thumb while another iGEM mate was adding the bacterial"

Mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm the suspected SDS-PAGE bands were our proteins of interest. The amino acid sequences obtained indicated we had successfully expressed EtnR1 and EtnR2 in E. coli. from the native Mycobacterium host (Figure 7).
EtnR1
EtnR2
Finally, EtnR1 and EtnR2 expression with an N-terminal His6-Tag was confirmed via Western blotting using an anti-His antibody performed by the UNSW iGEM team (Figure 8) as part of our wet lab collaboration with bands observed at the expected sizes for each protein.
RESULT: The Mycobacterium NBB4 genes EtnR1 and EtnR2 were successfully expressed in E. coli. verified through SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and Western blot.
Figure 8. Western blot with anti-His antibody. Cellular lysates were isolated from BL21 (DE3) E. coli. with pGro7 chaperone plasmid following IPTG-induced protein expression, and separated using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose blot and probed with anti-His antibody. Loading order is indicated above the gel. SeeBlue Plus2 Protein Standard was used as the protein ladder. Insol. - Insoluble fraction, obtained through SDS-treatment; sol. - Soluble fraction. The bands corresponding to EtnR1 and EtnR2 are indicated by the arrows.
Characterisation
In order to isolate purified EtnR1 and EtnR2, we used affinity chromatography based off the attraction between pyridine moieties in histidine residues, and divalent metal cations such as nickel(II) and cobalt(II). Following multiple attempts using Ni2+-loaded columns, we successfully obtained EtnR1 and EtnR2 in purer fractions using Co2+-coated beads, again confirmed via mass spectrometry.
Subsequently, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to determine the interaction between EtnR1 and EtnP, with band retardation observed when the EtnR1-EtnP complex was run on an agarose gel. This confirms that EtnR1 acts as a DNA-binding protein for EtnP, and provides evidence of its role in transcriptional activation of ethylene metabolism in Mycobacterium NBB4 and other ethylene"

QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis for ''luxCDABE''in TOPO vector
Purpose: To mutate the XbaI site that is located about ~1000bp into the sequence. The reason for mutating the XbaI site for luxCDABE in TOPO vector is because to clone the sequence into a biobrick vector (pSB1AK3 and pSB1AC3), the enzyme, 'XbaI' is required for cloning purposes. Instead of cutting the sequence into two parts, we have to mutate the site so that it only cuts at the end of the sequence properly.
QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit retrived from Stratagene
Both the control reaction and the control transformation was done as well to ensure efficiency of mutagenesis. Please see detailed procedures for mutagenesis in the protocol section.
Plasmids were transformed into XL Gold Ultracompetent cells (part of the kit) and was plated on LB plates overnight at 37oC. The XL Gold Ultracompetent cells allow the uptake of single stranded DNA.

Coliroid
What´s a coliroid?
Has it ever come into your mind that biology can be used as a photographic device?
Well that's not a  very far- fetched idea. In fact this has already been done by the joint  UT-Austin/UCSF iGEM  team in 2004. This team came up with a project of bacterial photography commonly known as Coliroid or E.coliroid.  But what exactly does that mean?
E. Coliroid is a bacterial system which switches on and off in response to red light and acts like a bacterial Polaroid camera. Thanks to this polaroid like function the unique name of Coliroid came into being by combining the words  E.coli and Polaroid.
Figure. Coliroid images.  The left panel shows the first coliroid image done “Hello World “ published in Levskaya et al., Nature, 2005 and the right panel shows a  coliroid portait of Andy Ellington
But how does this work?
The system consist of a synthetic sensor  based on 2 devices as shown in figure, that allows a lawn of bacteria in an agar medium to project a two dimensional chemical image, based on the projection of a pattern of light on to the bacterial plate.
Figure. Two device Synthetic Sensor. The left panel shows a light sensor that takes red light as an input and produces PoPs as an output and the right panel shows the color generator that takes in a PoPs signal as the input and displays a colored output.
The system works by  producing a black chromoprotein (LacZ) in the absence of red light, so the gel section overshadowed by the image becomes dark. This mechanism can be observed in the image below:
Background
In 2004, the University of Texas designed a bacterial system that is switched between different states by red light. The system consists of a synthetic sensor kinase that allows a lawn of bacteria to function as a biological film, such that the projection of a pattern of light onto the bacteria produces a high-definition (about 100 megapixels per"

The Northeastern iGEM Team is grateful to the following people and organizations who have supported and assisted us with our research project throughout the course of this summer.
Professor Carolyn Lee-Parsons
Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry / Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.
Professor Veronica Godoy-Carter
Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
The Northeastern iGEM Team would like to thank IDT for the free synthesis of 20kB of gBlocks® Gene Fragments. Without this generous gift much of our work would not have been possible.
Aaron Moskoff at Northeastern 3D Print Studio
Thank you to Aaron Moskoff for laser cutting parts used in our MEC and for providing technical advice for the building of our MEC chamber.
Northeastern University Department of Biology
Thank you to the Northeastern Department of Biology, in particular Adrian Gilbert, Frauke Argyros, and Corissa Mantooth for helping to provide a lab space to work in and materials to work with. This project couldn’t have moved forward without the patience and effort that was put in to make this happen.

WINTER CAMP
After the 2016 Giant Jamboree, team members of BIT-China couldn’t wait to share their experience of participating in iGEM. With the coming of the cold winter, we came up with an idea to start the winter camp and light the fire. Students of different faculties such as Life Science, Electronic Engineering, Software, Art Design came to our winter camp.
We invited our instructor Prof. Chun Li to give a general introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM competition, which inspired many students’ interest in synthetic biology and they wanted to know more about the logic design and skills required to start a project.
Many of them wished to take systematic courses to have better understanding of the core concept about synthetic biology including “design, build and test”. They would like to not only gain more biological knowledge, but also know how to give a good presentation and integrate the mathematical equations into the iGEM project. Based on their needs, we prepared several lectures for everyone who may be interested in the skills required for iGEM competition and the speakers were our instructors and team members. Here are the topics:
Our GPCR model based on three presuppositions:
(1) The history and development of synthetic biology (Chun Li)
(2) Literature searching and reading (Hongyu Yang)
(3) Photoshop training (Zeyan Li)
(4) Academic writing and English presentation training (Zeyan Li)
(5) System biology and mathematical model (Pengcheng Zhang)
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students came from all faculties in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm， which let students think about our project's innovative points and flash points with based on our project's background. The third link was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us about things related to our project and team. After this meeting,"

Comparision of motility between E. coli MG1655 and MC1000 (2nd attempt)
The motility comparison experiment ( 15 July 2008 ) was repeated, but this time only the plates for MC1000 contained streptomycin. None of the 0.5% agar showed growth. Overall MG1655 swarms were possibly slightly larger than MC1000 (in Cambridge 06' MC1000 had much greater motility than MG1655). The growth/motility of MC1000 might be disturbed because, in contrast to MG1655, the bacteria had to deal with an antibiotic. Thus, the experiment will be repeated without any antibiotics in the agar.
Chambers for bacteria-moving-bead assay
The dye plates were observed: They had dried out somewhat overnight, however the dyes had mixed well. The experiment was carried out again with whatman paper soaked in water in 15 cm petri dishes to make a humid environment. This time swimming medium (see table below) was also used instead of the 0.1% agar used before as this may be more like what we use in the final experiment.

Psb1C3 and the trc PCR products were ligated using sticky end ligation in a 1:1 ratio and 10:1 (plasmid:insert) ratios then transformed into IQ cells. Results: The transformation was unsuccessful because a chloramphenicol vector was transformed into chloramphenicol resistant cells.
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:  To further improve ethanol production, we contacted UniPavia, who in 2009 was able to attain 2% ethanol production.  They used 10% glucose and induced cultures with 1% ethanol (to improve ADH activity).
The EnzyChrom Ethanol Detection Kit was used again to test ethanol production in s70/PDC/ADH in NEB Iq E. coli cells. To mimic the growth medium of UniPavia 2009 iGEM team, cultures were grown over 48h with the addition of 10% glucose, to test the effects of glucose on E. coli growth and induced with 1% ethanol at 24hours. With these constructs, 0.018% Ethanol was detected.

ThiE/GLF:
VG:GLF and INV were added to the Nevada 2011 iGEM team page as parts and a DNA sample of each was sent to Meagan Lizarazo at MIT.
A new temperature gradient was run for GLF from 40-60C.  This yielded bands that were extracted, gel purified, and ran through another pcr reaction on another gradient from 40-65C.  This was checked on a 1% agarose gel.  The gel yielded two promising bands.  These were extracted and purified with a gel extraction kit.  Then another pcr reaction was set up for these with annealing temperatures of 55C (x5) and 50C (x30).
AGP/INV:
Procedure: An alternative strategy for constructing KNR+petBD was attempted using PCR to create ""bridges"" between the two gene segments. PCR was performed on pSB1C3 containing petBD and pUC4K containing KNR using picomolar amounts of their common ""bridge"" primers (KNR_petBD reverse and forward). The PCR reaction was verified on 0.7% agarose gel at 60 V.

NCTU_Formosa,2010,Team:NCTU Formosa#Model-TC_-_-_TEXT.html,". The expression level of tetR protein is the input to the system, and the concentration of GFP is the output.
This system can be modeled by differential equations as follows.
The first equation describes the temperature control in strand A (Fig. 1). Alpha-Temp is the production rates corresponding to transcriptional rate of constitutive promoter and the translation rate of the RBS BBa_K115002 which is a temperature sensitive post-transcriptional regulator. The second equation describes the concentration of GFP change with time. Alpha-B is production rates of the GFP, which are assumed to be given constants. To describe transition during log phase and stationary phase, the alpha-Temp and alpha-B and is assumed to zero when the Terminator in stationary phase. Gamma-TetR, and gamma-GFP are decay rates of the corresponding proteins. When bacteria divide, the molecular in a bacterium will be dilute. Because bacteria grow faster, the dilution rate d(t) is included in this model and can be calculated from OD ratio of medium (Fig. 2). For an inhibition of TetR protein, Hill function is an S-shaped curve which can be described in the form 1 / (1 +x^n) (Alon, 2007). The values of the kinetic parameters used in the simulation were initially obtained from the literature and experimental data. Data computations were performed with Matlab software. A program was written and used as a subroutine in Matlab for parameter optimization using nonlinear regression (Fig. 3)
Fig. 2: The OD ratio is increased faster in log phase than it in stationary phase. The dilution rate d(t) can be calculated from OD ratio and used in out model.
Fig. 3:  The behavior of low temperature release circuit at 25°C, 30°C, 37 °C and  40°C.  Experimental data (dot) and simulated results (line) of the model suggest this  temperature-dependent genetic circuit can control the expression level of the  target protein by the host cell’s incubation. The fitting results indicate our  dynamic model can quantitatively assess the relative translational activity of  RBS during log phase and stationary phase.
 
Using least squares estimation  from experimental data, the relative translational activity of this RBS BBa_K115002 at 25°C, 30°C, 37 °C and 40°C were  estimated (Fig. 4).

Our head of HP section named Wang Zhizheng met the team members of HKUST including their instructor, King.L.Chow, advisor, team leader, the head of HP section. We talked about many things including some macro contents such as project, team construction, HP work and the outlay. Besides, we also discussed some concrete contents such as the modeling software we used, the design of the main gene circuit, the schedule and so on. We feel so grateful for their king consideration!
Our team leader named Zhang Junjie and another two delegates made a wonderful report for almost 500 teenagers and high school teachers who comes from five different provinces. We introduced synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our project to them. It aroused their great interests. Many high school students said they wanted to major in biology and participated in iGEM competition in the future.
On this day, we joined iGEM China Community. Here are a lot of iGEMers around China. We usually discuss some experiment problems with them.
On this day, we issued the first article through Wechat Public Platform. We introduced our writing plan of the magazine. It mainly contains six parts, “iGEM STORY””iGEM KNOWLEDGE”” iGEM PEOPLE”” iGEM COMMUNICATION ”” iGEM THINKING”” iGEM BILINGUALISM”. And some parts are designed for professional persons, while some parts for university students not majoring in biology, and other parts are intended for common people. What made us excited was the first article gained almost 700 people’s attention and some shows considerable interest in it at that night.
On this day, after we opened “Wechat”Public Platform, we built another two internet platform to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM competition. One is located in Renren, a famous Chinese social network and anther is located in Weibo, a famous Chinese micro blog just like Twitter. Here we are aim at attracting some enterprises’attention. For example, our sponsor GENEWIZ once interacted with our team.
The whole team members went to Shenzhen to have a communication with SUSTC and SFLS iGEM team. We introduced our own project, told the progress of experiment, asked a few problems"

HERE is the poster for this event.
On this day, we were able to arouse curiosity in many from the audience. For that, we thank our speakers - Julia, Shantal and Joanan! Along with applause, we also received some constructive criticism regarding what and where we could do better. For example, Prof. Dr. Stülke, one of the supervisors of the iGEM team last year, gave us good suggestions regarding how to proceed with the dry lab section. With the improvements made and the positive feedback from the veterans we've been interacting with, we feel more and more confident and ready for Boston! yay!

Colloquia
Although we have hosted several seminars both in and out of the university, we have planned a grand colloquium for the 28th of this month. In addition to that, there will be an “experts-only” colloquium on the 20th of this month; which will only involve the team, its supervisors and a handful of experts in Infection Biology from our university’s medical microbiology center.  This event is meant to ensure that we did justice to the topic at hand and to rectify factual errors (if any).
The invitation for the grand colloquium on the other hand, has been extended to as many people as possible; both from academic and non-academic sectors.  Our goal here is to spread the word on not only our project in particular but also to inspire more people into participating in forthcoming iGEM jamborees.
Educative videos as part of human practices online!
As part of the human practice segment, videos with cogent explanation of simple laboratory protocols and methods were uploaded onto YouTube. This way, we intend to not only increase the awareness of the public on iGEM but also expose them to general laboratory working conditions.  These videos can be accessed HERE .

Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.

3. Filter design
Back to sub-goals
The aim of this part of the project is to design and assemble a filter that makes it possible to capture methane from the atmosphere. The system includes  a filter, a methane sensor, a vessel for gas, a pump, and a valve. Click on the different parts in Figure 3 to get directed to the specific part.
Figure 3: Draft of the filter system.
Filter
The most important part of the system is the filter. The filter consists of a plastic column, which is shown in the figure below. Porous, plastic pads were introduced to the column to create turbulence and efficient gas-liquid exchange. Its on these plastic pads that the media containing the engineered E. coli bacteria will be applied. The filter was modified by drilling a hole on a side of the column and sealing the top. This was done in order to connect it to the gas output and to create a close system.
Figure 4: Filter column and bubbles (water instead of a culture for simplicity)
Methane sensor
In order to show that our system worked a methane sensor was added. The sensor measured the concentration of methane after the methane had passed through the filter. For the measurement the methane sensor MQ4 was used. Its function is based on SnO2 whose low conductivity rises when natural gases are present. For the MQ4 sensor to work it was connected to Arduino board, which was then assembled to the breadboard. These components were connected together according to the iGEM "

Procedure
Colony PCR to verify Nir in pZA21::ara-tight
Redid colony PCR with sequencing primers instead. Two primer pairs to test for the two USER parts. Pair 1: Nir_FW_4_Seq + Nir_RV_5_Seq . Pair 2: Nir_FW_13_Seq + Nir_RV_14_Seq.
Used Q5 premix. Calculated annealing temperature for pair 1: 60C, pair 2: 64C
Note: The resulting gel showed a lot of bands that are consistent for all colonies. We repeated the PCR on the next day for one of the colonies with the following annealing temperatures: pair 1: 67C, pair 2: 68C

Backend Part
Django
Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern.
Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code, it emphasizes reusability and ""pluggability"" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. It also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface, which is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
Python 3
Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It is cross-platform and it interpreters are available for many operating systems.
Nginx
Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.
Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.
Standford CoreNLP
CoreNLP is a program of natural language processing, it provides a set of human language technology tools. It can give the base forms of words, their parts of speech, whether they are names of companies, people, etc.
It makes it very easy to apply a bunch of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text. A tool pipeline can be run on a piece of plain text with just two lines of code. CoreNLP is designed to be highly flexible and extensible. With a single option, you can change which tools should be enabled and"

Just like the CERN OHL it is a Copyleft or ‘viral’ license: the terms applied to one product are propagated to all downstream products. In short, this means that once a product is made open-source, it and all it’s modifications remain accessible to the community.
The key premises of the TAPR OHL are outlined below, as described by the official website [1]:
Products can be used for any legal purpose
Unmodified documentation can be released, but it must be in the form of the entire package
Products can be commercially released as long as the documentation is also freely released, or is available for free for up to 3 years
All modifications must be released under the OHL
All modifications must be well documented, and attempts made to notify the designers of the original product
Overall, the above requirements ensure that nobody is denied the rights to access the product and its documentation, including all downstream versions.
For more information on TAPR licensing procedures, see here.
* It is worth mentioning that these licenses were created by volunteers with expertise in legal matters. They did this for the benefit of the community itself, despite it being a complex and time-consuming process.

Lambert_GA,2018,Team:Lambert GA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," is no proactive treatment mechanism available for waterborne diseases in the city of Hato Mayor. After informing him about our project, Dr. Rainyer stated that having an efficient, inexpensive detection tool would be extremely useful for field testing.
A majority of the residents living in Hato Mayor did not have access to clean, drinking water and buying bottled water was a financial burden. While installing water filters, iGEM members had the opportunity to speak to the residents living in Hato Mayor. In the city, trash invaded the resident’s homes, gardens, and water sources.
We asked the residents how and where they retrieved their water. They said that the only way to get clean water was to drive down to the markets to buy bottled water; however, they emphasized how much of a financial burden this was.  Since many of the residents did not have access to transportation, they would have to pay for the costly trip.
Megan Hong, Lambert iGEM member describes her experience: When we traveled to the village by Hato Mayor, we were instantly surprised by the amount of trash filling the streets, homes, and water sources. Without direct access to clean drinking water, the residents of the village had to travel about 20 miles out of their way to the city in order to obtain bottled water. We installed 12 water filters throughout the area, which would help to serve over 50 people. While we implemented these systems and taught the locals how to use and clean the filter, the residents talked about how much the clean water would impact their lives in a positive way.
Team members installed water filters and interacted with the community to gain a greater understanding of the severity of waterborne diseases.

Summary Points
Exposure of young girls to science as a fun and accessible field
Improvement of communication skills through the explanation of complex concepts to younger children
Lambert iGEM recognizes the significance of disproportionate demographics in the biotechnology and the scientific community as a whole, especially with women. This problem is largely due to lack of exposure to STEM as young girls. Lambert iGEM discovered that most lab kits or chemistry sets for children were marketed towards boys rather than girls. As a result, the team created a doll kit specifically designed for elementary-aged girls to increase exposure and interest in biotechnology. These kits include basic laboratory materials such as pipettes and beakers as well as Lambert iGEM’s very own 3DFuge. This kit allows girls to explore biotechnology as fun and accessible rather than something strictly for boys, significantly increasing interest in the science field. Pl"
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"The drawing of the chamber design was done in Fusion 360, a cloud-based CAD/CAM/CAE tool for collaborative product development, using an educational licence. The version used was 2.0.4126:
The drawing was then exported into Ultimaker Cura, an open access program for preparing the model for 3D printing.
All chamber components were printed Ultimaker 2+, using PLA filament (polylactic acid), with filament diameter of 2.85mm and Marine Blue color, with disabled support, enabled print cooling and adhesion plate type ""Brim"".
Future improvements
Of course PLA polylactic acid is probably not the best material for growing bacteria in. At least some painting could be used after printing the model.
The device that was envisioned for astronauts to take on their space voyages would be of course far more advanced. It should be hermetically closed with double walls and multiple inlets/outlets allowing for manipulation of liquids and monitoring of parameters. It should also be enclosed in one more contamination containment chamber (the principle similar to what they currently use in nuclear power plants) which would protect the crew from the spillage of biohazard material in case of accidents. The fluidic system should allow for uninterrupted sampling both of the bacteria culture and of the protein solution. Bacteria could mutate due to exposure to mutagenic cosmic radiation so checking the genome of bacteria prior to start of protein production could be a good idea. On the other hand a samples from protein solution could be analysed either via capillary electrophoresis on a microfluidic device or some other method that would confirm the required purity and ""quality"" of the protein prior to use on the patient.
Finally, the chamber must withstand the disinfection between changing the bacterial strains when different proteins are needed. The most vulnerable part in this case would probably be the membrane, so a system that allows for changing of the membrane is a much better solution than the system with fixed one. This would also considerably extend the useability of the system, since a membrane that wears out could be easily changed.
Pictures from real process:
A special note to the 3D printing enthusiasts. As the principal idea of 3D printing is accessibility to everyone (who has access to the 3D printer) and sharing, many designs can be found online. This is the case also with our design. If you are interested into our Bacta_tank3.0 and would like to print it on your own, please feel free to contact us and we will readily share our knowledge with you. We are also welcoming any suggestions"
