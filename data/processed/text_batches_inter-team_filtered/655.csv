Agricultural Improvement Station
The most important factors in assessing soil fertility are levels of nitrogen, phosphates and potassium, measured by electrical conductivity, as well as total soil organic carbon. In Taiwan, phosphate levels are often too high, so a method of regulation could be very helpful.
Figure 1: We visited Agricultural Improvement Station in Taoyuan.
     To understand the nature of soil better, we visited the Agricultural Improvement Center in Taoyuan. There, we learned that excessive phosphate levels due to over-fertilization is an increasingly common problem in Taiwanese soil, and that no regulation methods currently exist. To address this situation, we made sure that our biostimulators included agents that could curb the effects of any extra fertilizer present in soil. Additionally, the center suggested we pay"

Protein function analysis- OD340 test & Electron microscopy
Tubulin polymerization assay is based on an adaptation of the original method of Shelanski et al.(1973) and Lee et al.(1977). Light at a wavelength of 340 nm is scattered by microtubules proportionally to the concentration of polymerized microtubule. Purified α and β tubulins secreted by engineered INVSc1 were mixed together and incubated at 37℃ for 1 hour, and absorbance readings at 340 nm were conducted every minute. The results are shown in the image below.
Comparing the absorbance curves obtained, it was clear that the secreted tubulins had successfully polymerized into microtubules when GTP is added into the system.
Figure 9 Absorbance curve of polymerization reaction at 340 nm.
To get more definitive results, we observed samples with High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). The following two images are polymerized microtubules observed in the system containing secreted mCherry-α-tubulin and β-tubulin. Several microtubules can be seen on these images.
Figure 10  Electron microscopy images of polymerized microtubules.
A Linear microtubule observed with HRTEM. The red arrows indicate the microtubules;
B Enlarged view of image A. The red arrows indicate the microtubules.
From the results we got with absorbance curves and electron microscopy images, the function of the secrete module can be verified.
Function verification of upgraded display system
As the function of the secrete module was verified, we experimented on the polymerization of microtubules at the surface of the yeast cells. Specifically, we did the polymerization reaction with tubulins extracted from the brain tissue of Sus scrofa domesticus and yeasts displaying β-tubulin. We did microscopic exam with HRTEM. Polymerized microtubules were observed on the cell wall of the yeasts, of which the quantity and lengths were consistent with our model prediction. The followings are the results.

M: Ladder.  1: GFP+Term RD 2: GFP+Term uncut 3: RFP+Term RD 4: RFP+Term uncut 5: BFP+Term RD 6: BFP+Term uncut
Again, the plasmids did not correctly cut.  The GFP+term has two bands but of the wrong size while RFP+term has three bands, all of incorrect size.  I looked on the NEB website to troubleshoot my restriction digest problems.  I found that the double digestion of XbaI and PstI with Buffer 3 does not give 100% efficiency, thus a longer incubation time is necessary to have a better reaction.
7/27:  To further troubleshoot my restriction digest problems, I ran the uncut plasmids of GFP+Term, RFP+Term, and BFP+Term against uncut Terminator to make sure there is a difference in length on a gel.  It did turn out to look correct in terms of size compared to the DNA ladder and uncut terminator.  Thus, I did another restriction digest, using 2000ng of DNA and an incubation period of 3 and 4 hours.
7/28:  This morning I ran a gel of the RD's from 7/27 of the _FP's+term.
The success of the restriction digest was varied, some with multiple bands and some with single bands.  Despite the inserts being larger than they should be in base pairs, I extracted them anyways.  Using these extractions, I ligated an RBS J61100 with the _FP's+term insert.  The RBS has a constuitive promoter upstream of the RBS.  These samples were then transformed using the Alpha cells.
7/29:  The transformations from 7/28 worked.  Today is our iGEM camping trip, so the overnight cultures will have to be set up on Monday.
WEEK 9: 8/1-8/5/2011
8/1:  Today I set up the overnight cultures of my transformations from 7/28.  I noticed that the RBS+RFP+term and RBS+BFP+Term both had a pinkish tint to it.  This is fine for the RFP construct, but strange for the BFP construct.  I plan on miniprepping the samples and then checking them on the gel."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

4. Local variations of the potential
The spatial low frequencies of the electric field generated by an active axon, has almost the same amplitude at each point of the nerve surface, regardless of the location of the axon inside the nerve. Conversely, the amplitudes of the high-frequency components of this electric field depending on the distance between the axon and the point of observation.
It was possible for several poles placed online, to determine the depth of the axon. Indeed, for axons close to the surface of the nerve, there is a difference in amplitude (as a function of the relative position of each pole relative to that of Ranvier's nodes), while for those who are far from the surface the measured amplitude is the same for each of the poles (Cf. Figure 7). Thus, it is necessary to suppress the common mode and amplify only the difference of the signals collected on several poles.
5. Sensibility of a small:
For the small tripole, we have a fast attenuation depending on the distance compared to big tripole (Cf. Figure 8). As figure 8 confirms it, the small tripole is much more selective than the big tripole. Moreover, figure 9 shows that despite the low power level of the targeted signals and the spatial filtering performed, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the output signals of the tripole can reach 6 μV for a single active fiber. Considering the superposition of signals - the simultaneous activity of several fibers - we can hope to reach larger amplitude. Even if it is the case, the output signals of a small tripole remain of very low amplitude and it will thus be necessary to be very attentive to the sources of noise to maintain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 9: Peak-to-peak amplitudes measure at the output of a big tripole (left) or a small tripole (right) in function of the position of the active axon (diameter 8, 7 μm, and lmy=1 mm) in a cylindrical nerve of 300 μm in diameter [9].

We are so happy that we had overcome our first challenge. After the final exam, joyful summer vacation will come to us!! But experiments are waiting for us to accomplish. So this week, Friday(6/25) 7:00 p.m. in Conference hall (4th), we have to discuss following matters:
1. Discuss our experiment time (and when will we go home in summer vacation).
2. Division work to find the required materials.
3. Who we can invite to be our instructor.
4. Meeting we had scheduled on 6/25 but we change the date to 7/6.

Date: Jun-17, 2010
1. Correct our idea model.
2. List problems which need to be solve:
Which gene do we want to transform into cyanobacteria? (look up these genes’ name, size, and
function etc.)
Which strain of cyanobacteria we want to express oil-degraded-enzyme genes?
Look up the alkane transporter of A. borkumensis.
Look up the oil degradation enzyme genes.
Keep correcting the idea model.
Date: Jun-16, 2010
1. Discuss everyone’s opinions after read 3 following papers:
Proteomic Insights into Metabolic Adaptation in Alcanivorax borkumensis Induced by Alkane Utilization.
Genome sequence of the ubiquitous hydrocarbondegrading marine bacterium Alcanivorax borkumensis.
Global features of the Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 genome.
2. Find useful figures on the internet.
3. Figure out the contents for the first seminar.
4. Compare 2009 iGEM Tianjin University, we found the way to solve the problem of CO2 production.
5. Bring up the model of our idea.
Date: Jun-15, 2010
1. Discuss everyone’s opinions after read several papers.
2. Now, we face some difficult problems:
Alcanivorax borkumensis is gammaproteobacteria, its gene regulation may be the same with E.coli. So, we have to prove that the A. borkumensis gene can work in e.coli.
Crude oil is composed of many compounds, are they all took in bacteria via the same transporter?
A. borkumensis can degrade the long-chain alkanes into “ non-poisonous” carbon chain.

Safety
To address potential safety issues with our project, we were asked by iGEM to answer the following questions:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
For the safety of our researchers and others in the lab, all experiments are done on a safe and dedicated lab space. Also all members are required to wear the appropriate safety gear (gloves,eye protection, and lab coats) when experiments are in progress. Everything is carefully controlled and disposed of in the proper way, like using the biohazard disposal for old cultures of transformed cells.  We also always washed our hands when we finished.  Since our experiments are being done in this lab area, there is no concern for public safety. Our experiment also does use the environment as a factor but it certainly does not compromise the safety and overall wellness of the environment because we are sampling it only in the lab.  If we wanted to sue our device outside we would have it safety tested.  Our Professor handled the arsenic and the ethidium bromide used in electrophoresis.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We didn't make any.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
We are very careful not to release any transformed bacteria or their products in to the environment.  All of the waste made from our work was disposed of in the biohazard waste container.  We used bleach and 70% alcohol to clean our work area and equipment.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? </li>
That is a good question: We think that if some researcher is going to use an iGEM outside of the lab that that iGEM should not be able to survive unless given special nutrition or something like that.  This would stop genetic pollution.

Protocol
Goksel about to insert some restriction enzymes into the tubes containing plasmid DNA
Although there is a protocol in Dr. Aldridge's lab explaining how to do restriction digests, Prof. Wipat came up with an alternative one. The E.coli colonies selected for further processing included cultures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Because 6 were chosen to be further processed, 12 Eppendorf tubes were required. In the first set of six, there would be the plasmid DNA combined with EcoRI enzyme and in the second set of six tubes, there would be plasmid DNA combined with both EcoRI and PstI.
The contents to be added to the tubes containing only EcoRI include:
7 microlitres of plasmid DNA
1 microlitre Buffer H (x10)
1 microlitre EcoRI
1 microlitre Sterile Distilled Water (SDW)
The contents to be added to the tubes containing both EcoRI and PstI include:
7 microlitres of plasmid DNA
1 microlitre Buffer H (x10)
1 microlitre EcoRI
1 microlitre PstI
Of the 12 tubes, 6 of them contained plasmid DNA along with EcorI, Buffer H and SDW whereas the other 6 contained the plasmid DNA as well as EcorI, PstI and Buffer H. This was achieved using a P20 pipette.
After this, the tubes were then lightly centrifuged (left to spin until 13,000 rpm was reached and then slowed down) and stored in the freezer.

Plasmid-Sensing Logically and Adjustably Cell Killer
Monitoring Plasmid Numbers
Kill the Slacker
In the procedure of large-scale industrial
production, due to the random distribution of
plasmids in the process of bacteria proliferation
and division, the bacteria containing less
plasmids will gradually become the
“slackers”.
Generally, we aim to avoid these undesired
bacteria become the dominant population.
There is no efficient way to prevent the birth of
plasmid-free bacteria and the applied ways are
only limited to the laboratory-use.
What about equipping the bacteria with a
plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer
(P-SLACKiller)?
Here is killer’s basic rule:
Kill the slackers (Plasmid number is below the
threshold);
Save the workers (Plasmid number is above
the threshold).
Worker-P：Cell containing our P-SLACKiller.
Surprise! We can guarantee the microbial
population structure stay optimal now!
Our team divide the project into 4 parts as below.
Why not click and have a look?
Our P-SLACKiller
Plasmids are losing, and the production efficiency is decreasing. Let’s equip the bacteria with a plasmid-sensing logically adjustable cell killer (P-SLACKiller) to kill slackers with less plasmids among bacteria!
Threshold Device
In what situation can the bacteria be judged as slackers? There must have a threshold concerning plasmid numbers. Let’s find it out and adjust it accordingly.
Killer Device
For the slackers, they should be able to turn on the self-killing switch. We tried toxin proteins to produce the lethal effect.
Optimization
The executor killer should be stably maintained, so we integrated killer device into the genome. Moreover, we mutated promoters to adjust the threshold.

SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Concept_-_-_TEXT.html,"ites, which mean non-toxic. However, physico-chemical characteristics and biomimetic of these molecules makes them hard to administer. They are, indeed, badly absorbed (at tissue and cell levels) and often quickly degraded and metabolized and unable to reach their target at tissue or cell level. This is one of the principal limits of the development of these molecules as medicine.
For all these reasons, the development of active principle vectors is considerably expanding during last years. Based on new physico-chemical concepts, the galenic research permits to imagine submicronic systems administration, biological or chemical, able to: (i) protect the active molecule from degradation and (ii) control its liberation in time and space.

Pharmacokinetic modification, pharmacodynamic and bioavability [1,2]
A “classical” medicine is distributed in the organism in function of its physico-chemical properties:
- pKa,
- Lipophily,
- Kd (protein fixation).
Furthermore, a « vectorized » vector is distributed in the organism in function of its vector properties:
- Vector size,
- Vector lipophily,
- Vector global charge,
- Vector stability,
- Vector immunogenicity.
Its distribution, so its bioavability is not the same. The bioavaibility acts directly on active principle efficacy and toxicity. If the injected dose is concentrated in one place, a better efficacy is obtained than if the dose is diluted in the all organism.
Thus, a vectorized medicine is not distributed in the same way and has not the same efficacy and toxicity than a “classical” medicine.
In the case of a “vectorized” medicine, the natural distribution is avoided. It allows to the active principle to be delivered to its target, and to concentrate the dose on the interested surface. Efficacy is increased and the toxicity is decreased.
Back to top
Vector components [3,4]
A vector is a nanotransporter composed of several elements.
First, there is a reservoir, which is the active principle storage element. It can be very different in function of the vector nature. For example, it can be composed of phospholipids like in the liposomes’ case, or proteins, as in the viruses’ case. But independently of its nature, the reservoir has a storage function and manages the active principle protection.
Then, there is the targeting system, this system permits to completely change vector bioavability and release preferentially the active principle in the wanted organ, tissue or cell. This system is often made by small proteins or proteins recognized by a lig"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#Synergy_-_-_TEXT.html," time taking the progress we had made on our project with us.  We got a variety of different perspectives from suggestions on the scale up of our project, to the cost and environmental impact of our numerous components.  The results of all of these can be found on our Interviews page.  One major concern was scale-up.  One expert wanted to know how feasible this system would actually be.  We have some FRED components, OSCAR components, and killswitch components, but how functional are these parts, and how do they work together?  Our next major goal was therefore to establish synergy: to put these pieces together in order to assess how far we have actually gotten.
Here we demonstrate that we can develop a comprehensive kill switch consisting of both an auxotroph and an inducible kill switch which work together to contain FRED and OSCAR.  With FRED, we show that we can detect toxins selectively in tailing ponds using our identified transposon.  Finally, with OSCAR we show that our killswitch auxotroph dramatically increases the production of hydrocarbons in the system and that we are capable of scaling up OSCAR's bioreactor and selectively collect hydrocarbons with our belt skimmer device.
Putting our Killswitch Together
Testing the Requirement of Glycine With our Auxotroph
Our flux-based analysis allowed us to realize the potential for glycine to be used not only as a way to increase the yield of OSCAR, but also as an auxotrophic killswitch.  This allowed our model to be used not only to inform our wetlab, but also our human practices.  We wanted to see how this auxotrophic marker system could work with one of our inducible killswitch constructs.  We procured a Keio Knockout Collection Strain which deleted glyA an important enzyme in glycine metabolism making it auxotrophic for this compound.  We wanted to identify the concentration of glycine required for its growth as shown below.
Figure 1: Glycine requirements for growth of glyA knockout strain JW2535-1.  The bacteria was grown in LB overnight, washed, and subcultured into M9 minimal media, glucose, with various different concentration of glycine (from 1nM logarithmically to 100 mM).  Interestingly, the glycine knockout grew best at concentrations of 1 - 10 mM.  However, the auxotroph was not strong enough even at low concentrations to completely abolish growth.
As identified by the growth assay, the glycine knockout is not capable of completely preventing growth of the strain"

Agarose electrophoresis was used to detect the digestion products which showed the expected lengths (fig.4). The band of has2 gene was clearly visible at 1693 bp. For cloning of has2 into pSMF2.1 plasmid it first needed to be digested with the same restriction enzymes SacⅠ und MluⅠ. Subsequently the restricted plasmid (6510 bp) was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (fig. 4). A restriction control without the restriction enzymes was carried out as well.
Figure 4: Restriction of pexK4-has2 and pSMF2.1 with MluⅠ/SacⅠ. The hyaluronan synthase (has2) artificially synthesised by Eurofins and cloned into the pexK4 plasmid was digested with MluⅠ and SacⅠ. The digested has2 gene is clearly visible at 1693 bp below the digested pexK4 plasmid at 2507 bp. For cloning of the has2 gene into the pSMF2.1 plasmid, this plasmid was also digested with MluⅠ and SacⅠ and is visible at 6510 bp.

Lane 2: Restricted pSMF2.1 (6510 bp)
After reisolation the pSMF2.1 plasmid was treated with alkaline phosphatase. The treatment causes an elimination of the phosphate group at the 5` terminus of the restricted plasmid and thereby prevents the restricted plasmid from relegation.
Afterwards the digested insert has2 was ligated with the restricted and phosphatase treated pSMF2.1 plasmid. Figure 5 displays the control of ligation. The approach with ligase showed a high molecular band at 8203 bp indicating that insert and plasmid were successfully ligated. As expected the negative control showed only the two original bands representing digested has2 insert DNA and restricted pSMF2.1 plasmid.

High School iGEM Introduction
     National Luodong High School visited us over the summer to learn more about the iGEM competition. To start, we introduced the field of synthetic biology. We then presented some of NCTU_Formosa’s previous projects, such as Pantide and Parabase. The students left with a better understanding of what goes on in the field of synthetic biology as well as the competition.

High School Workshop
     Over the summer our team hosted a week-long workshop for National Taichung First Senior High School students. The workshop covered all the skills required to produce a successful iGEM project. Students were first introduced to the fundamentals of synthetic biology before getting hands-on practice by transforming GFP into E.coli. Finally, they learned how to properly research science topics by referencing published papers and visiting sites such as PubMed. At the end of the workshop, the students combined everything they’d learned into a presentation of a project that they brainstormed from beginning to end. The workshop seemed to pique an interest in synthetic biology in many of the students, and we sincerely hope they decide to continue pursuing this passion.

60th NCTU Campus Fair
     During the school year our team participated in our school’s annual club fair. Our goal was to teach more people about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, as well as earn some money to spend towards our project. We sold popsicles and explained several previous NCTU projects to any willing listeners. By the end we managed to recruit a few members for next years team while netting a profit. It was quite a successful day!

Central China Conference
     In mid-July, our team visited Wuhan, China to participate in the 2018 Central China Regional Exchange iGEM Conference, which was held by HUST, to share our project with other teams. This year, five teams came together to discuss and exchange ideas. We presented our project ideas and the audience gave us some great feedback. During the question and answer section we were asked about some topics that we hadn’t considered, such as the cost of our bacteriocin production. Additionally, we saw some interesting topics presented by other teams, and also made some great friends along the way. Overall this event really helped us prepare a more well-rounded project!

Science is rarely a one (wo)man job and usually requires people with different backgrounds to work together to solve the challenges encountered. iGEM is no different. To encompass this spirit the iGEM 2017 Groningen team strives to work together with multiple teams on different aspect of our project and hopefully further strengthen connections within the iGEM community.
Scientific collaborations
To further develop and establish L. lactis as a chassis in iGEM we collaborated with the IGEM team of Sao Paulo. We  sent them protocols since we have a lot of in house experience with working on lactis.
To help the Nottingham team we tested their E.coli RFP fluorescence in our lab to provide an external control. They sent us a protocol along with their cells, and we did the testing and sent them our results.
NAWI-Graz: Our friends from Austria are developing a bioelectronic interface controlled by bacterial GFP-expression. They have developed a software to validate part of their experiments. iGEM Groningen has worked together with them to design mazes and therefore improve the functionality and identify flaws in the design.
Human practices
Virtual meet up Vilnius-Lithuania, Abu Dhabi (with follow up discussion) We presented our project designs to each other and critically debated their feasibility as well as implementation of the final product. This helped us gain insight into possible experimental flaws. Abu Dhabi is also working on designing a cartridge, so their engineering advice was appreciated and contributed to improving our cartridge. We held a follow-up discussion to update on the progress achieved and get advice on the challenges met. We had a few issues with cloning and got some help that enabled us to get our construct from team Vilnius. We hoped our input also improved on their design.

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Cre recombinase                 is shown to be toxic in mouse lungs and hearts. The limited choices of recombinases and their incomprehensive                 testing put restrictions to experimental design, ultimately hindering scientific discovery
By developing a site-specific, modular recombination (SMORE) toolkit with each part thoroughly tested, we aim                 to contribute multiple usable recombination systems to the scientific community, allowing the creation of                 complex gene circuits for various applications. We envision that SMORE will facilitate the use of multiple                 orthogonal SSR in vivo and in parallel, with applications such as multiple inducible gene knockout, as well                 as in the field of metabolic engineering, which we plan to demonstrate.
What does SMORE contain?
As a toolkit, SMORE contains individual recombinases expression constructs and their respective target sites                 in biobrick format. Following the principles of synthetic biology, we endeavor to characterise all of our                 parts as thoroughly as possible, through in vivo or in vitro testing. This is why we have included constructs                 in the SMORE toolkit for testing their activity, which lays out the framework for the characterization of                 recombinase activity. To learn more about the characterisation of individual parts, please check our results and parts pages.
Additionally, we are aware of the emerging role of computational modeling in synthetic biology, and we have used                 computer simulation extensively to predict the behaviour of recombination. Click here to learn more about our modeling.
Lastly, we believe that synthetic biology should be accessible to people from all disciplines. This is why we                 have chosen to investigate on ‘accessibility’ as our human practice. Click here to see more about our findings!

What are your plans after university?
I want to do PhD, that’s for sure. Eventually, it will end up in doing research and serving society as a medical doctor in parallel, I guess.
Why did you join iGEM?
While doing my medicine courses, I thought I would join research world as it seemed more interesting to me than just treating patients. That’s why I joined the toxicology master program. iGEM was a great opportunity to have close connection with the research world on synthetic biology and a nice way to spend the  beautiful Swedish summer with new people. Not to forget about the giant Jamboree in Boston, USA.
What food item/meal describes your life, and why?
Vat, dal and aluvate (typical bengali style rice, lentil and spicy mashed potato). It might not sound mouth watering or interesting but if you are on luxurious meal for a week, you will crave this cheap, simple and healthy meal!

What are Biobricks?
The iGEM Standards
The iGEM competition is based on Biobrick standards; it is a standard form of plasmid for interchangeable parts, developed with a view to build biological systems in living cells. Parts are characterized by sequence of DNA that encodes for biological function. This standardization aims to facilitate shipping to the Registry (which gather all Biobricks) to maintain and test them; to measure them for evaluation and characterization; and then to assemble easily compatible parts without any issues.
Backbone, Prefix and Suffix
The backbone containing the part has two flanking parts: the prefix and suffix. The prefix and suffix contain restriction enzyme cut sites; that can be used to transfer and assemble parts. In prefix we find EcoRI and XbaI sites while in suffix we have SpeI and PstI sites. In order to standardize all parts, iGEM request for all parts to not have any of the restriction sites found in prefix or suffix. This justify why, in our strategy, we have tried to remove this illegal sites from our sequences.   Restriction enzyme sites in prefix and suffix have been chosen in order to facilitate parts assembly.
iGEM basic parts
All Biobrick that have been created and used in iGEM are kept in the Registry. Each year all the team registered receive a kit. In 2015 the iGEM kit is composed of 5 plates with standards parts in dried DNA.

Fluoresence: VVD-split-YFP construction
In order to make our bacteria express fluorescence in response to a light stimulus, we aimed to construct a BioBrick that will link each VVD photoreceptor to one part of the split-YFP ( BBa_K1616004 for VVD-Nterminal YFP and BBa_K1616003 for VVD-C terminal YFP). In absence of blue-light, the conformation of the photoreceptor will prevent the formation of the complete fluorescent protein while in presence of the light signal the YFP protein will be reconstituted leading to the fast expression of a yellow fluorescence in our bacteria.  Despite the possible dimerization of two similar VVD-Split-YFP, there is a probability of 50% for the YFP to be functional after dimerization. The fluorescence should be observable about 20 min after light illumination.

Outlook: Future Development
There's still room for improvement in our software solution, as well as in coordination with the hardware setup:
As we mentioned earlier in the Achievements section, too many objects in the field of view would introduce excessive interference patterns which can't be effectively removed after reconstruction. This can be solved with a precisely controlled hardware setup, careful selection and alignment such that there's one or only a few sample objects in the field of view.
A bug in software solution: adjusting the parameter ""Spacing"" needs to be prior to importing any pictures to HoloPyGuy, otherwise the calculation would raise memory error. This is due to source code of HoloPy, as 'cam spacing"" is not updated in the holopy.core.update_metadata() function. In collimated source setup, ""Spacing"" is a parameter that doesn't need frequent update. However in point source setup, ""Spacing"", in relation to ""Magnification"", can be arbitrarily set for better reconstruction. Thus future improvement can be done in updating the source code for the point source setup.

We assumed 63% of the cancers we detected would be in stage 1 as in the National Lung Screening Trial [18] We then assumed that the detection of the other cancers would be evenly distributed through stages 2-4. This is unrealistic for a mass screening programme, as cancers not picked up in stage 1 would likely be picked up in stage 2. This would decrease the cost per QALY as the probability of cure in stage 2 is higher than the average of stages 2-4 and treatment in stage 2 is cheaper than the average cost of stages 2-4. [19] Therefore our model would underestimate the cost effectiveness of our sensor.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Sensitivity was taken as 100%, as with appropriately set cutoffs our tool would identify everyone with NSCLC. This is likely to prove untrue were our test to be validated with miRNA levels in a large patient cohort - though sensitivity would still be very close to 100%. Therefore, P(False negative) = 0. However, we included it in the calculations anyway, as later we show that even if sensitivity was significantly less than 100% our test would still be cost effective. We assumed as a lower bound that false negatives will not survive - in reality, some will be detected at a later stage and survive - but were we to have included that, it would have resulted in additional QALYs gained not due to our sensor, meaning we chose to exclude them.
The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]

A bacterial two-hybrid system is built on the interaction of two proteins and converts it in transcriptional activity of a reporter gene. The SH2 protein is our chosen positive control and should interact with the monobody HA4 designed in Chicago.  Therefore, the interaction of the fusion protein SH2-cI with the HA4 fusion protein of the part BBa_K2082221 was examined.  After purification of the proteins an affinity chromatography was made to validate the interaction. With the MALDI-TOF the sample of the affinity chromatography was analyzed. Both proteins could be detected in the same sample. Therefore, an interaction of the two proteins was possible. To validate the results the two purified proteins where measured in the bio-layer interferometry system (BLItz) of ForteBio. Directly after adding the SH2-cI fusion protein to the immobilized HA4 protein, interferences in the white light refraction was measured. Those interferences will be released if something is binding at the immobilized protein. The negative control with BSA does not result in any interference. That is the final evidence that the expected interaction of SH2 and HA4 also worked with our designed proteins.
Figure 4: Tecan-Results of the in vivo reporter activity. Two culters of E. coli were measured on their ability to produce RFP through the reporter construct. A culture with one fusion protein SH2-cI expressing is compared with a culture carrying both fusion proteins SH2-cI and HA4-RpoZ. The RFP intensity of the culture with both fusion proteins is significantly higher than in the culture with only one fusion protein.
The final functionality of the BioBrick as a part of the bacterial two-hybrid system was researched by a comparison of the RFP intensity of two different bacterial cultures. The first culture was only carrying the described plasmid BBa_K2082231 . The second culture also carrying the plasmid with the second fusion protein HA4-RpoZ. The comparison of the RFP intensity in the Tecan plate reader revealed a visible difference in these two cultures. The cells carrying both fusion proteins produce about 48% more RFP than the cells with only one plasmid. A two sided t-test approved the assumption that the difference between these two cultures is very significant. Therefore, an in vivo activation of our bacterial two-hybrid system is possible.
Therefore, the part is characterized. The fusion protein will be expressed and worked like expected. The"

We designed a novel toolbox for complete control over all major functions of the peroxisome. The toolbox is our solution for improving the engineering workflow and predictability of synthetic constructs. Interested? Find out how.
Scientific background
The root problem
Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline. And while we are able to plan our constructs with tools like biobricks, a major difference to e.g. electrical engineering is that they are not nicely isolated on a chip, but surrounded by all types of interfering agents. One of the major issues regarding protein expression in a novel chassis is unwanted and unexpected crosstalk between engineered pathways and the native cellular processes of the production host. The other one is toxicity of the products or intermediates of the pathway. Both can greatly change our system’s behaviour which in some cases leads to us to having to trial-and-error find a solution, making our previously modeled optimization useless.
Our approach
The natural approach of organisms to deal with metabolic interference and toxic byproducts is subcellular compartmentalization. This has proven to be a functional solution in naturally occurring pathways in eukaryotes as well as new synthetic pathways for biotechnological application. Thus, the creation of a synthetic organelle presents a suitable strategy to increase the efficiency and yield of non-native pathways. A common approach is to build up artificial compartments from scratch. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last decade, however the creation of a fully synthetic compartment is yet a milestone to reach for. We on the contrary want to start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization.
The peroxisome is the ideal starting candidate as it has many advantages over other compartments, including it being able to import fully folded proteins and not being essential in yeast under optimal growth conditions. Our project’s aim is to"

Christopher Anderson, an assistant professor of bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. The Berkeley iGEM team in 2007 proposed to display K1 carbohydrates. K1 carbohydrates are long linear polymers of sialic acid that extend about half the diameter of the bacteria’s surface. Given that polysialic acid is a typical coating on mammalian cells, the human immune system does not recognize K1 as foreign and hence the bacteria are disguised and granted access through the bloodstream. To display K1 carbohydrate in our bacteria it is necessary to also express O antigens, they suggest expressing antigen O16.

In this application,our device is used as a tool for bacterial infections research, by allowing the researchers to trace the bacteria inside the animal specimen subject to research.
How?
explains the general process that should be followed within this application.
1
The bacterial concentrated solution is injected intravenously.
2
Once in the bloodstream, the CEST contrast producing bacteria travel through it until they find their target.
3
Then a CEST MR Image is acquired.
4
The data is analyzed.
Considering that both applications are similar in principle, no specific model was developed for the second application, but it is possible to modify the parameters of the pharmacokinetics model used in the tumor imaging application to fit the requirements of the second application.
Strengths and Weaknesses of our device in both applications
The ideas we suggest with the two applications previously described take the principles of CEST MRI and delivery systems and apply it to an in vivo production of a CEST contrast agent to enhance the acquired MR images. As any application, what we propose also has advantages and disadvantages. The strongest point of what we propose is the possibility of producing in situ only the required amount of CEST contrast for the image acquisition, summed to the fact that it enables the physician or researcher to easily localize the damaged region. The greatest risk to the success of these applications is the difficulties society might have with coping with the idea of injecting live bacteria into a patient’s bloodstream. This main obstacle can only be surpassed by providing people with the proper unbiased knowledge sources related to synthetic biology and the use of bacteria for clinical and research applications. Therefore, as our human practice project, we have developed an online source of knowledge with links"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Introduction
The following are project studies (“cases”) noted by the members of the Human Practices subcommittee. Each “Case” will examine studies that has some relevance to certain aspects of Human Practices that we recognize within our own project. We have treated this side study as training exercises - as the means of brainstorming additional points that must be considered for the implementation of our product in the real world, based on the current projects ongoing in the synthetic biology field.
CASE 1: PHEnominal - patent criteria
In 2013, a group of researchers (Deming et al) filed a claim for a genetically modified probiotic, PHEnominal, to be used in the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) disease. PHEnominal is genetically modified to express phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme that degrades phenylalanine, and thus can be used to treat pku patients who are unable to digest this amino acid themselves. They published their patent just six months later, in 2014.1 While these researchers are based in the United States, they had also decided to undergo the Canadian patent process. This process, overseen by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, is experienced by many researchers, and it may apply to us depending on the outcomes of our project. Patents offer researchers the opportunity to protect and profit from their inventions, and they have the broader implication of promoting scientific advancement for the benefit of society.2
PHEnominal, as a genetically modified probiotic therapy, can easily be compared to our project. Thus, we can learn a lot from the experiences of these researchers. In order to publish their patent, Deming et al. would have had"

There have been very few studies using this fusion promoter so little is known about it. In addition, more known folding and misfolding proteins can be used to enhance the data gained with maltose binding protein.
Experiment 6: Preliminary characterization of Nms6 for the University of Lethbridge Team
Purpose/ Protocol
The University of Lethbridge is working with a protein meant to degrade catechol in tailing ponds. They have had trouble expressing it and they believe it was misfolding in the cytoplasm. It was constructed downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter (I0500) and ribosomal binding site (B0034). Then, it was transformed into Top10 competent cells containing a plasmid with the ibpAB-fsxA promoter coupled with a GFP reporter. 5 mL overnight cultures were made of these and induced with varying concentrations of arabinose after 16 hours of growth. The cultures were then grown in 30°C conditions and green fluorescence output was measured four hours after induction.
Results
This figure shows the GFP fluorescence output when Nms-6 was ligated with an arabinose-inducible promoter and transformed into cells containing the ibpAB-fsxA fusion promoter coupled with GFP.
Discussion and Conclusions
These preliminary results are not conclusive, however they seem to indicate that there is a much higher GFP output when the expression of Nms6 protein was being induced at higher levels through arabinose induction.  The graph shows an upward line of best fit, indicating the rise in quantities of GFP present.  This suggests that at higher levels of expression, this protein may be misfolding in the cytoplasm. These results are not conclusive however as we do not have enough characetrization data for the ibpAB fusion promoter. With more characterization on the activation of the ibpAB-fsxA fusion promoter and multiple trials to assay GFP production, more conclusive results could be obtained.  Regardless, the Univeristy of Lethbridge may want to try expressing thier protein at lower levels, either through an inducible promoter, or through the use of a lower copy plasmid.

Modelling
Modelling of the RelE-RelB System is Essential to Avoid Irrevocable Dormancy
Controllable dormancy is a feature that holds the potential to be applied in many different situations. However, inducing dormancy and bringing the bacteria back to a metabolic active state is like balancing on a tightrope, and to establish the basis of future implementations, the properties of this system would have to be investigated further. In an endeavour to provide this basic knowledge, stochastic modelling utilising the Gillespie algorithm was performed in an attempt to prognosticate the system and simulate the interactions between the toxin and antitoxin. The toxin RelE is inhibited by the antitoxin RelB through complex formation, and both proteins interact with their promoter in a feedback mechanism.  To consolidate the model, the capacity of the toxin-antitoxin system was assessed in an experiment, as the controllability of the dormancy system was studied through manual  regulation of RelE and RelB expression.
You can read more about the modelling here.

There was not another glucose inducible promoter in the iGEM regresistry, so our team created a novel promoter. This third promoter takes advantage of a repressor protein known as MLC, which is discussed below. The third promoter in our design is upstream of a yellow chromoprotein.
At extremely low concentrations of glucose, the action of the most sensitive promoter dominates, which is our device is always a repressible promoter upstream of a red chromoprotein. Thus, at low concentrations (of the input) the solution appears red. However, when concentrations increase, the red color diminishes and the second promoter starts becoming activated. This produces a blue color as the result of transcription of a blue chromoprotein. Lastly, the third promoter will activate at even higher concentrations resulting in the transcription of a yellow chromoprotein. At these high concentrations the blue and yellow colors will mix and appear green. This unique tri-color system allows for the quantitative measurement of concentrations because they are associated with visible colors.
General Background on MLC (Makes Large Colonies)
The third promoter created and was novel promoter to the iGEM parts registry, consisting of MLC binding sites. MLC is a regulatory protein that stands for “Making Large Colonies”, and is encoded by the gene dgsA. Specifically, MLC is a repressor regulator of many phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTSs). These are pathways for carbohydrate uptake (including glucose).
MLC binds directly to palindromic DNA sequences and blocks RNA polymerase from proceeding with transcription.1,2 In E. coli, MLC is involved in the regulation of many genes involving PTS, including the gene pstG, which encodes for the transmembrane glucose permease also called enzyme IICBGlu (regulation of pstG also involves a CRP, which activates transcription in the presence of glucose: it is thought that the two counter balance one another to provide the correct levels of transcription specifically for enzyme IICBGlu). The protein MLC has high intracellular concentration when glucose concentration is low and becomes sequestered to the cell membrane when glucose concentrations rise. As a result, a promoter with MLC binding sites should function as a glucose inducible promoter (repressing transcription at low glucose concentrations).
For our project, we synthesized four variants of the MLC promoter. The promoters vary in two characteristics: the strength of the promoter associated with the MLC region and the placement of the MLC region. Using the iGEM parts registry,"

According to the natural mechanisms for plasmid maintenance, many new strategies are                                 developed, so called plasmid addiction system (PAS) or post-segregational killing                                 system (PSK) [2]. However, these mechanisms are still under exploration and the                                 capacity of plasmid maintenance is not ideal since most of them can only ensure                                 at least one plasmid remains, can’t truly realize the quantitative control as we hope.
What’s the difference
 Quantitative control
Most existing methods for enhancing biosynthetic performance are stuck                                 at the level of resistance screening or relying on natural mechanisms                                 for plasmid maintenance. These method have the same problem: there is                                 no clear definition for high- and low-performance variants, or said differently,                                 those methods can’t define a number or a range as the threshold of plasmids’ concentration.
In our project, we can not only set a threshold to control the number of plasmids, but also                                 regulate it as we need by using the different biobricks. That is what we say—quantitative control.
 No human intervention
There is a step called spawn rejuvenation in the existing large-scale                                 industrial production procedure.                                 It’s useful to maintain the microbial population structure, but costs plenty of time and money.
Our design has great potential to simplify the process of spawn"

We distributed a questionnaire to investigate “how general public think about synthetic biology and genetic engineering technology.”
We took the questionnaire not only in Japanese but also in English through SNS such as Facebook and twitter.
We also worked in collaboration with iGEM UI Indonesia and we spread the own questionnaires throughout each country. Therefore, we could get answers from all over the world, especially Japan and Indonesia.
The each question and results of the questionnaire are shown below.
Q1. Have you ever heard of iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine)?
A majority of people who answered the questionnaire have already heard of iGEM both in Japan and Indonesia. But 45 % of Japanese and 40 % of Indonesian didn’t know about iGEM.
Q2. What kind of images do you have of E.coli?
In Japan most common answer is that E.coli is difficult to treat and main cause of the infections. On the other hand, ost common answer in Indonesia is “interesting”. It shows that difference of education in each country. From these answers, in Japan, we didn’t learn about E.coli at school and almost all of us can get negative images of E.coli through TV programs, news, newspapers so on.
On the other hand, in Indonesia, most popular answer is “E.coli is interesting”. The percentages of feeling interesting(21 %) is twice as that of Japan(11 %)!
But many people think E.coli bad thing like “main cause of infection” or “dirty” both in Japan and Indonesia! So negative images of E.coli are worldwide.
Q3. How do you want to use E.coli in your lifestyle?
In Japan the most common answer is “small bioenergy as battery and so on.” Japanese may expect that E.coli have a potential to generate energy.
On the other hand, in Indonesia, extermination of harmful insects and detection of environment pollutants.
From these results, Japanese think that E.coli can work as a useful device, but Indonesian thinks that it can work as a device for protecting environment and their daily life. The reason why people in Indonesia want E.coli to protect their lives is that there are many harmful insects in Indonesia than Japan. So we should achieve to make the device for protecting their comfortable lives.
So we can say that devices for developed countries are not needed for worldwide. We should consider about their environments, areas and"

We want to ask all the team how is their structure to work. Does everybody do everything? Do you have leader for each task?
We have three main groups: Lab, Model and HP. Each of the has their leader and students
At the lab we have very exiting news ☺ !! The part circled in red of the circuit is almost done. We are beginning to think about experiments to prove that the biobrick works.
We told you we had problems with the parameters in the mathematical model, but fortunately the parts of our system have been well studied and we were abled to solve the problem. Right now we are evaluating different variations of the circuit (Feed back, no feed back, different reporter…) in order to give the lab the best circuit possible.
Because we were working really hard on the lab last weeks we did not get the chance to participate in the third issue. But we still want you to meet one member of our group: his name is Skerlock coli.
Sherlock coli is a private investigator specialized in finding pathogenic bacteria. In this project he is helping us to find the bad guy Vibrio cholerae. For this purpose, Sherlock is using quorum-sensing molecules as his first lead and as soon he finds V. cholera he will give us a colorful announce.
Right now we are trying to give Sherlock the right tools to find V. cholerae. We have almost finished the circuit and we need to connect it with the phosphorylation cascade made by Peking 2011 Team.
NEXT STEP
The next steps are to prove the circuit and see what improvements can be done. In the Mathematical model the next step is the stochastic simulation.

GRO
This year, the Imperial iGEM team has decided to use a new language to visualise the behavior of its Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (G.E.A.R.) system: Gro. This new language, has allowed us to run hundreds of stochastic simulations, displayed as real-time animations, that provided us with an idea of how our system behaves. Gro proved to be a powerful visualisation tool that Matlab and its Simbiology toolbox both lacked. We have used this tool since the early stages of our project development to explain our circuit to scientists in Imperial College London and designers at the Royal College of Art. As a result Gro played a major role in the construction of our Visualisation Guidebook , which aims to help iGEM teams, particularly the ones on the foundation track, to communicate their project more clearly and efficiently to all kind of audiences.
Gro, developed by the Klavins group at the University of Washington, simulates the behaviour of cells in microcolonies including intrinsic and extrinsic noise. In this way the platform allowed us to carry out stochastic modelling of a version of our circuit to simulate the multicellular behaviours we are expecting.
The model we have produced is a high level model, designed to visually communicate the behaviour of our system at a population level. Due to a lack of computational power, the following simulations, unlike the Matlab models, do not include typical behaviour such as competition for resources, assuming infinite amount of resource and space for the cell populations. However all models by definition include diffusion rates so that we can explore this effect of population level behaviour on our circuit. The following simulations took an average of 2 days to run.
Figure 7: GRO simulation video of 2 cell populations with our GEAR circuit growing at 1:1 ratio.
After implementing a simplified version of the circuit with GP0.4 growth regulation into two populations of E.Coli, the simulation was run 30 times per model. 7 models in total were run, 5 which use our circuit, and 2 control systems to compare the results. All 30 runs were then plotted on a single graph per model with an average to show the typical behaviour of the system. Below each set of simulation results is"

Thermodynamic Model of Cooperative Repression
To recap the derivation from the previous section, the key equation for thermodynamic model of cooperative repression is:
Recap of Thermodynamic Model
In this section, the above model will be explored; specifically, the relationship between the red-colored terms will be studied. First, the relationship between Pbound and the number of Freg's will show the effect of changing number of binding sites on level of gene expression. Then, the relationship between Pbound and KSrd (Dissociation constant of repressor bound to DNA) will show the effect of changing binding strengths of repressors on level of gene expression.
Gene Expression Level vs. Number of Repressor Binding Sites

As highlighted in the equation shown above, the relationship between Pbound and the number of Freg's was studied. The variables and their values used are summarized below.

The problem of wound infections
Wound infections are an attractive target for living materials. During a visit to Expertisecentrum Wondzorg, a center specialized in chronic wounds, we met patient Karel. He had been suffering from chronic wounds for nine months. Because of diabetes and an impaired vascular system, his wounds heal poorly. Karel was so kind to share his story with us.
Due to wounds on my feet I can barely walk. After the removal of dead tissue, the wounds got deeper and the pain worse. Generally, I am always afraid that the mechanical cleaning of my wounds makes them expand or deeper. One of the wounds on my feet got infected and took six weeks of systemic antibiotics to get rid of. This had a great impact on my well-being. In particular, the impact of the antibiotics on my liver and kidney was heavy.
Scope of the problem
There are more patients like Karel. Only in the Netherlands (population size: 17 million), an estimated 500.000 people suffer from complex wounds (4). Globally, 1-2% of the population is affected by chronic leg ulcers (5). Practically all chronic wounds are infected with bacteria. Thirty percent of the wounds will not close, putting patients at risk of amputation. One group of people particularly suffering from wound infections are diabetic patients. Due to poor blood flow to extremities, patients easily develop wounds which subsequently heal poorly and get infected. Other patients at risk of developing chronic wounds are (elderly) people suffering from vascular diseases. Apart from patient suffering, costs to society are large, with an annual estimate of 3.2 billion euros of medical expenditure (6). As the group of affected patients will increase due to aging population, costs are expected to rise (7).
Another group of patients in need of new treatment options are people with burn wounds. In the Netherlands, the number of patients hospitalized with severe burns is approximately 650 annually, but many more suffer from smaller"

Plates show only two colonies, one each from ""slow"" GFP and ""slow insertion time"" GFP. These colonies sampled, grown in cultures.
Wednesday, June 18, 2014
Digested the HMF pathway with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF restriction enzymes. All PCR's of the third genome overlap containing dCas9 failed, and we realized we must complete the first plasmid by inserting dCas9 and use that as a template instead of the original dCas9 plasmid. This points the failure of the ligation to either the dCas9 PCR's or the ligase buffer has expired. We made new aliquots of fresh ligase buffer to test whether this was the case. We have run out of ClaI and cannot digest dCas9 until this arrives. Our strategy now is to Gibson assembly the Lambda Red Recombinase system and dCas9, then PCR Rescue and ligate into plasmid 1 using XhoI/SalI-HF and XbaI to mitigate the lack of ClaI.
Plasmid prep on cultures from colonies that grew after transformation. New hypothesis develope: perhaps the higher expression GFPs killed the cells due to their extremely rapid translation elongation, leaving only the less efficiently translated GFP carrying cells to live. Online check using website Genscript and their free gene analysis tool shows that the common GFP scores a perfect 1.0 and the rare GFP a perfect 0.0 on their scale (from 0 being not optimized at all to 1 being perfectly optimized). This reveals that the algorithm used by Genscript corresponds directly to the codon usage profile for E.coli over the entire genome.

Conducted 2-part Gibson CBA to assemble the Lambda Red Recombinase system and the dCas9 system.
Many more RBS library calculations run, some using a method where the Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence is mutated, but not the rest of the initial condition. Hopefully this will speed up the calculations and finally yield some high TIR libraries that evenly span the range we are looking for. Another overnight culture of slow GFP/slow insertion time GFP cells innoculated.

Fixed most of the first lab challenge. Tried to fix wiki CSS coding, but it didn’t work (at Lethbridge workshop, we learned that the wiki can’t handle css positioning so we are switching to use tables to divide the parts of the page into sections).
The robots now respond to more sentences, so hopefully they are more user-friendly. Still need to figure out how to make it most obvious what must be said to the robot for them to work. We also had our Second Life meeting today.

Visit Far East Bio-Tech Company
To find out the most effective way to solve the energy crisis and to ensure our project is responsible and good for the world, NYMU-Taipei this year paid a visit to one of the largest biotechnology company in Taiwan, Far East Bio-Tech Company. We visited Mr. C. C. Chiueh, the founder of FEBICO. He gave us some professional suggestions from an enterprise view and inspired us to find out more prospective ways to conduct our project.
Interview with Dr. Han-Jia Lin
Later in October, we held an interview with Dr. Han-Jia Lin, a microalgae specialist from National Taiwan Ocean University. We not only discussed the biosafety concern of genetically modified microalgae with Dr. Han-Jia Lin but also consulted him with the mutualistic relationship between Escherichia coli and microalgae in our co-culture model. Dr. Han-Jia Lin gave us lots of professional and constructive advice, which had deep effects on our project.
Education
This summer, NYMU also engaged with lots of senior high schools to advocate our project, including Wego Bilingual High School and Taipei First Girl High School. We introduced the main concept of our project to them and educated the students what is synthetic biology, so they could be more acquainted with iGEM. We also invited  CGU Taiwan to present their project to us as well.
Besides educating senior high schools, this year, we also held a special activity- the iGEM NYMU-Taipei 10 Year Exhibition. We presented all the posters from the last decade so that the audience could have deeper understanding of iGEM"

Since our product is a biocontrol, it can be fitted into the bactericide market, a market that has strong and experienced competitors that keep improving their products in order to keep the sales high. The impact of regulatory changes in the USA or other lead countries could be an upside factor to promote the market growth.
We analyzed our direct competitors based on the characteristics of the products they offer, specifically focusing on the unmet customer needs. Our product has the objective to fulfill these needs, having more advantages than those of our competitors.
The first product analyzed was the Bordeaux mixture, a mixture of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) used as a fungicide and bactericide. The environmental impact lasts longer than other similar products. Concerning phytotoxicity, the Bordeaux mixture leaves a salty deposit, has a high pH and it is more phytotoxic than other products, the phytotoxicity increases in cold and wet environments. It is important to mention that this mixture is not compatible with most pesticides which makes its preparation difficult because of the longer time it takes to prepare and also requires more knowledge and safety equipment. The first product by BIOferm, Agri-Mycin which is a protectant bactericide designed to combat difficult diseases such as fire blight in apples, pears, tomatoes, peppers, celery, and tobacco. The main disadvantage of this product is that it needs to get mixed with other chemicals, rising the investment of the agricultor considerably. Another product by BIOferm, Blossom Protect is a biocontrol product used for the prevention of fire blight. Beneficial microorganisms outcompete the fire blight pathogen for space and nutrients, blocking the site of fire blight infection. This product could be considered one of our main competitors, but the product has an exclusive sale only in the United States(Bio-ferm, 2015). An alternative product from Adama is Cuprimicín 500 hyper, it is a fungicide, bactericide, and mycoplasmicide of the group of the preventive in mixture with antibiotics, that acts as a control of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and mycoplasmas. This product has a great distribution in Mexico but has some disadvantages as a high level of toxicity to fishes and bees. Therefore the effects have a short duration lacking long-term effectiveness(Adama México, 2016). Bayer, one of the major companies in the market, comes"

Transforming B. subtilis with PCR product
We are currently working on biobricking lacZ. We are planning on submitting this part to the iGEM registry since the lacZ available in the registry has bad sequencing.
Week 21: September 14 - September 20
Now that we had sporulated B. subtilis and confirmed the presence of spores using Gram stains and spore stains, we were ready to activate the spores back to the vegetative state. All that is required for this switch to occur is the presence of nutrients, which describes a regular LB-agar plate. We attempted activation by spreading 50 uL of thawed spore solution (from 4 °C and -20 °C) on plain agar plates. Colonies successfully grew on the plates and based on a qualitative analysis, more colonies grew for the long-term storage spore solution than short-term storage spore solutions. Although we had colonies growing, we needed to confirm whether spores actually converted to vegetative cells.
Figure 9: B. subtilis spore regeneration on plain LB-agar plates. The plate on the left was spread with spore solution stored at 4°C for short-term storage. The plate on the right was spread with spore solution stored at -20°C for long-term storage. Based on colony growth, more cells were viable under long-term storage conditions.
Post sporulation and regeneration staining
Israt had plated regenerated B. subtilis on LB agar plates, which were incubated overnight at 37 ° C so that staining could be done on them to check to make sure the bacteria looked the same when analyzed as  before they were sporulated.  Six slides were made using Israt's plates, four for Gram staining and two for spore  staining.
Plates:
B. subtilis Spore. September 18, 2014
B. subtilis Spore+xylose. September 16, 2014
From these plates two slides for each was made for Gram staining, and then two slides from Plate 1 for spore  staining.  The same Gram and spore staining procedures, as above, was used for the slides, the only modification  made to the staining procedure was that the counter-stain Safrinin was left on for one and half minutes instead  of just one minute as it was noticed that the Safrinin was too light in colour in the previous staining slides.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments"

Overview
Day 1 was mutiny. Five students had met with a sponsor in the morning and when the two captains returned to the room, the students were milling around, whispering under their breath, and fidgeting. The problem was with motivation towards the project, as some students felt that it wasn’t novel enough. We had found a 1998 paper by Duport et al. that explained how their team developed yeast to produce pregnenolone and progesterone - the things we wanted to make. It turns out though that the paper didn’t lead to anything, the strain has been lost, and it was a good proof of concept for our idea. From the uprising we learned to communicate thoroughly.
Week of July 2nd
Overview
Our yeast strain is going to have all the genes to make progesterone, as well as the lactase enzyme so that we can feed it lactose and it break it down to glucose and galactose. We figured out after much deliberation how we could have our friends in developing nations get the accurate dose of progesterone. We learned from our mentor that we could use a technique to measure the weight of an object using a coat hanger, and depending on weight, calculate the amount of lactose inside that container. This would be the dairy that the people have on hand. Depending on weight, we will have a chart that says how much lactose is in that container. The people will be guided to portion a certain amount of the lactose into an ice-cube-like container and"

Our major motivation was to provide the world with a good solution to detect STIs. But we soon realized that what we achieved is actually a much more general strategy for developing quick and efficient tests. Indeed we developed a strategy which is extendable to pretty much every target you can think about. So we could imagine to sell the device and paper strips to be put inside the casing as a platform to be adapted with aptamers for each situations. Instead of detecting STIs we could detect water pollutants (heavy metals, pesticides…), other health issues (cancer, bacterial infections...) and food contamination. So we hope some future iGEM teams will follow us on this exciting path!

P-atp2
P-atp2 (atpB) is an alkali-induced promoter in Corynebacterium glutamicum located in F0F1 ATPase operon (Fig.18). Each microorganism in nature has an optimal pH and drastic changes in extracellular pH values trigger a stress response that results in overexpression of certain genes and suppression of others[17]. The P-atp2 promoter responds to the pH changes from pH 7.0 to pH 9.0, especially at alkaline pH. When the pH value increasing, the expression increased modestly[19]. It is activated by the alternative sigma factor of the RNA polymerase, whose synthesis would be activated when the bacteria are growing at alkaline pH[17][18]. In the C.glutamicum genome, there are several kinds of sigma factors, among them, expression of Sigma H and Sigma W respond to the alkaline shock(Fig.19)[18][20][21].
Fig.18 F0F1 operon
Fig.19 SigH responds to alkaline stress
P-atp2, as a kind of alkali-induced promoter, is believed to control the expression of functional genes depending on the extracellular pH. Because of this, we anticipate that the P-atp2 will control the functional gene to expression when the environment is alkaline. Combing these two parts, it would allow adaptive acid to neutralize alkaline. To achieve this goal of a regulation device that can be used to specific conditions, our main aim was to construct P-atp2, then testing and verifying it.
The promoter P-atp2 is placed in Corynebacterium glutamicum, and we got it by standard methods and the agarose gel electrophoresis was used"

Collaboration and sharing, the key to step forward
As iGEMers, we all know sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. If a team seal themselves off, not only will they be trapped in projects, but also cannot stand in a higher position to grasp the overall situation. Instead of cooping ourselves up, we actively cooperated together for the betterment of Synthetic Biology as a whole. UESTC-Software had collaborated with other 5 teams in 6 different ways:
(1) Mentoring and supporting TMMU-China, which is a new team.
(2) Solving problems for UESTC-China, our brother team.
(3) Wet-lab help from UESTC-China, which helped us with validation.
(4) Software testing by AHTU-China, which was the first user of Bio101.
(5) Having meetup with SCU-China, TMMU-China, UESTC-China and SICAU.
(6) Participating meetup with Nanjing-China organized by TMMU_China.
Support for TMMU_China
Background
This year, TMMU_China as a young team needed a lot of support from other experienced teams. iGEM encourages help and collaborations among teams, especially the new teams. Our team built a friendly connection with other iGEM teams like TMMU_China, and we provided some useful supports for them in order to contribute to iGEM the competition itself, and even to Synthetic Biology.
During our iGEM trip, we helped TMMU_China to build Protein Calculator, a web app to predict experiment result based on their modeling.
This programming work is time-consuming but helpful, we believe our effort can cut enormous workload and free their time so that they can focus on their experiments and research.
Main work
After communication and discussion about the workflow and details, our engineer group began to build and test the web app since our Chongqing Trip. We used Django to manage the web and put all necessary contents into HTML files, with related models and views in Python files.

Useful ideas for Improving Safety
Watermarking
To increase public safety we propose to introduce a water-marking standard.
Following the example of J. Craig Venter, who, in may 2010, created the first watermark in a bacteria, containing several readable messages, we propose to create a watermarking standard to increase the safety of the environment, as well as the safety of the community at large. <vr> But why should we consider creating and using a watermarking standard for work in synthetic biology? Let us consider the following example:
A company has created a synthetic organism capable of absorbing harmful substances from the ground. The government, eager to help clean polluted ground, releases the bacteria into the wild, confident that the bacteria will not pose any threat to the environment. These bacteria do not, however, react as planned. Instead of absorbing only the harmful substances from the ground, they transfer the substances to other organisms, or simply run amok spreading themselves in an uncontrolled manner, causing harm instead of good. Let us imagine that this happens close to the nation's border. The government in the neighboring state finds itself with a unexplained biological phenomenon, possibly causing great harm.
Should the rogue bacteria contain engineered, watermarked parts, it would be a small matter to have the parts sequenced, thus the government would be able to easily access all the relevant information on the rogue bacteria, contact the manufacturers and would know how to stop it.
The watermark
We believe that a watermark should contain the following:
I.        A 12 nucleotide ‘license’
We have set the following criteria for a good watermark:
I.        It should contain the creating team’s ‘license’
II.        It should not interfere with the other functions of the part
III.        It should be persistent in the plasmid, i.e. not be removed from the plasmid due to natural evolution
IV.        It should be easy to find, easy to read and easy to insert by the developing team
This 12 nucleotide license would then refer"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,"                                 camp lasted for two months. Then, we welcomed students                                 who showed great passion to iGEM to take part in the brainstorm activity.
What's more, our teacher, Prof. Chun Li,                                 introduced iGEM to students at Yan'an University. They wanted to set up                                 a team to participate in the iGEM, but they had never established any iGEM team and had no experience.                                  Therefore, we invited three students from Yan'an University to be our team members to design and                                 implement our project together. In this process, they not only expanded their knowledge of synthetic                                  biology and improve their experimental skills,                                 but also learned how to build an iGEM team.All those will help                                 them to establish an iGEM team next year on their own.                                  More importantly, we are closer to the idea of iGEM and spread synthetic                                 biology to more people.                                 We look forward to their outstanding performance next year.
Conferences
In August, 2016, BIT-China was invited to take part in the Asia-Pacific                                     conferenceheld by team NCKU-Tainan. About 20 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
We also presented our project, and received lots of feedback to improve our                                 design. As the first one to present, the Q and A section of our team was                                 under hot discussion. The questions raised referred not only to the                                 project design, but also extended to considerations about safety issues.                                 However, since the logic order of our presentation was not clear enough,                                 the audience misunderstood the core concept of our project.
After the conference, we adjusted the logic order and improved our oral presentation.
In addition to this, we held and took part in several exchange                                 meetings with other three teams: Peking,  Jilin_China , UCAS.
Through these exchange meetings, we got many useful                                 suggestions to shape our project step by step.
HP Union
In the Asia-Pacific conference, we greatly enlarged our horizons by sharing ideas with other teams. At the same time, we felt it’s not enough and it’s necessary and urgent to do more things. So we decided to establish a platform for teams’ interactive communication called iGEM Union.
This union mainly have three purposes:
a) Make it more convenient for iGEMers’ online communication this year:
In this way, most of the common problems can be solved as quickly as possible, and the members can"

Substrate supply
Background
There are three enzymes needed in our chassis. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase(pcc), an enzyme needed in the biosynthesis of polyketides, is an enzyme complex containing two components playing the core role in our chassis, of which accA is the α biotinylated subunit functioning as the acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA carboxylase while pccB，the β subunit，acts as the carboxyl transferase【1】. BirA is a biotin ligase that improves the activity of accA, acts as an enhancer like sfp, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase facilitating posttranslational modification of the DEBS proteins in E.coli BL21(DE3) [2]. With the pcc and sfp genes transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3), it will express DEBS genes at the comparable level to S. erythraea or S.coelicolor [2].
Design
As the three enzymes are suitable to produce the substrate for all of our polyketide synthases(PKS), we decided to co-express them in one plasmid—the low copy plasmid pSB4A5 and make it the chassis for our expression of PKSs.
Figure 2: Our design of the desired genes on pSB4A5. Sfp was originally desigened to be knocked into the prp operon of E.coli BL21(DE3) by homologous recombination but was frame shifted, so we put it on pSB4A5 with individual PT7 and T7T.

Innovative BioBrick construction
     This year we developed an innovative way to construct and pre-confirm BioBricks efficiently.
     This method mainly applies to those parts that are initially constructed on backbones other than pSB1A3/1C3/1K3 etc. and suffer adding suffix/prefix when changing into standard backbone.
Significance
     Due to various and specific needs for experiments, or customs in host labs, it is often unfeasible to use the standard backbone from the beginning to the end of the project. Therefore, when we construct BioBricks, we will have to reconstruct the part into the standard backbone.
     For example, this year, we used pEntry for most of our experiments, which contains attL recombining sites required by our design. We also used eukaryotic vectors for cell experiments and our G1 promoters (intended to submit as the new basic parts) were are ligated in an eukaryotic vector.
     Moreover, sometimes it is impossible to construct the parts with prefix/suffix for experiments: there is a big chance that the backbones used for experiments contain PstI, EcoRI, NotI enzyme sites (one or more), and that it will be used for experimental needs. In this occasion, you don’t dare add the same enzyme site beside you parts!

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#interviews#expert6_-_-_TEXT.html," student would be able to understand its theory. It is abstract, but not diabolical. On the other hand, its ontological furniture, that is the set of objects which it declares as existing objects, is complicated. There are a lot of elementary particles. Some people think it's too complicated, and prefer to simplify this ontological furniture by superstring theory. Every particle from the standard model is a vibration mode of a unique string. It is very simple ontologically, but it is infernal mathematically. Few people really have a good command of this theory. So we need a criterion in order to define complexity.
It is commonly accepted that for example life is complex. What makes a living system be alive? Some complex systems don't have any reproduction, that doesn't mean they are less complex. We can even imagine that some beings which are not complex are alive. One can often define something, a concept or a notion only by what it is not. For example: matter is what doesn't have a conscience. Conscience is what is more than matter. Definitions refer to each other. For life, it is kind of the same thing. Life is what is not inert; inertia is what is not alive… On this question one has to start with a characterisation of life, even if it is questioned, so that one doesn't talk to himself.
WHAT IS EMERGENCE?
I realised that people like to hear themselves when saying the word emergence, which is not well thought. What is emergence?
There is a first type of emergence: the fact that a property of a system is expressed only if this system reaches a certain size. The property is always present but it is invisible while the size of the system is limited. See for example superconductivity. An electron is not superconductor alone. The equations of propagation of an electron in a solid contain its possible superconductivity, but this property is expressed only in some conditions. The emergence of superconductivity is simply the apparition of a phenomenon determined by a theory which is valid at all scales. In that sense, emergence is nothing more; it doesn't bring any more information.
There is another emergence, radical emergence. Something absolutely absent in the underlying levels can appear. It can be a new law, new physics. This second emergence is due to the fact that our theories are only effective theories. See for example nuclear physics. When you do nuclear physics, when you work on the nucleus of an atom, you are not going to write a Hamiltonian on all quarks inside, gluons, etc. There are some effective theories which"

This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail. Please visit our characterization page for an overview of our measurements with those parts and our result page for other results.
How our system works:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
σx, BBa_K1379004 : gene sequence of competence protein ComX which produces σx factor. σx factor induces promoter containing Com-Box sequence (PcelA and PcomFA).
PcelA promoter, BBa_K1379000 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of competence CelA protein.
PcomFA promoter, BBa_K1379001 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of ComFA protein.
Data for Pre-existing Parts:
Strong promoter, strong RBS combination, BBa_K880005 (Team Michigan iGEM, 2012): combination of strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) was used as a backbone for a very high level of expression of ComX protein (σx factor).
GFP generator, BBa_E0240 (Antiquity Boston University iGEM, 2004): green fluorescent protein reporter ( BBa_E0040 ) with RBS ( BBa_B0032 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) was used as a reporter for characterization of PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
We Also Built and Characterized the Following Parts:
σx Generator, BBa_K1379006 : comX gene sequence was assembled with constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator so ComX protein is produced constitutively.

Blue Leaf
    This year, we have designed a new carbon cycle system. The system consists of three parts.
Figue2, Blue Leaf carbon cycle system.
    In the first part, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. The use of mature carbon dioxide fixation technology turns the carbon dioxide in the air into formic acid[3], and then gets formaldehyde which is the sole carbon source by specific enzyme.[4]
Figue3, Part I, Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide.
    The second part is the new formaldehyde condensation pathway which can achieve the efficient synthesis of D-xylulose from formaldehyde. This is the part that connects the front and the back of the entire Blue Leaf project, and also determines  whether the entire device can be used to synthesize starch with a carbon compound as the sole carbon source. We found two enzymes with different condensation functions, BFD and TalB. The former can turn formaldehyde condensation into two intermediate products: dihydroxyacetone and hydroxyacetaldehyde.The latter condenses two intermediate products into a five carbon sugars Compounds: D-xylulose. Our wet experiments also also focused on the validation of this pathway and the efficient expression as well as the catalysis of both enzymes.
Figue4, Part II, New Synthesis of D-xylulose by Formaldehyde Assimilation
    In the third part, Glycogen Metabolism can be used to synthsize D-xylulose into Glycogen.[5]
Figue5, Part III, Glycogen Metabolism.
    In addition, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combined catalysis, we used synthetic protein scaffolds technology[6]. We have optimized the protein scaffold sequence and performed functional validation on the basis of the iGEM CONCORDIA 2015 team.[7]

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

The expression of CsgA is strictly controlled by inducer anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and its biomass can be tuned by the concentration of inducer ( Results and Optimization ) so that the biofilm is only formed when we need it and is conductive to be well operated when our system is industrialized. Next, we demonstrate the experiments we conducted to test the expression, quantify the biomass, and analyze the viability of different CsgA biobricks.
Construction and Characterization
Principles of methods of characterization
Congo Red Assay:
Congo Red dye is a classic method to detect amyloid protein [2]. Amyloid can be visualized and quantified through the staining of Congo Red because Congo Red molecules obtain an oriented arrangement on amyloid fibrils. This property can be ascribed to the hydroxyl groups on the amyloid and hydrogen bonding on the Congo Red [3]. It only takes approximately 20 minutes to dye so it is indeed a good practice in lab to crudely test the expression of biofilms.
Crystal Violet Assay:
Crystal violet is a triarylmethane dye used as a histological stain to classify biomass. This is a simple assay practical and useful for obtaining quantitative data about the relative quantity of cells which adhere to multi-wells cluster dishes. After solubilization, the amount of dye taken up by the monolayer can be quantitated in a plate reader. [4]
Fig 1. Crystal violet and Congo Red reagent.
Transmission Electron Microscope(TEM):
In order to visualize the formation and different appearance of biofilm nanowire network, we utilize transmission electron microscope to directly look into the microscopic world. TEM can visualize nano-structure with the maximal resolution of 0.2nm which is beyond the range of optical microscope.
In using TEM, samples must be prepared accordingly. The first step is to apply UAc on objects. After object is covered by UAc, the certain area would absorb or cause scattering of electrons and therefore the detector cannot receive transmissive electrons through copper grid, thus leaving a dark shadowy appearance of sample in the image.

Quantum Dots Binding Assay:
Mechanisms of Quantum dots binding assay have been introduced in detail in Quantum Dots part. We utilizing Co/Ni-NTA-Metal-Histag coordination chemistry and fluorescence emission traits of Quantum Dots (QDs) to bind with the histidine in Histags on our biofilm and thus characterize its formation. The whole linkage is performed"

2GROUNDBREAKING NEWS (!): So we have decided to call it an......Opto-Magnetic Revolution
3HOW CAN THAT EVER BE POSSIBLE (?): Basically, we focus on achieving BRET under electromagnetic field oscillations......
4BUT BEFORE DREAMS COME TRUE (#): Yeah, yeah, we know......We were not using E. coli.
5WAIT, SO YOU GONNA PUT THEM IN... (§): Glial cells in brain......Yes, we will make them dormant.

INTERESTING POINTS (◎): Hummm......you mentioned about......""Realizing the Concept of Avatar?""
Magnetotactic bacteria have long been regarded as an intriguing group of species exhibiting magnetotaxis with their fascinating bacterial organelles, magnetosomes. Also, optogenetics, the recent revolution in neuroscientific methodologies, has caught our attention intensively. An eagerness out of pure curiosity to combine and utilize these two streams of thoughts gave way to a truly ground-breaking idea, the realization of the concept of Avatar.
GROUNDBREAKING NEWS (!):So we have decided to call it an......Opto-Magnetic Revolution
This year, NYMU-Taipei goes beyond the current realm of mainstream synthetic biology We develope a opto-magnetic probing platform on Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 which functionally couples to channelrhodopsins (opsins that are ultra-rapidly reactive to light beams of certain wavelengths) to enable activation of neuronal circuitry in a totally wireless, spatially and temporarily accurate, minimally invasive, 3-dimensional multi-site stimulation enabling fasion.
