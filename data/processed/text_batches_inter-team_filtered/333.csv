Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"

Atlanta Science Festival #ASF2015!!!
BioBricks, Synthetic Biology in Atlanta (GSU/GaTech iGEM)
The Atlanta Science Festival is a week-long event dedicated to the celebration of science and technology. This year the festival attracted over 45,000 people.
This year, GSUiGEM collaborated with the Georgia Tech iGEM team for this event. During the Exploration Expo, these main topics were discussed with Atlantans: What is iGEM/Synthetic Biology?; Ethical Concerns and Careers in Synthetic Biology. In addition, children (and even adults) could build their own Biobrick with legos.

Assemble your Biobrick!
Find a promoter (is it constitutive? inducible?). Attach an RBS to it. Choose your own coding sequence. What did you make?
In an effort to bring synthetic biology/iGEM awareness to the public, the GSU-iGEM team, along with the GSU Synthetic Biology Club, developed a game that we could play with children and adults alike using Legos to demonstrate a standard, working iGem construct.  This involved lots of hours developing a game that was simple yet informative.  We also spent a good chunk of time sorting upwards of 12000 Lego Bricks!"

BostonU,2016,Team:BostonU HW#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," become apparent. We had a clear choice here: We could have made Neptune interface with industry grade, powerful and very expensive fabrication methods using photolithography and plasma bonding. If we decided to do this, there would be a blunt eighty-thousand-dollar barrier of entry to researchers and hobbyists looking to use Neptune. That would be unacceptable. We could have had Neptune’s microfluidics be controlled using very high precision, high accuracy pumps that would provide flawless flow rates. But the hardware and infrastructure for these pumps would cost hundreds of dollars per pump, and the cost would not scale. We could not settle for this.
Instead, we framed our workflow around the low cost MakerFluidics fabrication protocol. In this protocol, the eighty thousand dollar fabrication process of photolithography is bypassed; instead our microfluidic chips are fabricated with a simple CNC mill, costing a order of magnitude less, while still delivering high performance devices.
We made it our project goal, to fully integrate accessibility into Neptune. Neptune is microfluidics for industry, for research, for education and for hobbyists. We made Neptune have the lowest possible bar to entry; it is the only microfluidic design, fabrication and control workflow all integrated into one software tool-- and the best part is it can be used by anyone. We made accessibility the centerpiece of Neptune.
Open Hardware Schematics
A big aspect of enabling accessible microfluidics is reducing the barrier of entry for controlling these devices. Microfluidics are controlled by pumps that generate pressures gradients to push or pull fluids, or open and close valves. Most modern microfluidic control pumps are expensive and difficult to integrate, making it hard to scale for larger microfluidic designs, and dissuasive for hobbyists.
We chose to directly target our hardware designs to this problem. We developed completely open 3D print design schematics for our microfluidic control infrastructure. These designs are available for download on our GitHub repo, and server though Neptune as well! Furthermore, we developed a completely original hardware design to control syringe pumps using very low cost servo motors.
NONA Research Foundation Partnership
Integrating our workflow with the idea of accessibility was a huge step; we successfully build Neptune as the most accessible microfluidics creation tool to date, with low cost fabrication protocols, open hardware designs, and powerful design algorithms- virtually any research lab can now realistically consider microfluidics as an option, without devoting huge costs or needing expertise in the field.
A big step, but we had to go further. The biggest issue we faced as the summer drew to a close was sustainability. Indeed, a"

Beadzillus: Fundamental BioBricks for Bacillus subtilis and spores as a platform for protein display
We chose to work with Bacillus subtilis to set new horizons and offer tools for this model organism to the Escherichia coli-dominated world of iGEM. Therefore, we created a BacillusBioBrickBox (B4) composed of reporter genes, defined promoters, as well as reporter, expression, and empty vectors in BioBrick standard. B. subtilis naturally produces stress-resistant endospores which can germinate in response to suitable environmental conditions. To highlight this unique feature using the B4, we developed Sporobeads. These are spores displaying fusion proteins on their surface. As a proof of principle, we fused GFP to the outermost layer. Expanding this idea, we designed a Sporovector to easily create any Sporobead imaginable. Because the Sporobeads must be biologically safe and stable vehicles, we prevented germination by knocking out involved genes and developed a Suicideswitch turned on in case of germination. With the project Beadzillus, our team demonstrates the powerful nature of B. subtilis.

This gel also confirms that we definitely do have our mZifA and mGliA within expected ranges.  mLexA, however, should only be 244 bp according to the vector map.

Preparation
Obtain and refigerate the following buffers:
RDP Wash Buffer (10mL)
RDP Elution buffer (10mL)
RDP Storage buffer (10mL)
Important: all liquid reagents stored refrigerated in microcentrifuge tubes will evaporate overtime and condense on the lid. All microcentrifuge tubes should be pulsed down and mixed just prior to use.
Identify the RDP parts you need from the iGEM kit plate.
Based on your design, detrmine the RDP parts you need from the kit.
Important: If your assembly has more than 5 RDP parts, include the X-blockers (Blk-X) and Z-blockers (Blk-Z). They aren't required as part of the circuit, but are needed for the assembly protocol as described further below.
To ensure you resuspend the correct wells, use a Sharpie or lab marker to draw a ring around the upper lip of each selected well
Resuspend RDP parts in high-grade H2O. Use the table provided for resuspension volumes.

Under the guidance of this model, we used a series of concentration of cadmium to induce the expression of RFP and have obtained a visible effect of color change.Figure 6 shows the color change.
Figure 6 shows the color change which reflect PcadA strength.
Then we narrowed the concentration range of cadmium ion and devoted to finding out the lower limit of detection. Figure 7 shows the lower limit of detection.
Figure 7 shows the lower limit of detection.
Part 2: Ptet Indicator
I. Goal
We are going to establish a suitable mathematical model by finding out the relative useful parameters and find out the relationship between the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion and the Ptet strength. After this model is built, we can easily figure out the lower limit of detection, which is the specific concentration of extracellular cadmium ion when the system presents obvious color change (from blue to red).
II. Principle
Ptet which we are using comes from iGEM committee. We are very familiar with its mechanism. Similar to PcadA, Ptet strength is limited by tetR, but tetracycline can combine with tetR and disable it, eventually , it leads to derepression of Ptet.
However, tetracycline wasn’t used in our project. Besides, expression level of tetR is controlled by PcadA strength, so there is a negative correlation between PcadA strength and Ptet strength.
Hill equation can be used to simulate the effect of Ptet too. In Ptet indicator model, the independent variable is the concentration of intracellular cadmium ion, and the dependent variable is the strength of Ptet.
III.Parameter Measuring and Data Processing
We are familiar with the mechanism of Ptet. Besides, we only use this model for semiquantitative analysis in our project. Therefore, we don’t need to design a quantitative experiment for this model to measure data.
2008 EPF-Lausanne Team and 2013 UC_Davis Team have used Ptet in their projects. In modeling part, they have provided the relative useful parameter data for us. [4][5] However, the mechanism of Ptet activation is different which they figure out respectively. 2013 UC_Davis Team’s is more concrete, involving the parallel function of the two operons. 2008 EPF-lausanne Team’s was analysed as a whole.
In order to establish a more accurate mathematical model and figure out the lower limit of detection, we analysed these two models by ourselves and used Chebyshev approximation and"

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," part of the workshop, we learnt about the different techniques of investigating public perception and understanding, such as providing unexpected physical stimuli in typical environments and observing people’s reactions.
This culminated in us conducting our own surveys on the streets of Cambridge on deliberately thought-provoking issues surrounding plant biotech, to establish a dialogue with the public about plant synthetic biology and understand the opinions already held about this area. Some of the issues we investigated included the ethics of plant experimentation, comparing this with animal testing and seeing if similar emotional responses could be generated from questions such as ‘Do plants feel pain?’
We also investigated how people felt about potential future applications of plant syn bio, such as enhancing the nutritional content of certain foods, or even using engineered plants to express a person’s complete nutritional requirements which could then be extracted and concentrated into a pill-a-day form.
Although many of our questions were purely hypothetical, the conversations they generated were eye opening for us in understanding the reasoning behind some objections to plant syn bio. Participating in the workshop at this early stage in our project ensured we considered the impact of our work on different communities, and the potential reactions to the technology that could stem from the project, throughout the entire iGEM process.

We used a dilution series of 1/10, 1/25,1/50, 1/100, 1/500, 1/1000 (Table 5) in order to make a calibration curve.
Table 5.Samples used for the second Western Blot experiment.
The Western Blot protocol (nr 24) was followed, as executed in experiment 1.
Results and discussion
Experiment 1: Qualitative analysis of internal CsgA_His protein
In Figure 11A, the SDS page gel is shown. The gel is too condensed to visualize a difference between the non-induced and induced samples, because the gel was overloaded.
Figure 11: A. SDS page gel, experiment 1 samples as described in Table 1.B. Membrane after blotting, of the samples of experiment 1 (Left to right).
We saw in figure 11B a band in lane 4 and 8, with a size of circa. 17 kDA. The lanes correspond to the strain ΔcsgA_csgA_his induced rhamnose, after 5 hours and 24 hours of induction. The antibodies bind specifically to the His-tag of proteins, which did not bind to the ΔcsgA_csgA samples, line 1, 2, 5 and 6. Therefore it can be concluded that the strain ΔcsgA_csgA_his produced his-tagged CsgA proteins. The effect of rhamnose was visible when compared to the samples with ΔcsgA_csgA_his without rhamnose induction, lane 3 and 7. There are no bands visible, therefore rhamnose"

04.06.2013
Research question:
Finding sets of candidate genes causative to the single cell phenotype in Aspergillus niger by transcriptome analysis.
Subquestions:
- is A. niger metabolically active at 44C?
- does A. niger divide at 44C?
May
Metabolic model A. niger
30.05.2013
The current metabolic model of A. niger needs to be expanded to include the lovastatin pathway as known from literature. First the model has to be checked: is it balanced? can we perform a FBA on the current model?

Fig.1: Graphic presenting para-nitrophenol’s absorbance at 405 nm at different incubation’s times with a 4 µM ComS..
Tests were also made to assess the optimal ComS concentration.
The peptide must be chemically synthetized and is therefore valuable. As such, decreasing the amount used would be economically interesting.
The ComS optimal concentration in the medium seems to be at 4 µM. Multiple experiences shows that higher concentrations even reduces the signal.
Fig.2: Graphic showing para-nitrophenol’s absorbance at 405 nm after 1 hour incubation with different ComS concentrations..
Still in order to obtain a practical product, the signal has to be clearly visible and easy to interpret.        A first possibility that we tested is to grow our strains containing pcMMCD 105 on a medium with X-Gluc         (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid, cyclohexylammonium salt).
X-Gluc is a glucoronidase’s substrate that produces a blue precipitate when cleaved (like X-Gal).        Results showed again an optimal concentration at 4 µM of ComS 5
Fig.3: E. coli GUS- pcMMCD105 culture spread on LB medium with erythromycin 100 µg/ml, X-Gluc 1.2µg/ml and 0-2-4-6-8 µM ComS.
This system could be optimized by replacing the glucuronidase by a RFP. This would allow us to obtain a direct signal and avoid the use of expensive substrates.
Lastly, to make our system fully functional and UV sensitive, we synthetized the ComS peptide with a photocaged tyrosine (ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine).        The photocaged tyrosine was purchased and verified by NMR.        The whole peptide synthesis couldn’t be achieved. We suppose that during the synthetizing, the ortho-nitrobenzyl group moved from the phenol function to the carboxylic function.        This would prevent any further amino acid addition.        To overcome this problem, the use of ComR/S from Streptococcus vestibularis has been considered.        Indeed this ComS version ends with a double tyrosine, getting around our current problems.

Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," and the development of a database on indoor pollution.
Obtained confirmation of the molecular targets for our project: Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)
A handshake with our President
All these opportunities to learn about air pollution and get feedback from experts of various fields nourished a constant reassessment of our project. Aether wouldn’t be the same without the people we met.
A global questionnaire
How is the air pollution issue perceived by citizens, and what potential solutions could be considered?
We conceived a survey in order to grasp the public’s knowledge about air pollution, and the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, for which we received more than 2 300 responses worldwide. We obtained 1 874 answers from Europe, 213 from Asia, 97 from North America, 71 from Africa, 24 from South America and 9 from Oceania.
The aim was to better understand the expectations of people regarding air pollution, and if the idea of using synthetic biology as a solution was well perceived and accepted. Another purpose for this survey, was to teach people and sensitize them on the subjects of synthetic biology and air pollution.
Design of survey
We separated the questionnaire into three sections: the first part collected information about the participant's profile; the second asked the participant about his knowledge of the different pollutants and sources of air pollution and the impact, if there is one, of this disaster on their everyday life; measures that they take to protect themselves or expectations on protection from it by authorities; the third part focused on synthetic biology, its perception by the general public, and its potential usefulness to find a solution based on this field of biology.
Spread of the survey
We used the following method to spread the questionnaire around the world:
We began by sharing the questionnaire on social networks (Facebook, Twitter), but we soon realized that this method would be insufficient to obtain broader representative results from our own social perimeter: friends and similarly trained science students. Indeed, after 500 responses, 90% were from people between 18 to 26 years old, in Europe.
Therefore, we changed our approach. We contacted French embassies in 40 countries around the world, and several of them (including Russia, Japan, Canada, US, New Zealand, etc.) shared our questionnaire on their social networks. We also spread the questionnaire through the alumni networks of our Universities. Finally, we distributed the questionnaire in several companies through our friends abroad and our families.
Participants profile
We obtained the following profiles for our participants:

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Detectives_-_-_TEXT.html," to become proficient in our techniques for the Telus Spark adults only night the following week. We experimented with various strengths and types of alcohol, freezing, thawing, and incubation times and also whether or not the strawberries were frozen in order to optimize the process of making the “DNA-daiquiri’s”.
We continued our efforts to clone the parts necessary for our genetic circuit. Many of the small parts (e.g. promoters and RBS) could not be validated with confidence either with colony PCR or restriction digest because their sequences are so short, therefore we instead ordered PCR primers to ‘synthesize’ the small parts by essentially filling in the gaps at the ends. We also went over the BioBrick assembly scheme and are ready to begin assembly of our reporter/repressor genes.
We are still looking for a suitable reporter. At this point we think that the most appropriate reporter will likely be an enzyme capable of producing a colored product, this would allow for a large degree of signalling without the side effects of cytotoxicity from the accumulation of recombinatory protein. The enzyme could potentially produce more product and therefore more response than the production of recombinatory protein would allow. Two examples of potential enzymatic reporters found in the registry are the lacZ and xylE genes. We are also considering using a novel enzyme which we could characterize and submit to the iGEM registry.
Week 5: June 9 - 11
Assembly of our reporter/repressor constructs is predicted to be troublesome. To hedge our bets we began designing sequences for synthesis. These sequences are essentially identical to what our in-lab assembled constructs will be, including scars between the BioBricks (Fig. 1). Literature research was performed on the subject of reporters. We are interested in finding and using a novel reporter in the form of an enzyme/substrate, we feel that the enzyme/substrate may be the best choice since we can obtain a continuous signal without risking recombinant-protein toxicity. However, we are also exploring chromophoric proteins. We are considering the lux and electrochemical reporters for a potential ‘premium tier’ version of our detector which may be of use in more advanced laboratory settings.

Arrows represent the constitutive promoter Pveg; orange rectangles represent the repressible promoter, also referred to as the operator; blue and green semicircles represent the ‘weak’ or ‘consensus’ variants a RBS B. subtilis.

今現在あるパーツを使って、組み合わせることで遺伝子回路ができていきます。 インプットやアウトプットよりもそれらをどうつなぐかということが重要です。 シンプルであっても面白いアイディアができるのが一番なんですが。
後半は事例研究でした。 目次にある4人が話しました。

Assistant Professor Xiangwei Wu from the University of Texas MD gave a lecture about early-disseminated tumor cells as a biomarker for colorectal cancer early detection. A specific feature of the apoptin used in our project is that it only enters into nucleus of solid tumors but stay in cytoplasm of normal cells. We consulted him whether the apoptin could be used as a biomarker as well. He said that we should first use nude mice to figure out whether MCF-7 cells can multiply in vivo by subcutaneous injection. Next, we should use CTC cellular immunostaining to figure whether the apoptin could work well.

Lastly, a user may export their annotated plasmid in any format they'd like: genbank, fasta, or SBOL . These standardized file formats are useful when using AutoGene in collaboration with other standard softwares, such as Ape. Our genbank format, in particular, preserves characteristics of annotations that may be crossed over to Ape, such as the color of each annotation.
Database
One of the key issues we recognized with the Autogene was the organization of the database. The structure would have to be robust to help encompass the different types of feature type annotations (terminator, promoter, coding sequence, etc.), organism taxonomy, and custom annotations made by the user. Therefore, there was a need to:
     - standardize the different feature type names
     - standardize organism taxonomy
     - keep the database flexible and capable of managing new types of features
To this end, we looked for current standards for feature type annotations and organism taxonomic identification, and found the sequence ontology project as a reliable source for feature annotations and NCBI’s taxonomy database as a source of organism taxon identification.
We obtained gene sequences from the University of Wisconsin Madison's E. Coli Database , the Saccharomyces Genome Database , Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria , and the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Implementation
PlasmidView: this is the AutoPlasmid window. On the left is a picture of the plasmid. On the right is the DNA and the list of features contained inside that plasmid. Using the many buttons in the toolbar on the right side, or by clicking annotations in the picture of the plasmid, the user may interact with AutoPlasmid in many ways described above.
Plasmid List: this is where AutoGene keeps track of the Plasmids that the user is annotation and/or designing with throughout their use of AutoGene. Anytime a plasmid is imported, it pops into the Plasmid List so that a user may easily open it at any time.
Private Registry of Features: this is where AutoGene keeps track of features that users would like to design with. A user drags features from the PlasmidView into the Private Registry as a type of Bookmarking utility. It is a way to quickly access features to later use in designing plasmids.
Log: this is AutoGene's log, which gives warnings or error messages to the user. For example, if the user tries to import a DNA sequence with incorrect characters. It also will notify users of tasks that are"

This will probably require         optimisation of grown conditions and upscaling of the growth and isolation process. Growth conditions optimisation         comes down to  trial and error - try different growth media, temperatures, light... monitor production and repeat.         Upscaling is almost entirely up to what equipment and how much resources you have available - assuming yields         similar to bacteria, rough estimate is 1-10 L of yeasts to get noticable amount of MAAs, a lot more to produce enough         for any practical use. Getting MAAs out of yeasts will probably be tricky - depending on your yeast, they might not lyse         readily and they will probably not release MAAs into medium. Purification is currently unsolved problem and one of         reasons why it is impossible to buy significant amount of pure MAAs: semi-preparative HPLC is standard practice to         get lab-quantities of MAAs, but it hardly works for more then micro-gram amounts; full preparatory HPLC is out of          reach of most labs and too expensive to be practical, and ""simple"" metanol extractions don't produce pure compounds.          You will probably not get to isolation optimisation point during the project time-frame, but assuming you do, best advice         I can give is to try standard metanol extraction, see what comes out, optimise HPLC conditions and repeat.
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Very little work was done on MAA-producing yeasts, so it is unclear whether         UV plays a role in MAA producing yeasts - I would assume that UV will activate         MAA production in yeasts, but I haven't done any work with MAA-producing yeasts.         Simplest approach is to just sistematicaly test lots of different growth         conditions - vary the composition of growth medium, exposure to UV and temperature,         pick the best and optimise.
Would you please suggest anything to increase the yield of porphyra-334 compared to shinorine? Do you think whether the change in serine/threonine proportion would have an effect on the ratio porphyra-334/shinorine?
There is lots of missing pieces in biosynthesis of individual MAAs, so I don't think it is easy (or possible) to predict           individual yields purely on genetics. Trying different substrates is worth"

Conclusion
Synthetic biology can become a very powerful tool if it remains under control. Risks exist, of course, but we have to be aware of these risks causes, and the finality of taking them. It is without doubt the scientific community to make the community accept this idea, by transmitting the knowledge. Some problems, such as various diseases, seem also to be resolved through it. But the sought interests are those of the entire society, and not particular groups. It might be beneficial to put quickly in place a regulation to avoid abuses, without limiting the development of this promising science
Survey
Today everything is patented or patentable, and worse it is possible to patent in simple concepts that have not been applied. Thus the purchase, exchange, submission and management of the patents bank of a company is a real business activity and it can be really profitable. Patent an invention, a concept or a brand is there real consequences on the daily progress? That is what we asked Sup'Biotech students and non scientists to respond.
32% believe that patents represent a barrier to innovation, while 43% disagreed. The opinion seems pretty divided, which is quite surprising because in theory the patent is a tool for encouraging innovation. Indeed, the temporary monopoly allows to finance investment in R & D. However, in practice the patent appears as a secondary tool, some people do not even have little confidence, while others do not hesitate to follow the example of the law fragmentation when innovations are cumulative and / or complementary as computing, biotechnology or electronics.
Do you think that patents slow innovation?
As part of a therapeutic application, we may wonder if we can patent a living thing, giving it a value? This is the question that is facing synthetic biology.
Do you think an organism created by synthetic biology should be patented?
Like other technologies, synthetic biology would  show us  a new era, of ""Biolithic"", where the living is becoming the instrument. A tool that could be greatly promising to cure many diseases. But what is the therapeutic goal legislates she use? Synthetic biology thus challenges our life conception. Where is the boundary between natural and artificial? Can we afford to create everything from the living? Evolution can be ""diverged"""

GUS will be imported to the peroxisome with the PTS1 sequence and measured quantitatively in the supernatant. We will use a coexpression of GUS-PTS1 and Snc1-Pex15 or Snc1-Pex26 to identify the secretion of the compounds. Furthermore, we will use GUS-PTS1 expressed in S. cerevisiae without Snc1 fused to a membrane anchor for a control. We will measure the active GUS in the supernatant with a liquid assay based on the turnover of  4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide to 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) (Blázquez et al, 2007) . Here we expect a higher activity of GUS in the supernatant of cultures with Snc1 decorated peroxisomes.
To increase the variability of our constructs we also designed vectors with and without a GS-Linker connecting the Snc1 with the Pex15. Additionally we tested our constructs in strains with a deletion of Pex11 . This deletion leads to formation of larger peroxisomes and may increase the efficiency of our secretion mechanism.

In Vivo Sensors
Surveillance of key physiology factors is indispensable for a good understanding and optimization of metabolic processes in compartments. In comparison to in vitro measurements, in vivo sensors have major advantages in terms of measuring relevant physiological properties in living systems. Former methods required destructive assays, expensive and time consuming preprocessing of cells or compartments to determining fluxes inside cells Frommeret al. (2010) . This leads to inexact measurements with poor spatial and temporal resolution. The usage of in vivo sensors tackles all of these problems at once. They allow detecting fluxes inside the cell and compartments in real time and supersede difficult and time consuming cell and organelle extraction.
Sensors
To enrich our toolbox we decided to measure four essential physiological factors: ATP, NADPH, Glutathione and pH.
ATP/ADP conversion is used as an energy currency in many cellular processes like translocation of proteins and metabolites or anabolic and catabolic turnovers."

   Team 2014 NYMU-TAIPEI was a gather of 19 iGEM beginners when it was formed in early 2014, however this far, we found ourselves maniacs in synthetic biology. In the past several months, we have been trying to develop a sustainable and auto-controlled way to cure caries, which may be a good blessing for the elderly and toddlers.

K_d is the dissociation constant (see modelling derivations). Parameters must be found by a parameter scan for sensible values or by comparing to already gathered data.
The concentration of 'active' repressor is given as a function of arabinose concentration by:
where X^T is the total amount of araC available, bound or unbound. A is arabinose concentration. n is the number of arabinose molecules binding to each molecule of the repressor, and K is a binding constant. n was taken to be two by assuming that each araC dimer needs two molecules to be bound before it can permit transcription.
Combining these two gives the overall input function, which has leaky transcription included at A = 0, seen in the actual results.
The Activator and its Promoter
This is based on a similar idea. Activator is made by transcription from pBAD, the mRNA is then translated (the potential time delays will be taken into account). The activity of the phage promoter is dependent on activator concentration according to:
Assuming that translation rates remain constant, the rate of GFP and RFP production would be expected to be multiples of the above promoter activities/ input functions (which represent rate of transcription)
The aim of this area of work is to fit the activator plate reader to curves in an attempt to better charactertise them in terms of hill function parameters after Canton [3] .
Entire System
The entire system, although a collected of nested hill functions, has an overall sigmoidal response to input concentration. This means that the full system can be modelled as a hill function, with appropriate parameters obtained by experimental analysis.
Making a Latch
A switch that remains on once stimulated would be useful if it was only necessary, say, to see if a hazardous contaminant had ever been present in a sample (it could still be there in low levels etc.). A method proposed is positive feedback; an activator placed downstream of its own promoter (as well as the reporter/ pigment) will, in theory, keep pigment production going. The rate of activator production from its own promoter is given in equation 3 above, which is dependent on activator concentration itself.
Modelling the proposed switching levels system
This idea was summarised in the diagram and discussion included in week 4 dry work:
Most of these model systems will rely on the very basic equations outlined above, with extensions to add levels of complexity, such as"

After discussion with ZHU Junhao and ZHAO Yanyan, novel ideas had occured to me, and an improved understanding of what we are supposed to do struck my mind. I felt nervous and passionate, as well as a little afraid. Well, as least we still have time to adjust the team and project. Go on bros and sisters!
What on earth happens here??? What is the idea? Wait, a feel of ominous appears….

Okay… I submit.. A guy called Zhu Junhao inspired all of us and we then scrutizie our project again and found it to be too boring. Then we planned to change the previous idea and get a new round of brainstorming . Though the process might be annoyance as we don’t have too much time on it, since most of us will not at school during the summer time. But I believe it will be worth it, only everyone love the project we can indeed do something and achieve something.
Here is the sentences wrote by Yang Tianfang after the “propaganda” by Zhu Junhao:

Today’s meeting is the longest one, but I feel stirring, like found a passion that has lost for long. Thanks Zhu Junhao “ruined” our team meeting. Thanks everyone in the meeting. I reckon this is the real brainstorm.
At the same day, planned and organized by Yang Tianfang, we booked the Xuetang every night and promised to get together every night and discuss the idea we can find. We want a indeed Brainstorming. Nothing else but a blackboard, a pen, and several brains. We think about everything we can imagine, think every idea that just come up into our mind and look into it very carefully, think about the parts we can use and think about the whole system.

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," tumour cells many research groups focused on designing gene therapies based on p53 gene delivery. Most frequently adenoviruses and eukaryotic plasmids were used. The research results confirmed increased effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs after introduction of p53 gene copy into the cell [4]. It has been shown that p53 with the mitochondrial leader sequence is enough to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. The fusion protein Lp53 with mitochondrial leader sequence from ornithine transcarbamylase was used. In terms of apoptosis induction fusion protein was almost as effective as standard p53. Previous research did not include delivery of p53 into tumour cells by bacterial vectors. Secretion of p53 into the cytoplasm by bacteria has an advantage over gene therapy because it does not disrupt genome integrity. Results of p53 integration with host genome are not fully characterized yet, but too high level of p53 is shown to accelerate ageing. Our project proposes a method to induce apoptosis without arresting the cell cycle. Cell cycle arrest decreases the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents, because they can affect only proliferating cells [14].
Detailed research project
Introduction
Fig 1. The overview of the system. Gene regulatory network is composed of three modules: invasion operon, endosome detection operon and cytoplasmic operon. Invasion and cytoplasmic operon are bistable switches regulated by endosome detection operon.
We are going to create E. coli strain able to enter the eukaryotic cells using the controlled expression of invasin from Yersinia sp. It leads to internalization of the bacteria into the fagosome of the host cell. To escape the endosome we will use controlled expression of bacterial hemolysin (listeriolysin) from Listeria monocytogenes. The coordination of protein expression is based on switching the E. coli cells between four physiological states: growth in the growth medium, ability to enter mammalian cells, presence in the endosome, and escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm. (Fig1.). Two component system phoP/phoQ from Salmonella typhimurium will be used to detect states. It activates PhoP dependent promoters in the endosomal conditions (low pH, low metal ions concentration). Each of the states is going to be stabilised by two feedback loops based on natural regulatory systems. System is composed of three synthetic operons [18].

Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," came across the possibility to insert specific mutations which render the protein atoxic.  Because we new, that there is a working group in the in Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of University Hospital Ulm we asked there for expertise support about the handling of AB-Toxins. They referred us to Dr. Thomas Binz a specialist in botox research in Germany, who is currently working at the Hannover Medical School. Luckily he was willing to meet us for an interview and talk about our project idea.
In Hannover we met Dr. Binz with whom we talked about botox in general, its characteristics, lab safety and how his group works with its toxic version. We also discussed the necessary mutations to detoxify the protein and asked whether he thinks they pose a valid method of doing so. He gave us invaluable tips on how to accomplish those changes of the DNA sequence. We also discussed our coupling plans for the additional proteins which would normally be considered as S2 but as we only worked with DNA our work was regarded as S1. After our botulinum toxin was undoubtedly detoxified, working with the protein was also considered to be S1 approved.
Meeting with Dr. Binz
Consequent upon our exchange with Dr. Binz we had a useful talk with Dr. Kittel who is the biosafety officer of our university. We discussed whether we were indeed allowed to work on our project in an S1 environment. It turned out that working with DNA only is appropriate for S1 and that since we’re working only in e.coli we can even transform and express our protein under S1 conditions.
Following the allowance to work in S1 in our university, we talked with our PIs and presented our ideas and how we planned to handle our constructs. At first we ordered the detoxified sequence from IDT which turned out to be very difficult. The GC content was below 30% and even after extreme codon optimization it could not be increased. IDT had big problems synthesizing the genBlocks. After many weeks and just as many failures we finally got a product that unfortunately didn’t fulfill the normal quality standards. In agreement with our PIs it was decided not to use these sequences because they were too precarious due to the whole process of codon optimization as well as the failed synthesis. In addition we could not separate the light chain (LC) and the heavy chain (HC) cleanly from each other. The toxicity of BoNt is provided by the combination of both the HC and LC together. Luckily, we were able to obtain the wt plasmid from Dr. Binz.

Experiments
In order to eliminate the possibility of confounding factors affecting our apparent results, PUF-PIN experimental results were further reinforced with tests designed to consider other factors of our constructs possibly affecting our quantitative and qualitative measurements. Along with basic experiments testing our proposed constructs we also tested several controls relative to each of the different pieces of our constructs including the following:
Experiment
Purpose
DH5a E. Coli alone
Measure the base fluorescence of DH5a and ensure our strain does not have contaminating fluorescence.
Protet plasmid
Measure the base fluorescence of a plasmid we used.
YFP + Control Binding Site in protet plasmid
This is a positive control for the YFP experiments.
YFP + Specific Binding Site in protet plasmid
This is a positive control for the YFP experiments.
YFP + Control Binding Site in protet plasmid + pBAD30 Plasmid
This can help understand whether cotransformation of two plasmids in the cell will interfere with YFP expression.
YFP + Specific Binding Site in protet plasmid + pBAD30 Plasmid
This can help understand whether cotransformation of two plasmids in the cell will interfere with YFP expression.
YFP + Specific Binding Site in protet plasmid + wild type PUF-PIN in pBAD30 plasmid
This is a theoretically negative fluorescence control due to the endonuclease activity of a specifically bound PUF-PIN protein silencing the YFP gene.
YFP + Control Binding Site in protet plasmid + wild type PUF-PIN in pBAD30 plasmid
This is a theoretically positive fluorescence control due to the endonuclease activity of a Control Binding Site bound PUF-PIN protein silencing the YFP gene.
mCherry + Control Binding Site in protet plasmid
This is a positive control for the mCherry experiment
mCherry + Wild type Binding Site in protet plasmid
This is a positive control for the mCherry experiment.
mCherry + Mutant Binding Site in protet plasmid
This is a positive control for the mCherry experiment.
mCherry + Control Binding Site in Protet plasmid + wild type PUF-PIN in pBAD30 plasmid
This test was to test the effects of the PUF-PIN endonuclease activity on a reporter other than YFP to pinpoint possible problems stemming from a YFP reporter"

Ryan: The difficulty I see is that meeting with you, I can’t just go and implement this. So, if this is going to go any further with the city, your group is going to have to do a lot more work. What I would recommend is based on our conversation, you go out and you come up with a proposal for this. Within that proposal you would say there is a bee problem and you would explain the whole bee problem. These are the benefits and this is what we propose. Within that proposal, you would say the city use this dryland meadow seed mix on all of the roadways. Within this mix [are these flowers,] and you list a mix that actually might work. This is the potential cost of this mix and these are the benefits. If you brought this to city council, that would make my job a lot easier and I would get direction from council to say “this is what you need to do and we accept this, we like this, let’s trial it out”. Then we could actually do something.
iGEM: Would you as a community member approve of what we are doing?
Ryan: Oh, yes. For sure.
iGEM: Do you think it would make Lethbridge aesthetically pleasing if the flowers ended up growing properly along the roadways?
Ryan: I think so because I know that the problem with it and it comes in terms of feasibility, is that to get a good mixture of meadow seed that would actually work here, would be very, very tricky. The types of plants that you may have to use maybe be confused with weeds.
iGEM: Do you think city council and your office would be okay with the mixture if it was also non-invasive?
Ryan: That would be an issue as well. I think that it would have to be non-invasive. I know that if there are lots of residents who live right beside some of these areas and if they start getting this mix in their lawn, [the city is going to get complaints]. So it would have to be as non-invasive as possible.
Taking into consideration what Ryan had advised us to do, we drafted a proposal for a meadow mix to be used in developing areas of Lethbridge.
Proposal for a Meadow Mix in New Areas of Development:
Abstract
The City of Lethbridge is known as one of the sunniest cities in Canada. Lethbridge is steadily growing and allowing for the development of subdivisions. With an increase in roadways, more native flowers should be planted to show the diversity of Alberta plant life. An"

TetR is a repressor protein responsible for blocking T7 polymerase expression, which is the only enzyme responsible for insulin gene transcription, under PT7 promoter control. Our designed sRNA aims Insulin’s mRNA, that can be produced by ptet leakage, aiming for complete repression control against insulin production in absence of glucose. Here ptet, pveg and  pT7 denotes promoter activity, ptet0, pveg0 and  pT70 describe promoter leakage; DNA represents DNA copy; Φmrnatet, Φsrna and Φmrnat7 RNA degradation rates; αTet and αT7pol proteins degradation and dilution rate and KCcpA* and KTet are affinity DNA-Repressor protein affinity constant.
3. Insulin production
When glucose is present, CcpA is activated and represses TetR and sRNA expression, unblocking T7 RNA polymerase gene expression finally leading to Insulin production. Here, we denote T7-pT7  interactions by an activator protein Hill equation without leakage, considering that T7 RNA polymerase executes orthogonal transcription. The sRNA action is described by the second expression in the first equation, in which KdsRNA represents Insulin mRNA - sRNA binding affinity.
Parameters
Parameter estimations and assumptions:
When creating a simulation, we don’t always find the exact parameter value that we are expecting (we even have different sources providing completely different values for the same thing). That’s why sometimes it’s necessary to make some assumptions and estimations in order to reach the most realistic results.
DNA copy number:
We’ve designed this circuit to be integrated into the chromosome as a single copy set of genes.
Translation rate:
We’ve calculated the translation rate of each protein by using the equation shown above, fixing ribosome translation rate in 15 aa/s according to Bionumbers (key numbers) and its size according to the amino acid residue number.
Promoters:
Promoter activity and leakage have a strong gene and biochemical context dependency, which makes parameter setting extremely difficult to elaborate. In our simulations, we assumed that ptet and pveg have the same activity, while pT7 possess double of its promoter strength (assuming its known high promoter activity). We also determined that promoter leakage would represent 20% of the total promoter activity.
CCpA activation
Here, we reimagined CcpA activation by glucose, by following similar kinetics and parameters to the CAP (Gram-negative carbon catabolite repression protein) and cAMP reaction. Furthermore, we considered a total amount of 350"

Notes of Modeling
Before July
Team members in modeling have get to know so much about the general knowledge of synthetic biology and related knowledge such as the biochemistry and the microbiology. We have learned and communicate with other team members through communication.
The First Week of July
We have communicated with last year’s TU iGEM fellows in charge of modeling immediately after the division of labors. Many important suggestions are impart by them. They also helped us with the time schedule of the modeling part.
The Second Week of July
We have studied the team of 2010 Slovenia whose team is very helpful especially in modeling. After detailed study and communication, we came to contact with one of the most important software in iGEM modeling that is the Simbiology toolbox in MATLAB. We have also practiced some real examples of Simbiology, the detailed discussion with each other have enhanced our understanding of modeling in Simbiology.
The Third Week of July
This week we have read several important articles about orthogonal ribosome. After thoroughly discussion with other team members, we get to know the inner principle of orthogonal ribosome and how to design the sequence of orthogonal RBS. Combined with what we have already known about this years’ project, we have also discussed with the people who are in charge of the wet lab to seek for appropriate tasks of modeling. Finally, we have also determined one task.
The Fourth Week of July
In this week, we are primarily seeking for related knowledge of the task, for example the ribosome binding intensity is directly related to the protein expression amount, and we have study the use of RBS calculator. We have also practice to use this online tool to calculate the related delta Gibbs free energy and relative protein expression level. What is more, we also learned Vienna and the Nupack to assist our modeling.
The First Week of August
This week we have calculated out the orthogonality of our experimental states, which goes the same with the result of the wet lab. We also calculated the"

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Model#Coacervation_-_-_TEXT.html,"$$ Here $\alpha$ is the interaction strength from the Debye-Hückel theory, and $\sigma \equiv Z/N$ is the charge density of the polymer. For aqueous solutions at room temperature, $\alpha \approx 4.1$. Now what the system will do, like any system, is go to a state in that locally minimizes its free energy. What remains to be seen however, is whether the energy minimum towards which the system will go is indeed a phase separated stated, or a homogeneous solution. It will be a homogenous solution if and only if the mixing criterion is satisfied, and this mixing criterion states that $$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2 }>0$$ (see ref Doi 2013 ). There will only be coacervation if this criterion is not satisfied for our system. What we can do is plot the curve for which $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2 }=f''(\phi)=0$, which is known as the spinodal curve, and identify regions in this plot in which coacervation does (not) happen. In fact there is also a region in the parameter space where both phases coexist. This is defined by the coexistence (binodal) curve, and a full treatment of the theory would also include this. However, as long as we are near the critical point of the spinodal curve (the minimum in the graphs of Figure 2), the coexistence curve approximates the spinodal curve and the coexistence region is negligibly small.
From here it will be immediately clear why the coacervation method works. Taking the derivative of $f$ twice with respect to $\phi$ yields that $$\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \phi^2} = \frac{1}{N\phi}+\frac{1}{1-\phi}-\frac{3\alpha\sigma^{3/2}}{4\sqrt{\phi}}$$ This means that the condition $f''(\phi)=0$ can also be written as $$\sigma_N (\phi)=\left(\frac{4\sqrt{\phi}}{3\alpha}\left(\frac{1}{N\phi}+\frac{1}{1-\phi}\right)\right)^{2/3}$$ Check for yourself that if the charge density of the polymers $\sigma$ is larger than the right hand side of this equation, coacervation will occur, whereas if it is less, homogeneous mixing will occur. The value of $\sigma_N(\phi)$"

3. Mix the agarose with the 25ml 1X TAE Buffer.
4. Heat the mixture until all the agarose is dissolved.
5. Leave the mixture to cool at 60℃.
6. Add TypeⅡnucleic acid dye and swirl the flask.
7. Pour agarose onto gel plate in a setting tray with appropriately-sized combs already fixed onto it.
8. Solidify at room temperature. It can be stored at 4℃ for a short period of time when there is no immediate use.
7. Gel extraction
Experimental idea
After PCR amplification, in theory we can get all possible pathways, namely, all fragments, as shown in Table 5, which begin with site 2 and end up with site 8. Then carry out the gel electrophoresis and gel extraction of PCR products, respectively cut gel volume of 200 bp (150 bp and 200 bp are so close as to cut together), 250 bp and 350 bp (300 bp and 350 bp are so close as to cut together), then extract separately.
Procedure
1. Cut out the desired DNA band (use UV lamp) and use paper towel to suck the liquid of gel surface.
Note:
1. At this time attention should be paid to remove the gel that contains no desired DNA, minimize gel volume as far as possible to improve the DNA recovery.
2. Minimize UV exposure time to DNA, in order to prevent DNA damage.
2. Shred the gel to speed up the step 6 of melting time, which improves the recovery rate of DNA.
3. Weigh out the gel, calculate the volume. Carry out the calculation with 1 mg=1 L.
4. Add 3 volumes of Buffer DE-A, 1.5 volumes of Buffer DE-B and 1 volume of isopropanol to the gel.
5. Heat the gel at 75℃( the agarose gel with a low melting point can be heated at 45℃). At this time, vortex intermittently to mix, making the gel melt fully (about 6 ~ 10 minutes).
Note:
The gel must be fully melted, otherwise it will seriously affect the recovery rate of DNA.
6. Add Buffer DE-A, Buffer DE-B (the volume of the latter is 1/2 of the former) to the gel melting

Design
Clear and concise description of our project
This summer, our team is aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 in the natural environment. We mainly design two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecular level; AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of AI-2 controllers, we hope to directly control the population behaviors of bacteria in group levels.
Fig 1
A detailed explanation of our work on this particular project
Coordination between cell populations via prevailing metabolic cues has been noted as a promising approach to connect synthetic devices and drive phenotypic or product outcomes. However, there has been little progress in developing ""controller cells"" to modulate metabolic cues and guide these systems.
Metabolic engineering exploits the genetic modification of cellular pathways to improve production of metabolites and proteins. Many noteworthy examples have been demonstrated wherein these cells serve as ""factories"" for the environmentally sustainable production of energy, materials, and chemicals. Towards this aim, metabolic engineering has incorporated finely tuned synthetic controllers and cells in the creation of artificial networks.
The general structure of these synthetic networks is based on control devices that respond to specific stimuli in a predictable fashion.
However, the task of coordinating among and between cell populations remains a critical challenge that can limit the production of desired end-products. One creative approach to address both of these challenges is through the leveraging of cell-Ccell communication networks, and these have been the target of a variety of dynamic control systems.
In this work, we have developed bacterial AI-2 suppliers and AI-2-consumers, which can be deployed to control AI-2 in a predictable fashion using the now well-characterized quorum sensing mechanisms of Escherichia coli.
AI-2 is synthesized and recognized by a wide variety of bacteria; correspondingly its use as a potential target for modulating QS activities among different cell types is of interest.
The use of genetically engineered bacteria to ""quench"" or ""ignite"" extracellular AI-2 was first described by Xavier et al. , where genetic deletions of its synthase (luxS) and its repressor"

To carry out the first experiment, the following steps need to be undertaken:
Perform PCRs on each of the practice plate oligos such that we end up with a relatively high concentration of DNA after PCR and PCR purification (over 40 ng/ul).
Cut both plasmid backbone and oligos with BsaI type II restriction enzyme.
PCR purify restriction products to get rid of enzyme and junk DNA.
Run phosphatase reaction to prevent autoligation.
Mix and ligate to get full plasmid.
Some tips:
Each ligation reaction should only have 10-15 ul volume.
You should have 100 ng of backbone per reaction
Since we are planning 18 reactions, we will need 1800 ng of backbone, which is several minipreps worth
The backbone:oligo ratio should be appoximately 1:4
In our case, the backbone is 2.2 kb and the insert is 131 bp, so for 100 ng of backbone there should be ~20 ng of insert
Gel extract plasmid to get final library.
Today, we did PCRs and PCR purifications for step one as outlined above.  We tested the concentrations of the results, displayed below:
DNA concentrations
In order to have enough backbone to work with, we seeded some LB/spec with CB bottom bacteria in preparation for 4 minipreps of 3 mL each tomorrow.  This should definitely yield the 1800 ng of backbone we will need for the ligation.
Practice plate primer tag test
We tested the primers to see if their selection of subpools was exclusive enough or not (i.e. to make sure that our control primers did not amplify the CB bottom sequences, etc.).  We ran a PCR crossing primers with DNA with the following results:
Strange results
The first and third lanes are CB primer/CB DNA and control primer/control DNA respectively, which should yield bands.  Lanes two and four were control primer/CB DNA and CB primer/control DNA respectively, which should yield no bands.  The fact that we got bands for these lanes is a little bit worrying, and so we are repeating this PCR again to see if we get the same results when we run the gel tomorrow.

SHSBNU_China,2018,Team:SHSBNU China#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Off campus, we established the collaboration with sewage plant for exchanging the instructive information including biology, plant and policy. We strongly believe that the practicability of our project would attract more plants even business companies to cooperate with us.
a. On campus part
We conducted lectures of iGEM projects and synthetic biology techniques to students on Tuesday and Thursday weekly. At the start of our education program, we briefly introduced our project's purpose, effectiveness and future potential contribution to the environment. We also invited students who were interested in improving the environment by synthetic biology technologies. After that, we held a series of lectures explaining the molecular mechanism, and prove practicability of our project to the students who followed up our project.
For the whole process of education, we put a high value on the effectiveness of lecture. Therefore, we required students who is willing to cooperate our work to register their WeChat account, and asked randomly 75% of students each time to share their perspectives, so we could adjust and improve the content of our lecture. We also interviewed students to find future iGEMers.
Furthermore, in our synthetic biology club, we introduced some basic methods and techniques of genetic engineering such as DNA extraction, restriction enzyme digestion, Primer design, and PCR, reserving talented students for our further iGEM projects.
In general, our on-campus education program comprehensively passed on our experience in iGEM and synthetic biology knowledge. Our program had also triggered students’ concern on environmental problems, as well as their passion for learning synthetic biology and becoming a qualified iGEMer.
b. Off campus part
During the visit of a sewage treatment plant, we briefly introduced our project to work leaders, then we showed reliability of our project and resolution to protect the environment. On one side, sewage treatment plant helped us conduct the design of our program by providing first-hand information of sewage plant. On the other side, we offered more information of our modified biology treatment. As a result, both sides were looking forward to establishing a long-term collaboration.
V. Conclusion
In conclusion, through the biology method, we found that the expensive cost and decreasing effectiveness are two main problems for traditional biological treatment method. These experiences from human practice has inspired us with the idea of designing our Biofilm × Laccase system. In the near future, we will build a filter with PHA beads coated with laccase linked biofilm and optimize the filter for real world sewage treatment.

Hello, interchangeable part:  Meet your new chassis
Yes, we have quite a collection of interchangeable biological parts for this and that.  And sure, they can light up, detect, act, react, and do all sorts of biological gymnastics that would make any biologist feel all warm and fuzzy.  However, we need a good chassis to put all these goodies in.  iGEM needs a sleek, efficient, and advanced host to showcase all the newly derived luxury, sport, and tow packages.  This is where JHU Build-A-Genome's custom Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sc2.0 comes in.  Harnessing the power of undergrad labor, the genome is being synthesized from scratch.  A few liberties have been taken in removing junk DNA, and introns to see if these features are really needed.  Also, this strain of yeast has been redesigned from the ground up to act as a biological 'goal seek' to find all of the solutions to the fabled minimal genome.
Genome Destabilization (Recombineering)
The driving force for minimization is supplied by the addition of numerous loxPsym sites between genes throughout the genome.  LoxPsym sites act like couplers between train cars allowing additions, deletions, and general reordering of the yeast genes.  Cre recombinase acts on loxPsym sites and, depending on local geometry and more likely random chance, allows recombination to occur between any pair of sites.  We employ a very specialized engineered Cre-ER chemically regulated by the human sex hormone estradiol so the process can be controlled at will. (Those who attended iGEM2008 will know the JHU Team has a tradition of always inserting the word SEX into its presentations). Such genome reorganization allows for a staggering number of permutations.  Most of the genomes in this “swarm” will not survive, but the ones that do can be analyzed.  Commonalities and linkages can be drawn by what genes are commonly left behind, with which other genes, and a huge linkage map can be made.  This map can lead to the minimal genome as well as the discovery of genes related by their"

II Do the orthogonality test for gene circuit design
    It helps us construct warriors that can just be killed by warriors from the other group but not from its own group.
     Because of the similarities between AHLs and between their receptors, warriors may be not only killed by the AHL secreted by the warriors from the other side, but also by itself, if the circuits are not well designed. This is a serious problem we faced when choosing the AHL-receptor-promoter pairs. This problem has been discussed by many groups in iGEM, like ETH_Zurich 2014 . However, all previous results are obtained by adding AHL artificially to test the respond of specific receptor-promoter combination. In our project, we let E.coli to secrete AHL itself, so different concentrations of AHL in our system may make the previous studies unsuitable for our system here.
    Therefore, we did Orthogonality test to fit our own needs to help us design gene circuits of warriors. Results are shown below.
Fig.3 Results of Orthogonality test
    However, we failed to choose an orthogonal gene circuit from our results. We can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete, as is shown below:
Fig.4 Gene circuit designed from the results
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I.
(More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
III Verify the orthogonality test
    We constructed our warriors and beggars and used the series of tests listed below to test the creditability of our results from the orthogonality test.
    Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test.
    According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from another side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our"

SFLS_Shenzhen,2018,Team:SFLS Shenzhen#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," a joint detection of miR-10b and miR-155 by constructing our gene loop.
Toehold switch designing
Toehold switch is a strain of RNA which has a hairpin loop that locks the ribosome to prevent it from further transcription. When another strain of RNA(called the trigger) matches with the switch, the hairpin loop unlocks itself and the transcription begins.[2]
Most toehold switch triggers are over 30bp long so they can match both the trigger and the stem. However, miR-155 is only 24bp long and miR-10b is 23bp long. To ensure a successful detection, we cut the stem below the start codon 1bp shorter to match miR-155 and 2bp shorter for miR-10b.
Our circuits-Tiggers(miRNA) and Switches
Each trigger is used for matching  a certain type of miRNA and start the transcription.In Toehold switch designing,a Switch will act as a “lock” while a Trigger(miRNA)  will act as a “key”.The “lock” will only be unlocked by a certain type pf “key”.We designed our switch  in order to match miRNA-155 and miRNA- 10b and “unlock” gene expression.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," been corroborated. But falsifying a hypothesis isn’t easy and it is important to remember that there is no form of ‘final’ falsification. It is always possible that our hypothesis is falsified by a mistake we made, and not because it is wrong. That is one of the reasons why it’s important to have an overview of the auxiliary hypothesis that are in use – sometimes they are the ones that need change or the ones being falsified VINCENZO, C. 2016. Confirmation. In: ZALTA, E. N. (ed.) Standford Encycplodia of Philosophy. Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University. .
Science has philosophical prerequisites since scientist works on the foundation of an empirical and objective world searching for an objective truth. Philosophy of science is working with these assumptions arguing why they are necessary for science - and arguing why they are not sufficient. A scientist has to be a fallibilist, meaning that there shouldn’t be premises above criticism.
Testimony in science
In the scientific community there is collaboration in almost every aspect of science. Our amount of accepted knowledge is too vast and complex for one scientist to understand all of it. As a scientist one needs to be able to base one’s research on the testimony of other scientists. That is also why researchers refer to other articles which forms the basis of their knowledge, and quite possibly helps them think of new hypothesis to test.
Referring to other researcher’s articles helps to carry the burden of proof but it also works as an internal control of the different research areas.
There seems to be an incompatibility between what we normally think of science and the idea of testimony; The idea behind science is thinking by one self and being a fallibilist. But when it comes down to working as a scientist there are presumptions that we accept due to where it comes from. If my professor tells me that something is true, I tend to believe him. The problem occurs when choosing which expert is a true expert.
Confirmation in science
When confirming a hypothesis one needs relevant empirical consequences that are true or actually observed. This means that if one experimentally tests a hypothesis or theory and it then survives, then it seems intuitive to think that it might be a true hypothesis or theory. The confirmation is relative to a set of background beliefs that are necessary to limit the confirmation. The background beliefs also function as auxiliary hypotheses which describes the beliefs and assumptions that are constitutive for the hypothesis’ confirmation. For example: For every F, then G confirms Ga if Fa is present. The constraint forbids that the junction of"

The full bisphenol A degradation pathway which is found in nature is shown in figure X (taken from KEGG database). BPA is metabolized to 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone and 4-Hydroxybenzoate which can be used by some bacteria as carbon source. These and other metabolites of the BPA degradation pathway can be found in the supernatant of BPA containing cultivations of S. bisphenolicum AO1. They can grow on BPA as the only carbon source, too ( Sasaki et al., 2005a ).
Fig. X: blabla
Bisphenol A is mainly hydroxylated into the products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol by some kind of oxidoreductase acting with NADH or NADPH. A total of three genes are responsible for this BPA hydroxylation: a cytochrome P450 (CYP, bisdB), a ferredoxin (Fd, bisdA) and a ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase (FNR) ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). The three gene products act together to reduce BPA while oxidizing NADH + H+. The cytochrome P450 (BisdB) reduces the BPA and is oxidized during this reaction. BisdB in its oxidized status is reduced by the ferredoxin (BisdA) so it can reduce BPA again. The oxidized BisdA is reduced by a ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase consuming NADH + H+ so the BPA degradation can continue ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). The bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were isolated, transformed into and expressed in E. coli and enabled this bacterium to degrade BPA, too ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). In addition, the BisdAB proteins from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were able to degrade BPA in a cell-free system (enzyme assay"

From a truth table to abstract logic circuits.
In BioBLESS a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then “Create”.
The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most                         cases is supposed to be a compli- cated multi-input circuit.
According to the perturbation ratio you input, such as 20% or 30%, the concentration-time curves of inputs and outputs will be shown toge- ther to shed light on the robustness of a designed gene circuit. Moreover, data processing and                         demonstration will help users to better understand the robustness of designed gene circuits.

UiOslo_Norway,2015,Team:UiOslo Norway#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolism in probacteria occurs by Periplasmic pyrroloquinoline quinone (PPQ) containing methanol dehydrogenase. The same metabolism in gram positive bacteria occurs by a NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme. The challenge with using the PPQ containing methanol dehydrogenase is that E.coli is not able to synthesize the cofactor needed fot this enzyme. So that the PPQ biosynthetic pathway has to be cloned into E.coli or PPQ has to be added to the growth medium. An additional challenge is that the Medh electron acceptor is cytochrome c, which is oxidized by a terminal cytochrome c oxidase that is not found in E.coli2. The NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme was therefor chosen because only one additional gene is needed and it utilizes the electron acceptor already found in E. coli. One organism that has the NAD-linked cytoplasmic enzyme is B. methanolicus. Previous studies have shown that wild type (wt) strains of B. methanolicus have several genes encoding for NAD-dependent Medhs, which all can be functionally expressed in E.coli3. Three specific NAD-dependent Medhs have been found in B. methanolicus: Medh, Medh2, and Medh34. All three Medhs have been tested under different conditions and it was found that Medh2 showed similar activity in E. coli lysate as B. methanolicus under similar conditions. Medh2 was therefore found to be the best candidate of the three to use in this project2.
Formaldehyde to fructose-6-phosphate
Next step is to convert formaldehyde to biomass in order to obtain energy. Two pathways can perform this conversion; non-orthologs pathways and pathways that can be done with or without fixation of CO2.  Examples of non-orthologs pathway are ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, and the gluthione-linked pathway. The second type of pathways are pathways such as RuMP cycle, serine cycle or Calvin cycle. Previous studies have shown that the most relevant pathway for this project are the RuMP pathway and the serine cycle. The RuMP pathway can be classified into three phases: fixation, cleavage, and rearrangement phase. Hexolose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) are"

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#prueba pag_-_-_TEXT.html,"). See more about the modeling of moth flight paths.
Using a modeling environment called Netlogo , we simulate the approximate moths behavior during the pheromone dispersion process. So, this will help us to predict moth response when they are also in presence of our synthetic plants.
Since pheromones are chemicals released into the air, we have to consider both the motion of the fluid and the one of the particles suspended in the fluid.
The motion of fluids can be described by the Navier–Stokes equations. But the frequent nonlinearity of these equations makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve, since it may exists turbulences in the air flow [1]. Now attending to the particles suspended in the fluid, an option for pheromone dispersion modeling consists in the assumption of pheromones diffusive-like behavior. That is: pheromones are molecules that can undergo a diffusion process in which the random movement of gas molecules transport the chemical away from its source [2].
There are two ways to introduce the notion of diffusion: either a phenomenological approach starting with Fick's laws of diffusion and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the random walk of the diffusing particles.
In our case, we decided to hold our diffusion process by the Fick's laws. So it is postulated that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient. However, diffusion processes are complex, and modelling them analytically and with accuracy is difficult, even more when the geometry is not simple (final distribution of our plants in the crop field). For this reason, we decided to consider a simplified model in which pheromone chemicals obey to the heat diffusion equation.
Approximation
The diffusion equation is a partial differential equation which describes density dynamics in a material undergoing diffusion. It is also used to describe processes exhibiting diffusive-like behavior, like in our case.
The equation is usually written as:
$$\frac{\partial \phi (r,t) }{\partial t} = \nabla · [D(\phi,r)  \nabla \phi(r,t)]$$
where $\phi(r, t)$ is the density of the diffusing material at location r and time t and $D(\phi, r)$ is the collective diffusion coefficient for density $\phi$ at location $r$; and $\nabla$ represents the vector differential operator.
If the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the density then the equation is linear and $D$ is constant. Thus,"

Ginny's day
wonders whether there's any point in filling this in...  got familiar with the new MoClo Standards and designed chromoproteins in the new biobrick compatible MoClo format
designed primers for the above constructs ready to send tomorrow read some cool stuff about potential symbiotic origin of TB worked on wiki following Matt's reminders :P realized how quickly time can pass...
Forgot to book flights... and played classical music to the lab to help us all stay sane
salil
Miniprepped DNA from ecoli transformation. Messed up - added 100\mu l of buffer P2 but all was okay and DNA was successfully extracted. Good enough concentration to sequence. Ordered primers for the construct. Made wiki page template for recording construct progress on the wiki. Organised DNA library/updated with concentrations of new things. Pestered others to upload progress onto the wiki.
Trang-Anh
Played around with the monster and looked at the results of the Blast run that compared Marchantia candidate proteins and Arabidopsis proteins.
Wrote C++ code to build a codon usage table from the sequences I extracted yesterday. Encountered a variety of compilation errors, segfaults and hearts, spades and smileys in my terminal.
Enjoyed Ginny's classical music.

Comparison test of Quantum dots Binding between CsgA-his and CsgA
In order to prove the effect of binding between CsgA-Histag mutant and inorganic nanoparticles is distinct, we apply same amount of suspended CdSeS/ZnS QDs solution followed by the same procedure mentioned above. After 1h incubation, we used PBS washing 2 times. The picture verify our postulation: On the left, CsgA-Histag mutant were induced and its biofilm bind with QDS. CsgA biofilm without Histag cannot bind with QDs thus its red fluorescence is much weaker.

CdS nanorods Templating
As for biofilm characterization, transmission electron microscopy is frequently to be used to visualize the nanofiber network. However, TEM is not very efficient to visualize soft matter due to the less dense of elections produced on soft matter even after negative staining. Amazingly, after incubation with CdS nanorods , the biofilm areas are densely templated by better conductive materials such as CdS nanorods  and we can easily confirm the expression of biofilm.

Exeter iGEM 2014 Team
We were asked by Exeter iGEM 2014 Team to send them the biobricks BBa_K1022115 and BBa_K1022105 from TU Delft iGEM team 2013 and we did. We hope that this little support will help"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," toxin fragments are unknown to the human immune system, an unwanted immune response directed against the neuronal cells could be triggered. This scenario is most likely to occur upon long term treatment using the shuttle mechanism, for example while substituting lacking proteins in the cells.  To be able to assess the immunogenicity of proteins with respect to MHC class I we implemented a machine learning based tool in python using the gradient boosted tree implementation of XGBoost to predict whether or not epitopes are MHC class I binders.
Data and Feature Encoding
Machine learning requires verified and large datasets. The IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) offers experimentally derived datasets containing 157327 samples of MHC class I binding for the most frequent HLA alleles [] . A single data point contains the species, the allele, the peptide length, its sequence, an inequality value and finally and most importantly the ic50 value. The ic50 is a measure of effectiveness of a substance in inhibiting a biochemical function - in this case MHC I binding. Hence, we receive an experimentally derived value of the binding strength of peptides to MHC class I molecules. An affinity of 500 nM is commonly used as a threshold for peptide selection [] . An ic50 value of less or equal than 500 nM indicates an MHC I binder, anything above 500 indicates a non-binder. Due to machine learning algorithms not being able to operate well or not at all on strings, all peptide sequences have to be encoded into features containing more additional information than just a character sequence.
To be able to feed our machine learning algorithm biochemical properties of the individual amino acids, we encoded each residue of the peptide sequences into feature vectors of length 11. Figure 4 shows our chosen encoding for the amino acids. By adding amino acid substitution information (blomap) and physico-chemical properties (columns 6-11) we enabled our machine learning algorithm to learn deep interactions between neighboured amino acids [] . All encoded peptides were used for the training of our machine learning algorithm of choice: Gradient boosted trees.
Figure 4: Extended blomap encoding of all amino acids.  The blomap values are basedon  the  blosum62  matrix,  the  additional  columns  feature  physico-chemical  properties  ofthe respective amino acid.  The blomap was obtained from Maetschke et al, all additional columns from the NCBI amino acid explorer.
Gradient Boosted Trees - Training
As our machine learning algorithm of choice we used extreme gradient boosted trees implemented in python by the XGBoost library [] ."
BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,".  From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that these differences had nothing to do with the objective product. Hence, it came out as another failure.
Relevant agent formula:
protein lysis buffer
Tris-HCl (pH=8.0)      85 mL
Sucrose             25.67 g
β-mercaptoethanol   15 mL
membrane solution buffer
protein lysis buffer : urea solution (8M) = 4 : 1 (volume ratio ))
Therefore, it was a pity that BNU_China failed to detect those two proteins, but they were able to give some opinions to us about protein detection through their experience: 1. Changing the expression strain for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the citation [1], the details are in Table. 2.
2. Make western blots if possible.
The experiments gave us lots of information about membrane proteins. What’s more, the experience helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.

P170 is a kind of acid-induced promoter, and can be bound by rcfB protein activated by lactic acid. To verify the relationship between concentration of lactic acid and promoter, P170 was linked with RFP gene, and strength of fluorescence was measured. Fig.8 shows the circuit with promoter P170.
Fig.8 Genetic regulation circuit of promoter P170
We firstly made assumption of the circuit:
(1) mRNA and combination of mRNA-rib had reached steady state
(2) all enzymes activities were not affected by acid concentration and could be regarded as constant
(3) concentration of rcfB protein was assumed unchanged.
The reaction processes are described as:
Here we list the parameter names and descriptions:
Basing on reaction processes above, equations are constructed as followed: Concentration of induced RcfB and combination of RcfB and lactic acid are written as:
Where KLa and K are constants and n is hill coefficient.
Promoter P170 can be activated in two ways. The first pathway is to bind to the dimerization of lactic acid and RcfB. The other pathway basing on our assumption is that a proportion  of P170 can be activated"

overview
There are a population of 884 million still drink water without the previous purification all over the world. There are about 3 billion to 4 billion families lack of drinkable water. Each year about 3.5 million people's deaths are associated with insufficient water supply and sanitation condition, which occurs mainly in developing countries.  According to all above, the matter of water quality is a great matter of human beings’ life quality. It has always been crucial to many researchers engaging in improving and making breakthroughs on the approaches towards water quality detection. Currently chemical detection methods are more complex and time consuming; besides ,on the way of bringing the samples to the laboratory, some of the indicators may probably be changed. Another thing we may acknowledge is that chemical detection apparatus cost too much money.    Based on the matters above, this year we intended to look for a new way using biotechnology. Here come the ideas, through two kinds of approaches we may achieve rapid water quality detection. One of the approaches is so called comprehensive detection, here we mainly rely on LuxAB ,which encodes a kind of luciferase. Because anything toxic within the water may have a negative impact on the activity of luciferase, the luminescence is likely to be decreased. The other is specific detection, because only in this way can we successfully quantify specific metal ions like Hg(II). One sequence of MerR operon occupies a significant position along with quorum sensing system. In addition, we use gfp as reporter. Besides the two biosensors we built, the joint uses of microfluidic chips, automatic detection devices, photoelectric detection technology and micro total analysis systems will extremely promote biological detection method. This device can also be linked to the computer and has the ability of offline CNC screen operation, which improves the detection"

Practices
“Change is the law of life; and those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future”
John F. Kennedy
Welcome to our Human Practices! Now, when it comes to the particulars of our Human Practices, you will find that it has been separated into three main parts. This is all strictly for narrative purposes, as every single aspect of our project and Human Practices are deeply intertwined through a shared philosophy: If you want change, look to the future!
1. A Philosopher’s Guide to the Future
To ensure an ethically sound iGEM product and experience, we have discussed the ethical considerations that ought to be taken into account. As luck would have it, one of our team members is a philosopher with an interest in bioethics. Thus a guidebook was created, a guide that amongst other things includes an overview of some of the bioethical arguments iGEM participants are likely to encounter, when discussing synthetic biology. You can find these considerations in our section on Bioethics .
2. An Implementation of the Future
We reached out to our local Municipality of Odense along with various experts, for their advice on the development and implementation of our device in an urban environment. You can read more about this in our section on Integrated Human Practice .
3. A Trip to the Future and Beyond!
Considering how our main philosophy was: If you want change, look to the future! It seemed prudent to bring our message on sustainability to the next generation. You can read more about our efforts in the section on Education and Public Engagement .
Bioethics
- A Philosopher’s Guide to the Future
“The facts of life... to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised once it's been established.”
Tyrell, Bladerunner
Synthetic biology and the iGEM competition are aimed to help solve societal issues, issues such as agriculture, medical research, and environmental resource management, the last of which has been our motivation throughout our project. However, while synthetic biology offers many new exciting possibilities, several concerns have to be met when dealing with living organisms. Against, the excitement of the iGEM community, skeptics have pointed to the uncertainty and potentiality for unwanted consequences that might arise from working with"

In addition, they have assisted us in the design of the constructs and primers used throughout the course of our project.
We would also like to thank Dr. FOO Jee Loon from the National University of Singapore, who provided invaluable insights on the more technical aspects of our project.  For further details on how Dr Foo’s suggestions have shaped our project, please refer to our Integrated Human Practices page.
Mr. Clarence TAN Kang Lek loaned and set up his DSLR to help us create a time lapse of our biomanufacturing of luteolin in a bioreactor.
PART 3: HUMAN PRACTICES
Please check out our Human Practices page for a list of our interviewees.  They helped us better understand how to tackle the problems we faced, and provided a refreshing  and holistic perspective on our project.
PART 4: HARDWARE
Miss TAN Annie and Mr. YIP Chi Ho, Justin helped us with the procurement of equipment for assembly of our hardware, such as the bearings used in our peristaltic pump. They also helped to process our Item Request Lists so our purchases could be reimbursed.  While we did not actualize the ideas generated by Mr. Brian Shohei TEO during our discussion on how to refine the design of Light Wait, we still learned much about good design practice and unconventional thinking, and did our best to implement these principles in later designs.  He also reviewed our Hardware page, and along with Mr. Eugene EE. Mr. Anuwar bin SHUKOR and Mr. TAY Peng Yeow supervised us and ensured our safety in our use of the 3D printer and laser cutter.  When it was not possible to use the school’s facilities, Mr SAJJAD Ali helped us to 3D print our designs using his personal 3D printer.
PART 5: MODELLING
We would like to thank Dr. YEOH Jing Wui for imparting to us the principles of mathematical modelling which helped us analyse the relevant biochemical pathways, introducing to us the concepts of optimisation,  and perhaps most importantly, being approachable and allowing our team to consult her throughout the course of our project. She gave us useful and practicable advice  - for example, when we were not able to get good fits based on our model, she told us to take"

Collaboration with NEU_China
This year our iGEM team have developed cooperative relationship with NEU-China team，we have reached an agreement that to help each other examine the effectiveness of the biobricks.
Our team undertakes a few experiments to test whether the EGFP we received from NEU-China can be successfully express in E. coli.
Firstly, We digested the sequence of EGFP form pEGFPN2 vector with restriction enzyme KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we insert the sequence into pET14b which is commonly used as a prokaryotic expression vector.
vector.
The bands located at 720bp, it is equal with the length  EGFP coding sequence, this  gel graphic indicates that we had successfully cloned EGFP                 Then we transform the recombinant vector into E. coli. We had observed green fluorescence from the transgenic E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.
Collaboration with SJTU software
We have connected with SJTU_software. Their project is a social network service (SNS) platform or iGEMers, it provides service for team-team ommunication and laboratory management in teams. When the service is presented online, iGEMers can seek cooperation and share files through their platform. SJTU_software invited us to help them to test the website and give them some advice. We were offered a beta version of their website. Then we gathered several team members to try out their service and gave some useful advice.We are very pleased to have this cooperation with SJTU_software.
