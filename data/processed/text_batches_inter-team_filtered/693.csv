Overview
This year, team Tsinghua-A utilized synthetic biology’s techniques to build up a system in S. cerevisiae to produce the H4 histamine receptor which is able to induce the pheromone responsive pathway and measure the histamine concentration in isolated human blood. The chassis in our project is a yeast strain derived from CEN.PK2-1C. To increase the coupling efficiency in the system, yeast Gpa1 gene was modified by substituting the five amino acids of its C terminal end with its mammalian Gα counterpart. Our professors, Zhen Xie, Xiaowo Wang, and Peng Li, are experienced in E. coli and S. cerevisiae genetic engineering experiments. (They all have been working as researcher or professor for at least 7 years.) They gathered us to learn the safety rules and to clean and sterilize the lab regularly. They also help us to learn how to use the toxic reagents, how to play sterile working.
General Safety Training
Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Wang. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. As for the safe use of instruments, all the experiments are performed under the guidance of lab instructors which successfully lower the potential risk. As for the waste treatment, our lab is secure with a waste-dealing system that guarantee the waste fully decomposed or going to the right place.
Chassis Organism Safety
The escape of S. cerevisiae strain used in experiment may cause allergy to colleagues by forming aerosol in the air. But these deserters will not suffer long despite lab environment due to auxotroph characteristic of certain strain. As for E. coli, the same allergic effect, water pollution and pollution to other lab organic materials may act as a result of escaping and further generation. Since our strain does not hold a proliferate feature, dominance of"

Project Presentation for the 2nd Time
Through the first reply, we gained many useful suggestion, adjusted our project, and concentrated on curing hyperuriemia and gout by remolding intestinal flora and using dialysis devices to let our project more feasible. After preparing enough, we invited our instructors to attend the 2nd reply. Compared with the last time, instructors’ attitude was more positive. They supported our whole idea and experimental design. The most inspiring thing is that we discussed the human immunity prob-lems with immunologist Hu Hongbo. He directly pointed out that although the bacteria in the dialysis device are indirectly contact with human being’s blood, once the bacteria debris or metabolite flow into blood, furious immune reaction will happen. He suggested we can try to avoid such risk by optimizing our dialysis device, increasing its leakproof ability and knocking out some gene of our engineering bacteria to decrease its toxicity. In addition, we can use animal experiment to mimic the leak of bacteria and find out the superior limit of the extent of immune reaction that we can accept.
Those valued opinions helped us to improve our project’s design in the parts of hardware, engineering bacteria and animal experiment. Human being’s immune reaction is always the biggest problem we confront, and professor Hu’s suggestions guided us to a brighter way. We do appreciate professor Hu and other instructors’ contribution.
iSWU 2017
To strength the collaboration with other iGEM groups, we hosted the 2017 China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU), and invited 4 groups in Southwest China to communicated each group’s project and exchange views.
On 8th April 2017, the invited 4 groups: SCU-China, SiCAU-iGEM, TMMU China and UESTC-China came to the WestChina campus of Sichuan university. We showed them around the campus and invited them to visit the laboratory where we do experiment. During the visit, we communicated a lot about the competition and experiment. In the afternoon, all the groups formally started to do presentation one by one. After each presentation the invited teachers asked questions and let iGEMers to think and express opinions. The discussion was heated and let each group gain precious suggestions. In terms of our own project, we were impressed of the valuable advice from TMMU-China. They suggested that we can change or chassis bacteria in the dialysis part from Bacterium typhimurium to Bacillus subtilis, and this kind of adjust can make the dialysis system safer and better.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.

Udhaya Bhaskar
About you:
Hey Fellas, I am Udhaya Bhaskar a.k.a Udhay from India. I am here in Göttingen pursuing my Masters in Microbiology and Biochemistry. It is a kind of dream for every student in India aspiring to have a research oriented future to pursue Masters in Deutschland and it came true for me. In Göttingen, I love the variety of people from different cultures come, live, study and pave a way for their future endeavours. I am always a curious guy who finds out some peculiar and different things around me and I believed that I am a good choice for the iGEM team. iGEM mainly teaches us teamwork and brings out certain talents that are important for research. In the iGEM team, I work in the wet lab performing lots of PCRs, transformation procedures in E. coli to bring out the desired product of our overwhelming futuristic project and also lots of chitchats with the iGEM buddies.
Interesting fact:
I love science and I am a surfaholic. An amateur in photography. I love cooking especially with friends."

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#human practice#start-up kit#report_-_-_TEXT.html," the third biggest contributors, scoring 145 and 143 times respectively, taking 10% each of the entire projects. Books and Business were the least popular types, only 26 and 22 of them done in the past six years.
Though the results were somewhat expected, the question why talks, surveys and workshops are much more popularly done still needed to be answered. The most likely reason would be that these are the types of projects that involve direct interaction with the public. The sole purpose of human practice is to expose the idea of synthetic biology out to the society, and the three types mentioned above fulfil the mission in a most obvious way.
Teams introduce their projects by holding conferences, observe and analyse people’s knowledge and perspective on synthetic biology by conducting surveys, and provide the opportunity for people to witness their working environment and attain hands on experience by giving lab tours and various workshops. Moreover, in order to discuss the current development and future applications of synthetic biology, teams write articles and post it on websites to allow interested groups to gain access and obtain knowledge.
In contrast, types like books and business seems not yet fully developed comparatively. Similar reason can be implied. It seems harder to get in touch with the public by writing and publishing a handbook or children’s book, since the number of copies made by each team limits the access. Though constructing a business plan may provide a base ground for future introduction of their product, it makes little contribution to the society in a short term. Nevertheless, all these types should not be discouraged, for they may have dramatic impact in the future.
Projects Done for Each Type in Each Region
   Fig 3.Percentage of projects done for each type in each region
It can also be concluded from the graph that Latin America, compared to other regions, have higher interest in holding workshops. Europe on the other hand, shows a higher percentage in using social media platforms as a form of Human Practice project. The teams in Asia are more comfortable with conducting survey than the other regions. The European and North American teams shows to have higher consideration in writing an article comparatively than Asia and Latin America.
When it comes to other types of projects such as business, books, visit investigation, game, video and art, there cannot be a definite conclusion which can affect the whole point of this section. This is mainly due to the low percentage or amount of these type of projects being made. So to wrap it up, the teams in each regions have their own preference in how to deliver their human practice projects.

To judge the book's virtue in accomplishing this design, we developed a quiz meant to be taken before and after reading The Adventures of Baxter Bacteria and its included parental guide.  Dr. Jamie Jensen, an expert in the field of Biology Science Education, advised us in writing questions that would quantitatively demonstrate increased understanding of synthetic biology. We administered the pre- and post- tests to children between 6 and 11. The results to the individual questions (n=24) are depicted below.
Questions 1-3 were multiple choice and were structured to test basic knowledge of biology. Questions 4-6 tested people's perception of synthetic biology and also their ability to apply principles of synthetic biology to real world situations. We graded questions 4-6 using a rubric with a number system as a measurement of understanding. The data demonstrates that our book is an effective method to increase children's understanding of synthetic biology. All children who participated in our study scored higher on the post test than the pre test.
We gained permission from the IRB before conducting the tests used to gather this data.
The following are links to the quiz we administered and the rubric we used for grading free response answers.

                                                                                                                                                                They taught us the basic biology experimental techniques by dyeing colon bacillus in a bio-tech way.
                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, they invited the team instructor of Peking University to introduce us how to understand this competition.
                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?
                                                                                                                                                                        Q2: In the field of civil engineering, are there any other applications?

                                                                                                                                                                Based on these three question, Professor gave the following answer to all of these.

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," Telus World of Science Edmonton, we took all the necessary precautions, and applied the advice of Environment, Health, and Safety when we conducted our two workshops. We explained the potential risks of participating, though they are small, and required all participants to use proper PPE. We provided gloves, safety goggles, and biohazardous waste bins. Waste disposal and disinfection were handled by our team members; we had many aliquots of the bacteria for pointing and copious amounts of ethanol to disinfect surfaces every few minutes. We found that this system balanced both the fun in hosting an agar art session while still upholding a culture of safety. The participants were also more than happy to abide by all our safety considerations and we even taught all of the proper technique in glove removal! Overall, putting safety first in these engagement workshops had such a positive result.
Safety Culture
Altogether, the comprehensive online courses and practical training certainly gave our members the necessary knowledge and mindsets required in assessing hazardous situations and addressing safety issues that may arise in the laboratory. Paired with the unique safety considerations needed for our engagement events, our journey has expanded the breadth at which our team’s safety skillset has been applied. From our 2017 iGEM experience, a culture of safety has definitely made its way among the members of Team UAlberta.
Special thanks to all our sponsors!

Run on the flow cytometer.
Flow Cytometer things to remember:
check the sheath fluid box to see if its empty
check the waster container.  If full, dispose and add new bleach
take care not to leave the machine on run. Save sheath fluid by keeping on standby when not in use
find parameters using negative controls. (FSC, SSC, Fluorescense marker)
DO NOT RUN PLATE. RUN WELLS instead. (Run the first well by itself first b/c it needs time to create file folders.) this causes problems.
Run plate only saves data of the first well.
Can rerun through the first well again which would suck up air.  Air no good for the machine.
highlight wells and change settings on the right in the aquisition dashboard screen
mixing speed 180ul/sec
mix 3 times rather than 2
run at 1ul/sec for samples and 0.5ul/sec for negative controls when finding parameters.
make sre uL doesn't exceed samle to prevent sucking up air. (Rule of thumb is to run 50ul less than allotted sample sizes for wells.)
Voltage settings were gotten by running negative controls and adjusting to readouts seen in histogram form of FSC, SSC, FITC

Proof of concept
BabblED have created a modular and accessible system to store data in DNA. We have demonstrated that data can be encoded into DNA, the DNA can be assembled using a modular system without the high expense of de novo synthesis, then read back with high fidelity and built-in error correction. Our multi-step proof of concept:
Data-to-DNA software:
We have written software in python which allows input data to be converted to DNA in the format of BabbleBlocks. The data library (for example an input list of words) is matched to a corresponding list of coding DNA sequences. The desired data to be encoded is then uploaded, or typed. The software gives an output of which BabbleBricks are required, and which order they are to be assembled. For automated labs a protocol script can be provided.
BabbleBricks (make this a link to the page explaining design of BabbleBricks?) are designed to be housed in phytobrick compatible plasmids for storage. The BabbleBrick can be excised from the phytobrick when needed for assembly use
Our BabbleBricks were created using complimentary primers. These were designed to leave overhangs which allowed insertion into a plasmid to comply with BioBrick standard.
To maintain a stock levels of the BabbleBricks replication of the plasmid was done by transforming into competent TOP10 e.coli cells. From these, the plasmid was then extracted, purified and mini prepped. This miniprep is stored and used for assembly. BBa_K1967000 is an example of a BabbleBrick.
Assembly of BabbleBricks
Creating BabbleBlocks from BabbleBricks is a demonstration of our new DNA assembly standard for encoding data. It is a BioBrick device as it consists of several BioBrick components.
The assembly method is the sequential addition of BabbleBricks onto a growing chain anchored by a magnetic bead. Alternating AB and BA"

In a word, users can manage their works in the Project System, communicate with others in the Communication System, create or edit biological maps or networks in the Pano Unit, do functional works in the Plugin Unit. All these are based on our users-friendly UI Framework.
Generally, our front-end is based on Google Chrome Explorer, using Material Design Standard as the framework of display, and, jQuery and D3 as the framework of visualization. Our basis and frameworks provide a clear view, and if more, rich environment for responsiveness. These features provide a great experience for users and meet the demand of functional usages properly.
UI Framework
We build our UI following the Standard of Material Design by Google, in order to make our website tidy to look and convenient to operate. Our framework makes users feel free in visualization, allowing smooth actions to perform while the interfaces keep clear. Aiming at demonstrating information properly and provide good experience for users, we tried our best to show richer content in fewer frames.
Project System
Project is the smallest unit to work in BioHub, in which information as below is saved:
Nodes and links are edited in Pano Unit and shown as thumbnails in the project page, allowing users to view their projects clearly.
Project information is determined when a new empty project starts, showing basic properties about projects.
Functional work information is what users do in Plugin Unit.
All projects are edited and saved on the cloud, allowing other users to comment on your work.
Communication System
We designed a communication system in order to make users worldwide able to view and make comments on your projects. The system is like a forum, where sharing ideas is never more convenient. The ability to comment on others’ work make our BioHub more like a laboratory, not a single software.
Pano Units
Pano is a module to display the biological network, and it is the most important part of this software, so it receives the most concern. A svg is used for storing and showing edges and nodes of the pano. Besides, several Javascript libraries, such as d3.js and jQuery is used for processing and transfering the data.
d3.behavior is used for zooming and dragging by using the mousel and your finger, and we use ajax by jQuery to fetch node information"

(09:30 am) A slow start as the group works on lab safety and forms. These include the COSHH forms for the polystyrene sugar (that should have been done at the start but as the pentane was vented out, didn't think was needed) as well as toluene. The reason the toluene is needed is because it is an irritant, highly flammable and toxic but also dissolves polystyrene so it could be a method that works as long as the P. aeruginosa can grow on toluene. The P. aeruginosa can live on toluene as it can degrade it and use it as a carbon source before it is killed. What the team plans to do is use a minimal amount of toluene to dissolve some polystyrene and then mix the solution into the minimal media broth. The bacteria can then grow on the toluene to start then once it is quickly used up it can then work on the polystyrene as its carbon source. This method could also be used as a selection media as the toluene will kill most bacteria except for the ones that can also degrade polystyrene.
(11:00 am) While the team waited for the supervisor to be found, it was decided to go into town to look for more sponsorship. This was a fun 3 hour trip stopping in almost every shop thought of, that could have a sponsorship fund, or produced a large amount of polystyrene waste that the project is working on.

Tuesday 30th of August
We did  minipreparations of Ribolock CeaB – Terminator and INP – Terminator. Afterwards the fragments were restricted and then ligated to a promoter.  Before the restriction we put the fragments on gel to make sure that the ligation was successful. A transformation of AFP was also done.
Wednesday 31th of August
The multiple  restrictions and ligations were done; INP-Terminator with pLac-Lux and constitutive promoter and AFP with constitutive and Lambda cI promoter.  A control ligation was made for all the promoters. In preparation for the following day the restriction of GFP and LuxR were done too.
Thursday 1th of September
On the plates with the ligated INP were successful in contrast to the AFP ligations. We opted to repeat the ligation of AFP with Lambda cI. A CTAB minipreparation was also done followed by a control restriction.
Monday 5th of September
A control restriction was done on the CTAB products from last Friday. Due to the failure of Fridays ligations, we did the ligations again together with the restriction and ligation of AFP with the constitutive promoter.
Wednesday 7th of September
We miniprepped the ligated products and did a control restriction with EcroRI and PstI. Unfortunately the results were not what we expected. The results of GFP test from the past week were inconclusive so we decided to repeat it. GFP testing was done on the promoters pBAD-GFP and constitutive promoter – GFP (Both induced with arabinose in two types of ''E.coli'' TOP10’ and MG1655).
Thursday 8th of September
The ligations of AFP and INP-Terminator to their promoters was repeated. We did GFP testing on pLAc-Lux – GFP and Constitutive promoter – GFP, both induced with IPTG again in the two types of ''E.coli'').
Friday 9th of September
The ligation of INP – Terminator were unsuccessful again so we repeated the ligation again together with the ligation of GFP to the HybB promoter.

Lab 1
The LabPats re-completed the Interlab after realizing that they were missing a set of wells from the last time. They spent the day completing the CFU protocol, working with the plate reader, and calibrating the flow cytometer for use. Later in the day, Mike helped the students locate primers and sequences in order to order more primers in time. After a long day with the Interlab, the students were happy to proceed forward with their project.
Lab 2
With all of the failed transformations in the week, moral was low for the RX Lab Students.  They entered lab and found a surprise, the Chitinase C-1 transformations were successful in 2 of the 3 bacteria strains! The team then split into the two working groups. Max and Jonah cultured the transformed plasmid of the iGEM Backbone. Travis, Peter, and Chris cultured the chitinase C-1 transformed bacteria and set up Yarrowia Testing #5 after Yarrowia Testing #4 once again showed no viable results. After the lab work was completed, the team headed to UES where they completed their presentation and went through a dry run of it in order to prepare for Dr. Naik the following day.

In order to express this alteration, as mentioned above, we use another part of pLacI* with decreased transcription speed instead of pLacI in the species.
The structure of binding sites is shown in figure (see Figure 3). The graph indicates that LacI monomers first bind together to form LacI dimer, then LacI dimers forms LacI tetramer, and finally LacI4 binds with pLacI* to form pLacI*:LacI4.

Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into"

Basic parts
New Basic Part : hUPll
BBa_K1722000
hUPll is a bladder tissue-specific promoter being found in human urothelium. Uroplakin II (UPII) has been characterized as a bladder tissue-specific protein and the expression of uroplakin II was found to be limited to bladder-derived cells. 2015 SZU-iGEM use hUPII to drive the expression of the therapeutic genes(such as p21 and Bax) so that the gene is expressed only in bladder cells and systematic toxicity is minimized.
Another Basic Part : hTERT
BBa_K1722002
hTERT, which is short for human telomerase reverse transcriptase, is recognized as a cancer specific promoter for various cancers. Researches show that hTERT promoters are activated in tumor cells that are telomerase positive while being inhibited in normal cells that are telomerase negative, which indicates that hTERT promoter may specifically target at tumor cells.
Another Basic Part : tRNA
BBa_K1722004
This tRNA gene can produce an tRNA with CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Only with this tRNA can the mRNA chain with UAG terminator being fully translated. The aminoacyl-tRNA came from barchaebacteria, and it is generally applied to unnatural amino acid orthogonal system.
Another Basic Part : shTERT
BBa_K1722001
shTERT is short for super human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is improved from hTERT promoter( BBa_K404106 ), a cancer specific promoter. Three base pairs in hTERT promoter were mutated and the drive efficiency of the promoter was verified to be increased significantly.
Another Basic Part : Rluc
BBa_K1722005
The Rluc was improved from BBa_J52012 ,which was being amber mutated.It can be transcripted to an mRNA chain with one codon being mutated to stop codon UAG. It cannot be fully expressed in natural biology system but can be used as a reporter gene in unnatural amino"

We helped City University of Hong Kong to clone a construct that they fail many times. As they use competent E. coli strain BL21 to make the plasmid before, we try to use DH5alpha as an alternative, eventually we successfully help them to clone with it, which is a better strain for plasmid constructing and they helped us to improve our modeling part.
We discussed the progress and exchanged some ideas of synthetic biology and iGEM with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

If the remaining founders do not wish to purchase these shares then they will be purchased by the company for the current market value of the shares. If the skill set of the departing advisor is deemed valuable to the company by the board of directors, a replacement advisor will be sought by the company upon unanimous decision by the founders.
Inability to Obtain Required Skill Sets
If FREDsense is unable to attract the required skill sets when needed there are two contingencies that will be attempted in order. The first contingency will be to approach internship programs at local universities to attempt to obtain the necessary personnel before their training is entirely complete, provided they have adequate mentorship from within their university. Failing this, FREDsense will reallocate money in the budget to attempt to attract qualified personnel with a more competitive salary or compensation package, potentially through the issue of shares to the individual(s).
Inadequate Performance by an Officer
If an officer does not commit to the time commitment required by their position within the company, such as part- or full-time employment, then that shareholder will be deemed to be performing inadequately. In the case of inadequate performance the shareholder will be given one full year (365 days) during which they are to meet all required performance goals as outlined by their employment position. If the shareholder does not meet the required performance goals with one year their shares will be purchased by the company for their current market value and the employment of the individual will be terminated.
Incorporation
As a next step for our group, our six members have begun the process of incorporating our business.  This has involved engaging legal professionals to maintain the rights of our company FREDsense Technologies.  We have established a share structure, secured the name FREDsense Technologies, and begun to protect our identity as a corporation.  We have also created an unanimous shareholders agreement (USA) to ensure that our team is working together strongly to build this company up in the future.

His interest in the resources we could provide to educators and students ended up leading to a longer-term collaboration
It was exciting to act as representatives of our college and talk to legislators. Meeting with Senator Mason and hearing his enthusiasm about our education outreach led us to more seriously consider how we could work with representatives of our community to address their needs.
Making Connections Across the W&M Science Community: Bioengineering Speaker Series
Although there is synthetic biology research at the College of William & Mary, there currently exists no engineering or bioengineering program. Toward the beginning of our iGEM project, a professor from the Department of Applied Science, who does research on the physical and chemical properties of spider silk for potential synthetic biology applications, met with our PI and was curious about our team’s research. After meeting with him and talking to him about his research, we realized that there are many professors who do research involving synthetic biology and bioengineering that are not connected because they are in different departments. As part of our outreach within our college community, we organized a Bioengineering Speaker Series during the summer for student researchers, professors, and anyone who was interested in learning more about synthetic biology research. We were lucky to host three speakers from the Department of Applied Science and the Biology Department. Each talk was presented at a suitable level for a general audience and was followed by a discussion with the audience. The fact that the audience was from diverse backgrounds of biology, chemistry, and physics led to rich discussions. Although we initially wanted to record the lectures and make them publicly accessible, we felt that in order to create an environment that could foster discussion between students and professors, it would be better to make it as informal as possible. Across the three events, we reached about 95 people. We are continuing the series this fall due to the positive feedback we got from students and professors. We are presenting our own research in early November, and Professor Myriam Cotten from the Department of Applied Science is presenting her research in late November.

Since our audience included people with varying levels of biology and scientific background, we received mixed feedback on this method. Some people said they understood the research description and they liked the presentation format but others told us that they found it very confusing.

☑ Best Model
Our team should be in consideration for this award for embodying the value of continuous interplay between theory and experiment.
1. In order to find the best fermentation conditions, we designed the experiment and used the experimental data to produce butanol function. The optimal fermentation conditions and maximum yield were obtained for the optimal solution of the function. Then we experimented it again under the best fermentation conditions, and the results showed that the yield was obviously increased. This reflects the guidance of the model to the experiment and experimental support to the model.
2. We established a molecular dynamics model for biochemical reactions. For the butanol production system, we find the reaction speed limiting step and the sensitive parameters. For the hydrogen production system, we have theoretically proved that the hydrogen production of the constructed Escherichia coli is relatively high. This theoretically demonstrates the feasibility of the project. Click here for more details about our Model.
☑ Best Integrated Human Practices
We conduct a survey for both farmers and citizens to get a view of current treatment of straw and clean energy. We found that phenomenon of burning straw still exist and utilization rate of it is particularly low. Besides, citizen’s attitude toward clean energy is friendly but they are still not willing to use. After mastering the basic situation of straw treatment and clean energy, we have communicate with Biogas Institute of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to understand the current research progress in this field so as to improve our design. We get more information about obstacle in current research of reusing straw, as well as analysis of advantages and improvement in our project. After those above, we consult biologist of our project for further optimization in pathway and experiment in a more professional perspective. Click here for more details about our Human Practices.
☑Best Software Tool
Gene Card Online is an online board game developed by Team UESTC-China, realizing the organic combination of synthetic biology and board game. The most basic elements of synthetic biology are clearly delivered to people under the condition of victory, which is the combination of restriction enzyme, DNA ligase, vector, target gene, bacteria and PCR, and they can understand what synthetic biology is in the process of enjoying the game. This fills the blank of Software Tool about promoting synthetic biology. Putting a board game online can further expand the impact of the our project to drive the development of the project itself. It can be transmitted any place at any time in the world that has access to Internet. It can not only help iGEMer around the world to promote iGEM activities, but also help the contributors of synthetic biology to popularize synthetic biology more vividly"

Vacuum (2)
Similarly to the experiment carried out in the section “Limits of E.coli” with vacuum, we plated the strains and incubated them in deep vacuum for 48 hours. After this incubation period, cells were recollected and O.D.600 as well as (normalized) fluorescence, determined. Surprisingly, Biobrick 2 proved extremely sensitive to vacuum in both strains, since normalized fluorescence dramatically decreased compared to the normal pressure-incubated cultures (Figure 15).

Standardization
Biobrick parts are supposed to be standard, this is, they are expected to behave in a similar and predictable way in different host organisms             or “chassis”. In this part of the project we used six different Escherichia coli strains commonly used in molecular biology labs (DH5α, XL1-Blue, JM109, DH10B, HB101, BL21(DE3)) to test whether the             behavior of our Biobrick parts was homogeneous among them (Bb1 to Bb6, BBa_K1468000-BBa_K1468005 in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts ). Surprisingly, only one of the constructions we tested displayed a relatively standard output among the different strains (BB5).

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," a common set of cytoplasmic signaling proteins: CheW and CheA interact with receptor molecules to form stable ternary complexes that generate stimulus signals; CheY transmits those signals to the flagellar motors, CheZ controls their lifetime; CheR (methyltransferase) and CheB (methylesterase) regulate MCP methylation state.  Abbreviations: OM (outer membrane); PG (peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall); CM (cytoplasmic membrane)
As in many biological signaling systems, the signaling currency in the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is reversible protein phosphorylation (Fig. 5).  However, the principal signaling chemistry is a bit different in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  CheA is a kinase that uses ATP to autophosphorylate at a specific histidine residue.  Phospho-CheA molecules then serve as donors for autokinase reactions that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB.  Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity.  The active forms of these response regulators are short-lived because they quickly lose their phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY.
CheW couples the autophosphorylation activity of CheA molecules to chemoreceptor control.  Receptors, CheW, and CheA form stable ternary signaling complexes that modulate the influx of phosphoryl groups to the CheY and CheB proteins in response to chemoeffector stimuli.
Figure 3: Phosphorelay signaling.  The flagellar motors of E. coli spin CCW by default; the signaling pathway modulates the level of phospho-CheY, the signal for CW rotation.  Reactions and components that augment CW rotation are depicted in green; those that augment CCW rotation are depicted in red.
Chemoreceptor signaling states in E.coli
The signaling activities of chemoreceptors are described by a two-state model (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels of phospho-CheY.  Receptors in the CCW signaling state deactivate CheA, resulting in low levels of phospho-CheY.  Thus, the behavior of the flagellar motors reflects the relative proportion of"

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
First months of 2018
This year we decided to start public engagement early, so in the beginning of   January we presented synthetic biology, Science & Technology programme and iGEM on the TV show of Estonian National Channel. During the show we taught the host how to extract DNA from saliva, showed the DNA samples on gel, introduced a robot which was programmed to recognize different bacteria on plates. Through this example we explained, that synthetic biology is combination of robotics, information technology and biology.
Watch the show in Estonian
First months of 2018 our team members and Primary PI have been busy travelling the world with educational fairs.

Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
Yesterday saw the Metal Sensing team attempt to transform DH5-alpha E.coli bacterial cells with two BioBricks (the cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick and the kinA BioBrick) and plate them out on LB + kanamycin plates. The cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick is part of the Metal Sensing team's sub-project and the kinA BioBrick will be used by the Stochastic Switch team's sub-project.
Today's exercise should see the Metal Sensing team inoculate LB medium with any transformant cultures which grow on these plates - if there are no cultures present then the transformations will be attempted a second time.
Observations
On all four plates there could be seen hundreds of transformant colonies - this was to be expected as the DNA used to transform the DH5-alpha cells was in pure form.
Procedure
There were two procedures carried out in response to these observations:
Three colonies from each 200ul plate of transformants were used to inoculate 6 x 5ml LB+kanamycin (making a total of six tubes of inoculated 5ml LB + kanamycin). This is preparation for mini-preps.
One colony from each of the 200ul plates (1 cotC-GFP-smtA transformed E.coli colony and 1 kinA transformed E.coli colony) was taken to inoculate 2 x 50ml LB + kanamycin media. This is preparation for midi-preps.

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Killing I_-_-_TEXT.html," These are polymeric structures that extend into the periphery from the surface of the donor cell and can attach to the surface of other bacteria and initiate conjugation. They do make the physical contact between the cells by retracting, but they do not form the channel, through which the DNA is shuttled.
After the initiation of conjugation, a relaxase creates a nick in one of the strands of the conjugation plasmid at the nic sequence of the origin of transfer (oriT) and unwinds the strand to be transferred (the T-strand). If the relaxase (TraI in IncP plasmids) works in complex of many proteins, this is called the relaxosome. The T-strand is unwound from the plasmid and transferred into the recipient in a 5’-to 3’ terminus direction. During this process, the relaxase protein stays bound to the 5’ end of the T-strand. The transfer is catalysed by an enzyme (called TraG in IncP plasmids), which possibly acts by connecting the relaxosome at the 5’ end of the T-strand with the mating complex (mating complex are all proteins that are important for the formation of the plasma bridge between the two cells). The remaining strand is replicated using rolling circle replication. The transferred strand is complemented in the recipient cell.
Since a conjugation plasmid contains all the information necessary to transfer DNA, the recipient becomes a donor after conjugation [10] .
There exist many variations of this classic system of conjugation. One is a two component system, consisting of a helper plasmid and a mobilizable plasmid. Most of the proteins needed for conjugation are trans acting elements, they do not have to be on the transferred plasmid, but can either be part of the chromosome or be on another plasmid, a so called helper plasmid. The only cis acting element needed for the transfer of a plasmid is the oriT sequence. It consists of the sequence, where the relaxase nicks the DNA, the nic, and some genes called mobilizable (mob) genes. Together they make about 500bp. The mob genes encode for example accessory proteins that bind to the DNA sequence at and around the nic sequence and assist the relaxase. If they are included in an arbitrary plasmid, it will be mobilized and conjugated by the helper plasmid.  This two component system has some important advantages: You do not need to put the genetic information you want to transfer on a big conjugation"

[5 ] Yoshimune et al. isolated SheDnaK from the Antarctic Shewanella bacterium, and observed it has a much higher ATPase activity at low temperatures than EcoDnaK, which is characteristic for cold-active enzymes. [9] (Figure 2) They subsequently expressed SheDnaK in a DnaK-null mutant. This did not rescue E. coli 's growth at 43°C, nor did the strain support lambda phage propagation at 30°C, but it did allow their SheDnaK comprising E. coli to grow at temperatures as low as 15°C, which was impossible for the null-mutant. We use SheDnaK in our CryoBricks based on the speculation it may recover some of the functions EcoDnaK loses at low temperatures when they are expressed in parallel to eachother.
Figure 3: Freeze/thaw cycle survival rate of E. coli containing an empty vector (black circles), a vector carrying P. irgensii 's CspA gene (white circles), and a vector carrying P. irgensii 's CspC gene (white triangles). Adapted from Uh et al. (2010)
CspA and CspC
While exposure to low temperatures represses the expression of most proteins, cold shock protein (Csp) expression is actually induced by this. Jones and Inouye showed E. coli's CspA concentration can increase over 200-fold within 1.5 hours, when exposed to cold shock. [10] CspA functions as an RNA chaperone, [11] capable of melting stable secundary structures in mRNA, and in doing so facilitating their translation at low temperatures. [12] [13] Its nucleic acid binding properties are mediated by a β-barrel structure, which is known as the cold shock domain and is common to all cold shock proteins whose structures have been clarified. In particular, two recurring motifs - RNP1 and RNP2 - are essential for cold shock proteins' ability to bind RNA. [14]
E. coli 's genome comprises a family of 9 highly similar RNA chaperones (CspA through CspI), 4 of which are cold-induced. [15] Deletion of one, two or three of the cold-induced chaperones does not affect cell viability at low temperatures, but a quadruple knock-out strain exhibits a cold-sensitive phenotype. Xia, Ke and Inouye not only made and characterised these knock-out strains, but"

Another idea was to make a short movie which introduces our project concept and us. It was not that easy to combine the project idea with introducing us, but after brainstorming together with Professor Fritz Treiber we came up with a good concept. He told us how to do a screenplay, the importance of a good time table and borrowed us his sound equipment.

Concretely, it expresses two main proteins:
proNGF, linked to HlyA, a type I secretion system export signal in E. coli. Between the two, we added a TEV protease cleavage site.
TEV protease, a protein from Tobacco Etch Virus that recognizes a specific sequence and cleaves it. We also linked the TEV protease to the same export signal.
Once exported from the cell, the TEV protease can cleave the proNGF from HlyA and free the pro-neurotrophin in the external medium.

Results showed that the PC reporter system works with a preference for spacer length of about 21 bp and 33 bp, presenting a period of 10-11 bp; this is consistent with the length of DNA double helix in one period (10.4 bp) [12].
Figure 6. The effect of spacer length variation on the performance of PC reporter system. Spacer is defined as the sequence between the sgRNA pairs. The spacer length varies from 5 bp to 107 bp. Note that the effect of spacer length exhibits a period of 10-11bp, which is consistent with the structure of DNA double helix.
Taking all the above together, the final design of our PC reporter system was determined: both fragments of split luciferase fused to N-terminus of dCas9, PAM-out sgRNA orientation, and spacer length of 21 bp. Next we set out to validate whether PC reporter can read out the sequence-specific information using crude PCR product instead of well-purified DNA samples.
Applying PC reporter to crude NAD product
We first carried out specificity test using PC reporter system to distinguish the target plasmid (BBa_K909009) from different kinds of non-specific controls (Figure 7a,b,c). The results showed that the luminescence intensity using the positive target is significantly higher than that of non-specific controls (Figure 7d).

(b) Control with only one site recognized by ""half pair"". (c) Negative control with no site to be recognized. (d) Experimental data. Error bars denote s.d.; n=3.
Also, we need to test the sensitivity of PC reporter system. As shown in Figure 8, PC reporter can still work at the concentration of ~0.1nM target for both plasmid (Figure 8a) and crude PCR product (Figure 8b).

Project Abstract
This summer, the UW-Madison iGEM team will be working on streamlining the biofuel discovery and production processes through the use of biosensors and microcompartments . The necessity for sustainable, economical sources of fuel is ever growing, and UW-Madison is a forefront institution in the hunt for such supplies. In association with the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center ( GLBRC ), we are creating new E. coli biosensors that can accelerate high throughput screening of potential fuel sources. We’re specifically interested in ethanol and alkane , derived from sources ranging from cellulose to metabolically engineered E. coli.
We have found regulatory systems which respond to each of the biofuels of interest, and are using standard BioBrick assembly to create E. coli strains which can be used to perform fluorescence-based assays. By using fluorescent biosensors, we hope to lower costs (in both equipment and cost-per-sample) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. In the interest of creating robust and accurate assays, we are also attempting to increase the magnitude and range of the linear fluorescence response through directed evolution. We hope to leverage multiple selections to both decrease basal fluorescence and increase the point where the response becomes saturated.
As a more direct approach to increasing microbial biofuel yields, we are also pursuing the use of bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) as scaffolding for key enzymes. We hope that through localizing crucial anabolic enzymes, as well as the beginning of our sensing cascades, to the BMC surfaces, we can increase fuel titers as well as our reliability in accurately sensing them.
We hope that when combined our projects will produce a useful toolkit for researchers in and beyond the GLBRC to aid the discovery and engineering of promising fuel sources and processes.
What is iGEM?
iGEM is a synthetic biology competition and stands for Internationally Genetically Engineered Machines. It began as a friendly competition between 10 MIT teams in 2004, and has since grown to over 130 teams in 2010 from all different countries around the globe. This year even more teams are anticipated, and"

Characterisation
Plates
Plate characterisation showed that cscA is a suitable selectable marker- only cells which had the gene grew on sucrose as a sole carbon sourse (Figure 5). The drawback of this antibiotic-free selectable marker is that more time is required for the growth of the cscA cells on sucrose plates (we incubated them overnight at 37"
TMMU_China,2016,Team:TMMU China#Project Results#Project3_-_-_TEXT.html," peptide from the Usp45 protein which is secreted out of L. lactis very efficiently. Fusion of the signal peptide of Usp45 to a couple of proteins resulted in an efficient way of secreting the coded proteins into the media. The fusion protein will meet a chaperone protein, SecB, which bring the fusion protein to a protein secretion apparatus. This apparatus cleaves the signal peptide and frees the proteins from the cell.
Figure3.1:The surface display system
Design
The protein of interest is fused to the cA domain with the USP45 signal peptide, driven by the PnisZ promoter and followed by the nisin resistant gene nsr. To demonstrate the utility of the protein surface display, here we took the β-galactosidase protein as a proof of concept.
Figure3.2:Design of the surface display system
Result
To demonstrate whether cA could indeed anchor the protein of interest at the surface of L. lactis, the pLacZ-Cytosol and pLacZ-Surface plasmids were introduced into NZ9000 respectively. As stated above, the cA domain is derived from the AcmA protein, which is an autolysin of L. latis that cleaves the peptidoglycan to release the duplicated bacteria. Since the substrate peptidoglycan is now occupied by the cA-β-galactosidase fusion proteins, the AcmA autolysin activity is hindered, thus cell separation will be interfered. Indeed, we found that under microscopic, the NZ-Surface cells were poorly separated compared to the NZ-Cytosol strain. Further more, using a polyclonal antibody against β-galactosidase, we found that about 70% of the β-galactosidase protein is present at the cell wall, while the other 30% protein is present in the cytoplasm, perhaps due to the inefficient secretion process. In contrast, all theβ-galactosidase proteins were present in the cytoplasm in the NZ-cytosol strain.
Figure3.3:The protein surface display system for L. lactis. A). Microscopic picture of the NZ-Cytosol and NZ-surface. The LysM domains of cA can compete with the autolysins of L. lactis, thus the NZ-surface strain is poorly separated after nisin induction. B).

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel linings. It has a high incidence, especially in developed counties. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Unfortunately, there is no known cure currently. Therefore, our team is seeking for therapies towards these refractory diseases.
To teat IBDs, we turned to gut microbes for help. We armed E.coli with various weapons (renamed as Gutrio) so that they can automatically search and destroy targets (which are IBDs). The name Gutrio is a combination of Gut and the famous adventurer Mario in video game Super Mario.
Gutrios eliminate their enemies with the EGF bullets.
Gutrios lock their enemies by tracing Nitric Oxide.
Gutrios call for reinforcements with the Quorum Sensing system.
Gutrios terminate their missions while a Kill Switch turns on.

Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
What influence will be make to the cells if we change the signaling pathways of cell?
The level of the cell modification plays an important role in drug safety. Generally speaking, lower modification level means less side effects. Modification of subcellular structure may cause the cell activity change. If it leads to an acceleration of cell metabolism, it may eventually make the cell cancerous or autophagy.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
What kind of side effects?
Increasing reaction rate may result an accumulation of intermediate products which cause side effects. However, your project will not only increase the reaction efficiency but also make the reaction ordered. This modification of reaction chain makes reaction under control. In other word, the type and output of productions can be controlled. Theoretically, the side effects can be minimized.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
Finally, could you please make a prospection of our project?
I have engaged in drug safety assessment many years. I think what restricts the development of the pharmaceutical industry is the disorder of reaction. The disorder makes it difficult to get the identical ingredients in different production batch which cause worse side effects. Your project is supposed to order the reaction chain and decrease the impure component of drug. This can not only increase the reaction rate but also improve the quality of drugs. I believe it will have a positive influence on the development of the pharmaceutical industry.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
Thanks for your answer.
II.Spread iGEM to other three university(CLICK)
We start a new program this year through which we could invite several members from other universities (which are not iGEM participants) to work with us in our project to:
1. Help them to have a thorough understanding of iGEM and Synthetic Biology.
2. Get them prepared to start an iGEM team in their own universities in the years to come.
3. Further promote the spreading of iGEM and synthetic biology.

Cas13a - Accurate detection of specific genes
Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) is a Class 2 type VI-A CRISPR-Cas effector that specifically targets RNA ( O. O. Abudayyeh et al. 2016 ). Due to the potential use of Cas13a as a broad range detection tool we attempted to turn the protein and its required guide sequence into a BioBrick. The construct was delivered in three fragments that had to be assembled with the backbone into a plasmid. In parallel, we expressed Cas13a from a plasmid ( pC013 )"

Figure 3. Schematic representation of the envisioned biomaterial.
Testing Our Living Material Platform
To demonstrate the performance and behaviour of our designed living material platform,                       we designed and carried out multiple experiments. A detailed analysis of the                       results can be seen here . We started with                       reproducing the hydrogel synthesis conditions described in the paper by Plieva et al. (9) .                       When this yielded mechanically unstable hydrogels, we examined different combinations of degree of substitutions of dextran, equivalents of                       the radical initiator system, and preparation temperature to identify suitable conditions that yield reproducible hydrogels.                       See here for more information.
Subsequently, Scanning Electron Microscopy experiments were performed to find the optimal hydrogel                       polymerisation conditions that result in the desired macroporous structure. After attempting different hydrogel synthesis conditions,                        the required conditions were identified.
To demonstrate the functionality of the dextran-adhesin combination,                      we first investigated the dextran-binding capabilities of the isolated MpIBP carbohydrate-binding domain                      via an assay based on dextran binding affinity to Sephadex beads, which can be used to pull dextran-binding proteins from solution.                      A schematic overview and global explanation of this experiment can be seen in figure 4. More details about this experiment and the results can be                      seen at the registry page of our carbohydrate-binding domain biobrick, BBa_K2812000 .
Figure 4. Assay to examine the dextran binding capabilities of the carbohydrate-binding domain. The beads present in step 1 are                                         dextra-based Sephadex beads to which dextran-binding proteins can bind and subsequently these beads can be used to pull dextran-binding proteins                                         from solution.
Next, a washing experiment was designed to investigate the binding of adhesin expressing E. coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria to 380 µL columnar-shaped hydrogels under different circumstances.                     A schematic overview and global explanation of this experiment can be seen in figure 5. Click for more detailed experimental conditions and results .                     During these experiments we switched in our design from E. coli BL21 (DE3) to E. coli BLR, a strain known known for                      more stable expression of proteins with many repeats, in an attempt to obtain more consistent results.

Customize and style your wiki
So far be we created the backbone of your wiki by using templates and a table layout. Besides, every teams wants to have their only style. However, in the case of an iGEM team wiki, the normal way of change the look and feel of a wiki does not work. This is due to the fact, that all teams share one big wiki and changes done to the layout will change all other team wikis as well.
The best way of styling your wiki anyway is by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). To read more about CSS read the following section.
Read more
CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) is a language that is used to describe what elements on a web page are supposed to look like. So a webpage is created using HTML code and can be styled using CSS. The CSS instruction are to be placed between an opening ""<style>"" and a closing ""</style>"" in the header of a HTML page or can be directly included in HTML tags using the ""style"" attribute:
<html> <head> <title>CSS example</title> ... <style type=""text/css""> a {             color: green;          }          a.external {             color: red;          }          #bestImage {             border: 1px solid green;             width: 500px;          }          .red {             color: red;          }          ... </style> </head> <body> <p '''style=""color: red;"">Just some text</p> </body> </html>
If the style-attribute is used, the CSS instruction will only affect this tag and all its child-tags. In case of the ""<style>"" block in the header section, two types of information have to be provided: What is to be styled and how is it to be styled.
The first information is provided by so-called selectors. A selector can select an element of the page in many different ways. A selector can generally select all tags of a certain kind (e.g. all <p>-tags). Secondly, a selecotr can select an element that has a certain identifier. An identifier is a unique ID for an element within the webpage and is specified by the attibute ""id"" (e.g. <img id=""bestImage""><nowiki>). Thirdly, a selector can select a subgroup of elements, called class. HTML elements can be grouped into a classes by using the attribute ""class"" (e.g. <nowiki><img class"

Mario Moisés Álvarez is the former director of the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in México. He is the coordinator of the Biotechnology Graduate Program in this same institution, and one of the youngest scientists in México ranked as a Level 2 Researcher by the Mexican System of Researchers (SNI). Dr. Álvarez has a Ph.D. from Rutgers University in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, a Masters in Science in Chemical Engineering from Rutgers University, and a Masters in Science in Process Engineering and a Bachelor Degree in Biochemistry from the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He did a Postdoctoral stay at Bristol Myers Squibb, at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute, where he collaborated in different projects related to the design and scale-up of Pharmaceutical Processes, particularly reactive and crystallization processes.
Dr. Álvarez's main area of scientific expertise is laminar mixing (mixing operations at low speed or in high viscosity conditions). Currently, his group is working in the application of mixing knowledge on the design of bioreactors. This includes the design of novel high performance bioreactor systems for animal cell culture, the diagnose of mixing performance in bioreactors through reactive methods, and the study of non-ideal mixing conditions in bioreactive systems.

Tec-Chihuahua,2016,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#projectresults_-_-_TEXT.html," we             could be certain that what we obtained was what we wanted.
When we did the last electrophoresis we had as a result that all the parts that we extracted were right, with the             exception of one of them, we believe that the chloramphenicol backbone was supercoiled and that’s the reason             it appeared to be at a higher molecular weight.
After this we quantified how much nanograms of DNA we had per microliter and proceeded to do the 3A assembly. Since not everything is digested and ligated properly during the assembly, there are some backbones without the insert that can interfere. Because of this there were two types of colonies in the plates where our transformed cells were plated: pink and white. The ones that we were interested in were the white ones, since these are the ones that have what we want correctly inserted; the pink ones are the backbones that were not correctly digested and ligated and thus are of no use for us. We grab one of the white colonies and put it to grow in LB broth, so we could later extract its plasmid and start this process again until we have the BioBrick™ we desire.
The BioBrick’s we built contains intermediate part of CDS of the chaperonin 60 (along with chaperonin 10 provides             resistance to high temperatures) and CspC (it provides resistance to low temperatures), BBa_K2069000: INT 3.             Also, another that allows the easy assembly for expression of a cephalopod Reflectin 1A with a T7 promoter, BBa_K2069001: INT 1. The last one give expression of Reflectin 1A and GAFP-1 under control of a T7 promoter, BBa_K2069007:             Eme.

NCTU_Formosa: Team Introduction
Team Introduction
     We are NCTU_Formosa iGEM team. Our team consists of 16 students with a diversity of major departments in National Chiao-Tung University, including the department of Biological Science and Technology, Material                 Science and Engineering, Nano Science and Engineering as well as Electronics Engineering. Each of us made good use of our specialized knowledge, we shared opinion and did brainstorming together, and gain new multifaceted abilities during                 these days. NCTU_Formosa! Go! Fight! And Win our glory!!
Team Leader
I’m Francis, the team leader of 2017 NCTU_Formosa and a student majoring in Material Science and Engineering. From a childish kid who didn’t even hear of iGEM to the leader of NCTU_Formosa, I learned lots of things. Learning technical                     skills for experiments"

""An inspiring try, I like it very much. Hope it will be more perfect in the future, and our lab could really use it."" by Researcher Shen from Prof. Lu Yongjun's laboratory
""More professional articles in database might be better?"" by researcher Lin from Prof. Yang Jianhua's Laboratory
Figure 18: We recommend S-Din to researchers of LU laboratory.
Ordinary bio-lovers are also interested in S-Din, especially its name.
""The name 'S-Din' is cool! I like it!"" by Lin
""The software is smart! How does it know what I really want to search?"" by Zheng
""What if S-Din can recommend some daily headlines, like newspapers, Synthetic Biology Daily?"" by Li
Figure 19: We introduce our product S-Din to ordinary students of SCAU.
We are very excited to witness a hit in public when S-Din first met with the public. From the original inspiration to the real software product, our software can't be born without continuous communication and timely feedback with public and all related fields. We are deeply impressed by the power of human practices. Although this version of S-Din is not perfect, we'll continue to create a better product.
Synbio is just a S-din away.

This primer anneals in the terminator and probably has too much secondary structure. It will be moved downstream and re-ordered. Plasmid prep on G2.3 and G3.3 yields good concentration. Rescue PCR on G1,3,5, appears successful. G1,3,5 digested along with pFTV overnight.

Spent time today working on all of the necessary materials for the ScienceU presentation that will be on Tuesday of next week. Start to put together different activities that would introduce the high schoolers to genetic engineering, our project, and current ethical issues in synthetic biology. Cleanup of digestion product from yesterday, ligation, purification, transformation of cells with G1,3,5. 30 Minute incubation, plating.
Sunday, July 27, 2014
Worked a majority of the day on making a PowerPoint and developing content and examples that kids would understand without a heavy science background. Lots of CM 50 plates were made so that we could demonstrate antibiotic resistance in our presentation and also because we needed some more.

Sequencing results arrive - only one colony from the ligation, arbitrarily termed ""L6"" had the dCas9 system. The rest of the ligation and CBA plasmids did not appear to have dCAs9 inserted. Ashlee transformed L6 into DH10B cells and plated for overnight growth on Kan at 37 degreees C.
The ""Central Dogma Relay"" was put together and cut out so that we could use it as a way to check and see if the kids were able to understand transcription and translation. PENN STATE and SCIENCE were used as examples that the kids will need to transcribe so that they can keep their cell ""alive"". Transformation from yesterday yields very few colonies, cells re-transformed using yesterday's ligation product, plated. Samples G2.3 and G3.3 sent for sequencing using primers common R1 and F2 and fast F2 and R1 (these primers all anneal in the CDS). Four colonies picked from re-transformation of G5, used to inoculate cultures. Culture inoculated from streak of G5.3 cells (plated 7/18). Six colonies picked from G1 re-transformation.

En effet, malgré l’abondance des recherches sur ce sujet, il n’existe toujours pas de vecteur efficace.
Le succès de la thérapie génique réside donc dans la capacité à transporter le gène dans la cellule cible et à obtenir un haut niveau d’expression. Il apparait alors nécessaire de concevoir un nouveau vecteur.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," sales of 400–500 panels for a single strategic partner within the first year. Based on our interviews, a price of € 10,000 per plate is adequate, corresponding to a turnover of € 4–5 million with a gross profit margin of about 97% without taking further investment costs for business development into account.
Within the total market for cell-based drug development, our target market is located in cells and tissues. This target market exhibits a total market volume of $ 100 million today and will grow to $ 300 million by 2019. Based on our interview, company B would be the first potential customer as soon as the results have been scientifically validated.
The competition is heterogeneous. Numerous indirect competitors act in the field of drug development by providing their customers with e.g. 2D cell cultures. Direct competitors are exclusively linked to the 3D cell culture area. Among these direct competitors, we consider Organovo to be our closest rival. Organovo also produces 3D bioprinting products for the pharmaceutical industry, but based on a significantly less powerful technology. Our printed tissues stand out by a significantly higher accuracy, stability and flexibility compared to competitors. In cooperation with the Technical University of Munich, a patent application is currently being considered.
We are seeking for an initial investment to overcome the high financial barrier that hinders market entry. Furthermore, we are interested in a network to acquire pilot customers and in an investor who is experienced in regulatory hurdles when entering the market in the pharmaceutical industry.
2. Product and Customer
The development of drugs by the pharmaceutical industry today is performed in different stages. Before drugs are eligible for testing in humans, they must be investigated by cell-based assays and animal experiments. During the first step of this pre-clinical stage, thousands of substances are screened for a desired effect and potential health risks that might disqualify them for market approval.
