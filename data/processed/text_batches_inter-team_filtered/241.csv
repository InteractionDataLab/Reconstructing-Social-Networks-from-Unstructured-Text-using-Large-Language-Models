USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," September 2016, and we had a meaningful communication with students of University of Science and Technology of China after meeting. We appreciated that the students of University of Science and Technology of China have assisted us to solve a problem in improving model. Not only because part of modeling in project not be able to continue if problem does not resolve, but we also obtained a new idea about modeling. Meanwhile, we sincerely hope that your team can get good resuts in IGEM contest.""

Collaborations with Team:USTC-Software
In this year, our IGEM team is in the need of a method to caculate the intensity of the green fluorescence produced by our device quantitatively. As it is convenient to communicate with the team in the same university as us, we consulted from USTC Software Team and applied their method to our data.
They provided us the code in Matlab and also explanation. We acquire the value of the intesity of green fluorescence in several steps: first, we reverse the contour figure, then, after we select only the bright part of the figure, we are able to caculate the average brightness of the illuinating area.
Figure 1. The Original Photo
Figure 2. Reverse the contour figure
Figure 3. Select only bright part of the figure and omit other parts
They helped us to convert the colours into the values that can compare with one another. We figured out ""The concentration of GFP - The temperature of heat shock standard curve"", so that we can predict the intensity of green fluorescence after giving a heat shock at a specific temperature for a period of time. Our    caculated results are consistent with the observed results well. Thanks to the USTC Software Team, we gained the satisfying results and came to the final conclusion we expected.

Astaxanthin is a kind of naturally-occurring keto-carotenoids which is found in some microalgaes, shrimps and crabs. This compound is insoluble in water while soluble in most of organic solvent like pyridine, ethanol and benzene. In fact, it is merely in some specific species of algaes, bacteria and yeasts that astaxanthin can be synthesized. It is impossible for animals to synthesize astaxanthins on their own so that the accumulation of astaxanthin in the body of animal is the consequence of diet. In some organisms, astaxanthin takes on a colour of brown or blue as it forms into some types of pigment-protein complexes. For humans, astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant with broad health implications. Thus, astaxanthin has been claimed a good commercial prospect for its value in medical and health care.
Currently, the industrial ways to produce astaxanthin are extract from microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis,Phaffia yeast,shrimp processing waste and chemical product.However these ways aren’t safety enough and the purification is difficult. While higher plants are supposed to be an efficient and safe bioreactor to produce astaxanthin,because it has advanced protein processing system to produce complex product, such as senior terpenoids. In nature, there are many precious products were terpenoid , such as carotenoids, microbial A, paclitaxel, etc. And in the low-level and annimal unable to synthesize some complex product.
Although higher plants such as Zea mays are capable to synthesize zeaxanthin, which is the metabolic precursor of astaxanthin, due to their lack ofβ- carotene ketolase, astaxanthin still can not be synthesized in these higher plants unless with the help of metabolism engineering.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," demonstrate computationally, how these could be used in simple devices such as NOT gates and novel collapsible AND gates (where once the output switches from 1 to 0, it cannot be switched back. Think of it as a fuse box, which melts if the input voltage goes higher than a certain point). This entire module was called the Basic Logic Assessment and Signaling Toolbox, or the BLAST Toolbox.
Having demonstrated these successfully, we moved ahead to our main aim, which was to engineer and demonstrate a square wave oscillator in E.coli. Square waves are commonly used in electrical circuits, and can have a wide array of applications in various areas in biology such as clock inputs for timing events, time dependent drug delivery, switching of metabolic pathways and shunt activation, and would also help understand variations of biological clocks such as the circadian clock, whose gene regulatory network still remains largely unknown. This has been discussed at length in the next section.
Figure – Comparison of a sine wave and a square wave. While both sinusoidal and square inputs are used in electrical engineering, the analogue of square waves in biological systems has not yet been reported. This largely limits the applications of oscillators to regions where a sine wave is required, since a proper, well characterized square wave oscillator has not been reported.

Overall, the sensitivity of parameters from trial and error is also low. The bi-stable is also shows great stability. However, we consider the value in AND Gate 2 is too extreme. Although this fact doesn't indicate that the circuit design is wrong or we can't finish the weblab project theoretically, we decided that it's very necessary to construct the circuit with T3 RNA polymerase.
With all necessities prepared, it's time to see the result !

Jun 7 ~ Jun 13, 2010 We find Antimony is a good way to translate SBML files into human readable form, so I read some documents on libsbml. Liao and I discussed on the project of PKU2009, we both agreed the simulation of it will be a tough job.
Jun 14 ~ Jun 20, 2010 I write a PPT on UI and give a draft of my design, the PPT focuses on input and output. The design of input seems pretty good, but we get stuck in output. How should we present the result to players? It is a hard question. We decide to add drag and drop features throughout the game to make it easier to use and play.
Shangyu Luo
Now we have two choices: developing the whole process of simulation and model by ourselves or learn from other existing software and utilize APIs as much as possible Start to learn some knowledge about SBML and libxml as we will use them as format of presentation and interaction.

Scientific Reproduction
We have made it our obligation to follow the virtue of scientific reproduction. It is fundamental for the scientific method and is integrated in the scientific community.
Science began when people started wondering about the significance of their observations. Aristotle was wondering why the stone fell down when he dropped it from midair. He therefore developed a hypothesis about the essences in all things, which explained that the stone was moving towards its natural place - that the stone had a teleos (Ancient Greek: purpose, aim). Nowadays we laugh at that type of explanations but the essence of science still stands: explaining our observations KLAUSEN, S. H. 2014. Hvad er videnskabsteori. Akademisk Forlag. .
Theories and hypotheses have virtues, which a good scientist should comply with, e.g.: to follow the rules of good reasoning, being coherent and explaining a phenomenon. A hypothesis or theory must always have implications that can be empirically tested for it to be of any use. To accept a hypothesis or theory one needs to show that it satisfies all demands - and then it needs to be tested by an objective scientist. This is called the demand of reproduction HEMPEL, C. G. 1966. Philosophy Of Natural Science. Foundations of Philosophy series. Princeton University. .
Confirmation and Bacto-Aid
In our project we tried to follow several other iGEM teams’ protocols and methods for our work. We had success following the protocols from the iGEM teams of Imperial College London 2013 , Tokyo Tech 2012 and Standford Brown 2015 . We used their protocols in the make of PHB and some of their BioBricks. We had trouble with following 2015 UCLA's protocols for producing spider silk. At first we believed we had falsified their method – we certainly believed that we could not corroborate their hypotheses. In the end of the project we found that the things that had gone wrong was not really related to their protocols, but the components we had used in the work. The enzyme we used were of a different type than the one used by 2015"
Virginia,2014,Team:Virginia#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," this survey will help to shape policy and education on synthetic biology on a global scale.
When giving out the survey, we handed out a pamphlet with information about our team and our project.  We also provided a link so that people could leave feedback about our project, or bring up any concerns they may have.
Engaging the Public: A Collaborative Discussion
In order to engage the local Charlottesville community and to extend our teaching out of the classroom and towards the general public, we hosted a Synthetic Biology Night on September 24th at OpenGrounds.  The OpenGrounds Corner Studio aims to connect institution with community, and this environment contributed to our collaboration which targeted both students from the University of Virginia as well as locals interested in science and synthetic biology.
The Panel
The event opened with a discussion of the ethical issues related to synthetic biology by three field experts, with the goal of informing the public and allaying any misconceptions about the topic.  Dr. Kozminski, a molecular cell biologist, provided scientific background on the field of synthetic biology and brought a scientific perspective to the discussion.  Dr. Arras, a professor in the bioethics department and member of President Obama’s Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, provided insight on ethical and religious groups’ perceptions of synthetic biology.  Professor Bagley of the UVA Law School, shed some light on the legal side of synthetic biology research, especially issues concerning the patenting of genes modified or created using synthetic biology methods. Check out our event program to learn more about the panelists . Panelists discussed a range of topics from the environmental release of bacteria to the proper regulation of synthetic biology research.  The conversation also touched on issues such as the labeling of synthetically produced products and the growth of DIY biology.  The first portion of the dialogue was moderated by a member of our team, but the audience was encouraged to join in the dialogue and provide questions for the second portion of the panel.  A reception followed the panel discussion, and attendees had a chance to chat with the panelists one on one, and to view posters submitted by local high schoolers (see below).

Current trends and methods in B. subtilis transformation were analyzed, with competency rates ranging from 104 to 107 transformants per microgram (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) . One method utilized xylose in conjunction with the pAX01-comK plasmid to overexpress the competency regulator gene, ComK, in B. subtilis and create ""supercompetent cells"" (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) . This yielded the highest transformation rate among the methods studied (Zhang & Zhang, 2013) .
Other members of our team developed the basis for a ""genetic circuit"" which could detect the DNA of pathogens upon uptake by a competent bacterial cell.
Week 4: May 20-23
Literature searches were conducted on the regulation of competence in B. subtilis. We contacted Dr. Zhang and requested the pAX01-comK plasmid, also making sure to ask if only certain strains of B. subtilis can be made supercompetent. Dr. Zhang stated that any 168 derivative strain could be made supercompetent and told us to request the necessary plasmid from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Centre. Further literature searches were conducted to find the best plasmids to induce competency in B. subtilis. A highly experienced B. subtilis researcher at the University of Calgary, Dr. Wong, was contacted in order to gain more information on B. subtilis and hopefully acquire a supercompetent B. subtilis strain.
Following the decision to use B. subtilis as the platform for our in-vivo diagnostic tool, we officially divided our team into two groups: the Transformers and the Detectives. The goal of the former is to facilitate high transformation rates in B. subtilis, while the goal of the latter is to develop and tweak the pathogen detection system.
Week 5: May 25-30
We attended the Alberta Innovates Technology Futures workshops hosted by geekStarter in order to learn more about policy & practices, presentation skills, current trends in synthetic biology, and 3D digital modelling. Speakers included Kelly Drinkwater of iGEM, Cesar Rodriguez of Autodesk, and David Lloyd of FredSense. Following the presentations, the speakers provided useful feedback on our project from both a scientific and human practices perspective. We also met the Lethbridge iGEM team and was introduced to their project.
Later in the week, we prepared overnight cultures and plasmid mini-preps for the parts required to assemble the genetic circuit. We also created antibiotic solutions"
BIT,2017,Team:BIT#HW2_-_-_TEXT.html," strands with lysine can get detached . Our intention to design the chamber as an oval is that the elongated structure can reduce the bubble generated by the difference in flow rate between the cavity wall and the middle stream.
  Chamber 2 is round( diameter:12mm) Within this chamber ,there are gel pillars(diameter: 0.5mm). The contents of the chamber are engineering bacteria frozen into dry powdery and trypsin. After the reaction in the chamber is carried out for a certain period of time, the mixed reaction of the culture medium and the reaction liquid flows from the upstream into the chamber under the negative pressure generated by the peristaltic pump (see the equipment section), the following reaction occurs:
  ①: Freeze-dried engineering bacteria’s recovery with the help of culture medium and constant temperature provided by the heating plate
  ②: Trypsin catalyzes cracking of DNA chain,lysine on the complementary strand falls into free small molecule
  ③: Lysine goes into the engineering bacteria, biochemical reaction within the engineering bacteria began.
  We can use the design of hardware to detect the reaction generated fluorescence generated in reaction③, and we can draw a conclusion through analyzing and processing.
Ⅱ.Materials
  The material we used to fabricate the chip is NOA 81.In normal conditions it’s in liquid state.It will solidify with exposure of 320nm to 380nm wavelength UV light.
  We made the chip using the material NOA 81. The material is normally liquid, and when subjected to UV light from the 320nm to 380nm band, the material is quickly cured to form a solid with good hardness and toughness. [4] According to this characteristic, we can use soft lithography method to achieve the production of the chip . The reason why we used NOA81 as the material of our chip is not just it’s UV curing characteristics, the light transmittance of this material is also taken into consideration. The transmittance provided by the manufacturer is shown in Figure 1.3. At the same time, we also designed a verification experiment for the light transmission of the chip(can be found in demonstrate section )
Ⅲ.Working Process
  Briefly,our chip went through following process between fabrication and finishing detection(shown in Figure 1.4):
  ①:Injecting magnetic beads to Chamber 1,then freeze-drying the liquid.
  ②:Injecting engineering bacteria to Chamber 2 ;then freeze-drying"

BaeI is a 38 pb site : it cuts two times at the 3’ extremity leaving 5pb protuberances. We used this restrictiction site among other things, because it doesn’t cut in the conjugative plasmids we use (pSW23T and pK18mob). It           requires the use of 2x33pb oligonucleotides as primers.

We warmly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money...  We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!).
To finish, a special thank to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered.  Indeed, if you had an administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays).  He know how to make everything ok in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, no one of our instructors worked on it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had question about B. subtilis.
We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness.
Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too : he brilliantly answered to our questions about B. subtilis.
We also thank Sarah Guiziou, ex-iGEMer, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi : Aspergillus brasiliensis and Chaetomium globusum.
We used them to test our SubtiTree system.
Other iGEM teams
Since several parts that we wanted to use was not in the iGEM kit plates, we asked iGEM teams to send us some parts :
Thanks to the iGEM Warsaw team, especially Radoslaw Stachowiak, for sending us the biobricks BBa_K780000 , BBa_K780001 , BBa_K780002 and BBa_K780003 .
Thanks to the iGEM Utah State team, especially Charles Miller, for sending us the biobrick BBa_K1162001 .

We visited Zarifeios Akadimia, a primary school                                                 in Alexandroupoli, in order to spark the                                                 students’ interest for science and introduce                                                 them to the concept of synthetic biology. As we                                                 wanted to actively include them in our                                                 activity, we used candy as an example of DNA’s                                                 structure and characteristics to construct an                                                 edible DNA helix. Different color candy standed                                                 for different nitrogenous bases, representing                                                 how complementarity works in the DNA. Each                                                 student built a different “DNA sequence” by                                                 selecting different colored candy. This is how                                                 we managed to explain that, in synthetic                                                 biology, scientists can design their own DNA                                                 sequences in order to achieve the desired                                                 result. In addition, the students, with our                                                 assistance, isolated DNA from bananas. This                                                 way, we displayed that the DNA is not an                                                 abstract concept, but it is a molecule of vital                                                 importance that exists in every living                                                 organism.

Student-Run Biology Workshop (SRBW) is a                                                 congress organized by students of the                                                 Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics                                                 from the Democritus University of Thrace,                                                 taking place in Alexandroupoli. The goal of the                                                 congress is to bring students from all over the                                                 country together, so that they can meet with                                                 colleagues from different universities, get                                                 hands-on experience and create presentations                                                 and talks about interesting scientific topics.                                                 So, we thought that the 3rd SRBW was an                                                 excellent chance for us to introduce Synthetic                                                 Biology to a crowd full of future scientists.                                                 We gave a speech about Synthetic Biology, its                                                 origins, tools and its vast number of applications.

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"iation of transcription requires an additional polypeptide known as a sigma factor.5 sigma factors are a family of relatively small proteins that can associate in a reversible way with the RNAP core enzyme. Together, the sigma factor and the RNAP core enzyme form an initiation-specific enzyme, the RNAP holoenzyme.
Figure 1 The initiation of transcription
The sigma factor directs RNA polymerase to a specific class of promoter sequences. Most bacterial species synthesize several different sigma factors that recognize different consensus sequences.6
This variety in sigma factors provides bacteria with the opportunity to maintain basal gene expression as well as for regulation of gene expression in response to altered environmental or developmental signals.
The frequency at which the RNAP holoenzyme initiates transcription, also known as the strength of a promoter, is influenced by the promoter sequences and the conformation of the DNA in the promoter region. The sigma factors recognize two conserved sequences in the promoter region, known as the promoter consensus sequences. sigma factors or fragments of sigma factors bind specifically to promoter DNA sequences and by specific base pair and amino acid substitutions in the promoter consensus sequences or sigma factors. Most bacterial species synthesize several different sigma factors which direct the RNAP holoenzyme to distinct classes of promoters with a different consensus sequences. This variety in sigma factors provides the bacterium with the opportunity to maintain basal gene expression as well as for regulation of gene expression in response to specific environmental stimuli.
The identification of bacterial promoters is an essential step in the elucidation of gene regulation.7
As a general rule, the more complex the life-cycle and environmental niche of a bacterium, the greater the number of sigma factors with corresponding promoter types. Typically however, the most common promoter type is that which regulates the housekeeping genes and the corresponding major sigma factor is shared by all bacteria (sigma 70 in the well studied E. coli, and its homologues in other species). The binding site for the sigma70-family of promoters is defined by two consensus hexamers, TTGACA and TATAAT, located at approximately −35 and −10, respectively relative to the transcript start site (TSS) and spaced 15–21 base pairs (bp) apart2. RNA polymerase core enzyme associates with the major sigma factor to form the holoenzyme which in turn binds to its cognate promoters to initiate transcription.

In prokaryotes, the minimum requirement for RNA polymerase binding is recognition of the promoter by the sigma factor. In general, prokaryotic RNA polymerases can"

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," study the two   states but only in separate cells. Thus, cloning the two mutant   versions of a desired phohoprotein (constitutive phosphorylation and   non-phosphorylatable) it would allow to study how this protein works   with any phosphorylation pattern and to have a reversible system   inside the same cell.
Application 3 – Gene therapy
It could be used as an expression system for genetic therapy. A usual vector would need the addition of the inducer for the whole life of the patient, which may cause health problems. This new approach allows that only one dose promotes the expression of the desired gene for a long time, leading to a reduction in the amount of inducer injected.
Application 4 – Biosensors
Also biosensors seem like a plausible application, changing the system so it responds to different inducers. Toxics substances or pollutants may be good targets for the development of new regulatory pathways.
Application 5 – Biological memories
In a long-term future, if synthetic biology continues its actual development, it is possible to imaging biologial memories that work like a flash memory (that is why our project was called Flash-bacter). To achieve that goal, the first step is to obtain very efficient flip-flops. After this, we have to think in a way to distinguish among different bacteria, that is, to be able to assign addresses to singular bits (ideally individual bacterium, or a given set of bacteria) and a way to write and erase the information only for a given address (bacteria). With the current development state of synthetic biology this still pertains to the theoretical realm, but we have the hope that some day the idea could become real. We want to make engineering with genes to create complex system and we are sure that is possible because nature does it.

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," manipulate single genes but even create new genomes. The foundation for a new field of biotechnology called synthetic biology was built. The results are comments like the following from Tom Knight of MIT: “The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It´s time for a rewrite”, which shows that mankind has not only the potential to create new forms of life in the future, it also has eventually the will to do so. So what exactly is synthetic biology? Synthetic biology is a relatively new science. The term was first stated in 1912 in a work of Stepháne Leduc but was not used for a long time. In 1974 the geneticist Waclaw Szybalski picked up the term as you will see in the following citation of his: “Up to now we are working on the descriptive phase of molecular biology. […] But the real challenge will start when we enter the synthetic biology phase of research in our field. We will then devise new control elements and add these new modules to the existing genomes or built up wholly new genomes”. If we look at todays technical standard it seems that we are now very close to what Szybaski has predicted 40 years ago. Even if today there exists no real new synthesised organism, due to a daily increasing collection of standardized biological modules (called BioBricks), which can realize special functions in a cell and can easily be combined for difficult tasks, like metabolic pathways, it is only a question of time until scientists will be able to built new organisms.  Synthetic biology today is persuing three different goals.  The first goal is based on an engineering approach by which BioBricks can be combined in living organisms like components in machines. The annually competition iGEM requests students all around the world to built new BioBricks, usable for technical applications. Synthetic biology therefore focuses more on the technical aspects than the traditional biological focus on theory. As described in the beginning, understandig is replaced by manipulation. The second goal of synthetic biology is to create artificial biomolecules and with this leave the field of life principles. With a creation of new forms of biosystems a new spectrum of new features which do not exist in nature or even the creation of new aminoacids or DNA bases arises. This divergence from nature brings about an era change in biology. The third goal is to create new genomes and maybe new organisms. Synthetic biology in this goal not only extends classical biotechnology and is not only an extreme genetechnic, due it is placed in contrast to existing technology because the spectum is much bigger. It is not only to manipulate"

Overview
Speaking of the education purpose, this year our team established ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests, or in acronym the iDPI. For this year’s iDPI, a Lab Open House Day was held welcoming the delegation from Shanghai Concordia International School. A series of hands-on tutorials as well as science popularization speeches were performed on the day. Approached by some of the visiting students who demonstrated strong interests in synthetic biology and the iGEM, our team members further assisted them to build up their first-ever high school iGEM team. With regards of the public engagement, our team conducted several questionnaires and communicated with the industrial community, the academic experts, and some authority in general. Besides, our team self desigened and made a movie to spread the idea of synthetic biology, especially to the young generations. Additionally, our team was invited by Shanghai Energy Conservation Association to participate Energy Conservation Week 2017 to demonstrate our project publicly, aiming at arousing people’s awareness of the energy issue.
Propagation of iGEM - iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI)
Aiming at spreading the iGEM as well as contributing to the local community, ShanghaiTech iGEM Day for Public Interests (iDPI) was found in 2016, along with the establishment of the first ever iGEM team at ShanghaiTech University. The iDPI at ShanghaiTech is set up to encourage every iGEM team to dedicate themselves not only into scientific researches, but also social practices. Sciences and technologies are used to serve people and the society; therefore the awareness to contribute to the social interests is of equal importance with the research explorations. In the acronym name iDPI, “D” stands for dedication, “P” stands for passion, and “I” stands for inspiration. Our hope is that with the establishment of iDPI, every iGEMer at ShanghaiTech would bear a strong social awareness in minds, to yield profound contributions and achieve social values.
This year, iDPI collaborated with Shanghai Coordinate International School, holding an iGEM Lab Open House Day on"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," eukaryotic RNAi, siRNAs are loaded to Argonaute proteins which carry out the repression, either by blocking mRNA translation or by degrading the mRNA (Siomi and Siomi, 2009). More detailed information on both possible siRNAs mechanisms is found here.
siRNA design
In order to achieve effective gene silencing or knock-down, the 19 nt binding sequence must be flanked by special, non-binding 5' and 3' extensions (Figure 1). To trigger mRNA degradation by RNase E, the 5’-terminal triphosphate of the siRNA needs to be converted to a monophosphate by RNA pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH). For the siRNA to be recognized by RppH, the 5’ end of the siRNA has to start with the tetranucleotide AGNN which is not allowed to match the targeted mRNA (Foley et al., 2015). At the 3’ end of the siRNA, the small MicC scaffold is added which facilitates the hybridization of siRNA and target mRNA and protects the siRNA from degradation (Na et al., 2013).
Figure 1: Effects of siRNA design on RNAi effectiveness and siRNA stability. A If the siRNA does not carry suitable 5' or 3' extensions, it is quickly degraded. B siRNAs extended by the tetranucleotide AGNN are recognized and processed by the pyrophosphohydrolase RppH. This enzyme converts the 5' triphosphate to a monophosphate which greatly reduces siRNA degradation. This allows the siRNA to hybridize to its target mRNA which in turn is degraded by RNAse E, thus leading to effective mRNA silencing. C Extending siRNAs with a 3' MicC scaffold in addition to the 5' tetranucleotide AGNN further enhances mRNA silencing. MicC facilitates the hybridization of siRNA and target mRNA and protects the siRNA from degradation.
In addition to degradation-based RNAi, siRNA can also be used to block mRNAs without degradation. This is achieved by adding the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) scaffold to the 5' end of the siRNA (Figure 2), enhancing its stability. In addition, the hybridization of the siRNA and the target mRNA can be facilitated by addition of MicC to the 3' terminus. Both sequence extensions are also part of our vector system, enabling efficient design and construction of effective siRNAs. If"

Current Methods and Research
In order to evaluate the need for our yeast pill in health care, we considered the most common detection and treatment  options for colon cancer available today. We also looked into current research. Based on our findings we concluded that there is a need for an easy and non-invasive method for colon cancer detection as well as more efficient treatment options. In this section, we have summarized the information that we found during our background search.
Detection
One of the most common methods for detecting colon cancer is colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive method that requires the patient to adapt food intake and to use laxatives prior to the examination (Simon, 2016). As an alternative to colonoscopy, the colon can be examined by x-ray with CT colonography. The colonography is semi-invasive but still requires the patient to prepare for the examination as for the colonoscopy (Simon, 2016).
Non-invasive detection methods where blood or abnormal DNA is detected in the stool are available. FOBT or fecal immunochemical tests can be used at home and detects hemoglobin in the stool (Simon, 2016). The drawbacks of these tests are that they have a low detection rate of precancerous lesions and that they can give false results as a consequence of diet (Simon, 2016). Multi-targeted stool DNA tests, mt-sDNA, that combines the detection of blood together with abnormal DNA has shown to have a higher sensitivity compared to FOBT and FIT (Simon, 2016).
To find non-invasive detection methods that are more specific and sensitive than those that are available today, research is put into the development of nanosensors. Nanosensors could for example detect volatile compounds that are indications of colon cancer in the breath (Peng et al., 2010) or urine (Arasaradnam et al., 2014). Since nanosensors only need a small amount of sample, they would be both fast and easy to use (Salvati, Stellacci, & Krol, 2015).
Another field of research revolves around the microbiota and its connection to the presence of cancer in the colon. It has been found that the relative abundance of species in the gut differs between healthy individuals and individuals with colon cancer (Zackular, Rogers, Ruffin, & Schloss, 2014). This could be exploited to detect this type of cancer in an early stage (Zackular et al., 2014).

Slovenia_HS,2015,Team:Slovenia HS#TeamSlovenia HS Practices.html_-_-_TEXT.html," 60 years of age, but we decided not  to be bound by the limitations of traditional media, and expanded our campaign to social media as  well, which is read mostly by our peers, but more and more by the rest of the public as well.  Most read was our facebook page (iGEM HS Slovenia), where we published weekly updates on our  project and interesting articles about advancements in synthetic biology we found as well as pictures  and anecdotes from the lab.  We also created a twitter account (iGEM HS Slovenia) and a web site for sponsors and other people  interested in the details of our work.
PRESENTING TO POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS
While presenting our project to the public is indeed very rewarding, we also found it important to  explain the benefits of synthetic biology to the people who hold the most power in our country, and  are therefore most able to make a difference quickly. We were fortunate enough to be able to  present our project to the highest officials in Slovenia.  Our team representatives attended the 2nd Conference of Young Researchers of Slovenia and  Students from Abroad and Slovenia, the honorary sponsor of which is the president of Slovenia,  Borut Pahor. Slika 3: Attending the conference at the presidential palace We were even prouder to be able to personally present the aim of our research to the prime minister  of Slovenia, Dr. Miro Cerar and to be able to talk to him about the future of science in Slovenia, the  involvement of students in research and about the importance of supporting the inspiring youth for  every country. We were overjoyed to see that the prime minister takes such sincere interest in areas  we are also passionate about and that he understands the importance support for the youth in  science can make. While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such interactions where  you can see what a difference you can make are very rewarding as well. Being able to open  someone's mind, but even more so when is the prime minister's mind, to the important issues of  science and of support for the young scientists is certainly a memorable experience. Slika 4: Presenting to the prime minister
ENGAGING THE YOUTH
As young people with great passion for science we found it very important to engage with other  young people.  Presenting synthetic biology to the young has the advantage that they were usually  not already influenced by the negative connotations the words genetic engineering bring with them  and are thus able to listen to us with open minds.

M01W04: The One With The Retrieval (22nd Jun – 28th Jun)
We began the wet lab work this week. BBa_F2620 was located on the Kit Plate and the lyophilized DNA sample was reconstituted in 20 µL sterile water. 2 µL     of DNA was used to transform competent cells (Escherichia coli DH5α) by the heat-shock method. The cells were plated on an LB agar (containing     chloramphenicol) plate and allowed to grow for 16 hours. At the end of that period, positive transformants could be seen as isolated colonies on the plate.     We picked one of these colonies and inoculated a primary culture with it.
After 12 hour incubation, the cell suspension was centrifuged and a mini-prep was done. The isolated DNA was run on an 8% agarose gel and viewed under UV     light using the GelDoc software.     The week ended with the timely arrival of our synthesized Gb3 mimic DNA from GenScript, Hong Kong. The construct was transported in a pUC57 plasmid     backbone.
M02W05: The One Where Everyone Is High (29th Jun – 5th July)
Since our insert had already arrived the previous week (Gb3 mimic in pUC57), the team was in high spirits to get the vector as well as insert ready for     ligation.
Vector: The plasmid vector was digested with EcoRI and PstI. We wanted to check the successful release of the promoter (pLuxR) from the vector on digestion     with these enzymes because the promoter was cloned in between the RE sites for these two enzymes. An agarose gel run confirmed the release of a 1061 bp DNA     element (pLuxR) from an approximately 2kb vector (pSB1C3).
Finally, sticky ends for ligation were generated in the vector by double digestion with SpeI and PstI. A gel run proved that, following which, the digested     vector was eluted from the gel.
Insert: Gb3 mimic DNA (lyophilized form) was reconstituted in 20 µL sterile water and 1 µL was used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. The cells were plated     on Ampicillin plates since pUC57 has ampicillin resistance.

University of Toronto
We were also mentored by the UToronto team, which provided advice on how to begin with a modeling effort for our team. Brayden and Fin gave direction on what items to start with. The first suggestion was a confirmation that our plan to study the kinetics of each of the enzymes was a reasonable place to start. This study would require both an estimation and/or literature search for each of the k values for each of the enzymes involved. Next, we discussed whether the loading/diffusion of phenazine shuttles was a limiting factor for the transfer of electrons between electrode and our engineered system. This aspect of our system could potentially be modeled using a random walk model of the electrons being transferred. Both these items could be used for our future work in modeling the MES system.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

ETHICS:
With the biological lighting system that we are creating, we have considered ethical issues that arise for Synthetic Biology where there are distinct advantages in our project, most notably: The dangers of gene technology (control of the system), the dangers of creating artificial life, intellectual property (IP) and gene patenting.
The Dangers of Creating Artificial Life and The Dangers of Gene Technology (Control of The System):
Major societal concerns with gene technology – including Synthetic Biology where there exists the potential to manipulate or create artificial life – is the occurrence of gene transfer that can potentially lead to contamination and genetic modification of foods, crops, animals and even humans. This involves issues with propagation, multiplication or increase by natural reproduction, of the recombinant organism or genetic circuit. Other concerns are that scientists are removing functions from cells in synthetic biology to build a machine and this cannot be controlled. Our project eliminates the specific risk of propagation, as cell-free systems are non-replicating and non-propagating. Because of the general “safe” view of cell-free systems, they are not currently legislated by the Australian Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. However, it should be stated there will always remain statistical probabilities of gene transfer from the cell-free chassis, and so we would argue cell-free systems should also be regulated in the same manner as other recombinant systems. Our project does not eliminate all risks of gene transfer but reduces the probability of this occurring.
There is a limited circuit life from a cell-free chassis dependent entirely on depletion of the essential components of the system. This creates a new level of control and hence a great reduction in the risks associated with gene technology; there is a greatly reduced probability of successful escape or gene transfer to the environment. Furthermore, for gene production to occur most readily, the gene must go into a vector or cell containing a T7 phage"

As well, regulation enforces monitoring water quality in the surrounding lakes, water streams, and ecologically sensitive areas. Present technologies for monitoring water quality in the oil sands are highly analytical, however they pose problems due to their expensive nature, requirements for highly trained personnel, sample processing time, and the need for materials to be transported to off-site facilities. There is a need for new technology in order to meet the growing need to monitor samples on-site in a rapid and cost-effective manner.
Our first target market is water monitoring related to the oil and gas industry. General toxicity sensing in oil and gas holds a market of up to $50 million dollars. Annual financial predictions based on similar competitive products suggest that FREDsense could reach annual revenue of up to $2,250,000 by capturing 30% of the Alberta market. With the growth in the number of monitoring sites, which are expected to more than double in the next two years, as well as the increased amount of green policy and legislation both at a governmental and industrial level, we see this as a growing market potential. Additionally, more specific sensors can be developed as second-generation products to meet any further industry needs within this market, expanding the market potential of this system and the potential profitability of our company.
Presently, detection is completed by expensive analytical machinery such as mass spectrometry. Portable biosensors systems do exist in this market, primarily marketed under the name MicroTox®. MicroTox® has established a powerful market presence, however it has numerous limitations due to its limited accuracy, expense, and sample limitations. We aim to partner with an end-user to be able to successfully compete in this market.
FREDsense is a product-based company with a revenue model consisting of the sale of the detection system and disposable cartridge units containing the test reagents. Recurring revenue is procured by selling individual cartridge units for each sample that needs to be analyzed, and different cartridge units will be developed for each type of sensor produced. Detector units will be sold independently of the cartridges, and a single detector will be usable for multiple samplings.
We have established a group of advisors and students with a firm foundation in science, chemistry, engineering, law, and business strategy. Our team consists of six biology/chemistry students, four professors, and three industry representatives with extensive experience. In our first year of operations, 2014, major milestones will include securing grant and private investment funding for research and development and a thorough market analysis. By year three we plan to secure one million in investment from venture"

Constructions of J04500 with hpaC, dszB, and katG-LAA were performed. Transformations were carried out at the end of the week.
Denitrogenation
The new stock of CarAa that we had PCRed from LD2 was sent for sequencing this week and came back as a match, so we have begun constructing a RBS site and a TetR promoter (J13002) in front of it. At this point all the Car genes have been successfully amplified, inserted into a biobrick plasmid, and sequence verified. We also continued to attempt to construct CarAc with an RBS site (B0034) in front of it, but had no success. On a better note, we confirmed this week that CarAd was mutated properly and we were also able to insert an RBS site in front of it. The next step for this gene will be to attempt a plasmid switch as it is currently in PSB1A3 and needs to be in PSB1C3 for submission to the parts registry. After sending a new batch of the Ant operon for sequencing we got the same confusing results as we did last week. We therefore hypothesized that our primers were annealing to a homologous region that is similar to the Ant genes and very close to CarAa. This means that we need to restart PCR on this gene as all of our current product is incorrect. The sequencing results for AmdA that came back this week were also somewhat confusing as they did not quite match the sequence we expected. However, they were a 100% match for the AmdA gene in a different strain of Rhodococcus erythropolis. This means that DSMZ probably sent us the wrong strain of bacteria and that we were very lucky that the primers we designed based off of the expected template actually worked to amplify a slightly different gene in another strain. The good news is that this new sequence contains no illegal cut sites, which explains why mutagenesis was not working (there was nothing to mutate) and allows us to immediately begin construction of J13002 in front of AmdA this week.

Week 19: Sept 29 - Oct 3
This week when we got the sequencing results back we discovered that the parts we thought had successfully been BioBricked were actually CjBlue , a chromoprotein, and not our synthesized constructs in the iGEM plasmid. We went back and realigned the sequences from other repressor ligations last week and it turns out that those samples were also CjBlue. We then went back and re-aligned the lacZ sequences that had been previously sent for sequencing and found that they too contained CjBlue. Thus, the mystery of the CjBlue began…
We started the process again by transforming more of our synthesized constructs into E. coli and mini-prepped those samples. To try to narrow down where CjBlue contamination was coming from we sent in all undigested mini-prepped samples of our synthesized constructs from this week and last week for sequencing. We also sent in our stock of mini-prepped vectors (used for plasmid switch our synthesized parts into) for sequencing to verify that these are RFP. and not the source of cj blue contamination. Once these results are back we will be one step closer to figuring out where the cj blue entered the picture. Our summer iGEM project was also presented at the University of Calgary BHSc research symposium. Finally, on Saturday, we went back to the cPCR agarose gels we ran last week, in which we chose colonies that we thought contained the correct construct in the iGEM plasmid. Looking back now it appears that these bands are a bit higher than they should be (~700bp). We decided to use the samples that were around ~500bp instead, even though we were expecting a bit higher than that. We made overnights of these samples and mini-prepped them and will be sending them in for sequencing to find out if we have successfully transformed the ligated product.
Week 20: Oct 6 - 10
We sent in the 43 samples for sequencing that we thought contained our BioBricks. The results indicated that the promoter, Pveg, was present in the plasmid, but the rest of the construct was not there. Unlike last time, these samples did not contain CjBlue. This week we made it through two cycles of digestion, ligation, and transformation of our parts.  The first round of digestion/ligation/transformation lead to 36 samples likely containing our parts. Samples were then sent in for sequencing. The"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," for transformation, while BL21-DE3 cells are better for protein expression. This led to the expression of SOX being placed under the control of a T7 promoter due to BL21-DE3 cells producing T7 polymerase after the addition of IPTG. Colonies indicated successful assembly, which was confirmed by creating plasmid DNA preparations of the colonies and performing confirmation digests to view on an agarose gel using the restriction enzymes Xba1 and Spe1 (Figure 4). During the initial design stage of the protein, parts of the sequence were lost between optimisation and sending it to be synthesised into a gBlock. This was not discovered until expression of SOX was induced by IPTG in BL21-DE3 cells and a sample analysed by SDS-Page gel electrophoresis (Figure 6). It was noticed that the band we were expecting was of a lower molecular weight than what it should have been; ~35kDa instead of ~42kDa. It was realised that the sequence in the PSB1C3 plasmid was different to the sequence origin. Therefore a new gBlock was synthesised using the proper sequence, a confirmation digest was performed to check for successful assembly (Figure 5), and an SDS-Page gel used to confirm that the protein expressed was of the correct molecular weight (Figure 7).
Figure 4: Restriction digest confirmation of first sarcosine oxidase assembly using Xba1 and Spe1 restriction enzymes.
Figure 5: Restriction digest confirmation of second sarcosine oxidase assembly using Xba1 and Spe1 restriction enzymes.
The plasmid DNA preps with the correctly assembled SOX gBlock present were then transformed into E. coli BL21-DE3 cells ready for testing.
Characterisation
To prepare SOX for testing, cell cultures were grown following this protocol to step 4. The protocol used for CFPS extract preparation was then followed. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis of the samples was done to check for SOX expression. 1 ml of each culture was lysed with lysozyme and incubated at room temperature before being boiled at 100°C for 10 minutes. 20 µl samples were loaded into each lane.  At this point, an error was spotted with the size of SOX on the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 6), as mentioned above.

Table 1.2 Countries and cars
Figure1.3 Rate of cars produced from different countries
Besides the quantity, we also did the analysis of the relationship between countries and average formaldehyde level of cars.
Figure1.4 Average level of formaldehyde in different groups.
From this graph we can know clearly that cars from different countries have diversity in the level of formaldehyde, so we may think it over before deciding which one to buy.
Conclusion
From this program we have finished, we can find that the basic vehicle - cars may have higher concentration of formaldehyde than we thought before (For the reason that nearly 30 percent of cars may have excessive level of formaldehyde). It alerts us that we should focus our attention on what we may ignore before, even the basic one around us. Through this program, teachers and our classmates have got access to our iGEM project, almost all of them participated in it happily and finally found what was ignored before. This is not only good for communication between teachers and students, but also can help more people to realize environmental problems in our daily life.  We feel sorry for that kits can only detect but not remove formaldehyde at the same time, if our iGEM project could come true, we can solve this problem easily. More than one teacher have shown their interest in our project of using E. coli to detect and remove formaldehyde at the same time, we will work harder and try all we can to make our dream come true!

Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," more vulnerable to esophageal cancer?
Nearly 90% of esophageal cancer patient are found in china. There’s also a featured geographical distribution of this disease. Most cases aggregate in area along the Taihang mountain, which covers provinces like Heibei, Heinan. There’re also some villages in Xinjiang and Sichuan where esophageal cancer is frequent. Through clinical observation, many esophageal cancer patients often drink really hot water or soup, and eat stimulating food. Drinking alcohol and smoking also contribute to high risk of esophageal cancer.
What are the current therapeutic tools of esophageal cancer?
Like most cancer, treatment of esophageal cancer mainly involves 3 methods, which are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. According to the patients’ situation, doctor will take one or a combination of these 3 methods. And the curative effect also varies with different patient.
How about chances that esophageal cancer can be completely cured?
That depends. We usually divide cancer into 4 stages according to the extent of cancer cell proliferation. In Stage I, during which cancer cells haven’t transferred, the 5-year survival rate can reach 70%. When it comes to Stage II, this number dramatically drops under 50%. And for Stage III and IV, it is 20% and 10% respectively.
Can esophageal cancer be easily diagnosed in early stage?
Currently there are two major approaches to test esophageal cancer. First one is CT (computed tomography), which can show the thicken area in the esophageal wall. Another one is doing gastroscope, which allows doctor to directly see the abnormity in esophageal and take sample for further examination. Though these two approaches have high accuracy, each of them has their own drawbacks. CT may bring radiation hazard. Doing gastroscope is a rather painful process, and it’s hard and expensive to book a painless gastroscopy. These drawbacks deter people from these checks when they don’t have any symptom. However, it’s usually too late when one can feel the lesion.
According to your observation during work, which stage does most patients in when they realize the disease?
It varies with individual, but according to my observation, most patients are sent here in Stage III or IV. Because the standard test approaches, as I’ve said before, are expensive, time-consuming and painful, most people won’t do these tests unless they feel really uncomfortable.
Are there any biomarkers for esophageal cancer that are currently in clinical application?
No. There are currently many researches focus on miRNA working as potential biomarkers for"

In the youthful stages of project design, we had researched the vast epidemiology of Leishmaniasis as a neglected tropical disease, and read into the Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva protein, LJM11, as a solid solution for immunisation against the disease. But we felt there were many questions which still needed to be answered before we could be sure that it is a worthwhile investment of both time and money;
Is our Limitless Lactis vaccination actually needed in the developing world? Is the disease as prevalent as we had read? How would it add to current available prevention/treatment and provide benefit to the population?
Is it something that the population will accept?
Would the regulatory bodies in afflicted regions approve of this therapeutic? What problems might be encountered?
Is there any way that we can improve our therapeutic design to make it more beneficial to these areas?
Outside of therapeutics, are there any other ways that we could combat the disease?
However, despite our extended efforts to find the answers to all of these questions by filtering the available online database, we couldn’t answer all of them. We were left frustrated. We soon realised that we were looking in the wrong places. These are real world questions which need real world answers. Leishmaniasis is a disease which resides primarily in the developing world, where the web is an underused resource. These answers weren’t all online, they lied in the people living on the soil of the affected areas. Thus, this realisation instigated the next step in our project - to reach out to those who live in the affected areas.
Following this bold decision, we needed to gather as much information as possible on the current global climate of the disease before choosing a location to explore. To do this, we had a Skype session with one of the key Leishmaniasis researchers worldwide, Dr. Alvaro Acosta - a parasitologist from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. We set out to learn the main global problems associated with the epidemiology and management of the disease.
We learned that as Leish"

Results:
The gel returned large smears in each lane containing sample DNA rather than distinct bands. This confirmed the presence of DNA, but did not allow for any identification. The ladder did work indicating that the gel was run correctly and the problem instead lay in either the preparation of the samples, the PCR, or the transformation itself.
Products:
The following gel was produced.
Next:
Troubleshooting of the smear problem and repeat gels will be run using alternate methods in order to identify and isolate the desired sequence.

Modeling Details of Repressilator
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

He is currently the Director of Interdisciplinary Programs Office. His research work spans a broad spectrum of biological                             sciences, with many different interdisciplinary collaboration. He has been engaged in iGEM activities                             for the past 9 years and sees it a very effective way of vertically integrating education while                             training our critical thinking skills. When we're facing problems, he encourages us to explore                             by ourselves rather than directly telling us the solution.

Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues regarding researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our Labwork is constantly overseen by Ph.D. students,  postdocs, and professors of our institute, the Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry. All of them are very experienced in laboratory work, with expertise from genetics over molecular biology to structural biology. To ensure replicability, we document all of our work in our laboratory notebook. Our Team follows widely used laboratory protocols in an appropriate laboratory facility (biosafety level 1 laboratory, S1), as requested by German law (""Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (GenTG),"" German Gene Technology Law and “Verordnung über die Sicherheitsstufen und Sicherheitsmaßnahmen bei gentechnischen Arbeiten in gentechnischen Anlagen (GenTSV)”, Genetic Technology Safety Regulations Act) to guarantee the safety of the researchers and the public.
The participation in regular meetings about laboratory safety is an essential element of the education at the University of Tuebingen. Additionally, all of our lab members were specially instructed about biosafety. The organisms used in our project, namely Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus Johnsonii, are not only well-known and considered safe, they even occur naturally in the human intestine. Due to the absence of any pathogenic, toxigenic, or colonizing activities in the organisms and the harmless nature of our parts, there are no safety concerns during our work. Furthermore, the transformed Lactobacillus is nonviable outside a fructose-rich medium,  which is another convincing fact regarding the absence of security concerns. In the case of success with the Lactobacillus, we would have tested our system with fructose-int"

Degradation Module
Team ITB_Indonesia tries to make a module to degrade PET. We use LC-Cutinase fused with ompA and Lpp signal sequence. LC-Cutinase will break the ester bonds on PET structure through esterase activity of the enzyme and generate ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid as product. We plan to expose this enzyme on the surface membrane of bacteria thus making the enzyme immobile and more thermostable. On the other hand, PET which has high molecular mass can be degraded directly without need to pass through bacteria cell membrane. This molecular machine then named as whole cell biocatalyst.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Ethics macro_-_-_TEXT.html," regulations (legal framework and enforcement) of genetic engineering techniques therefore are much more logical to be discussed by the parties that in some way or another are in contact with this technology.  This is in great contrast with synthetic biology. The term “synthetic” probably makes people perceive that the connection with “life” and autonomy of life is, perhaps partially, already lost. With increasing levels of artificialness (irrespective of where the frame of “naturalness” ends) it may therefore seem that more is allowed in terms of use of recombinant DNA techniques, than was the case in metabolic engineering with “genetic modification”.  It seems that just this difference in terminology may have important consequences for the public appreciation of the technology, while in fact, synthetic engineering can be considered “worse” from a technical point of view in terms changing DNA and respecting life and living organisms’ quintessence; it seems that under the banner of synthetic biology, more may be allowed, while forgetting about the ethical issues raised in the previous paragraph.
But nonetheless, before it was argued that currently, synthetic biology and metabolic engineering are not that different. This should also mean that the ethical issues related to genetic engineering should be considered in synthetic biology and should not omitted or forgotten. Indeed, synthetic biology gives rise to new ethical issues that need to be considered, like the afore mentioned moral issues related to biosafety, biosecurity, intellectual property and artificial life. Papers and reports focussing on the ethics of synthetic biology focus on these new issues, but most of them do not elaborate on ethical issues of genetic engineering in general, like mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph.
3.6 The media: a PR stunt or time for a public backlash?
In a different approach, one may also argue that in synthetic biology, the application and related processes within an organism are in the centre of attention, while in metabolic engineering the technology and the organism itself play a more prominent role. This implies that the designer approach of synthetic biology, possibly together with the constructive excitement of this new approach may make synthetic biology appeal more to the public and therefore my be more appreciated by the public.  But this is not how synthetic biology is presented in the media. A quick survey on the news paper websites of the BBC, NY Times, Daily Mail and the Guardian, with search term “synthetic biology”, yields a number of articles, which do not put synthetic biology in a particularly good (or bad) perspective:
Synthetic life 'no terror threat' – “Synthetic biology can help in the fight against emerging infections, rather than aid the design of bioweapons"

Outpixel [#]
Size of the output square pictures, can be used to cut the center part of the reconstructed images
In our experiment we used cell phone flash light attached with a 5 micrometer pinhole, which makes it a point source. Unlike the collimated source, the pixel spacing at the reconstructed wavefront can be chosen arbitrarily due to the magnification of the emanating spherical wave. The “Spacing” and “Magnification” parameter are relative and reversely proportional, the higher the magnification, the smaller the pixel spacing, thus the higher the resolution in the reconstructed images. When the reconstructed image has less pixels than the specified “Outpixel[#]”, the whole images will be displayed in “Reconstructed Images”, otherwise the images will be cut from the center [15] .
Next, select “Point Source” tab, “Open Background” to import the background image, such that the recorded hologram with the sample object and the same background, would be able to subtract the background noise for a better reconstructed visualization. In addition, more than one background image can be imported, whereas the average is taken for better estimation. Then, “Load Sample” loads the recorded hologram of the sample object, then “Reconstruct” ignites the calculation, a stack of “Reconstructed Images” will be shown in the window, where you can move the slide bar through the stack, as well as zoom in by rolling your mouse.
Essentially the algorithm in HoloPy functions as a digital lens, taking pictures at different depths, or cross-section slicing images of the sample object, which contains the 3D information of the object. Next “Save holograms as”, where all reconstructed images will be named and saved in sequence in the specified folder, clicking now on “Show 3D Object”, a subprocess in python would trigger the software Fiji, passing command arguments converting images to stack, invoking the 3D Viewer plug-in, thus visualizing the stack images as one 3D object.
If the reconstructed images is not yet optimal due to parameters tuning, or when we simply want to compare different reconstructed images, we can “Set Reference Pic”, so that the current displayed image in “Reconstructed Images” window will be shown in the “Reference Reconstruction"

Sensitivity to antibiotics
After having succeeded to make our bacteria grow, we tested their resistance to different antibiotics. Knowing their resistance to antibiotics is very important because it will allow us to finalize protocols of selection after transformation.
We chose to test the most commonly used antibiotics. We included the three antibiotics used in iGEM (kanamycin, chloramphenicol and ampicilin), plus the erythromycin and the tetracyclin. We chose the erythromycin to test a conjugation protocol which required this antibiotic for E.coli, and we chose to test tetracyclin because it is quite often used for inducible systems.
Table3: Concentrations tested for each antibiotic
We tested several concentrations of each antibiotics (cf: Table3), and we added a supplementary concentration for erythromycin because it is known to be ineffective on GRAM- bacteria.
The sensitivity tests were performed in four different conditions (cf: Figure3). We tested on Marine Broth (MB) 1X plates, MB 0.5X plates (used for conjugation) and M9-CASA 1X (+3% NaCl). We also tested in liquid M9-CASA 1X (+3% NaCl) to have a test in liquid culture, unfortunately we cannot measure the optical density with the MB medium because of its opacity.
The cells' sensitivity was measured for Pseudovibrio denitrificans, E. coli, and different clones of E. coli transformed with plasmids and carrying an acquired resistance AmpR, KanR, CamR ou ErmR.
Figure3: Protocol of antibiotics' tests on Pseudovibrio denitrificans.
We let all the media incubating at 30°C (with shaking for liquid cultures), and they have been checked at day 1, day 2 and day 3.    In the following figures, find the results obtained after three days of cultures on plates and one day of liquid cultures.

Growing Biofilms
Reliably growing biofilms covering the whole surface of the conducting glass plates we were using for our solar cells was a major challenge during the course of our project. Biofilms grow best in semi-dry environments and while protocols for growing biofilms are abundant in literature, most of them are either not meant for covering greater areas than a well in a 96 well plate or they require rather complicated setups. Both these kinds of protocols were not attractive to us, as we wanted a quick and easy method to cover the entire substrate area with biofilm. Initially, we attempted to grow the films in petri dishes on a rotary shaker. We filled the dishes with medium just enough to barely cover the glass plates and hoped that the circular motion would cause the medium to slosh onto and off the glass, thus create alternating wet and dry conditions, thus enabling the film to grow. Unfortunately, this approach was hindered by the water evaporating overnight and accumulating on the underside of the lid, which resulted in a permanently dry glass surface – not an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.
In the end, we switched to a rocking seesaw shaker. This way, the medium containing the bacteria was sloshed from one side of the dish to the other, on the way flowing across the glass surfaces. This yielded adequate biofilms for our purposes.

Binding of inorganic material
The second part of our project is binding of inorganic nanostructures, such as zinc oxide or cadmium sulfide to the biofilm. We used a modified CsgA, which is a subunit of Curli fibers.

For flow cytometry, both LB medium with 50 µg/mL ampicillin and M9 medium with 100 µg/mL ampicillin were used. Excitation of RFP was at 561 nm, and emission was measured around 580 nm.
The images obtained by fluorescence microscopy, which are given in Figure 1, revealed that the weak promoter, BBa_J23114 , presented high variability in the expression of RFP between cells, indicating a high level of noise. Contrarily, RFP expression was more uniform in the bacterial cells containing the medium promoter Bba_J23106 . Similarly, another medium strength promoter BBa_J23110 , showed uniform level of RFP expression, although less consistent than the observed for BBa_J23106 . Expectedly, the strong promoter, BBa_J23102 exhibited high RFP expression in cells and a low level of noise was observed.
Figure 1. Fluorescence microscopy of RFP under the regulation of four members of the Anderson promoter collection, ( BBa_J23114 , BBa_J23110 , BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23102 ) on pSB1A2 in E. coli MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5. BBa_J23114 displayed a low and noisy expression of RFP, whereas both BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23110 showed a more uniform expression of medium intensity. The strongest promoter, BBa_J23102, exhibited a high level of consistent RFP expression
The noise levels observed by fluorescence microscopy led to the design of an experiment, by which the cell population could be quantitatively studied. The change in expression levels and noise during growth of cell populations were tested for the weak and strong constitutive promoters, for which flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of the RFP reporter system. First, the cell populations were studied in LB media with 50 µg/mL ampicillin, thereby maintaining similar conditions as for the fluorescence microscopy experiment. All cultures were prepared from overnight cultures, obtaining a starting OD600=0.005.

Genomic DNA of cultured Plasmodia
Our primers were first established with synthetic DNA templates. Apart from that we urged to figure out if our primers work for the detection of real Plasmodium DNA. We did not want to work with the parasite itself to exclude the risk of infection. This is why we reached out to laboratories who work with cultured Plasmodium who could provide us extracted DNA that we could use for our experiments. This led to collaborations with the Center of Infectiology and Parasitology in Heidelberg (AG Portugal) and the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Tuebingen (AG Kreidenweiss) who provided us genomic DNA of their cultured Plasmodium strains."

Figure 5. Ink solutions prepared from acetone and water extractions of cranberry and lutein tablets. Guar gum was added to the solutions to a final concentration of 0.5% and allowed to set. Water based inks became thick and more opaque than the acetone based inks. Guar gum precipitated in the acetone based inks.
Finally, used a syringe to draw a line with each ink across Whatman paper (Figure 6). The acetone based inks were more prone to bleeding than the water based inks. The water extraction of the cranberry tablets yielded a more vibrant colour on paper than the acetone extraction, and the water extraction of lutein/zeaxanthin was more uniform in colour an darker than the acetone extraction.
Figure 6. Demonstration of the inks application to Whatman paper.
Using the ink in old fountain pens was attempted, but we found contamination with previously used ink in the pens were interfering with our results. The creation of our ink for use in fountain pens does not need to be as precise in terms of viscosity as it would need to be for printers. This is because there are no mechanical or moving parts or significant movement of ink within the pen, all we need is for the ink to be able to come out while keeping the amount of solvent as low as possible to prevent bleeding of the ink. This allows us to just attempt a few proportions of pigment, resin, and solvent for the pens."

Preparing media & Electrocompetent E. coli cells
At the beginning, we had to prepare LB medium including 5g/L yeast extract, 10g/L trypton and 10g/L sodium chloride, as well as, agar plates using a premixed agar from Invitrogen. Ampicillin was added in a concentration of 10mg/ml for selective reasons.
During the first week we were also preparing electrocompetent Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MR Rec A+ cells for further transformations. First of all, the strain was provided by our department at TU Graz. After doing ONCs by picking a single colony, we prepared a so called “main culture” and let the cells grow up to an OD600 of 0.8.

To test our electrocompetent cells we performed a transformation using a provided vector. In the first attempt 40 µl of ECC (electro competent cells) and 2 µl of vector DNA were used. The results showed, as we excepted, a non-countable number of cells on the plate.
The gBlocks from IDT were resolved in 50 µl ddH2O. After that, every single gBlock was cloned into a pJET-Vector and transformed into ECC using the „CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit: Blunt-End Cloning Protocol“.

Nanoencapsulation
Chromoproteins
Improvement of nanoencapsulation protocol with low molecular weight chitosan and sodium                 tripolyphosphate (TPP)
The main objective of nanoencapsulation was to create an efficient vehicle for protein delivery. In                 order to attain this, we applied the nanoencapsulation protocol from iGEM TAS Taipei 2016 and produced                 a smaller nanoparticle with an approximate size of ~27 nm. The creation of smaller particles yields a                 higher internalization rate of several drugs, which acts inside the cell, rather than on the surface                 receptors, small nanoparticles ( < 39 nm) are able to pass through the nuclear pore complexes via                 passive                 diffusion and have a higher endocytosis rate. Nuclear target nanoparticles are an example of such a                 design. (Tamman, 2015)
We assessed the fact that during encapsulation pH may need a                 modification to optimize the interaction between chitosan and proteins, shifting the encapsulation                 efficiency. A troubleshoot was applied for this protocol to work better with any protein, as pH 5.5                 is not a universal ideal condition. The reason behind this is that chitosan is positively charged                 when dissolved in an acidic environment, and proteins with low isoelectric value are better                 encapsulated at a pH greater than the pI value, favoring the interaction between negatively charged                 proteins and chitosan. Therefore, before encapsulating any protein, the pI has to be consulted to                 adjust the chitosan solution pH, so that pI < pH < 6.5 as an ideal condition, though not all                 proteins                 will meet such constraint (Gan and Wang, 2007). Our improvement proposal is demonstrated by the                 encapsulation of a standard protein that meets this suggested condition.
The employed red                 fluorescent protein (BBa_J04450) has an isoelectric point of around 5.6.                 The characterization of RFP encapsulation was made under the following conditions as stated by                 TAS Taipei 2016: pH of 4 to avoid chitosan aggregation and solution concentrations of 3 mg/mL                 chitosan and 1 mg/mL TPP.

COLLABORATIONS
One of the core value and spirit of iGEM is working together with other teams to solve problems and share resources. As such, we did our best to extend a helping hand when needed.
Team UGA-Georgia (University of Georgia)
UGA iGEM has asked us to help in their effort to characterize archaeal ribosome binding sites by measuring the expression of mCherry in their sample as a proxy for RBS activity. As such, we measured the fluorescence and protein concentration of 30 samples (triplets of 10) at an excitation wavelength of 590nm and emission of 645nm and at OD280, respectively.

Team Genspace
Genspace iGEM members were having trouble with a quorum-sensing related promoter that was controlling the expression of red fluorescent protein (RFP). The RFP was meant to only be expressed when a threshold cell density was met, but was being expressed below this threshold. As a result, we suggested that they had their construct's base RFP expression level measured via our fluorometer and how this compared to fluorescence levels after the threshold density was met to better characterize what was going on with their part. Since Genspace is a community biolab that is not as well-equipped as an institutional laboratory such as ours, we offered help by means of equipment that we are more fortunate to have.

UC_San_Diego,2015,Team:UC San Diego#Modeling#Constraint_-_-_TEXT.html," important constraint is the objective function. The COBRA Toolbox allows us to maximize or minimize the flux through certain reactions of interest1. For instance, setting the objective to biomass production allows us to predict the growth rate of a yeast cell once it reaches steady-state. For our purposes, maximizing the flux through the light reaction was set as the main objective.
Results
In both models, we first defined a minimum media to mimic experimental conditions. The components of Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) were listed and linked to exchange reactions in both the v7 and the BIGG model. Exchange reactions are defined to describe the metabolite composition in the immediate surroundings of the cell. The upper and lower bounds for all other exchange reactions were then set to ‘0’.
Once the Lux reactions were inserted into both models, we analyzed the metabolic burden on the cell using a two-step process. First, we ran the built-in COBRA function robustnessAnalysis. This function plots the flux through a pathway against the flux through the optimized pathway1. In this case, the flux through the light pathway was negatively correlated with the flux through the growth pathway. We concluded that this result could only have been obtained if the light pathway was redirecting a metabolite that would normally have lent itself to growth.
Figure 2. Flux through light on the y-axis and flux through growth on the x-axis.
To confirm this hypothesis, we needed to identify which reactions in the native genome were coupled to light. We developed a script that set light as the objective function, and then constrained growth in increments until it reached its max value. At each growth value, we took the vector of all the fluxes through every reaction. In the end, each reaction fell into one of four categories: incr, decr, zero, and neither. In incr, we had a list of reactions strongly coupled to growth. The flux through these reactions increased at every point that growth increased. Likewise, in decr, we held a list of reactions strongly coupled to light. In zero, we stored a list of reactions that were uncoupled to growth and light. In neither, we stored reactions, whose flux varied with no discernible pattern.
Figure 3. Reactions coupled with light and their respective subsystems.
The BiGG model returned 34 reactions that were strongly coupled to light and the v7 model returned 56 reactions. The transport reactions in this category were then removed to better ascertain which subsystems (Glycolysis, Citric Acid cycle etc.) these reactions belonged to4,5. The diagram below traces the light pathway to"

Often times people confuse Shanthi’s last name with “Hedge.” Perhaps because she is constantly living on the h-edge. Although its unknown if Shanthi spends her spare time pruning hedges, she can be deemed as the marketing mastermind making sure that there are no rough “h-edges” in our project. Being truly the most creative and artistic mind in the room, you can always rely on Shanthi to create amazing pitch videos, eye-catching flyers, and choose the perfect colors. Truly blessed in the realm of arts, Shanthi is a skilled oboe and piano player. As a girl scout, Shanthi is one with nature, so much so that she argues that rocks are biotic and hugs trees in her free time. Shanthi defines kindness as she is always looking out for her fellow team mates and shows so much compassion to everyone around her. But I must warn you, to never ever commit a crime, because Shanthi’s love for forensic science makes her the most skilled Canadian spy ever. She is obsessed with herbal tea and Celtic woman, an Irish band group she aspires to play oboe for. As I told you before she is truly Shanthi “livin on the h-edge” Hegde.
MEGAN HONG
Hi! This is my second year on the iGEM team. From spending countless hours in the lab to meeting new people with different ideas and backgrounds, I can say without a doubt that being a part of the iGEM community has been one of the best experiences of my life. Outside of the science hallway at Lambert, you can find me playing soccer, trying to master new viola pieces, and reading anything I can find. Can’t wait to meet everyone and learn about all the interesting projects at Giant Jamboree!

Through the intense competition that is school and life, there is one person who truly does what they want because they enjoy it. His name: Sahil Jain. Almost every quality about him makes you rethink how your life as he does everything in his life genuinely. His aspirations are diverse and constantly changing because he constantly ranks at the top in anything and everything he does. The most admirable quality about him is that he isn’t affected by what other people think of him, making him a very unique person to work within which he is always thinking of new ideas. This is reinforced by his career aspirations which are currently unknown. Sahil loves 3D Printing, coding, puns, and nihilistic humor. In the end, one"
