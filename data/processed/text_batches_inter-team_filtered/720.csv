One of the colonies for construct 11 showed the correct band size, so it was sent for sequencing, but the part was 100bp of the Blac gene. We transformed constructs 9, 10 and 11 from GenScript in pSB1C3 again. Colony PCR showed some positive results for construct 9 and 11.
We also did a gel shift assay to test the binding of TALE A to its target site. We tried different concentrations for TALE A + [A] and we picked two of those to run TALE A + [B]. However, the concentrations of protein were too high. We will repeat the assay next week if lower concentrations of TALE.
Week 21: September 16 - September 20
This week, we did  plasmid prep and verification digest of constructs 9 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE B -link-Kcoil) and 11 ( pSB1C3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac). We have some good results for construct 11, so we did overnight of those, plasmid purification and submitted it to Parts Registry along with our other constructs.
We also repeated the gel shift assay, this time with TALE A and TALE B . The concentration range was from 0.1ng/uL of protein to 40ng/uL. Because Red Safe, which we used for staining the DNA, is not very sensitive we loaded higher amounts of DNA recommended and the gel revealed nonspecific binding by the TALES. We repeated the assay and this time we added chromosomal DNA to prevent nonspecific binding. We also added the recommend amount of DNA (55pM) and stained the gel after it ran with SYBR Green. This time, we were not able to see any bands at all.
We transformed construct 11 into E. coli BL21, cultured the colonies, induced them with IPTG and purified the protein. We performed Bradford Assay on our samples and the concentration range was between 0.20 and 1.06mg/mL. We ran these samples on a 7.5% SDS page gel.
Because construct 11 has Blac on it, we cultured the cells in ampicillin too as beta-lactamase provides resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics The medium density increased suggesting that beta-lactamase was functional in our construct.

Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry. Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.
The spectacular success of the metabolic engineering field eminently shows the defect in this paradigm. Successful engineering of model organisms is based on using chemical kinetics and metabolic networks, where metabolite flux is directed by both gene up-regulation and deletion. (Insert examples here...)
Since deletions from a cell's genome is another means to engineering the cell as a system, we have also characterized the biofilm response of a set of knockout E. coli. Unfortunately, these systems cannot be submitted to the biobrick registry because they do not conform to the Biobrick paradigm, an issue we hope that the iGEM competition can address.

When done  properly, the ligation will result in a successful combination of the insert  and plasmid into one plasmid.Based on the digestion of mutant-pSB1A3-GR, terminator DNA fragments,ligation can  be done. We ligate mutant-pSB1A3-GR  vector and sticky terminator DNA fragments to construct an new plasmid  mutant-pSB1A3-GR-t.By  detecting the quantities of GFP and RFP, terminator efficiency can be  calculated.
1.  Prepare the control  reaction as indicated below:
Total: 10μl
+ 1.0μl of plasmid mutant-pSB1A3  (NA)
+ 6.0μl of terminator
+ 2.0μl of T4  DNA Ligase , #EL0011
+ 1.0μl of 10XT4  Ligase buffer
2.  Put  the tubes in 22℃ water bath, react for 8-12 hours.
Bacteria  transformation
Transform the ligation products into  the DH-5α competent cells, put the plate on 37℃ gas bath for 12-16  hours.
Cultivate the Bacteria
According to the results of the   PCR detection, we choose positive colonies and  transfer them to 5ml LB liquid media ( 5μl of ampicillin has added)  stored in 12.5ml centrifuge tubes. Put the  centrifuge tubes in 37℃ gas bath  overnight.
Flow Cytometer Analysis
Flow cytometry is a laser based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them by an electronic detection apparatus. It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second.
Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength, and the emission spectra often overlap. Consequently, the combination of labels which can be used depends on the wavelength of the lamp(s) or laser(s) used to excite the fluorochromes and on the detectors available. It is practical that the expression of RFP and GFP can be measured at the same time.

If bio-reconstruction is used, it is desirable to ensure its controllability when used in large areas. Besides, before the product is put into use, it should be verified at the cell level and the organization level to ensure that the organisms other than mites are not damaged. In addition, as a biological product, it is necessary to consider the benefit problem, and under high-efficiency conditions, the cost needs to be controlled.
The interview of Professor Wang Zhongkang
Q: How does your company guarantee the safety of the products after the production of the Metarhizium-related products?
A: Because the Metarhizium used in our products is wild-type Metarhizium from nature, even if it leaks during transportation, it has no effect on the environment. Our products are very friendly to the environment.
Q: We have learnt from the paper that Metarhizium will degenerate in the process of fermentation production, resulting in poor product quality. How can this problem be solved?
A: In the production process of our company, there is generally no such problem, because Metarhizium usually degenerates after more than 25 generations of reproduction. However, in the fermentation production process of our entire product, it will not experience so many generations of reproduction, so there will be no degradation.
Q: We are planning to use spores inside the oil to inflect cockroaches. Do you have any suggestions for our choice of formulation?
A: First, I think that oil spores are inconvenient to transpor, and secondly, it is also inconvenient to use. I suggest that you use a emulsifiable powder on a non-woven fabric, which is much more convenient. And the shelf life of the emulsifiable powder machine is much longer than the oil spores.
Q: During the process of infecting the experiment, we got some insects batryticatus. Could you identify if it is covered by the outside.
A: According to the spore morphology covered by the appearance of your worm, I think it may be a mixed spore of Metarhizium and Aspergillus. Based on our previous experimental experience, I suggest that you try to mix Metarhizium and Aspergillus to infect cockroaches. Aspergillus has a very strong penetrating effect on the epidermis. When mixed, Aspergillus penetrates the epidermis, and then the fungus can invade the corpus callosum.
Q:"
Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," risks from the ethical hazards. Continue on a separate sheet if necessary.
Inform - State here the information (relevant policy/code of practice/local rules or local, local rules), instruction & training that will be provided to the researchers and if necessary the public on the hazards and control measures.
Review - State whether this ethical hazard needs review after a certain time. Remember to review this assessment at least annually and more often if there is a material change to the work which may affect this risk assessment.
Risk – Scale of 1-5
Ethical impact – Scale of 1-5
Severity - The product of impact and risk - i.e. Risk (1-5) x Ethical Impact (1-5). Depending on this score, review whether action is needed for the ethical concern in question. Use the table below to determine this.
1) Economic implications
Synthetic biology has the potential to create an abundance of new industries and jobs, however in the process of doing so can cause current industries, companies and/or jobs to become redundant. This can result in a sharp increase in unemployment which can be made worse by the fact that these people may have a very specific skill set and thus need retraining.
Identify – Could your research cause job loss? Could it cause a current industry to be made redundant? Is the funding source kosher?
Control - Not particularly that relevant for this section; however consider possible solutions or preventative procedures that one could implement
Inform – Not normally relevant for this section
Review - This could be quite important, could need to review after the research has been conducted to check on the economic impact
2) Legal implications
Patent law is an extremely crucial part of scientific research and development. It is important to assess whether you are illegally using other people’s work/products and consider when it is appropriate to ask for permission. It is also important to consider the implications of potentially patenting your final research, for example patenting a vaccine could result in it saving a lot less lives. This section can also be used to consider dealing with illegal substances such as drugs as part of one’s research.
Identify – Are you defying current patent laws? Have you carried out research into the legality of your product? Could your research result in a need for new laws/regulation? Are you using any illegal substances as part of your research?
Control – Do you need special permissions? How can you be careful with illegal substances?
Inform – Do you need to inform someone who owns the intellectual property
Review - This could be quite important, could need to review after the research has been conducted to check if a patent is needed

Until the beginning of the 50's there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.                                 World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical                                  standards.
As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues. The federal government                                 As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues. The federal government in the USA and the                                 European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations. In order to                                  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRB is an                                 institute that exist in every academic establishment or research institute and function to implement regulations regarding                                  research ethics.
Judaism Bioethical principals
Learning about bioethical issues, we continued to explore the history of bioethics. We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the                                  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish                                 medical ethics. In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics. We discussed ethical issues                                  concerning new technology, including synthetic biology.
In his paper, ""Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View”, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as                                 well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: ""Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God                                 and encourages research for the benefit of humankind. Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards                                 the current goals of synthetic biology. But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and                                  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy"".
The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that the                                  role of people is to maintain and take care of the world. The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches                                  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the 'Bal Tashchit' (""do not destroy"") commend. The commend orders men not to waste                                 or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary. Many hold the view that                                  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care                                  for God's creation. However, humans are regarded"
Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#PowerCell#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," suggest water erosion in quantities far greater than can be accounted for by ice in the polar regions. 8 For this reason, scientists hypothesize large amounts of ground ice and subsurface reservoirs exist across the planet. Though there are no comprehensive surveys of subsurface water deposits, there have been numerous studies of yet another source.
Vapor content has been measured from several satellites orbiting Mars. 9 , 10 , 11 Cameras circling above use spectrometers to image the planet and note the intensity of peaks at certain wavelengths corresponding to H2O. From this information, they can quantify the amount of water vapor existing in a hypothetical column of atmosphere (this is measured in pr-μm, or micrometers of precipitable H2O)
H2O column density at High Northern latitudes (think the “Arctic circle”) 10
Planetary scientists have systematically recorded the density of atmospheric H2O column for the entire surface of Mars, compiling a global map of water vapor.
Seasonally averaged water vapor abundance (in um of precipitation) 9
From this map it becomes clear that, as on Earth, there are variations in the distribution of atmospheric water vapor based on longitude and latitude. In particular, the Northern hemisphere contains significantly more atmospheric H2O than the South.
As with dust, the distribution of water in the Martian environment represents a complex system which should be considered in the calculus of photosynthesis in the Martian colony.
In Summary
Considering all of these factors, it is apparent that modeling the productive capacity of photosynthesis on Mars is complex and requires parameters describing geophysical conditions and how cyanobacteria are affected by them. As planetary scientists continue to collect more observations about Mars, our understanding of the differences and similarities between their atmosphere and ours will grow. Then, exobiologists will be able to simulate more variables in the lab to study microbial physiology and identify challenges for synthetic biologists to solve through genetic engineering.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," report Syns of Omission (ETC 2007). The ETC group authors critique the pseudo impartiality of the report’s proposal of regulation, wrongfully presented as a ""project to examine the societal implications of synthetic genomics ».
The main critic of ETC group is the self governing both proposed and performed by the researchers. And, by reminding us that the Alfred P Sloan Foundation is financing this report with around half a million dollars, the ETC group brings out the partial orientation of conclusion. The Foundation of A P Sloan, former boss of General Motors, is working on science and technology topic, but is mainly focused on terrorism concerns. The ETC group points out that the bioterrorism risk is over accentuated, and that scientific errors are minimized. The report is denounced by Jom Thomas from ETC group as a “partial consideration of governance by a partisan group of authors"".
Legitimacy of discourses, through the question of internal or external critic is making the question of governance more and more complex. How should we consider civil society in a decision making process about such a technical subject? If trust in scientists about such important concerns is not possible, what other subjects should be governed by the whole society? What about other fields which are equally important? Is a real consensus with so many actors thinkable? Aren't we about to put our trust in the best speaker? Won't it be, in the end, a scientist? Even deeper, how should we consider the border between the internal and external standpoint? Aren't we always on both sides?
We have already mentioned non-scientist participation in these decision making processes, in a macroscopic way and we put it as a principle. The ETC group enlighten how private interests can build up biosafety and biosecurity concerns have already been raised. However, two additional social stakes mentioned by the ETC group are:
Economics : synthetic biology is a capital-intensive technology likely to have massive downstream impacts on marginalized peoples if it is adopted and promoted. Impacts will come first in agriculture and health but then in geo-engineering climate change. Synthetic microbes programmed to make industrial substances could potentially de-stabilize South economies and employment.
Control : like biotech, companies are already patenting critical synthetic biology technologies and processes. Although some in the synthetic biology community may be advocating for opensource biology, others such as Craig Venter have a long biopiracy record of profiting from human and non-human gene sequences. Because the science can be privatized and monopolized it becomes more attractive to companies seeking profit rather than addressing social needs.

Key Features in BioDesign V2.0
  BioSearch is just a 2-month old software developed entirely by a group of passionate undergraduate novices from SUSTC who dare to challenge the unchallengeable. During the past 2 months, we are making every effort to optimize it incessantly. BioSearch still has a long way to go. With careful analysis and prudent evaluation of our application, here we make a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in next version.
  
iPad version & Android Version
  To better satisfy the need of increasing iPad/Android user.
  
Merge BioDesign with BioSearch
  We expect to import data from BioSearch to BioDesign to do biochemical reaction simulation. Then BioSearch will be even stronger and comprehensive.
  
Simulation & Calculation
  What if BioDesign is more than a graphic editing program? Many potential users expected BioDesign to possess simulation function and calculation function. Perhaps we need first to find out the algorithm of simulation and then to take the advantage of cloud calculation via the Internet to make our App more comprehensive.
  
Optimization of User Interface & Graphics Editing Module
  Currently, BioDesign has achieved all the essential graphic editing functions, which already satisfied the primary requirements of potential users and researchers. However, the layout of the user interface can be improved to be more reasonable and beautiful if time permitted.
  
Redo/Undo/Cut/Copy
  o far, you can use BioDesign to add/delete/rotate/connect figures. However, to better provide convenience to users, we’d like to develop redo/undo/cut/copy functions to cater for users’ habit. These problems are still challenging because these involved much more complex data storage and"

This is done through a semi-quantitative analysis of keratinase A (kerA) and keratinase US (kerUS) activity, and expression of these genes in E.coli.  The genes for production of kerA and kerUS originate from Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus brevis respectively.  These genes were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli JM109 and DH5⍺.  The KerA enzyme is most active in degrading keratin in feathers, while KerUS is most active in degrading keratin in hair. The production and effectiveness of keratinase was tested on human hair over five days at a temperature of 37°C.  Observations from this semi-quantitative assay, combined with results from a skim milk plate assay suggest that some protease is being expressed and secreted.
Abstract for ""Learning to Ker: Safety and Ethics in High School Synthetic Biology""
The Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team is a dynamic synthetic biology group made of high school students from grades 10 through 12. On the team there are brains, athletes, princesses, and basket cases all working towards one goal: expressing Keratinases in E.coli JM109 and DH5⍺. Keratinases have the ability to reduce the 8.5 billion tons of keratin waste produced by the poultry industry every year, along with the keratin waste in wastewater treatment industries in the form of hair. The hair and feathers degraded by the keratinases could even be recycled into a high-quality protein product that can be used to make fertilizer and animal feed. While one focus is to complete this project, the true goal is to provide high school students with a well-rounded education beyond the classroom. This diverse scientific education is not limited to working inside the lab or on the technical aspects of the project. It extends to all areas of science, including safety and ethical considerations, as well as the acknowledgement of different religious and economic perspectives in scientific endeavours. Over the past 3 years, the Our Lady of the Snows iGEM and synthetic biology team has been learning how to build a lab that is economically feasible, through do-it-yourself projects and secondhand equipment. The team has tackled safety issues related to sharing lab space with many students in a high school. Students have also considered the project from a faith-based perspective, and addressed other ethical concerns related to young student scientists and genetic engineering.

Interview Transcripts
What is your scientific background? I did my undergraduate degree at University of Toronto; a neuroscience specialist and cell and molecular biology major. I did research in neurodegenerative diseases in undergrad and some dry lab psych research. I actually didn’t do a Masters, I entered as a Masters student and reclassified. This is common in Canada and leaves you with a longer funding period, you can also take all your work over with you. Now I’m doing a PhD in the Department of Molecular Genetics at University of Toronto. Where in the time line did you become interested in science communication?
I’ve always liked teaching, since I was a kid I’ve been mentoring and teaching as much as I can. I think they go hand in hand. I formally started efforts in science communication 3-4 years ago. Is that when you started your instagram? No, my Instagram is actually only about a year old but I’ve been on twitter for a while. I started writing tweets for a non-profit organization 3 years ago at the beginning of my PhD. I guess that’s my formal start, but I’ve been doing it for ever. So I wasn’t aware you’ve been on twitter for so long because I know you from your Instagram. I was wondering what made you pick that platform 1 year ago? You asked so I’m going to give the full answer. I’ve been on twitter for 3 times as longer but my Instagram following is 3 times bigger. What I was finding on twitter was that I was getting incredibly helpful connections but mostly with other scientists and communicators. Twitter isn’t really popular with our- er you’re younger than me but I’m going to lump us together- ages. Do any of your friends use Twitter? I have two or three who are in Masters or PhD that use it. But for social or personal reasons? No one really uses twitter in our generation, but academic twitter is huge. Scientists and anyone in communications, they’re on twitter If you want to be in comms and you’re not on Twitter,  you should should get on it. Twitter was useful for networking but I wanted, as a communicator, to reach people not in science. I wanted to"
Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Crowdfunding_-_-_TEXT.html," funding or as a means of widening general awareness of synthetic biology?
That's a great question! We generally stress the fact the main benefit of crowdfunding is actually publicity (raising awareness). Many project creators who have used Sponsume in the past to successfully fund their venture would argue that the biggest advantage they derived from their campaign was the attention their project and the subject they dealt with received (both during and after the campaign).
We would like to thank Mr Vincent for his time and answers that helped us in getting a better understanding of the topic.

JUDGING FORM
The iGEM Bootcamp was a dual outreach and recruitment / training workshop we held over the course of two weeks early in the summer. Students followed a prescribed set of experiments as they got a taste for molecular biology and synthetic biology in an attempt to assemble two BioBricks together.
We choose BioBricks representing both RFP and LacZ expression, hoping that the visuals (either Red, Blue, or Dark Purple) would allow students to visualize the efficiency of their cloning. The protocols and experiments are described in detail in our Bootcamp guide, available as a PDF: File:T--Kingsborough NY--iGEM bootcamp instructions1.pdf
The results were partly successful: students were able to transform bacteria with ligation reactions and recovery colonies. Moreover, more colonies were recovered for the experimental ligation than the control reactions. However, for some reason the LacZ BioBrick failed to produce the characteristic blue color when grown in the presence of X-gal (we even tested the X-gal with pUC19, and this positive control was blue - data not shown). Some faint blue color (or purplish color for combination BioBrick - RFP with LacZ) appear on the experiment plate (E2), but the result was not as clear as intended.
Below are some of the results from one group of Bootcamp students, which are similar to results obtained from other student groups).
In the future, we may add modules to the bootcamp - for example, verifying that the constructs were made correctly by colony PCR, since the color read-out was not ideal."

TAS_Taipei,2017,Team:TAS Taipei#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Eric P. Lee, senior member of technical staff at Maxim Integrated, and TAS alumnus, to ask him some general questions about the approach of our project. We asked him about our two approaches, one with E. coli receptors that bind to the capping agents of NPs, the other with biofilm that traps NPs. Dr. Lee suggested that our membrane receptor must be specific to a particular capping agent. He also commented that the biofilm approach was a good idea since we could trap multiple types of NPs regardless of their capping agent. (Interviewed by Emily C.)
Dr. Gwo-Dong Roam
We interviewed Professor Roam of National Central University and former general director of the Environmental Analysis Labs (EAL) of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to learn more about the background and potential threat of NPs. Dr. Roam informed us that the most common NPs used in Taiwan include: TiO2, ZnO, Ag, Au, Fe, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Clay, and Graphene. He also told us that the toxicity of a NP is directly related to its size, but there are currently no regulations or guidelines that specify the toxicity of different types and sizes of NPs. With the increased use of NPs in society, Dr. Roam believes that more attention should be placed on waste management, risk assessment and regulations.
After our first visit to the Dihua WWTP, we learned that the sludge removed from wastewater is either 1) sent to landfills, 2) used as fertilizer, or 3) incinerated. We asked Dr. Roam if aggregated NPs in the waste sludge would still be harmful to the environment if disposed using current methods. He said that all of these sludge disposal solutions are still harmful to the environment, but they are better than letting NPs flow into bodies of water. He advised us to target removal of NPs in the wastewater treatment process before it is discharged. (Interviewed by Candice L. and Justin Y.)

Moreover, we were also working out a protocol to measure the GFP intensity with the Tecan Plate Reader as our first attempt did not provide any conclusive results. The intensities were too high, exceeding detection levels of the reader even when our cultures were diluted. Hence, we adjusted the parameters of the photometer and tried different sampling volumes so that we can measure the fluorescence intensities even when the culture becomes saturated
August
Week 1
We sent our  LDPWT-TT and LDHWT-TT construct for sequencing and found that they were wrong. Hence, our progress on the LDH and LDP characterisation is stalled untill we got the constructs. We redo ligation for this two constructs.
We got a protocol that enables us to measure GFP intensities over an eight hour period and still remains within the detection limit of the plate reader. Do have a look are our protocols for more detials. Hence, we started right away with 4 mutants to test if our protocol worked. 10AG, 10AT, 8AC and 8AT were the first batch of RBS mutants tested. The process takes a full day and was very tiring. The conjugation of the reporters into Shewanella is still on going. We will start on another batch next week.
Week 2
Our construct of LDPWT-TT was correct for this time but LDHWT-TT is still wrong. As we do not have our LDPWT-TT construct we start to ligate out LDH mutants with the wild type LDP into one operon. We ligated 20 mutants in total, 6 from the first batch nd 14 for the second batch. Still, we carried on with the LDHWT-TT construct.
For the RBS, we characterised RBS mutants of base pair 1, 2 and 3 on Monday and and mutants of base pair4, 5 and 6 on Thursday. As we are still lacking the mutant with G switched to T on the sixth base pair, we tried mutagenesis again.
Week 3
As our ligation product was very long, >3kb, we had to use 2 sequencing primers to confirm if our ligations were sucessfull. Fortunately, our ligations were all sucessfull. We have conformation that an RBS is between the TAA stop codon of the LDH mutant and the ATG start codon of wild type LDP. Hence, we minipreped the constructs and transformed them into WM3064 for conjug"

Memory Units
As memory units, we are using bistable autoinducing loops that can be suppressed via a reversed antisense promoter (jammer). The autoinducing loop will act as an amplifier of the input signal with the promoter inducing expression of its own transcription factor. To switch off the loop, we adopted the endogenous device from the 2009 iGEM team of British Columbia, which implemented a reverse antisense promoter downstream of the coding sequence ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia/Jammer ).
Mechanism of bistability in autoinducing loops.
Our implementation
The first memory unit is based on a modified lambda Prm promoter (BBa_I12006) producing its own inducer cI. By means of the reversed antisense lasB promoter it will be repressed in the presence of LasR. The second memory unit consists of the lasB promoter (BBa_R0079) producing its own induction factor LasR. Both autoinducing loops can be repressed by an arabinose inducible reverse antisense pBAD promoter. The transcription factor genes (cI and LasR) were fused in various combinations with different RBS and degradation tags, resulting in 12 different construct variants. These enable us to study the dynamics of expression and half-life of different autoinducing loop variants in order to subsequently determine the constructs that best meet the criteria for bistability.
Lambda cI based autoinducing loop.
LasR based autoinducing loop.
Experimental Planning
First, we want to test promoter leakage by cotransforming a plasmid containing the autoinducing loop and a reporter plasmid under the control of an appropriate promoter. Second, we will cotransform assembled input and output systems with plasmids bearing various variants of"

From a truth table to abstract logic circuits.
In BioBLESS a truth table dialog box will be displayed for users to input Boolean numbers 0/1. All you need to do is to click Boolean buttons and then “Create”.
The corresponding designed logic circuits with different predicted performances will be automatically generated and displayed in order. You can immediately and clearly see the configuration of a designed logic circuit, which in most                         cases is supposed to be a compli- cated multi-input circuit.
According to the perturbation ratio you input, such as 20% or 30%, the concentration-time curves of inputs and outputs will be shown toge- ther to shed light on the robustness of a designed gene circuit. Moreover, data processing and                         demonstration will help users to better understand the robustness of designed gene circuits.

Experts in the topic of biotechnology were invited from the field of science and industry. The iGEM team from Darmstadt could get Dr. Maurer for the panel discussion, who had worked 25 years for Henkel and became new Director of Business Development of AB Enzymes. Prof. Dingermann from the Goethe University in Frankfurt took part as a scientific representative for the red biotechnology. Prof. Warzecha of the TU Darmstadt was proponent as Instructor of the iGEM team as well as a representative of the green biotechnology. For the ethical and moral issues in the field of biotechnology, the team from Darmstadt got Prof. Nordmann, who deals with the philosophy of Synthetic Biology. At the beginning of the event, Prof. Warzecha conducted a presentation on biotechnology. He gave the audience a short overview of biotechnology and its applications in today's world. He spoke to the fears of the people and tried to clarify them. This was followed by the presentation of the project of the iGEM team by Arne Wehling. Afterwards was a ""get-together"", in which the audience could talk to speaker and members of the iGEM team. The audience had the opportunity to write down questions on flipcharts that should be answered in the upcoming panel discussion. In the subsequent discussion were the issues of the flipcharts discussed with the audience and the experts. The panel was moderated by Henrik Cordes, who also brought in the discussion as a representative of the team. The event officially ended after three hours, but enough guests remained until late in the evening with the experts and students to discuss about the pro and contra of biotechnology and also Synthetic Biology. It was a good step of the iGEM team of Darmstadt to organize this interactive panel discussion, as it allowed reaching the people. The event shown young scientist, which concerns prevail in the human and which misinformation need to be clarify.

Stochastic model done
Models
Stochastic program is implemented for the toggle switch and works fine. We adapted the program for the whole system so we can implement the quorum sensing stochastic model very quickly when we have the parameters (about 1/2 day of work). The current model and parameters prove that we do have a bi-modal distribution when IPTG and pollutant concentrations are equal :
On the X-axis we can see the concentration of lacI (neg) or merR (positive) in cells. On the Y-axis we can see the amount of cells in one way or another.
Parameters
We have coherent sets of parameters, but we still can't compare our models to the real system and are waiting for the results of characterization experiments.

By introducing plasmids with many decoy binding sites of the target proteins, we tried to prevent repressors from acting on genomic sites.
Suppressor of Multi-Negative Feedback System of Clock Devise
In our project, Multicellular Analog Clock, we needed a suppressor to be used for the Multi-Negative Feedback System and UV reset devise. Our clock devise uses novel systems which are not seen in previous papers or past iGEM project and it is difficult to say what kind of suppressors is best unless we actually try them. So we designed two kinds of sRNAs that bind to the TIR of mCherry and luxI as the suppressors (anti-mCherry and anti-luxI).
sRNA suppressors will behave differently from AiiA and TetR. sRNAs express and decompose more rapidly than suppresors based on these proteins and act on different targets.
The two sRNAs are act on different molecules within the clock pathway and therefore expected to influence clock behavior differently. Translational inhibition is caused only by sRNAs binding to the TIR of the target gene while degradation by RNase E is caused by any sRNAs binding to the mRNA.
The differences of mechanisms may lead to various patterns of suppression of various strength and time.

Collaboration with 2011 Uppsala Sweeden iGEM Team
We asked them to use and give feedback to our software tool on our wiki. This tool is named as BioGuide which was first studied on last year’s competition iGEM 2010 and gained silver medal. This year this team joined with wet lab team. While they were progressing the BioGuide project, this software tool also supported the web page and experiments of METU_Ankara team. We publish this software program on our wiki page to made other iGEM teams to reach and benefit from program on part  and path choices. Uppsala-Sweeden team was one of the teams that use and try the BioGuide program. They tried to reach their used parts in kit distributions and then gave us feedback on them.
They tried this software tool according to parts of their project As an input parameters they tried to type red light 'cph8',  blue light 'LovTAP', green light 'Ccas', IPTG(PT5-Lac), YF1 and as output parameters they typed amil GFP, amil CP and mCHERRY.  However they found the library of program restricted and they could not reach all parts  because BioGuide software tool library is designed and programmed on parts that are in 2010 and 2011kit plate distributions. By the way, they found this software program managable. Given part names or input and output data results with Biobrick codes of parts in parts registry library. Therefore, it made easier their job on longstanding assembly plans. For mutual collaboration, we read and evaluated their Biosafety web page and gave feedback below

Istanbul_Tech,2016,Team:Istanbul Tech#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Furthermore, it should be stated that conclusions drawn here are merely the thought and conclusions drawn by our team and are up for debate. After statistical analysis in the form of a t-test, the discussed results were shown to be significant.
As a whole, the attitude towards genetically modified organisms (GMOs) was more positive in Sweden with over 80 percent being positive, whereas in Turkey, 72 percent had a negative or sceptical attitude towards GMOs. The sceptical attitude towards GMOs could be linked to the low exposure to the subject within formal education. Results show only 28 percent of the Turkish participants having received any information regarding GMO within an educational setting. Furthermore, the Turkish participants showed a higher level of dissatisfaction with the information that they had received. When asked if GMOs should be used for medical purposes, 24 percent of the Turkish participants disagreed, whereas 3 percent disagreed in the Swedish poll. This result can most likely be attributed towards the general scepticism towards GMO that the Turkish participants showed. Swedish participantsdid not agree that GMO products should be labelled, in contrast to the Turkish poll where 93 percent agreed that GMO products should be labelled as such. This further illustrates the distrust that the Turkish participants showed towards GMO products.
The mistrust may be due to a low availability of good information regarding GMO, clear information on how it works and what the risks with the technology can be. Since the participants in the Swedish poll consisted mostly of university graduates, which does not represent the majority of the population, their positivity may not reflect the true opinion of the general population. From a Swedish perspective, it is quite clear that the opinion is not as high as the poll might indicate.
Both nations did however show great interest in the field of GMOs and genetic engineering. 80 percent or more were interested in learning more about this field. A prudent strategy for both nations could be to include more information of the basics of genetics and biology in the lower levels of education to increase the level of understanding for life and biological processes.
Istanbul_Tech Team’s Analysis about the Survey:
Most of the participants’ ages are 21-30. (Probably, most of them are university students or new graduated and the average age of people using internet in Turkey.)
Swedish participants are mostly male but, Turkish ones are mostly female.  High rate of female participants in Turkey may be due to GMO is an attractive issue for females because of food industry in Turkey generally use GMO.
Both of participants are graduated from university or are university students.
Also, both of participants are studying on engineering; especially Swedish ones. (Probably, Turkey is facing GMO"

LEGEND OF TABLES:
Constitutive: the induction point, in term of O.D.600, is under the minimum detectable value calculated by the algorithm. This minimum value was estimated by running the algorithm on data acquired from a culture that constitutively produces GFP. For this reason, the devices labelled as constitutive can be considered as constitutive GFP producers.
*: in two of three experiments the self-induction failed, thus having a non-induced culture for all the cell densities. The standard errors were not computed for these cultures.
**: in one of three experiments the self-induction failed, thus having a non-induced culture for all the cell densities. The standard errors were computed on two independent experiments.
<partinfo>BBa_K300016</partinfo> is labelled with *, but probably induction failed in two of the three experiments because the culture didn't reach the O.D.start point (the experiment was stopped before the culture reached the O.D.600 critical value).
Discussion: a modular PoPS-based devices (<partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> was designed and used to realize a library of self-inducible devices, able to start the production of the heterologous protein at a defined culture density. Other members of this promoters' family are derived from <partinfo>BBa_K300009</partinfo> (see the proper section for details).
They were characterized in many different experimental conditions:
varying the strength of the promoter controlling the production of the signal molecule (Sender Modulation)
varying the copy number of vectors bearing both Sender and Receiver circuits
varying the growth medium (LB or M9)
A graphical summary is reported in the figures below:

To share Cell War with more people, we grab every chance to demonstrate our board game. Our board game was brought to conferences, schools and organizations.
We tested the board game in Fudan Board Game Club several times. Club members were so impressed and showed great interests in related topics.Cell War was then for the first time introduced to the public on the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC). We won everyone’s attention. Haoqian Zhang from Beijing also showed interest in our board game. Mr. Zhang was previously the iGEM team leader of Peking University. Now he is the CTO of Bluepha, a synthetic biology related company. In CCiC, he first got to know our board game. After that, an intense cooperation has been made. We made several sets of board games and send them to Beijing to be promoted at Peking University affiliated high school.

Once in log phase, the cells were transferred into a 96-well plate with solutions of LB pre-adjusted to various pH levels. Every 5 minutes, the OD and GFP-fluorescence of each well were recorded.
Each data point was normalized for LB autofluorescence and for OD (OD shifts were observed based upon the amount of HCl in solution).  These abnormalities are seen in the unusually high fluoresence of all wells due to LB autofluoresence and abnormally high OD of the pH 2 wells due to HCl in solution. The results were then normalized again by calculating the fluorescence per OD of cells (pictured below). A t-test was then performed on the two populations of fluoresence/OD numbers, with the null hypothesis stating that the two populations did not have different means and the alternative hypothesis stating that the two populations did have different means. When the t-test was performed, the p-value was 4.9E-009, suggesting that the null hypothesis should be rejected and that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean Fluoresence/OD of the Pgad/GFP + nsCP/clc/xx at pH7 and at pH2. This means that the clc antiporter was activated at low pH conditions, causing chloride ions to flow into the cell, which in turn activated the Pgad promoter, producing the fluorescence found in the assay.
After quantifying the amount of Pgad expression through fluorescence, the next logical assay to perform was a test lysis assay to see if the cells would lyse when exposed to the physiological conditions of the stomach(low pH, high Cl). Cells containing the assembled Pgad/lysis nsCP/clc-ec1/xx in pSB1A3 plasmid were overnighted and then regrown in LB to log phase. Once at log phase, the cells were placed into a 96 well plate with varying pH solutions of LB. Every 15 minutes the OD and of the cells was recorded.
Simply put, cells with the Pgad/lysis nsCP/clc/xx part at a pH of 7 grew exponentially in solution as according to their OD’s over time. The cells at a pH of 4 and 3 however did not grow exponentially in solution. Their OD’s stayed relatively constant over time. The cells at a pH of 2 however did lyse, and their OD’s dropped over time.

Project abstract
In the long run our crude oil resources will be on the decline but most importantly the effects of the climate change demand a quick shift to a sustainable fuel economy. Approaching biofuel production by direct synthesis from sunlight has the potential to solve the problems that arise with the conventional fermentation of starches and sugars such as the direct competition of fuel feedstock with food crops. Thus the Uppsala iGEM Team 2009 investigated the production of ethanol and butanol with the use of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp PCC6803. Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria possess the ability to directly convert sunlight into biofuels. We engineered constructs for ethanol and butanol production as well as strategies to increase the yields of photosynthetic ethanol production.

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," which is the output in the signal pathway model. From figure 14, it is clear that the output is dynamic. However, using the whole time series as an output result is complicated in calculation and analysis. Thus, we decide to choose the output at a certain time as the output. Now the dilemma is how to choose the proper time that makes the testing is most accurate and effective.
The core concept is the greedy method here. As the result we observed in figure 14, the EGFP outputs at a certain time are different from the input, which means we can define a gap at a certain time as follow
$$ gap(t)=max\{EGFP(t,RL_{max})\}-min\{EGFP(t,RL_{min})\} $$
The $RL_{max}$ and $RL_{min}$ in the definition mean the $RL$ values that let the EGFP in time $t$ has the maximum or minimum value respectively.Generally, $RL_{max}=RL_p$ and $RL_{min}=0$.The gap can be calculated and shown in the following chart.
Then,the time that has biggest gap $t_{max}$ can be easily found by algorithms, for example, the simulated annealing we used.In this set of parameter, we find that $t_{max}=145$.
Next, we focus on the relation between the concentration of activated histamine receptor (input) and that of EGFP (output) in the time $t_{max}$ (145), which is demonstrated in the follow line charts.
As the chart shows, the concentration of EGFP soars when that of activated histamine receptor is less than approximate 250nM, but the growth rate decreases and maintains stable after this.And, by interpolation, we figure out the function of relation between the concentration of activated histamine receptor and that of EGFP in one yeast.
Then, we assume that the fluorescence intensity ($Flo_p$) and the concentration of EGFP in one yeast (EGFP) follow this simple linear relation.
$$ Flo_p=kEGFP=kf(RL_p) $$
Recalling the number of yeasts in the testing system $N$, we can derive the relation between the fluorescence intensity ($Flo_t$) and the expectation of concentration of EGFP in one yeast.
$$ Flo_t=k\times N \times EGFP=k N  f(RL_p) $$
The $k$ is scale coefficient and $N$ is the number of yeast in the system.To further improve, we combine the model 'Reaction in system' that provides the relation of hist"

Design
Our project design constitutes a synthetic design, which involves the insertion of modified PETase and MHETase into E.Coli, and an engineering design, which plans to place our bacteria into a Ram pump that is to be put into the secondary or aeration stage in the wastewater treatment plant.
I. Synthetic Design: E.coli containing modified Petase
We took the sequence of the original PETase found in Yoshida, et al., 2016 and changed two amino acid sequences at two plastic-binding sites S238F/W159H discovered in an article by Austin, et al., 2018.
We used Gibson assembly to build 3 DNA circuits that contain: (1) Wild-type (Contol) PETase, (2) Modified PETase, (3) Modified PETase and MHETase, which are then transformed into our E. coli cells. We utilized AmilCP reporter gene in our DNA to stain cells that are successfully transformed, ""blue"".
To test the enzyme performance of the successfully transformed E. coli, we inoculated these microbes with media in the presence of small plastic PET bottle shreds.
To observe the efficiency of the these enzyme performance, we weighed the small plastic particles before and after inoculation with the E. coli that are expected to express PETase that would degrade the PET plastic particles. We also planned to utilize the Scanning electron microscopy for a more accurate observation of the plastic particles’ surfaces that might have been degraded or grazed by our PETase enzymes.
The plastic particles exposed to the (1) Wild-type PETase and those exposed to the (2) Modified PETase are analyzed in terms of their reduction in mass to compare the rate of degradation between our wild-type PETase and our modified PETase that is expected to have a higher PET structure binding and degrading rate. Meanwhile, the plastic particles in the (3) Modified PETase and MHETase allow us to observe the efficiency of the MHETase.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#Collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," meeting in London, members of each team have tele-conferenced weekly on Skype. After accustoming ourselves to the eight hour time difference, we developed SensiGEM , a collaborative database in which we could catalogue all the biosensors in the history of iGEM.
Before sinking our teeth into past Wikis, we realized that we had different definitions of biosensors. We asked each other a fundamental question: What is a biosensor? We developed the following definition:
A biosensor is an engineered system that relies on biological systems or components to detect and report a condition. The condition(s) detected and reported could encompass an environmental, biological, chemical or synthetic aspect or compound in the sensor’s environment or surroundings.
Once agreeing on the nature of biosensors, we split up the Wikis from 2007 onward between Calgary and Paris-Bettencourt. We analyzed 936 project Wikis from 2007 to 2013 by hand, incorporating the projects which matched our biosensor definition into the collaborative SensiGEM database. We included 229 projects on the database, some of which were biosensors as per the definition, as well as other projects containing biosensor elements that aligned with our definition.
We designed this database with future iGEM teams in mind, with tools for efficient navigation biosensors according to inputs, outputs, and their intended application. We made both SensiGEM's source code and underlying data available under the permissive MIT license . This means that other teams can either collaborate with us on our version of the database or host their own independent copies. We foresee SensiGEM as a resource where future teams can effectively assess biosensors developed previously in iGEM and find components that they can harness in new projects. Additionally, we want to see iGEM teams showcase their biosensors in a single location.
Lessons from SensiGEM
We conducted some preliminary analysis of the database in SensiGEM to see how our projects stand in the current iGEM biosensor landscape. Please see Figures 2 and 3 below.
Figure 2. The approach Calgary has taken using an in vitro sensor comprised of isolated, non-living protein components is rare within iGEM. There was an all time high of 12 of these projects in 2010.
Figure 3. Since 2007, fewer than 10 iGEM biosensors involve inputs of nucleic acids. Henceforth, Paris-Bettencourt and Calgary are significantly expanding the variety of nucleic acid biosensors in the iGEM registry.

They pose dangers similar to landmines. These weapons continue to cause casualties long after the conflict has ended, and they hamper development and post-conflict reconstruction. Large stretches of land cannot be cultivated, medical systems are drained of resources by the cost of helping landmine/ERW casualties, and money must be spend on clearing mines instead of, for example education [8].
The amount of mine contamination as of October 2013 is shown in figure 1. As depicted in the figure, the most affected countries are current (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,Palestine) or former (Vietnam, Cambodia, the Balkans) war zones[9].
Figure 1 World map indicating mine contamination per country. The contamination is measured as the amount of square kilometers which are SHA or CHA (suspected/confirmed hazardous area, see below)[9]
An example of the impact of old landmines and ERW is Vietnam. Although the Vietnam War is already over for decades, Vietnam is still suffering from the large-scale use of landmines during that conflict. In the period 1999-2012, landmines caused 1683 casualties, of which 630 were killed [8]. Another example of this problem can be found in the Balkans. Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina recently (May 2014) suffered major flooding. Due to landslides caused by this flood, landmines from the Bosnian War (1992-1995) resurfaced and dislodged, adding to the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers [10][11].
Survey of casuaties
In 2012, a total of 3628 mine/ERW casualties were recorded; adding up tothis is more than ten casualties per day. At least 1066 people were killed and 2552 people were injured; for 10 casualties it was not known if they survived the incident. However, the true number of casualties is likely to be significantly higher, due to the fact that,because in many areas, plentya lot of casualties go unrecorded. Despite of this alarming factof this, the number of casualties decreased to the lowest level since 1999 (the start of documentation of casualties by the Landmine Monitor). The majority (78%) of the landmine casualties in 2012 were civilians. A substantial amount (47%) of the casualties in 2012 were children [8].
From all the countries affected, Afghanistan is the country with"

Our chelator Copper Storage Protein 1 (monomer) with 13 bound copper ions.
Delivery
From discussion with patients and the public, and the work carried out by previous Oxford iGEM teams, we decided to investigate the use of a bead to deliver our bacteria to the small intestine. Our bacteria will initially be encapsulated in an alginate matrix, and then be alternately coated in layers of alginate and chitosan. The goal of the multiple polymer-coatings is to protect the bacteria from the harsh conditions of the stomach, whilst having the ability to degrade in the more alkaline pH of the small intestine. This degradation releases our bacteria into the favourable conditions of the small intestine, where they can colonise the area and chelate dietary copper.
Our bead design
Results
Through our experimental work we have been able to obtain data suggesting the following:
Different arrangements of both our CueR-linked and CusS/CusR-linked promoter systems are sensitive over a range of copper concentrations, including at the lower concentrations mimicking the gut.
MymT is able to chelate a measurable amount of copper in vivo.
Alternately layered chitosan-alginate beads release material in the small intestine, following passage through the stomach, in a simulation accounting for the pH change.
Please see our experiments and results pages for more discussion of our methods and the outcomes.
Improving Registry Parts
As part of our project, we have improved the function/characterisation of three poorly documented parts.
Please visit our parts and results pages for further information.
BBa_I760005:
This copy of pCusC located in the registry had been previously used 11 times, but had no associated useful characterisation data. From discussions with a mentor, Tom Folliard, we came to the conclusion that this may have been because the promoter region was too short, and thus missing key binding sites. We decided to deposit an elongated form of this promoter, which we have achieved thorough characterisation.

Introduction
Discovery of GANs
Goals
Introducton
The computational content we present in these software sections are directly responsible for the motivation and creation of CAT-Seq!
Just as the iGEM year has started and our Team was formed, we readily acknowledged the main “big picture” problem we want to solve in synthetic biology - the difficulty of creating novel, synthetic parts. In particular we were interest in synthetic catalytic biomolecules.
Catalytic biomolecules are a cleaner and greener substitute to chemical catalyzers used all over the world. The catalytic biomolecules offer an enormous 17 orders of magnitude chemical reaction acceleration as well as excellent stereo-, chemo- and regio-selectivity in aqueous environments. Yet, one of the main drawbacks of using enzymes is that for many important chemical reactions, efficient enzymes have not yet been discovered or engineered.
That said, identifying enzyme amino acid sequence with the required novel or optimized reaction is a challenging task because the sequence space is incomprehensibly large.
The discovery of Generative Adversarial Networks
While exploring the possible ways of solving the previously described problem we have stumbled upon an article describing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). As we were not familiar with these relatively new neural networks at that time, we have studied the examples of what it has already achieved. The main idea of GANs is that it can learn the patterns of a given data input in order to generate examples as if they were from a given dataset. For example, if shown enough cat images, it will not start to generate an exact, specific cat image from the dataset, but it will learn how a cat should look in general. That results in a GAN that may produce cat images which do not have analogs in the dataset. A completely new cat!
We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer"

modelling and simulation
Replication of E.coli cell
Model written in SBML format is shown below. The dynamic curve of E.coli replication is plotted by time course simulation. Exactly speaking, dynamic behaviors of biological system are meaningless after 4000s because of termination of reproduction of E.coli. However, the curve is in qualitative agreement with that from experiments in the first and second stage of reproduction of E.coli.

Basic example with pLac-LacI repression system
introduction
MoDeL provides poweful supports for description of interactions between two species. No interactions exist in the previous example. In this example, we will construct a plasmid backbone with promoter, rbs, coding sequence and terminator inserted in and transform it into E.coli. LacI repressor are produced after two steps of transcription and translation. It binds with itself to form a dimer and then a tetramer, which could bind with promoter LacI on the plasmid to repress the process of transcription. Besides, replication of E.coli cells, degradation of proteins and mRNAs, as well as dilution due to replication of cells, are also considered.
database construction
Actually, it is a complex molecular process and takes many steps to complete a transcription reaction. It includes binding and initiation, elongation, and termination. So does translation reactions. The first version of MoDeL DOES NOT support transcription and translation reaction templates and they will be handled by our core program of iGame and thus no need to write in the database.
All binding reactions in the database demo are modeled using law of mass action. They are dimerization of two LacI repressors and that of two LacI dimers. LacI tetramers will bind with promoter LacI in the plasmid and thus repressing the expression of plasmid DNAs. However, MoDeL enables any mathematical model form for species-species interactions and is not constrained within only law of mass action. Users could change the reactants, modifiers, products, as well as kinetic laws arbituarily and validate their models via output of dynamic curves.
Species reaction templates are worth mentioning to show features of our new language MoDeL. It is never a easy problem to calculate degradation rates of proteins since different parts in a fused protein may have different degradation rates and the overall rate is still unknown. What's more, a protein in MoDeL may have different protein chains and it is more complex to determine the overall rate. In"

This year we communicated with team BIT-China, helping each other at several aspects.
BNU-CHINA for BIT-China
1.  We assisted BIT-China with their modeling
It's our pleasure to assist team BIT-China with their modeling part. We mainly help them to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, we build a model to link six chemical reactions together, all of which are controlled by pH switch. There is only one chemical reaction with a specific pH, and with the pH changing, the chemical reaction will change subsequently, which makes the pH range from 5 to 7 smoothly. They prove us the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and we are responsible for the realization of the procedure during the entire process.
The difficulty that BIT-China meets is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the pH switch to find out the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, in order to draw a image to reflect the pH variation trend with time. Because some of our team members are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, we have plenty experience in the solution of differential equations, application of MATLAB and design of procedure. With these resources, we have helped them solve their problems successfully.

This year, we have disseminated two global health problems: heart attacks and strokes, and their viable clinical solutions. Due to the intricate components of the present mechanisms and treatments of such clinical methods we have set forth a project which has an ample  perspective and approach, together with our policy & practice activities.
Here , you can take a look at the main components of our project design.
The Problem
Ischemia is the restriction of blood supply to tissues, generally caused by the blockage of a clot due to the reduction or inhibition of blood flow. This process results in the shortage of oxygen and nutrition vital for metabolism and survival of cells. Since oxygen is delivered to tissues only via the blood stream, incommensurate blood supply causes tissue cells to spurn. Particularly for the heart and brain, irreversible damage is parlously supposable to occur in as little as 3–4 minutes at body temperature.
Ischemia is said to be the major factor in many of the medical problems of today. The famous heart attack, which is culpable for most of the deaths worldwide, is, as a matter of fact, an ischemic condition. In addition to this, the loss of a specific region of the brain due to inadequate blood perfusion is associated with ischemia and is widely known as stroke.In fact, every year, about 1.5 million Americans have heart attacks resulting in 500,000 deaths. A heart attack occurs every 20 seconds, which is equivalent to loss of a life approximately every single minute.
As it can be expected, one treatment of ischemia is the extermination of the blockage. Nonetheless, such a removal has the likeliness of making the situation more radical. In the current day, it is possible to dissolve the elements of the clot with specific medication such as tissue adaption. However, the tissue adapted to hyp"

iGEM Meeting 29.03.2010
Die Klonierungs-Software ]Geneious Pro 4.8.3“ wurde von Tobias vorgestellt. Hierzu einige wichtige Tipps:
immer erst am Rechner vorklonieren, dann im Labor nachklonieren!!! Dauert zwar manchmal ein paar Stunden, aber man vermeidet Fehler, die evtl. sonst bis zu 2 Monate Zeit kosten können!
Klonierte Sequenzen und Restriktionsschnittstellen immer annotieren.
Die hergestellten Vektoren werden (über Nacht von GATC) sequenziert (für die Proben gibt’s einen entsprechenden Briefkasten in der Bio II/III) und müssen mit dem theoretischen Vektor abgeglichen werden. Wichtig: Es kommt auf JEDES Nucleotid an, eine 100% Übereinstimmung ist erforderlich.
Mit Hilfe des Programms können über die entprechende Sequenz auch auf Proteinebene Informationen gewonnen werden: Aminosäure-Sequenz, Gewichtsangabe, Länge, Extinktionskoeffizient,…
Es gibt verschiedene Klonierungsstrategien (Infos unter: http://partsregistry.org/Catalog ), ein Beispiel wurde von Kristian vorgestellt.
Von den Plasmiden sollte immer die ganze Sequenz bekannt sein.
Eine kleine Gruppe hat sich bereit erklärt, sich etwas genauer mit der Software auseinanderzusetzen, um hierfür Ansprechpartner zu sein und um möglichst einen Überblick über das ]Kloniergeschehen“ zu behalten. Beim nächsten Meeting werden hierzu weitere Informationen bereitgestellt.
Was noch ansteht: Infos über Helferkonstrukte sammeln (Sequenzen); Modifikationen des AAV; Enzyme, die in den Virus verpackt werden, sollen bald bestellt werden.

Queens_Canada,2012,Team:Queens Canada#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," issues arising from each biobrick part has been noted in the registry; as we work more on each part  we will add additional security concerns as we see fit. Due to the nature of some our parts, dangerous chemicals  such  as  haloalkanes will be used for characterization.
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
For each of the chemical used for characterization, the proper protocol and PPE was put in place due to  its relatively toxic nature compared to the organism  itself. This included handling volatile liquids in the fume hood, wearing  safety gloves  and goggles as necessary. We also asked more qualified members of the lab before attempting anything that we ourselves were not accustomed to doing.
Each member of our lab also received biosafety training before the project began. This included general laboratory safety, biosafety, and hazardous and chemical spill training. In addition, all team members were trained by a lab technician on proper lab techniques and safety procedures.
How could other teams learn from your experience?
Many teams, particularly those in the environmental and manufacturing tracks, may be working with reagents or products that have some toxicity.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Dr. Kenton Ko, the chair of the Biohazard Committee at Queen’s, and Dr. Chin-Sang, another member of the Biohazard Committee, are advisors for our team. Both are very familiar with our project, methods and safety considerations. The work being carried out by our team this year in Dr. Bendena’s lab is considered level 1. All iGEM members have had proper safety training. Good sterile techniques and proper disposal is essential. Dr Bendena’s lab is officially approved for level 1 work by the Biohazard Committee.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
To deal with safety issues in future iGEM Competitions, it may be beneficial to develop a biosafety standard data sheet, based off a similar structure as material safety data sheets. Similar to when you order lab reagents, an BSDS (biosafety data sheet) can be provided with the DNA, which can provide important information about the part in question, what it codes and any concerns with expression in certain chassis or potential hazards. These sheets may also include information about certain chemicals required to characterize or determine expression of parts.
As iGEM teams introduce new chassis"

UNITN-Trento,2015,Team:UNITN-Trento#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," et al. determined that $V_{\max}$ is fixed by the boundary condition that $R_{PR≈}\frac{R_{\sin k}}{10}$ at the highest light irradiance $I=\frac{160mW}{cm^{2}}$. $\; R_{\sin k}≈R_{\mbox{re}s}≈10^{15}\; \Omega$ and $K_{m=}\frac{60mW}{cm^{2}}$. Where light irradiance of $\frac{20mW}{cm^{2}}\;$ is roughly equivalent to PR absorption from solar illumination at sea level. [2]
At the boundary condition:
$Rpr=\frac{R_{\sin k}}{10}=10^{14}\Omega =\left( \frac{V_{\max }*I}{K_{m}+I} \right)^{-1}$
Hence:
$V\max \; =\; \frac{K_{m}+I}{R_{PR}*I}\; =\; 1.375*10^{-14}\; \Omega ^{-1}$
The rate of reaction, $v$, has units of $\Omega ^{\left( -1 \right)}$; through dimensional analysis we can see that $\Omega ^{-1}\; =\; \frac{Amps}{Volts}\; =\frac{coulombs}{\left( \sec ond*voltage \right)}$.          The voltage across the PR, $V_{PR=}0.2\; Volts\;$ [2] and the charge of a proton is $q=1.6*10^{\left( -19 \right)}\; \mbox{C}$.
Therefore we can work out the number of protons pumped by the PR per second as
$N_{Proton}\; =\; \frac{V_{\max }\; I}{K_{m}+I}*\frac{V_{PR}}{q}$
If an electron pair is composed of 10 protons and there is a net gain of 2.5 ATP molecules per electron pair then the number of ATP molecules produced per second is simply:
$N_{ATP}\; =\; \frac{1}{4}N_{Proton}\; =\; \frac{1}{4}*\frac{V_{\max }\; I}{K_{m}+I}*\frac{V_{PR}}{q}$

Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#project#fungal sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," complete construct containing both our fusaric acid inducible promoter and a reporter gene.
Approach
To isolate the pp1262 gene and the downstream intergenic region, two promoters containing the RFC10 parts were used in a PCR reaction on the genomic DNA of P. putida KT2440. The product was ligated into pSB1C3 and transformed into chemically competent E. coli cells. The part was digested again and ligated upstream of several different reporter genes. BBa_I13507, which contains an RBS, mRFP and two terminators was successfully transformed. However, after sequencing it became clear that this BioBrick did not contain mRFP, making it unsuitable for this experiment . This problem has been reported to the registry. BBa_I13504 - which contains an RBS, GFP and two terminators - was used for further experiments. This reporter construct combined with our promoter part was ligated and transformed into E. coli. Sequencing confirmed the successful assembly. This construct should only show green fluorescence in the presence of fusaric acid, and no fluorescence when fusaric acid is absent.
The E. coli cells, containing the construct were grown on agar plates containing different concentrations of fusaric acid. At 140µM, there was no significant difference between the transformed cells and the control cells. At higher concentrations the cells died, due to their inability to pump the acid out of the cell. Since small amounts of fusaric acid are lethal to E. coli, this is not suitable as a host to test the expression.
The construct was transformed into a different backbone (pSB1K3) and inserted into electrocompetent P. putida cells. The transformed cells were again grown on plates containing different concentrations of fusaric acid. A slight difference in colour could be observed between the transformed cells and the wild-type cells, indicating that the promoter is only active when fusaric acid is present (see Figure 3).
Figure 3. Both plates contain 4 strains of transformed P. putida, containing the BBa_K1493003 . The right plate contains 50µg/ml kanamycin and 50µg/ml fusaric acid, whereas the left plate only contains 50µg/ml kanamycin. A slightly increased fluorescence can be observed in the right plate, indicating the promoter is induced by the fusaric acid.
A growth experiment was performed in a 96-wells plate, containing 0, 55, 140, 285, 565 and 1415µM (0"
Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html," detect a small molecule that is associated with gastroenteritis-causing Campylobacter only - not in any other non-pathogenic subspecies of the Campylobacter genus – nor present in any other bacteria that might be inhabit a poultry-carcass environment. Additionally, in this ideal scenario, a well-characterised E. coli gene regulatory system with a strong output expression level would already exist.
Sensation
We identified two molecules of interest from Campylobacter for detection. One was xylulose, a 5-carbon ketopentose sugar. The second was the quorum sensing molecule autoinducer-2. Xylulose is a rare sugar most commonly associated with the pentosephosphate pathway, where xylulose-5-phosphate is an intermediate step. Interestingly, xylulose was found in the polysaccharide capsule of Campylobacter jejuni strain RM1221 [1] . The presence of xylulose is not common in bacterial polysaccharide capsules, and the glyosidic bonds which incorporate xylulose were found to be extremely acid-labile. One sub-project aimed to exploit a xylulose-associated transcriptional activator system (mtlR-mtlE) from Pseudomonas fluorescens . Another subproject aimed to mutagenize the well-characterised arabinose transcriptional regulatory system (araC-pBAD) from E. coli and modify its ligand specificity to the closely related structure of xylulose . Our engineering subproject designed a functional prototype biosensor device that simplified a process of dissolving a swabbed input sample, processing the solution through acid and high temperature to release xylulose, and then delivering the sample to a waiting strain of genetically modified bacterial carrying the biosensor circuit for detection. Finally, purified xylulose is extremely expensive to purchase commercially, so for the testing of our biosensor we attempted to biosynthesise and purify the sugar ourselves .  The other molecule we identified as a marker for Campylobacter was autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a secreted quorum sensing molecule. AI-2 is a significantly less specific biomarker, as many varied gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species sense their population density and surrounding bacterial environment using this molecule [2] . On the other hand, this ubiquity meant that AI-2 gene regulation was well characterised, with prior iGEM teams having worked on the natural E. coli AI-2 quorum sensing regulatory system.

9.8(B)
The key point of our meeting today is to summarize our process of the experiments.  On the whole, we have a very good start at the beginning of this term. However, for many different kinds of reasons, especially the failure in separating PCR products and primer dimers when extracting plasmids, and the troubles like low recycle rate of gel, mistakes in electrophoresis like no separating bands were repeatedly spotted during the process.
However, we should feel grateful that we finally succeeded in the electroporation yesterday. It's our first success after 6 failures since last month.
As for anaerobic promoters, we finally decided the following 18 ones, and they are K387003, K404106, K227007, K376003, K239005, K239006, K376003, K288005, J61043, K387009, PadhE, PgadA, PgadE, PhdeA, PftnA, PldhA.  Among these promoters, half of them are from iGEM committee, while the others are found from our references.
As for the report genes, we initially decided to use both GFP and luciferase as our report genes.  However, as we have not much time to finish both of them for 18 anaerobic promoters, we have to give up GFP.
9.13(all)
Today, we want to talk about the process of our two groups of experiments.
On the whole, we have good results for both of the experiments.  As the experiments of A began in June and had an early start, they seem to be more successful and have already been in the final stage.  However, when it comes to our experiments of B, we have all kinds of problems, staying in a cycle period of different failures for a long time. Anyway, we are moving forward.
As for the wiki, we made some changes for it, deleting some useless parts. Besides, in order to better reflect our Chinese style, we also have some changes for our logo.
As the competition is approaching, we have more trivial things to do.  Apart from the experiments, we need to prepare for other kinds of materials.   We have a new arrangement for them and hope everyone can try his/her best for our final work.

Protein Cages
Proteins naturally have evolved to self-assemble into supramolecular structures often playing a role in complex cellular functions.  These supramolecular structures are built mostly by copies of the same protein subunit and are arranged in a symmetric fashion through non-covalent bonding. Though we see these in nature through specific proteins, what if we were able to engineer our own protein subunits and create complex structures for our own applications?
A proven way to form these supramolecular structures is to engineer a self-assembling protein molecule as a fusion of two different, naturally oligomeric protein domains. In order to get a pre-defined, homogenous structure, the two components must be fused in a way that follows specific angular rules. To satisfy this requirement, the two proteins fused are required to have terminal alpha helices and are attached by an alpha helix preferring molecule. This allows the fused protein subunit to be sturdy without variance in its bond angles and allows us to predict with more accuracy on how the structure is going to form.  This technique has worked and the predicted cage-like structure was achieved through a 12 subunit assembly.
What can we do with such a cage? The most obvious application that comes to mind is drug delivery. We might be able to engineer a protease induced cleavage cite onto our cage making it an efficient delivery system where the cage breaks open the moment it comes in contact with its inducer and releases the drug. This technology can even lead to formation of protein cages made up of human proteins with non-immunogenic properties. Such a cage would have an immense impact in field of drug delivery and in the field of medicine as a whole."
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," is the fact that it can be freeze-dried and thus stored effectively for a long time and is ready off-the-shelf. This makes prescriptions and availability easier.
Hospitals
Hospitals have similar interests as physicians: fighting resistant bacteria via the reduced use of common antibiotics and easy storage through freeze-drying. At the same time, limiting the treatment cost is a high priority for hospitals.
Nurses
For the people applying the patch, the nurses, ease of application is important. This is ensured by designing the patch like band-aid. This is also important for their skills on using it, as not much has to be changed in their training or surroundings to learn how to apply such a patch. However, as they are the ones handling the wound healing patch, they are concerned by making the patch as safe as possible as well. Reducing chemical toxicity is their main interest along with the fact that the bacteria inside the gel do not pose a risk to the nurses.
Insurance companies
Our contact at Plasmacure , Koen Lim, had been working for several insurance companies. He could thus inform us about the wound care market, as we described on the Applied Design page. Koen Lim expected that our product will drastically decrease health care costs once it is fully functional. Wound care currently costs Dutch society over 3 billion euros (1), so a cost reduction would be welcomed by insurance companies.
Society
As the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria is a major problem for society, it is our responsibility to reduce the systemic use of these antibiotics. We are trying to achieve this by using bacteriocins, and not common antibiotics to reduce the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. Another thing that we have to take into account however is that there is fear among people about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). People are afraid of potential dangers. As an iGEM team, it is thus importance to increase awareness of the benefits of GMOs as well as of the danger of and preventive measures against antibiotic resistance. On top of that, we should highlight the additional safety layers introduced by our design . We tried to contribute to this through our education and outreach .
Government
The government is responsible for regulations to ensure GMO safety. As Gelcatraz introduces a safer method of working with GMOs outside of the laboratory, it may form an incentive to reconsider the regulations in certain cases. Obviously, this should only happen when the safety is guaranteed and will require a social debate. Furthermore, the government is faced with the problem of antibiotic resistance. Charged with the responsibility of finding a solution, the government would most likely welcome"

July 29
(TR) I ran the product from Monday on a gel and found our PCR didn't work this time.
July 30
(TR,CB) We began the process of researching about N europaea and N eutropha.  Both would be easier to work with because they can withstand transformation through electroporation and N multiformis can't.
Week of August 8
Aug 4
(TR,CB) We received word that the N europaea is not growing, but the other two are, so we refined our research to just N eutropha.  Using metacyc.org in conjunction with NCBI, we found that the serB gene in N eutropha would probably be the best gene to target in order to make N eutropha auxotrophic for serine.
Aug 6
(TR,CB) We did another SOEing PCR on the front and back of our N multiformis auxotrophy insert using q5.
Aug 7
(TR) I came in and checked the PCR from yesterday on a gel.  It was unsuccessful again. I am not sure why it was working before but isn't now.  I wonder if something happened to the PCR product we have frozen of our two halves.  I am tempted to just focus on N eutropha now because we will be able to electroporate it, which will be much easier than conjugation.
Week of August 15
Aug 11
(TR,CB) The decision was made that, since we are probably not going to use N multiformis as our chassis any more, we will just focus on N eutropha for now.
Aug 13
(TR) I went ahead and designed primers to be used with N eutropha to knock out the SerB gene and hopefully make it auxotrophic for serine.  Here they are;
Forward 1: overhang compatibility - bamHI - front of front 500 bp homology block

7)When bacteria spread in human bodies, they could be controlled effectively by antibiotics.  Unlike virus, most bacteria parasitic in tumors cannot survive in cells.  Their function is to deliver relevant target anti-cancer genes.  Meanwhile, bacteria occupy certain parts both outside and inside of cells, competing for nutrition with tumor cells.
8)If we combine bacteria therapy with traditional chemotherapy, targeting on both internal and external parts of tumors, we could get more ideal curative effects. 2
Once the bacteria penetrate into the tumor, bacteria can replicate unimpededly by the macrophage and neutrophil clearance mechanisms that normally serve to eliminate them.  At the same time, they can sensitize the immune system to induce tumor clearance.
Dating back to 19th century, researchers have found out that some tumors of cancer patients shrank after infections of bacteria.  In 1860s, a German surgeon tried to use Streptococcus to cure a female patient with neck tumor who was near death, pioneering in curing cancer with bacteria therapy.  After that, bacteria therapy started to be applied in tumor treatment.  However, people could not take control of those bacteria drugs at that time, and terrible side effects occurred sometimes.  In some cases, the tumors didn't reduce and the patient died of bacteremia.  This side effect became the biggest inhibition for the development of bacteria treatment.  Therefore, US Federal Regulators cracked down this dangerous therapy a century later and demanded more clinical trials to improve bacteria treatment, hoping to decrease this side effect.
3 Salmonella
1)The bacteria we normally use today vary from obligate anaerobes (Clostridium and Bifidobacterium for instance) to facultative anaerobes (Salmonella and Escherichia for instance).  In the late 20th century, some scientists from Yale chose an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium as a new drug against solid tumors like melanoma.  Compared to common microorganism, this Salmonella Typhimurium has the following unique advantages.
1)The modified bacteria can infect human and mice with high invasiveness and low pathogenecity.  Concerning no ideal animal models at present and the infections caused by Salmonella in human and mice are similar, mouse models are usually used in researches to conduct the preclinical evaluation of the anti-cancer effect of Salmonella. 5

Wearing Lab Coats
The IIT Delhi iGEM team whole-heartedly collaborated with Berlin team. Berlin team was working on the affordable, practical and effective diagnostic of the widespread third world parasitic disease -Tapeworm Infection. Since India is one of the countries where millions of people are infected by this parasite, IIT Delhi directed Berlin team to a suitable site. It was a hospital in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh where many cases of tapeworm were reported. After the successful extraction and lysis of the Tapeworm eggs, Berlin team obtained RNA molecules of the T. Solium species of the Tapeworm. IIT Delhi further assisted them by providing our own lab as -20 and -80 degrees centigrade refrigerators and other required lab apparatus were not available in the above-mentioned hospital. Sequencing of the RNA was also done and all the samples were shipped to them.
This was not only constricted to iGEM collaboration as we further plan to adopt this technology for affordable diagnostic of tapeworm infection which is otherwise done using fecal inspection using a microscope. This would help in timely detection of infection and thus would save lives of many people. Following this, Berlin team provided us the protease stains without Degradation Tags required by us to generate oscillations in the form of a square.

Experiments (Build) & Results (Test)
We first verifed the function of gut inflammation thiosulfate and tetrathionate sensors by sfGFP expression in E. coli Top10 and E. coli Nissle 1917. After the experimental simulation to confirm that colorful bacteria (expressing chromoproteins) are able to work even in the condition of “excrement” (actually curry),  we replaced the sensors’ reporter by gfasPurple, asPink, amilCP, respectively. While thiosulfate sensor works with chromoproteins as expected, the tetrathionate sensor does’t response very well. Accordingly we changed its reporter to a dark-green molecular-protoviolaceinic acid, which successfully solved the problem. At last, we experimentally demonstrated that E. coli cells carrying our engineered sensor-reporting systems are quite promising to detect gut inflammation in real medical scenarios.
Verifying the function of ThsS/R & TtrS/R
ThsS/R
ThsS (BBa_K2507000) and ThsR (BBa_K2507001), both codon-optimized for E. coli, are two basic parts which belong to the two-component system from the marine bacterium Shewanella halifaxensis. ThsS is the membrane-bound sensor kinase (SK) which can sense thiosulfate outside the cell, and ThsR is the DNA-binding response regulator(RR). PphsA(BBa_K2507018) is a ThsR-activated promoter which is turned on when ThsR is phosphorylated by ThsS after ThsS senses thiosulfate.
Because thiosulfate is an indicator of intestinal inflammation (Levitt et al, 1999; Jackson et al, 2012; Vitvitsky et al, 2015), the ThsS/R system can be used as a sensor for intestinal inflammation. Our experiments confirmed that the system indeed works as a thiosulfate sensor, both in Escherichia coli Top10 and E. coli Nissle 1917. By linking thsR with sfgfp (BBa_K2507008), chromoprotein genes (BBa_K2507009, BBa_K2507010"

“Some of the striking differences that I come across are how [academia] funds stuff and how you decide to do it.”
“There is more division of labor in academic lab, they have technicians and buy equipment, etc. while we have to make equipment, clean ourselves, etc.”
Describe the workshop program. Which experiments did you undertake?
“We started at Hackspace firstly, trying to make competent E. coli as a carrier for the biobrick. Then we amplified the plasmid backbone, which would be to carry the biobrick. Then we went to UCL and amplified the genes from Oceanibulbus indoloflex - the antifreeze and mercury reductase - and now we're back at the Hackspace trying to amplify these genes again in our own environment.”
What was your motivation to participate?
“We needed some outside input to improve our techniques and experiments.”
“I was interested in getting a grasp on the professional techniques, taking [my skills] to the next level.”
What specific aims did you have for the workshop?
“I wanted to raise the quality of our work in the backspace.”
“One of my aims was to collaborate and meet other great people.”
Could the workshop have been improved?
“It would be great to have some learning & illustrative videos from the whole process… maybe we can do that in the Hackspace.”
Did the workshop add to your perspective on Biohacking?
“[Our collaboration] gave [biohacking] a more professional perspective”
“I don't see a need to separate the collaboration and biohacking. We're doing the same sort of stuff, the difference is the social context that we're doing it in. If I were an academic working on a lab, that would be my living and that would put constraints on it, because I’d have deadlines to keep and people assess my work. The interesting thing about [biohacking] is that it is less constrained in that way but we created other kinds of constraints for us in the process, particularly resources.”
