SUMMARY
Design
The purpose of our project originated after a brainstorm discussion on what problems most affected Baltimore City citizens. We went through ideas such as air pollution and curing cancer, and presented our project ideas to each of our team members. However, the projects that really stood out to our team were the clot making and clot breaking.  The clot making team focused on treating trauma injuries, such as those caused by gun violence. We knew that with Baltimore City having one of the highest murder rates per capita in the country, it was important to figure out a way to lessen the rate of murders through treatment. We noticed that current bandages and sponges with coagulation enzymes were expensive, and also wanted to make sure that our final product would be cost effective for Baltimore citizens.
The clot breaking team looked at diseases that were caused by clot formation, such as strokes and heart disease. Other than being known for violence, Baltimore has a high rate of heart disease which often goes untreated. The clot breaking team wanted to use a product that was more cost effective than tPA but had the same level or better level of efficiency.
After the clot making and clot breaking team presented their ideas, the entire Baltimore BioCrew team was split between picking the clot making or clot breaking team for our 2018 iGEM project, so we picked both.
Once we had our projects decided, we began to conduct research on how to design our constructs.
The clot making team looked at ways that previous teams have coagulated blood. The first team that we came across was the 2016 Lethbridge High School team, who used Cerastotin (Horned desert viper) as their enzyme for coagulation. We saw that they were successful and decided to contact Dr. Brian Dempsey, who gave us more information about their team’s constructs. Upon hearing about these constructs, we decided to make three constructs that included their original construct. For all of the constructs, we codon optimized for E.coli. One construct included a His-tag for nickel column purification and a LacI"

3. We have a wide variety of HP. During the presentation, we listed them one by one but it was too complicated. So when we are in Boston, we will pay more attention to this and pick HP highlights to introduce. The above problems also exist in the experimental part. We should take a more concise expression. We explained too many experimental details, but we did not grasp enough in the overall work introduction. We improved PPt to make it clearer and easier to understand.
4. As for poster, we also got a lot of inspiration through CCiC. We improved it and made the poster layout design more reasonable. We also beautified the poster style and enriched the poster content.

OVERVIEW
HBUT-China 2018 participated in three main aspects of integrated human practice. First, we focused on the issue of lake protection and management in Wuhan, and conducted a field survey. Inspired by a staff member on the front line of a Wuhan Lake Protection agency, we decided to design a machine that detects the concentration of nickel ions in the environment. To better help solve environmental problems, we actively searched the literature, then using what we found, designed and built a nickel ion detection system in S. cerevisiae.
Research on Lake Protection and Management in Wuhan
Abstract
Our country attaches great importance to the construction of an ecological civilization, and promotes a basic national policy to protect the environment.
Our project aims to address the problem of nickel ion pollution in water. In Wuhan, water resources account for one quarter of the city area, and there are more than 200 lakes throughout the city. We learned from the newspaper that the speed of modernization of Wuhan has accelerated in recent years. The conflicts between lakes and urban commercial land are becoming more and more serious. The protection of lakes is urgent, and the call for protecting them is growing. In addition to the education of the public about synthetic biology, we feel that it is very necessary to investigate the protection and management"

Why Mars?
When asked of the prospect of human colonization on Mars, Stephen Hawking stated that, “It will completely change the future of the human race and maybe determine whether we have any future at all.” (Hawking, Stephen) While most would imagine that billions of dollars that are gone into space exploration would be best used fighting world hunger, or finding a solution for poverty - a never ending problem that we must resolve as members of a society - it is also important to think long-term, and what would be of the human population 100 years, maybe even a thousand years from now. The only home that we as humans have ever known has been Earth. However, as our population increases at an exponential rate (Haub, Carl), and surviving as a species on a tiny blue planet in the vacuum of space is no longer a guarantee, it is vital to start thinking of the alternatives, the possibilities of colonization within the cosmos.
A classic example would be the extinction of the dinosaurs, who roamed the Earth for over 65 million years prior to us, only for them to remain as nothing but fossilized remnants of what used to be: all because of one colossal asteroid. There are no longer traces of said dinosaurs walking the planet, so what if this happens to the human species? This is similar to the risk of monoculturing crops, where having only one species is dangerous, on the off chance of that a pathogen wipes out the entire population. If the human species is only limited to thriving on Earth, what will happen if Earth was not there? What if one colossal asteroid, or perhaps a natural disaster wipes out the entire human existence? Whatever it may be, one thing is for sure: placing humans on more than one planet will allow for our existence to exist for thousands, if not millions, more years from now.
How Did We Get Here?
With the rapid rate of technological advancements over the past few decades, the idea of space colonization has been brought closer and has become a more tangible goal than ever before. Mars, our interstellar neighbor, a planet with the same heat-range as that of Earth, has become the prime target for"
Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," used for the synthesis of perilous products. There is however a straight-forward justification for either of the aforementioned dangers: Firstly, to avert unintended production of hazardous substances, we intend to include several precautions within our software, which is elaborated on in the according section. Secondly, someone contemplating malicious abuse of our proposed framework, would also have the chance to produce the dangerous substances by chemical synthesis.
As we, in our project intend to offer a more efficient way of recycling gold from electronic waste, we consider the implications of our projects for the environment a central point in our safety considerations. This reaches from the basic avoidance of contamination, which we ensure by good laboratory practice, to learning from and discussing with professionals about biosafety and precautions for the environment during an ABC-defense training (atomic, biological and chemical weapons) at the German Armed Forces. Please refer to our Scientific Outreach , for further details on that.

Software-Safety
Our software team developed the NRPSDesigner, a web application capable of suggesting cloning strategies for the creation of artificial NRP-synthetases, which can synthesize a peptide of choice. This software is built upon a database of domains, origins and products. The very nature of this project meant that we were confronted with safety issues all web developers face, as well as by issues specific to the biological underpinnings of our software. The latter overlapped in many cases with our considerations throughout the wetlab projects.
Any web application has to deal with diverse attacks of malicious intent. Dealing with these was simplified by using Django, a stable web framework. Such frameworks try to trivialize common tasks in the work of a web developer and of course safety issues fall into this category. For example, Django provides a mechanism for protection against cross site request forgery attempts, in which a malicious site can cause actions in the server by using the credentials of a logged-in user. The Django development team also uses a very strict process for dealing with new security issues in a timely and safe fashion by initially fixing these through private, confidential channels. Once the patches have been applied, the security issue is publicly disclosed, so that server maintainers can update to the latest Django version. As an example, this September a set of security releases were issued by the Django development team in order to remedy a problem with denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Of course, after being informed of this release, we immediately updated the Django version running on our server to the latest one.
A second issue arising during web development, is the safety of a user's confidential data. Again Django provides an in-built authentication"

BBa_K1459001 - PmrA
Protein name: PmrA Other names: basR, parA Gene name: basR Source organism for the data: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. strain LT2 / SGSC1412 / ATCC 700720 UniProtKB signature: P36556 Gene sequence RefSeq accession number: NC_003197.1 Protein sequence RefSeq accession number: NP_463157.1 Length: 222 aa Molecular mass: 25,035 Da Cellular localization: cytoplasmic Biological function: transcription regulator
The PmrA protein is a cognate response regulator of the histidine kinase PmrB. Upon phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA undergoes dimerization which dramatically increases its affinity for promoter DNA. This allows it to regulate expression of a number of genes, usually coding for LPS- modifying enzymes. In our project, we used the PmrA unchanged, for it to serve as an transcription inductor for our reporter - the GFP, expressed under the control of the PmrC promoter, i.e. the promoter of one of the genes involved in LPS modification. Notably, however, there is no PmrC gene"

Northwestern University
With our projects united in their focus on outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), Northwestern University and UNSW came together for what felt like a very natural collaboration. Skype calls and emails enabled our two teams to overcome the distance barrier, and share critical information and advice that aided the progression of our two projects.
Northwestern University began their project with the use of a ready-prepared TolA knock-out strain of E. coli that also overexpressed TolR. This strain was given to them by a laboratory contact who had already demonstrated demonstrated OMV overproduction in this strain. For our team, this information validated our choice to include a TolA knock-out strain, and TolR overexpression strain in our library of E. coli for comparison of OMV production alongside our other strains. By including these two strains in our library and comparing their OMV production capabilities against other strains, our results can help validate the results of Northwestern University.
Importantly, throughout the iGEM competition both of our teams openly shared protocols for OMV purification. These protocols were essential for the success of both our teams, and by actively sharing feedback, troubleshooting and advice on the operation of these experiments, our results were largely furthered. For example, our team suggested alternatives to ultracentrifugation, since access was an issue for Northwestern University, and we both shared outcomes achieved with the use of different filter sizes. Furthermore, both of our teams were also testing periplasmic localisation of fluorescent proteins, and thus this was another area of protocol and results sharing.
This was a far-reaching collaboration, that reached the core of both of our projects, and we thank Northwestern University for their extensive communication with our team throughout the competition.
Please visit the experiment page to see details of our protocols, including the ones developed with the Northwestern University iGEM team.
Sydney Australia
Unlike our collaboration with Northwestern University, our partnership with the University of Sydney iGEM team was not limited by geographical distance. Thus, we made the most of our ability to share wet-lab materials and perform experiments in order to validate each other’s expression systems.

Toronto,2017,Team:Toronto#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," inserts are being assembled into a vector (or 4-6 fragments are being assembled)
Notes:
Efficiency of assembly decreases as the number or length of inserts increases
The mass of each insert can be measured using the NanoDrop instrument, with absorbance at 260nm or estimated from agarose gel electrophoresis followed by  ethidium bromide staining.
Yields will be best when the the different inserts are present in equimolar concentrations.
Inserts to be assembled should not have stable single stranded DNA secondary structure, such as a hairpin or a stem loop, or repeated sequences, as this would directly compete with the required single-stranded annealing/priming of neighboring assembly fragments.
The Gibson Cloning Master Mix consists of three different enzymes within a single buffer. Each enzyme has a specific and unique function for the reaction:
T5 Exonuclease: creates single-strand DNA 3’ overhangs by chewing back from the DNA 5’ end. Complementary DNA fragments can subsequently anneal to each other.
Phusion DNA Polymerase: incorporates nucleotides to “fill in” the gaps in the annealed DNA fragments.
Taq DNA Ligase: covalently joins the annealed complementary DNA fragments, removing any nicks and creating a contiguous DNA fragment.

It was discovered going through the plates that there is a strong need to consolidate the glycerol stocks.  It appears that there are several plates containing transformations that have never been made into glycerol stocks, but because the shared list is incomplete, it is hard to say.
Number of colonies on the 1:1 plate:

mCherry - 587 ex, 610 em and EYFP - 514 ex, 527 em
Took cultures out of incubator around 2:25 pm, 20 hr and 25 min.
Discovered lack of growth in several of the cultures from last night, especially those whose carbon source was galactose.  This could simply be due to the fact that the tubes with galactose were innoculated after each respective tube containing dextrose, such that the dextrose tubes had first contact with each colony.  All dex tubes experienced growth except for

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," Pcar [BBa_K861171] is a glucose responsive promoter created by WHU-China in 2012. Pcar promoter region was de novo  designed with overlapping of CRP and RNA polymerase binding site. The initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase may be hindered by the binding of CRP, which occurs at the formation of cAMP-CRP complex in the low concentration of glucose. In other words, when the amount of glucose is high enough, Pcar would be turned on after the leaving of CPR due to the low concentration of cAMP, and vice versa.
PI promoter [BBa_K861170] is a modified version to Pcar with correction of -10 position in the promoter region, which gives the promoter stronger activity and a weaker CRP interaction. The PI promoter [BBa_K861170] was used as a major part in the work of team NCKU_Tainan in 2016. These two parts have been used in our work.
PhlF repressor system contains the repressor PhlF [BBa_K1725041] and the PhlF repressible promoter [BBa_K1725001] created by Glasgow in 2015. PhlF could repress GFP fluorescence intensity by 83-fold according to the study of Glasgow’s work.
We’ve innovated this year a novel glucose responsive repressor system (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230012]) by connecting these two system and extend the function of them. Furthermore, based on this new system, we assembled lysis and nuclease genes to the device and created the suicide circuit controlled by the presence of glucose (Pcar-wRBS-PhlF-T-Pr-sRBS-GFP-sRBS-lysis-sRBS-NucA/pSB1C3 [BBa_K2230017]).
Lysis gene [BBa_K117000] created by NTU-Singapore in 2008 encodes Lysis protein which could not only lyse bacterial cell membrane but also activate the endonuclease of Colicin E7 (ColE7). The lysis-colicin is one class of bacteriocins which are produced to response to worsening environmental conditions and outcompete other bacteria1.

Part Promoter(Sequence, BioBrickID);
Promoter p1, p2, p3;
The instance Promoter will store part type: Promoter, the properties that Promoter can have, which are Sequence and BioBrickID, and objects stores the instances p1, p2, p3, where each instance will have its own list of property values.
Wednesday continued working on the grammar, tried to generate the parser and lexer code and ran into lots of errors. The error message that ANTLR gives seem not specific enough, so decided to debug my code by creating a new grammar and copying slowly part by part. The problem turn out to be when one declares a grammar rule, it has to be in such specific way that left recursion will not occur, for example:
expr: declareObj expr | instantObje expr | instantObje | declareObj;
would cause left recursion and errors. One way to solve that problem, is follwing:
program: expr*;
expr: declarObj | instantObje;
The sign * means that multiple statements of declaring Objects and instantiating them will be accepted by the compiler
Thursday met with Professor Hilfinger to get some feedback on the language design, possible useful considerations:
Creation of modules -> certain areas of code that do the same thing and only the parameters differ can be included in modules
Ability to import modules into larger structures
Rule scope -> need to know to which part rules apply
Conceptual language behind the syntax, what structures, data types should we use?
Decide on the interpreter/parser, right now it seems we are going to stick with ANTLR
Friday discussed with Doug Plug-In Model:
new Clotho/Plug-In Model
Right now we have five interfaces. In order to create new Plug-Ins one needs to extend one of those interfaces. It would be easier to have one main interface which contains the methods and an abstract class that implements the interface. Therefore if we want to create new Plug-Ins the class just needs to extend the abstract class and override the needed method.
Continued to work on the grammar and the semantic actions. Added print functionality. The following statements work so far: PROGRAM
Property someprop(txt);
Property someprop2(txt);
Property RelativeStrength(num);
Part customP(Sequence, BioBrickID);
customP.addProperties(RelativeStrength);

1.  Optimization of butanol fermentation process
Increasing the yield and rate of butanol is a hot and difficult point in current biobutanol research. Butanol synthesis is affected by many environmental conditions such as temperature, initial pH, and inoculum (initial OD). We constructed a kinetic equation for the synthesis of butanol, performed a kinetic analysis of the factors affecting butanol fermentation, and optimized the butanol synthesis process to increase butanol production. [1].
1.1  Test design
In the butanol fermentation process, how to control the temperature（\({x_1}\)）,initial PH（\({x_2}\)）, initial OD（\({x_3}\)）, so that the butanol yield（\(y\)）is the highest ? To do this, we need to explore the quantitative relationship between y and \({x_1}\), \({x_2}\), \({x_3}\). The quantitative relationship between them can be expressed by the following model:
\[y = f({x_1},{x_2},{x_3})\]
Since the response surface equation \(y = f({x_1},{x_2},{x_3})\)is unknown , a test (sampling) is required, and the experimental data obtained from the finite test is used to estimate f (by partial estimation of the whole). We chose the Box-Behnken Design (BBD) method to design the test. [2][3]. The test point arrangement is shown in Fig.1.

Each DNA part and the vector backbone were synthesised to overlap by about 30 bp. An exonuclease, ligase and polymerase are then used to generate complementary single strands at the ends of each DNA fragment, and seamlessly join them together in a single isothermal reaction.

The BsaI restriction endonuclease cuts the DNA outside of the restriction site producing DNA fragments with 4 bp overhangs. The 4 bp overhangs are used to join to overhangs on another DNA fragment through complementary base pairing.

DNA Design
DNA was designed from K. stuttgarteinsis protein sequences corresponding to the gamma, beta, and alpha subunits of Hydrazine Synthase (GenBank accessions CAJ73611.1 [1] CAJ73612.1 [2] and CAJ73613.1 [3] , respectively). This DNA was reverse translated first using the Sequence Manipulation Suite [4] , and ultimately using software developed by our team.
The program we developed takes FASTA formatted protein sequence(s) in a single file and reverse translates them to DNA, using codons preferred by E. coli. Furthermore, the program will eliminate any of the standard BioBrick restriction sites from the DNA sequence (i.e. EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI), while preserving the encoded information. Finally, the sequence will be changed (again, while preserving the encoded information) so as to eliminate any repetitive blocks of 8 nucleotides; that is, any pattern of 8 nucleotides that occurs more than once in the sequence. This last step is performed to satisfy a requirement imposed by IDT during synthesis.
The program, protein2bioBrick , is freely available in this zip package, that includes a stand-alone executable JAR file, the source code, and some example data. Your computer must have some Java package already installed in order to use the program.
Restriction Enzyme Cloning
Using the DNA designed above and ordered from our gracious sponsor, Integrated DNA Technologies, we proceeded to clone the three HZS genes into the standard BioBrick vector, pSB1C3, through routine restriction enzyme digestion and ligation.
Our strategy for this initial step and subsequent cloning steps was to take advantage of the standard BioBrick restriction sites, EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI. Our apparently unique strategy involved a triple digest to circumvent the need for gel purification of the desired fragment. This strategy is highlighted in the following diagram:
The top panel depicts two standard BioBrick plasmids, both with the same antibiotic resistance. For example, this could be combining a promoter (like R0011) with one of our composite parts, K1952003 (RBS + HZS-gamma). The first plasmid is cut with EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI. The second plasmid is cut with EcoRI,"

Courtney and Nicole received notice on Friday afternoon and put together a two-part presentation that included a streamlined strawberry DNA extraction and “Creature Feature,” an adapted visual model of genetic engineering applications. The 60 teens had been taught about DNA, and were able isolate strawberry DNA using a streamlined kit designed by the iGEM team. With this new version of the strawberry DNA extraction, it took approximately 15 minutes of lab time, along with 20 minutes of an accompanying lecture that discussed the science behind a DNA extraction and how the extraction is useful for genetic engineering. This activity transitioned into the second lab, which focused on demonstrating how genetic engineering can help in situations where “creatures” may not have the characteristics to survive in a new environment. Students were given construction materials based on the genetic sequence they created out of beads, and tasked with the creation of a creature. This creature had to undergo a survival test due to an external force placing too much pressure on its evolutionary adaptations and so synthetic biology concepts came up as a way to help their creatures out by giving it a new feature. At the end of the lesson (and the dunk test), we had a discussion on real-world applications of synthetic biology, DNA extractions, and genetic engineering.
“I want to do that (genetic engineering) when I grow up!” –Student
“We have more DNA!” –Student
“My (strawberry) DNA looks like cotton-candy!” –Student
“I’m gonna buy my creature an airline ticket so that it can survive the Great Flood” – Student
“Please survive… please survive” -Student
On a follow-up: “I'm excited about the new kits! The kids had a really good time with those activities and I thought the lessons were highly engaging. I'll pass on the information about the new kits to the rest of my science team.” – Hilary Buttenfield, Teacher at ECS

Andrew: Viability checks from weekend were recorded and showed viability in all conditions.  Each condition was plated again for checking viability.  A digest was run for GFP in preparation for testing universal RBS strengths, created early on in the summer. Two LB plates were made to begin testing dilutions for proper dilution factor of CFU counts on actual protocol run. This is expected to begin before Friday of this week and terminate before July.  A gel was then prepared for running the GFP digestion followed by loading a remaining PCR sample along with the GFP.  Early bacterial growth on dilution plates showed definite decrease in CFU density, providing optimism for finding appropriate dilution factor.
Archana: Updated budget. Edited thank you note to backers. Provided feedback on Experiment campaign slide for Bindley lobby. Overlooking Biomakers website posts. Researching and emailing companies about propane canister discounts. Worked on press release. Called up Sheraton and ThermoFisher. Provided feedback on Biomakers website posts.

Berkeley,2010,Team:Berkeley#Clotho_-_-_TEXT.html,"o.  So we decided to recode a simplified automation framework using the ideas from the Kepler project.
A single Actor object in Clotho. The green boxes represent InputPorts, which describe the inputs to the Actor, while the red boxes represent OutputPorts. Each InputPort or OutputPort specifies the type of data it receives or outputs, respectively. This allows Actors to be chained together to form workflows
What we came up with is illustrated above. A unit of automation is called an Actor, which executes some algorithm. Each Actor defines a set of InputPorts and OutputPorts, and each Input/Output port only works with one type of data. Thus, the set of ports of an Actor specifies how it can interact with other Actors. Actors allow developers to reuse code from other developers, as well as allowing users to chain together Actors written by different developers into new workflows, customized for their own needs.
Multiple actors can be chained together to form a workflow. Clotho is able to check that all InputPorts not connected to an OutputPort are fed some initial data, after which the Actors are exectued in order.
A workflow is built by connecting the inputs and outputs of multiple Actors. After a workflow has been constructed and fed initial data, Clotho will execute the Actors in the workflow according to the partial ordering defined by the workflow (which is a directed acyclic graph). Users can construct workflows using the scripting interface provided by Clotho. In addition, a graphical interface to build workflows is currently under development by the Clotho team. These tools will make it easy for users to share their automated workflows with the community.
Data Model
Potentially the most fundamental change this summer was a shift from dynamic data models to a static Clotho data model. In previous years, Clotho tried to remain data model agnostic by allowing users to define their own data model. However, this introduces major problems for developers trying to build tools for Clotho. If one tool is built assuming one data model, then it is unlikely to be compatible with another tool built assuming a different data model. Even worse, if a user changes the data model after installing a tool, the tool could be rendered nonfunctional.
Because we could see no good solution to the problems generated by a dynamic data model, we adopted a new architecture that presents two layers of data exchange.  Tools directly receive and send data using a standardized datamodel to Clotho's Core, and then the Core exchanges data through ClothoConnection Apps to databases using whatever schema is encoded in the database. In this way, we get the best of both worlds.  Tools all work with the same"

About KIT
KIT, Kyoto Institute of Technology, is a national university in Kyoto, which had been the capital city of Japan for more than a thousand years. KIT was founded to do research on silk and textile, important for artistic kimono industries for Kyoto.   Though its name has 'technology' in it, KIT is a fusion of science and arts. KIT has been committed in the genetics more recently. A good example is the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC), which collects stocks of Drosophila, an essential model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. The institute has also collaborated actively with industries in Kyoto and beyond.   KIT's competence is beyond science. It also has arts and design courses.   KIT is a place of robust science and creative arts. We will exert our strength as students of KIT. We are very proud of competing with wonderful students in other universities in iGEM. We will show you what you will get when arts and science merge. See you in Boston!

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," SYNBIOSAFE (2009) and from work performed by the US Presidential Commission on Bioethics in 2010 (1) . As Europeans, we were quite interested in the European view on the SynBio case. However, we found the European framework a collection of potential issues and concepts rather than a framework useful for an ethical analysis. As Lily Frank shared our preference for the American framework, we decided to use this one for our analysis. In the discussion, we also touch upon some points extracted from SYNBIOSAFE.
We realize that some of the positions taken by the US Presidential Commission are themselves debatable. However, we consider it beyond the scope of this ethical analysis to debate the framework. In the next section, we will briefly explain the used framework before applying it to our project Gelcatraz.
Analysis
The American report New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technology (2010) was a result of six months of work commissioned by president Obama, in response to the development of the first self-replicating artificial bacterial cell in 2009 (1) . For six months, they consulted approximately thirty experts and received written comments which discussed the risks and benefits of synthetic biology. The commission concluded that synthetic biology should be approached with “prudent vigilance”. This means it is not necessary to implement new regulations or even discontinue research in the field of synthetic biology, but that the developments of the field should be continuously monitored. They invite scientists and public policy makers to assess the risks, benefits and moral objections   of new projects and their implications, and they strongly advice to engage stakeholders, scientists and the public in this debate. In fact, such evaluation is well captured by iGEM’s Human Practices process.
The commission found five guiding principles for the evaluation of synthetic biology processes and products: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice & fairness. Below, we discuss our project in the context of each of these five values.
1. Public beneficence
The value public beneficence is defined as the maximization of public benefits and the minimization of public harm. This principle should be applied to the individual, institutional, community and public levels. The commission advises to be vigilant about harms.
Our entire human practice trajectory was performed with the aim of optimizing public beneficence and minimizing the harmful side effects of our design. For instance, we ensured optimal entrapment of bacteria in the gel, designed a kill switch to minimize the risks associated with bacterial escape, added an additional bacteriocin to our secretion system to eradicate additional malignant bacteria"

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

1) Primer design
Each In-Fusion primer must contain two parts: the primer 5 'end must be included and will be connected to the DNA fragment (such as carrier or another fragment) 15 ends completely homologous base. Primers 3 must contain primer sequences of target genes.
Each primer 3 'should be:
- with gene specificity
- length is 18 - 25, the content of GC is 40 - 60%
- annealing temperature (Tm) is of 58 - 65 C. Forward and reverse primers of the Tm value difference should not exceed 4 degrees, otherwise the amplification effect is not ideal. Note that the evaluation of Tm values should be based on primer 3 (gene specificity), rather than on the whole primer. If Tm is too low, we can appropriately extend the part of primer with gene specificity until Tm reaches 58 - 65 degrees C.         - do not contain successive identical nucleotides. The last 5 nucleotides of each primer '3' should not contain more than 2 guanine (G) or cytosine (C).
The complementary sequence between the primers is avoided to prevent the primer itself from producing hairpin structure.
You can do BLAST search to make sure that the 3’ end of each primer is highly specific. (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)

Summary
With the spirit of communication and cooperation, Peking 2012 iGEM team members organized several team communication activities, among which are the visiting to Team ZJU and Team OUC-China. We seriously discussed our projects and what we were doing on human practices.
Visiting Team ZJU
Peking iGEM team and ZJU iGEM team have traditionally been in tight connection. Since Peking is the 1st runner-up in 2010, and ZJU is the 2nd runner-up in 2011, both of the two outstanding teams know that we could learn a lot from each other's experience and improve the ideas and designs of both team through the free discussion. Therefore, on July 27th, 7 members of Peking 2012 iGEM team launched the 3-day journey to Hangzhou, the most beautiful city in China, and launched the open communication with ZJU 2012 iGEM team.

Colombia,2012,Team:Colombia#Human#SynthEthics_-_-_TEXT.html," presentation at the workshop, we were given about 30 minutes for questions and debate. There were two main concerns from our audience. The first one questioned synthetic biology feasibility from a biosecurity and bioethical point of view. Since biological causality is nonlinear, that is, since biological events are generally regulated by many others (e.g., because of the cascade properties of intracellular signaling a single change of a signaling protein may have different cellular consequences), Prof. Arana claimed that genetic modifications would be very difficult to perfectly restrict. He stated how things may go out of control and we may end up as Goethe 's proverbial “ Aorcerer’s Apprentice ”. Additionally, taking into account the high globalization of the current age, he quoted Oppenheimer and stated that every technologically feasible idea ends up being constructed, and warned us about the danger of proof of concept explorations. Dr. Fernando Lizcano, M.D., based his opinion in a paragraph of Francis Fukuyama ’s book The End of History and the Last Man , claiming that any particular political and economic interest may be justified by the right person. He claimed that President Obama changed the bioethical committee and searched important Universities for people who would agree with his views. Whether or not this is true in this particular case, it is certainly feasible.
The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Illustration from around 1882 by S. Barth for the original Goethe's Poem
On the other hand, Prof. José Murillo focused in a more existential aspect of synthetic biology. Our use of controversial expressions earlier teased Prof. Murillo as expected, and he strongly defended how life may not be produced or built, but instead transformed. The reason behind this is the fact that synthetic biology relies on “ingredients” generated by biological processes. He believes that to “build” life is not the only way to understand it, and that the concept of producing life is ambiguous and obscures the reality of life itself. He proposed that one main difference between human generated machines and “biological machines” is that the whole purpose of the former is to accomplish a specific objective. This is their whole meaning of existence. Quoting Aristotle , life is generated by motion, and a living being is produced only when it sets itself in motion. In this way, machines are not their own movement; they limit themselves to defined functions. Living beings, however, must first function for themselves before being able to do things. Finally, he questioned the practicality of living beings as engineering scaffolds and we were once again accused of hubris, doing this for the purpose of controlling life instead of pursuing"

Background
Nitrogen fixation is a process in which nitrogen in the atmosphere is converted into ammonium (NH4+).No matter natural and synthetic, the process is essential for all forms of life because nitrogen is required to biosynthesize basic building blocks of plants, animals and other life forms, like nucleotides and amino acids.
All biological nitrogen fixation is done by way of nitrogenase, a metal-enzymes which contain iron, molybdenum, or vanadium. The enzyme is composed of the heterotetrameric MoFe protein that is transiently associated with the homodimeric Fe protein. Therefore, Molybdenum is an indispensable chemical element to nitrogen fixation and agriculture.
According to the Liebig's law of the minimum, which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource, molybdenum as a trace mineral, is identified as limiting the growth of peanuts in large field of China. So molybdenum powder is commonly used as a fertilizer in agriculture. And our project aims to establish an E.coli strain that is able to capture Mo in the medium, directional deliver itself to root system and kill itself eventually.
ModA
The genes encoding a molybdate transport system (mod) have been isolated and sequenced from Escherichia coli[2–5] Four genes modABCD, organized in an operon, share strong structural similarity and sequence homology with genes encoding binding -protein dependent solute(or ABC-type) transport systems [2–5]. The first gene, modA, encodes a periplasmic binding protein. ModB and ModC have sequence homology with integral membrane and cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis components of ABC transport systems, respectively. ModD does not show sequence similarity to any gene product in current databases and its role in transport is unclear."

The plasmid were then be cut with EcoRI and PstI, and the results were be put on an agarose gel in order to perform a restriction test.  Also plasmids of K1319013 and K1319014 will be cut with EcoRi and SpeI. K1319008 will be cut with XbaI and PstI. These will then be ligated together and then ligated into a pSB1A3 vector via the 3A assembly (vector cut with EcoRI and PstI). These constructs will be transformed into BL21 (and NEB as a backup). The created construts will be known as K1319018 (K1319013.K1319008) and K1319019 (K1319014.K1319008).
made precultures of the master plates from the day before (K1319008, K1319013, K1319015 and pSBX1A3 with Gal3).
also inoculated 4 cultures for the further testing of the OD/F Device (the F part). The cultures are 2 shake flasks of I20260 and 2 shake flasks of B0015.
Furthermore, did a growth experiment with DH5α for the NEAnderLab school experiment. 3 500 mL shake flasks were filled with 50 mL TB medium, and inoculated to an OD of 1.5 with the overnight preculture. Samples were taken every 30 minutes and tested for OD using our own device as well as the spectrophotometer. The resulting growth curve is shown below. we concluded that the growth was fast enough for these growth conditions to be used for the school experiment on the 24th.
Growth Curves
Growth under these conditions was sufficient for the school experiment to be carried in 5 hours. And our device did a good job measuring, too!
made chips with K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008, K1319013, K1319014, B0015 and K131026. Images were taken every 30 minutes with our own device.
tested our OD/F Device with a dilution test. Samples were checked with the spectrophotometer (OD), our OD/F Device (fluorescence) and platereader (fluorescence).

Resumen
Nuestro objetivo es maximizar la productividad fotosintética de una cultura de Rhodobacter sphaeroides en ambas alta y baja intensidad de luz en un biorreactor sintéticamente por la regulación del tamaño de la antena de captación de luz. Hemos elegido para llevar a cabo un proyecto de este tipo en R. sphaeroides debido a su bien caracterizado fotosintética y sistema genético. Funciones del sistema de la antena para ampliar el espectro de luz disponible para la fotosíntesis por la absorción de diferentes longitudes de onda que el centro de la reacción. Básicamente, es como el plato principal en todo el receptor de cualquier antena. Bacterias marinas, tales como R. sphaeroides, evolucionó muy grandes complejos de antena para absorber la luz en un entorno natural donde hay una gran competencia por los fotones. Como resultado, la maquinaria fotosintética está saturado y no a una baja intensidad de luz en un sintético entorno no competitivo, como un biorreactor. Esto hace que hasta el 95% de los fotones incidentes que se disipa como calor o fluorescencia de las bacterias en el exterior de un bioreactor a través de un proceso llamado no fotoquímica enfriamiento (NPQ) (Mussgnug et al., 2007). En esencia, estos fotones se desperdicia como NPQ reduce la penetración de la luz en un biorreactor y hambrea células en el interior de fotones.Un método que ha demostrado mejorar la eficiencia fotosintética es la reducción de la luz de recolección de tamaños de antena (Polle et al., 2002, Mussgnug et al., 2007). Sin embargo, los enfoques actuales en este sentido se basan en knockouts genéticos y, como tal, son difíciles de controlar con precisión desde la perspectiva de la ingeniería metabólica y la biología sintética. Nuestra intención es crear un sistema más dinámico para variar el tamaño de antena que depende de la intensidad de la luz incidental y que puede"

Week 4
(22nd - 28th August)
18 colonies were then isolated from the plates, and plasmid was mini-prepped, digested and underwent gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of the Mega Operon isolated from the transformant cells.
The Super Operon retrieved in the previous week was also run on the gel in order to assess the quality of the operon and determine whether it was appropriate to use for further experiments.
The gel indicated a successful ligation of the Mega Operon genes, as the size of the bands observed on the gel (roughly 6kb) corresponded with the expected size of the Mega operon (6.2kb). To validate the results of the Mega Operon, its genes were re-ligated and run on a gel in the following week.
The Super Operon bands corresponded with its expected size on the gel (10.5 kb) making it appropriate to use in further experiments.
Fig 6. Mini-prep of the Mega Operon and Super Operon was performed and the results were run on a gel.  The gel shows 6 bands at roughly 10,600bp for the super operon and 16 bands at roughly 8000bp for the mega operon.
The Super Operon and Mega Operon were prepared for ligation. First, the Super Operon was digested with the restriction endonucleases, SpeI and PstI and then treated with alkaline phosphatase immediately after digestion to avoid relegation.  The Mega Operon was digested with the enzymes Xbal and PstI.  These two digests were then ligated together directly.  Some of the Mega and Super Operons were also ligated together using the 3A assembly method on a KAN backbone using the enzymes EcoR1 and Spel.
Week 5
(29th - 4th September)
Following the ligation of the Mega and Super Operon together into an Ultra Operon, PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to assess the success of the ligation. The gel results indicated a negative result, due to the large size of the operon and multiple regions of primer annealing.
The products of the ligation were also transformed into three different strains of E. coli ; DH10B, BL21 and DH5a.  The transformants were cultured for 37oC.
Following the incubation, DH5a strains grew on the media, suggesting a successful ligation and transformation of the Ultra Operon.

FM 707.1 Marketing Update for the Weeks of August 17th 2009
Hello everyone,
My name is Fahd Mirza and you are reading my FM 707.1 marketing update for the week of August 17th. This week was rather slow for marketing because our marketing team was either busy with lab or ethics work. However we still managed to get a lot of stuff done for marketing,
1) Last Thursday, we were interviewed by the CJSW 90.9 Radio station. CJSW is the University of Calgary Community Radio station whose aim is to promote the activities of the University of Calgary students in Calgary and surrounding areas. We were interviewed by Joe Burima, who is the current program director for CJSW. On behalf of the University of Calgary iGEM team, we would like to sincerely thank CJSW for their support to"

UNIK_Copenhagen,2016,Team:UNIK Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"X Gibson MasterMix was added to the Eppendorf tube and the samples were incubated at 50 degrees for two hours. Then the samples were stored on ice upon transformation. The transformation of E. coli was carried out as described in the protocol section ( https://2016.igem.org/Team:UNIK_Copenhagen/Experiments ). Chemical competent cells were thawed on ice and the DNA was added. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes, and heat shock the cells for 30 seconds at 42 degrees and let the cells rest on ice for two minutes. Then add recovery medium and incubate at 37 degrees for up to two hours and plate the cells out on LB plates containing 50μg/mL ampicillin. Store the plates at 37 degrees overnight and check the transformation efficiently the day after.  Colony PCR is carried out on the formed colonies to screen for colonies that have the five construct and the vector backbone. The protocol for PCR can be found in the protocol section ( https://2016.igem.org/Team:UNIK_Copenhagen/Experiments ).
Result: to test if the Gibson Assembly worked, a colony PCR was carried out on the grown colonies after transformation. The PCR was chosen to be done for GFP, because it gave a clear band when it was amplified (Fig. 16B). But also presence for YFP and PhaA were tested during the colony PCRs.  Figure 23 shows the first colony PCR where presence for GFP was investigated. As it can be seen the forty colonies investigated, all but one were negative for GFP. This one colony was further investigated for the presence of YFP. However, this ended up being negative, meaning that it would not have had all the six fragments from the Gibson Assembly. Also, none of the forty colonies showed YFP. This further suggests that the Gibson did not work (Fig. 24). The PCR for YFP shows some bands in several of the colonies. However, these bands are only around 700 bp long, so about 200 bp smaller than the expected size for YFP. Because of this, we conclude that the primers can have some unspecific binding to the vector.
Figure 23: Colony PCR of GFP. Colon #39 show a positive band at the expected size for GFP. The ladder used was 1kb+ from Thermo Fisher Scientific©. The negative control is carried out with water as template. For the PCR conditions see the protocol section. The positive was taken from the synthetic gene from IDT.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#MOOC_-_-_TEXT.html," MIT. It has since evolved into a summer competition for college students and in 2011 a iGEM High School division was created. Although the college competition has become more successful over time, this is still not the case for the High Shcool competition (Fig. 1). Many students would be interested in participating but do not know about the iGEM competition for Highs Schools or how to start a team at their school. There are limitations that make it harder to participate in the competition, such as the expense of consumables and registration fees or the lack of time or the appropriate lab facilities.
To encourage more teams to participate in iGEM HS and spread Synthetic Biology, the iGEM Paris Bettencourt 2014 team has developed the MOOC iGEM High School.
Figure 2. The MOOC is a complete approach to support High School science and iGEM HS.
What is MOOC iGEM HS?
MOOC iGEM HS is a platform that covers the topics necessary to create an iGEM High School team.  We have developed a network to support High Schools with advice and support for common issues such as organization (Fig. 2). Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) The Massive Open Online Course is composed by texts covering important topics for starting an iGEM team. They can be found at Genius.com, a collaborative annotating website. Audiovisual material in English, French and Spanish is provided for each topic. So far, the MOOC includes 21 topics distributed over 4 different areas: Fundamental facts of synthetic Biology, Bioethics at iGEM, Science project at iGEM, and Human     practices at iGEM.
Figure 3. An extensive network has been created to support the platform (Fig. 3).
MOOC iGEM HS network
Many iGEM Practices & Policy projects (former Human Practices) are not continued after the competition. We plan for this tool to be used and improved by other iGEM teams in the future. For this aim, we have built a network of organizations, people and institutions from all around the world interested in helping and supporting high schools teams of their area (Fig. 3).
Figure 4. The course supports four key components of an iGEM project.
MOOC course
As mentioned before, we developed a course on the Genius platform. The Genius pages so far has more than 50 contributors, more than 1500 visits and more than 1000 activity events (annotations, likes, comments, annotation edits). This platform and outreach approach has little precedence among"

We were happy to see that people are looking forward to knowing more and that our ways of public engagement seemed to be successful.  On the other hand, we learned many things too. We found the best ways to gather the public and interest it as well as realised the importance of sincere contact and close communication. We even found parallels between subjects we never thought existed and had a possibility to consider questions and problems that have never crossed our minds before as we are maybe too concentrated on our field and lack wider sight ourselves.
To sum up, we held many activities that, hopefully, were beneficial to both us and public.

BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," coat PDMS in order to obtain the precise thickness. There was varied success in the beginning, but eventually we were able to get a consistent result. However, after subsequent testing we realized that more research was still needed.
We then reached out to one of the publishers of the paper, Rajeev Ram, who is a professor at MIT University. We wanted to have an up close look at the device after realizing the high level of complexity it took to design and manufacture the chip. We went to visit his lab and see a copy of the microfluidic device as well as the corresponding system that is used to run it. Both teams were provided with valuable insight into the chip’s operation and design after the visit. This allowed us to understand the minimum pieces of the design that needed to be kept in order to maintain the same functionality.
Stage 3
The BostonU Hardware team worked to develop and manufacture a replication of the microfluidic device. Eventually with the help from the Harvard iGEM team we were able to replicate a relatively accurate design of the chips cell culturing chamber. However, when the chip was tested using colored water there was very little success. The fluid was unable to move in a proper clockwise movement and was not able to be displaced fully from any chamber. Progress was eventually stopped due to the lack of hardware resources from last year's project, Neptune.  In order to continue the development of the microfluidic module more work would be needed with programmable syringe pumps.
Stage 4
The last portion of the collaboration was to validate the Harvard iGEM team’s optical density sensor. The BostonU Hardware team developed small scale microfluidic chips in order to test the sensor. However, in order to test the OD sensor, the Harvard iGEM team vapor polished the surface to remove any etchings that was left from the manufacturing process. This aimed to decrease the possibility of inaccuracies that could occur during testing. The Harvard iGEM team came to the BostonU Hardware team’s lab. Check out the Harvard iGEM team's wiki for more information.
Fluorescence Microfluidic | July - September 2017 | Boston University Wet Lab iGEM
This collaboration was based around co-engineering a microfluidic chip that performs the BostonU Wetlab team’s Toe-hold protocol. This chip was then integrated into the MARS Chip Repository as the fluorescence chip. Our preliminary fluid functionality checklist was used while testing the final chip design in order to receive feedback regarding its effectiveness. Feedback was also provided for the Microfluidics 101 content and the usage protocols for our"

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," on plates for prolonged periods of time. The rapid mutation rate affects the chromosome, and after prolonged growth, the subsequent colonies are probably not genetically identical to the original strain.
The E. coli XL1-Red-aided DNA mutagenesis method has been successfully applied to isolate mutant variants of the glutamate dehydrogenase RocG and the glutamine synthetase GlnA in B. subtilis (Wray et al., 2006; Gunka et al., 2010).
The Material
Competent E. coli XL1-Red cells
Liquid LB medium
LB medium agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics
NucleoSpin® plasmid kit, Macherey & Nagel
The Procedure
Use some material of a cryo culture of the E. coli strain XL1-Red to inoculate 4 ml LB liquid medium and grow the culture overnight at 37°C with agitation.
Competent cells of the strain XL1-Red can be prepared according to CaCl2-method and transformed with the respective plasmid to the standard protocol.
Plate the cells on an appropriate amount of plates to obtain enough clones. The amount of clones that are needed depends on the size of the gene. We have plated 40 LB plates resulting in approximately 80 colonies per plate for the mutagenesis of an insert with a size of about 1.3 kb (rocG gene) into a vector with a size of ca. 6.7 kb (the plasmid pBQ200). Briefly, we used 3,200 clones for the experiment. For a gene that is about 1.3 kb, half of the clones (1,600) should have a mutation in the insert. Statistically, the resulting plasmid pool should contain a mutant for every base in the gene (Gunka et al., 2010).
Re-suspend the colonies from each plate in 1 ml of LB medium, and 100 μl of each suspension can be used to inoculate 100 ml shake flasks containing 10 ml of LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.
Grow the cultures for 48 h at 37°C to allow the emergence of mutations. If you use a low-copy plasmid or if you mutate a very small gene (less than 1 kb) the culture can be diluted for continued growth.
Isolate the plasmid DNA from each culture individually (harvest 3 ml of the culture) by using the NucleoSpin® plasmid kit (Macherey & Nagel low-copy pl"
Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"56*. Extension time was 30 seconds.
We ran a 1% 100 ml. agarose gel at 120V to check the success of the PCR.
Gel of our colonies, miniprep-ed colonies, and controls to check for w+zif268 insertion
The bands were rather thick, so it was difficult to estimate the exact band size. However, the bands appeared a bit below 650 bp, although we expected a size of 709 bp, so we ran an e-gel on some of the colonies to ensure that that bands were indeed the right size.
Gel to ensure our bands were the correct size (709 bp)
The bands were closer to the size that we expected, so we decided that we successfully inserted w+zif268 into the plasmid. We decided to pick colony 9 (which had the highest concentration post-miniprep) and work with that from now on. We made spec plates with 50 ul of colony 9.
Team Wolfe
Selection strain transformed with pSR01:
both plates had lots of colonies--almost too many.  We need to make sure the plasmid is, indeed, in these cells.
Colony PCR:
picked 6 colonies and diluted in 7µL H2O: 3 for PCR template and 4 to be grown up in LB+amp
KAPA protocol using M13_F and M13_R primers (anneal to the vector), 50˚C annealing, 2min elongation
E gel results: lots of bands but rather messy and not exactly what we'd expect. We'll try to verify the presence of the plasmid in a few other ways.
pSR01 colony PCR 7/11/11
Sequencing:
We sent out the PCR samples with M13_R to Genewiz
Culture PCR:
We used the cultures made with the colonies used for PCR above as template to see if this gives us cleaner results.
same protocol as above except with 1µL of 1:20 dilution of culture as template.
Assuming that the plasmid is indeed in the colonies, we will grow an overnight culture in LB+amp as well as the Wolfe selection strain and tomorrow we will use a growth reader to check their phenotypes in NM
MAGE round 3 colonies:
In case pSR01 does not rescue the selection strain's growth phenotype, we will PCR 96 colonies from the MAGE3 plates and send them out for sequencing tomorrow.

To obtain our goal of an accelerated clotting process, we have deployed the venom serine protease “Cerastotin” which will act on the thrombin, bypassing multiple factors in the clotting cascade and cut long fibrinogen strands into smaller fibrin “monomers” which will stop the bleeding at a greatly accelerated rate. In order for the venom to stay localized at the wound site, we have augmented a short fibrin peptide with the venom that will polymerize with the other fibrin monomers at the wound site. With the polymerization of the venom within a permanent clot and with blood pressure directing flow to the wound, the venom will not be traveling throughout the body and initiating a clot other than that of the wound site.   We chose a constitutive medium strength promoter (J23107) and a medium/strong RBS for our construct in order to produce an ample amount of venom, but also allowing our Thiol isomerase time to stabilize the multiple disulphide bonds in the venom, so the protein will fold properly and its enzymatic activity increases.
To ensure our venom protein folds properly, we have a periplasmic signal attached to both the venom/f"
Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," a series of cells samples with different concentration by gradient dilution. And we used OD function of our device and spectrophotometer to test the sample respectively. By this way, we can get a relation between the readout of our kit and the real OD value. If the relation is linear, we can use a linear model to analyze and predict.
Result
$$ spectrophotometer=-0.06759+4.61774 DeviceReadout_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,0.0052) $$
Taking the OD values measured by spectrophotometer as real values, it is obvious that the real OD values can be derived from the readout of our device, which means that our device is able to measure the OD value of samples accurately.
Florescence Function Testing
Test method
As we already derived the model of OD function of our kit, we design a method to test our florescence function based on it. We made a group of cells samples that steadily express the fluorescence protein by gradient dilution, and use our hardware to measure the OD values and Fluorescence intensity of each sample. As the criteria of the method, the OD values should be proportion to the fluorescence intensity of samples. So we use this method to test if the florescence function of our kit can actually work on florescence intensity testing.
Result
$$ FL_i=53.828+88.287OD_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,6.16) $$
The linear regression model is shown above, which implies us that the florescence function can regularly work. And it can test the florescence based on the linear model we made.
For testing data and more details about data analysis, please look up in data
Design and components
In order to make such a device, we have to minimize the size when we select of the components and design the bracket.
The overall design
Our reaction system is about 800μL, which heights approximately 8mm in the common 10mm cuvette. Therefore, we choose the position which optical pass is 4mm high. Although simply changing filter paper can reuse photosensor, to make it more automatically, we use two photosensors with different light filters to sense different light. Optical pass design is displayed in figure. If we switch on LED in a certain order and measure light intensity respectively, we can calculate the intensity of transmitted light. According to the intensity results before and after the reaction, we obtain the cell density and fluorescent intensity in the solution.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#BioHYDRA_-_-_TEXT.html,"les while in spore form. To regulate the humidity content in the spore core, B. subtilis have adapted by changing the shape of its wrinkled spore cortex with various degrees of humidity. As the air becomes dryer, the spores shrinks, and vice versa. Suddenly, we have a folding mechanism. Thus, we sought to improve on the work of Chen et al. (Columbia University) and their HYDRA technology (Fig. 2), which is able to scale up the nano scale contractions of spores to the macro scale. We wanted to create fully biological HYDRAs, using cellulose and cellulose binding domains on the spore coat.
Fig. 1 Scanning Electron Microscope picture of spores from our lab
Fig. 2 HYDRAs in parallel (Chen et al.) [1]
Experiment
From synthetic to biological
There were two experiments, recreating HYDRAs from the Chen et al. publication, and creating bioHYDRAS, which are fully biological versions of HYDRAs.
Fig. 3 Spores on one of our HYDRA samples
Recreating HYDRAs: By expanding on the protocol by Chen et al. [1] to create HYDRAs, we then used desiccant and wet paper towels in separate chambers to create humidity variance for these HYDRAs to expand and contract, and recorded our results using a ruler and a humidity sensor.
BioHYDRAs: The goal of BioHYDRA was to replace all the parts of HYDRAs by biologically produced substances. We sought out to replace polyamide tape by bacterially cellulose, and the glue by cellulose binding domains on the surface of the spore coat.        Thus, the first step involved cloning a Bacillus construct in Escherichia coli of a fusion protein consisting of a spore coat protein, cotZ (building off work done on Sporobeads by the LMU Munich 2012 iGEM team), and a cellulose binding domain (CIPA). Additionally, we decided to add aeBlue, a chromogenic protein, between cotZ and CIPA to be able to see with the naked eye whether Bacillus is in a vegetative or a spore state. The plasmid would thereafter need to be transformed and expressed in Bacillus . Here is a link to our part: BBa_K1692028 .
We then needed to produce bacterial cellulose. For more details, refer to our Cellulose page.
Finally, our project would consist of testing for the binding affinity of the"
SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEMers create amazing gene circuits easily, we suggested SKLBC-GDSYZX to collect remarkable past iGEM designs to build up a gene circuit library. During the process, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX could test their app and gain novel ideas about the app. However, gathering past iGEM gene circuits was a hard work for them since they were lack of experiences in synthetic biology. Therefore, we help them to study the past iGEM projects and used the panel app to construct a gene circuits library. Then we gave them feedbacks to help them improve panel app. These are some examples of gene circuits that we created with SKLBC-GDSYZX’s app below.

PphoBR (BBa_K737024) is first characterized and BioBricked by OUC-China 2012 iGEM team . To provide more characterization data on these two promoters, we improved these promoters by obtaining different sequences.
Endogenous phosphate sensing system in E. coli
Figure 1. The Pho phophorous sensing system in E. coli.
E. coli has multiple native phosphorus sensing and regulation systems that we could use in the construct. Among them, we chose the PhoR/PhoB two-component system (TCS). It contains a sensory histidine kinase PhoR and a partner DNA-binding response regulator PhoB. PhoR is activated under low phosphate concentration, which will then phosphorylate PhoB. The phospho-PhoB is then capable of activating expression of the Pho regulon genes, one of the examples is phoA. In high phosphate concentration, phoR is turned into an inhibitory state, which interferes with phosphorylation of PhoB. PhoB is, thus, not capable of activating expression of phoA.
*The above text is our summarized understanding on phosphate-sensing system using information from Hsieh & Wanner (2010). Please refer to our references section below for the reference cited.

To construct a phosphate-sensing device, we cloned the promoters PphoA and PphoBR, and fused it with a GFP reporter BBa_I13504 in BioBrick RFC10 standard. The activity of promoter can then be reported by the fluorescence level under different phosphate concentrations.
The activities of PphoA (BBa_K1682013) and PphoBR (BBa_K1682015) in different phosphate concentrations were measured in Fluorescence per Biomass, following a modified protocol (see below) from Tokyo Tech 2013 iGEM team . They were found to be falling in a dynamic range of 0 - 300 μM"

Here is a summary of all the parts we submitted this year. Details and characterization data for each can be found on the respective parts.
We improved two TALE proteins from the Slovenia 2012 iGEM team and submitted them in an inducible system (LacI) with a His-6 tag such that they can be easily expressed and purified. We also submitted binding sequences for these, both in separate plasmids, and on the same plasmid.
We also designed two of our own TALEs (TALE A and TALE B) to bind to pathogenic E. coli genomic sequences.
We submitted the E-coils and K-coils which can be used as connectors for scaffolding proteins that cannot be fused together. We submitted these coils in the Friedburg assembly backbone such that other teams can easily create fusion proteins with them.
We submitted two new reporters: beta-lactamase and ferritin to the registry. We also submitted these with 6-His tags in an inducible system (LacI) such that they are easy to express and isolate.
We submitted our fusions of: TALE A with beta-lactamase and TALE A with ferritin in order to have detector-reporter constructs.

This in turn, results in recurring respiratory infections, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and rapid heart beat upon standing. Additionally the deficiency increases one's risk of a rare type of liver cancer.
The exact prevalence of the ZZ genotype and associated disease is not known, but it is thought to be around 0.1% of the world population, though it varies by ethnic group. Northern Europeans, in particular, have particularly high instances of the mutation, while it is rare in Asian and African populations. The A1AT deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease and the most common reason for liver transplant in children. Additionally, A1AT deficiency often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as asthma. Treatment options are also not convenient or cost-effective  - many patients require weekly intravenous augmentation therapy, which can cost up to 100,000 dollars a year - an astronomical amount over a lifetime. These were also factors we considered when selecting this disease.

USP-UNESP-Brazil,2012,Team:USP-UNESP-Brazil#Plasmid Plug n Play#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the ORF from the kanamycin resistance gene, flanked upstream by the loxP and downstream by the lox66, using PCR. These sites should be recognized by the Cre recombinase (from NEB company), which could circularized our linear PCR product. This is important because we don't want it to be degraded when inserted in the bacteria. This In vitro assay was a test for a posterior In vivo assay, where we expect that this process happens inside the E. coli using a Cre recombinase enzyme expressed by the same bacteria.
Our experiment showed that 5U and 10U of Cre recombinase reduced the linear DNA (Kanamycin resistance gene flanked with loxP and lox66) amount when compare to 1U of Cre recombinase and to the control DNA (No Cre recombinase added), as is showed in the figure A. It was also observed an increase of the DNA plasmid form (upper band at 2 Kb), as is showed in figure B. We also used a control DNA substrate supplied in the NEB recombinase kit. The same amount of PCR-product was applied to each lane (260 ng).
The conclusion was that we can use this loxP-lox66 mechanism in our design and we will need at least 5U of Cre recombinase for any in vitro experiment.

In vivo assay
We proved that we can circularize a fragment of DNA (kanamycin resistance gene) flanked by a loxP and a lox66 sites in vitro, so we decided to test one of the Plug&Play prototypes (T7-lox71-Cre-pSB4A5). This plasmid produces a low copy number and has a gene that confers resistance to ampicillin. The Cre recombinase is under the control of the T7 promoter, the target gene (in this case the kanamycin resistance gene) will be inserted in the lox71 site upstream the Cre recombinase gene. When the gene is inserted it will be controlled by the same T7 promoter. This plasm"

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," Given high and low Dox concentration input, cells exhibit different probability distributions, as illustrated in the example below [ref: fig].
What we have in hand is the conditional distribution $p\left( {Y\left| {X = x} \right.} \right)$ , given a known level of input $x$ . In order to calculate mutual information $I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \iint {p\left( {x,y} \right){{\log }_2}\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}dxdy}$  and estimate channel capacity, which is $C = \sup I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ , we need to find the input distribution $p\left( X \right)$ and joint distribution $p\left( {X,Y} \right)$ that optimizes the equation. $p\left( X \right)$ , however, is not known in the first place. We first randomly pick a stochastic vector as the initial input distribution and then use an optimization algorithm to iterate the function and maximize $I\left( {X;Y} \right)$ . The final result is the channel capacity."

3. Collaboration with CIEI-BJ
[mentoring a new high school team]
◎ BIT-China for CIEI-BJ
https://2016.igem.org/Team:CIEI-BJ/Collaborations
CIEI-BJ is a high school team and it’s their first time to participate in iGEM competition this year. In the middle of July, team CIEI-BJ came to visit Beijing Institute of Technology and communicated with our team BIT-China.
As an undergraduate team, we shared the core concept of our project this year and explained a little bit about how we have exchanged ideas among the team members and how to assess the feasibility of our design as a reference for high school students.
Later, team members in high school also shared their fascinating ideas. However, some plans are not that practical due to the objective reasons. A lot of questioned were raised by members of BIT-China to help shape the project of team CIEI-BJ this year. The considerations refer to the practical meaning and the possibility of conduct for an appropriate project. What’s more, some suggestions are given to optimize the details like designing an experiment to prove a concept.
After the discussion, we showed high school students around our lab and explained the brief function of some experimental instruments. Besides, we introduced them to the previous projects of our team with the aid of posters preserved.
After they designed the basic gene circuit, we gave some advice on how to improve it. In the next few months, the guidance of BIT-China to CIEI-BJ are not only limited to the project itself, but also extended to the details about the competition procedures. We have been in touch with CIEI-BJ through the Internet and give advice on many aspects, like how to present our iGEM program to potential sponsors and how to achieve the requirements for deliverables.
In September 17th, 2016, some members of BIT-China are invited to share their experience on how to design the wiki page. A few examples were given to explain the good elements in introducing the project in a simple way. What should be put on the wiki were also discussed during this meeting. Considering the web fluency and in order to design a clear page, notes are listed for high school members to pay attention when they are working on their wiki.
In the process of mentoring a high school team, we also benefited a lot. Not only did we engage in the competition, but also we had a better understanding of the"
