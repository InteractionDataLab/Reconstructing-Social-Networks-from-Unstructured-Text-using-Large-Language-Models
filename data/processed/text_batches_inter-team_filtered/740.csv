Combination Constructs
The following two parts were designed to be be cotransformed into the same cell to control expression of a gene of interest under the control of the sigma-54-dependent hrpL promoter.
BBa_K2561006: High Pass Combination Construct (AND gate)
A composite part consisting of a constitutively-active promoter sequence (J23100) that drives the expression of TetR (BBa_C0040) that in turn directs the expression of downstream gene products. Translation of TetR is additionally controlled by an upstream RNA thermometer construct that prevents recognition and binding of the RBS at temperatures lower than 32 degrees Celsius. The TetR produced represses the expression of HrpR, an enhancer-binding protein that forms a heteromeric complex with HrpS to regulate expression of the sigma-54-dependent hrpL promoter. TetR is tagged with a degradation tag (BBa_K2333405) characterized by the 2017 William and Mary team that targets it for degradation by the mf-Lon protease; this prevents leaky expression signals between oscillations. This part should be used in conjunction with the Low Pass Combination Construct (AND gate) part (BBa_K2561004).

Though challenges were identified, the promise of peptide therapies and the potential of their wider applications drew our team to further investigate protein-based technologies in the context of peptides therapies.
Screening Protein-Protein Interactions
Civilization has been using compounds found in nature to treat our various ailments since ancient times. Historically, drug discovery has been mainly serendipitous, but much effort has gone into developing more deliberate and informed strategies. Currently, the development of many therapeutics, including protein-based technologies, use natural proteins or compounds as starting points. However, wild-type proteins are often in need of optimization for use outside of their natural context 2. For proteins, this optimization is the realm of protein engineering, where the chemical and physical properties of proteins are optimized for use in industries such as manufacturing, medicine, and materials3.
Because our understanding of protein dynamics is still incomplete, optimizing proteins often relies on directed evolution. This process involves repeated cycles of mutating proteins and screening for improved variants to engineer protein-protein interactions with higher specificity and affinity. Due to the iterative mutagenesis required, directed evolution, and the screening associated with the process is extremely laborious.
Interviews
Dr. Maya Shmulevitz
Associate Professor
Department of Oncology
University of Alberta
Dr. Maya Shmulevitz , a researcher in the University of Alberta’s Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, has previously worked with the yeast two-hybrid system for screening protein-protein interactions. The particular system she used was based the expression of antibiotic genes regulated by the reconstitution of the yeast transcriptional machinery via the interaction of proteins of interest. The stringency of the screen is modulated with antibiotic concentration. If proteins of interest interact sufficiently, they confer antibiotic resistance to yeast, which are then selected.
However, what Dr. Shmulewitz found when using this system was that it was difficult to determine how many from a library of positive results should be selected, especially when no reference to controls are available. When Dr. Shmulevitz reduced the stringency of her test, she found many false positives, but when the screen was too stringent, many possible interactions are lost.
Our main take away message from our conversation with Dr. Shmulevitz was that the choice of reporter genes in assays like the yeast two-hybrid system is crucial to the results of a particular screen. In her case, antibiotic resistance did not provide an outcome that can be used to readily discern the relative strengths of protein-protein interactions, nor can it be used to separate desirable candidates from false positives. Though,"

What we can say is that if the cells can survive for longer outside of this period, then they must have enough ATP available for basic maintenance. If cell death occurs,  other processes than pure water-efflux must be the cause of that. This could be due to a combination of lacking nutrients and water-efflux, or over production of osmolytes to keep the balance.
Beehave
Due to regulatory and experimental hurdles it is difficult to test the effectiveness of BeeT in combating Varroa destructor. We would still like to be able to give advice to local beekeepers on the ideal application strategy of BeeT, based on several scenarios. To accomplish this, the previously published model beehave was adapted to include the effects of BeeT on Varroa mite and virus dynamics in simulated colonies. Beehave is an open-source agent-based model, which can be used to examine the multifactorial causes of Colony Collapse Disorder 1, 2 . It consists of several modules which control aspects like foraging, Varroa mite dynamics, and colony growth as shown in Figure 19, and was extensively tested for robustness and realism 1 .
BeeT can be transported to the hive by adding it in sugar water or bee bread. Both these sources have their advantages and disadvantages. In this project we have used Escherichia coli as our model chassis, which can be applied to sugar water . Sugar water is supplemented to support a colony during honey harvest before winter, as a substitute for nectar 3, 4 .   Supplementing honey bees with sugar water is a well established and familiar practice among beekeepers 3 . Alternatively, reconstructing the same system in Lactobacillus species would allow us to use BeeT in bee bread. Bee bread has some advantages over sugar water, as it it is more frequently transported to larvae. Bee bread is a combination of pollen, regurgitated nectar, and glandular secretions. To protect against harmful micro-organisms honey bees also inoculate bee bread with fermenting bacteria 5 . The fermentation process reduces the pH .

Organization of a Meet Up: Another European Meet Up
Reason
After attending two meet ups we realized that these meetings are very enriching experiences in preparation for the Giant Jamboree. One of the main reasons for these meet ups is to get to know and know the project of other teams. Other reason is that its also serves to practice the presentations of the project and its results. And finally serve to open the network of contacts beyond the contest itself.
We realized that the events to which more teams come are usually the first ones to be organized, and in these although if they serve to obtain collaborations, do not fulfill so much the function of practicing to present the results of your project due to at the beginning of the summer there are no results.
This year the European meet up was on July 20. Date in which novice teams, without sufficient contacts do not yet know how to deal with these events and do not have the necessary funds to attend. And teams with more experience do not yet have conclusive results. With this context we proposed this ambitious project: Make another European meet up. We invited all the teams of the continent in mid-September. A date that was supposed to be the best for the organization of new teams and with the possibility of simulating the final event.
Event
The event was organized between September 14 and 16. Although this event was given as much publicity as possible and contact was made with all possible teams in Europe, attendance was low due to several factors:
- Spain is geographically at one end of Europe and travel is expensive.
- The teams were short of funds and were saving for the trip to Boston.
- The event was announced at the beginning of September, many teams did not have room to maneuver in their organization to attend.
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.

PROJECT UPDATE
Our project is separated into 4 groups, namely B2H (Bacterial-two-hybrid), mutation, M13, and RNAT (RNA thermo). The work of each group is approximately in accordance with our schedule, and some of the details are stated as following: For B2H group, who aims to assemble a B2H system to activate a reporter gene by interaction of two compensative proteins, a major problem is that a mutated positive control for lower affinity shows, on the contrary, higher expression of reporter GFP. We have been working on this problem for days, and still need an answer.
For RNAT group, who aims to build a RNA thermal switch for system control, we have successfully certified the function of one of three prepared thermal switches, but the other two were somehow disable.
For M13 group and mutation group, a dramatic number of bugs are haunting the project, and thus we need some time to deal with them.
Additionally, this year we participate in the Interlab Study, a subordinate and independent section of Measurement Track. We have already accomplished all cloning work as well as procedure modification, and final statistics and report will be finished in few days.
PLAN FOR FUTURE STEPS
1. All bricks to be submitted must be recorded into normative document, and standard sample of each brick will be prepared in few days.
2. The style of our wiki will be decided at once and first edition of frame work will soon come out.
3. A detailed plan about which individual awards we should focus on should be taken into consideration, in that this is helpful to increase the competitive force of our wiki.
4. The final experiments and data collection will be done according to the plan of each group.

We did not manage to finish the cloning of PhiC31 and Tp901.1. But,thanks to Bonnet’s help, we were able to produce the Tp901.1 recombinases directly from the original plasmids ( view other parts )and use the produced recombinases for in vitro characterization.
Results
The following table presents our plan for testing the efficiency of the recombinase-based switch and the results we should expect.
The color of each cell of the table corresponds to the expected colors of the resulting colonies.
in vitro switch of the logic gates
The basic idea is to perform the switch with a cell lysis containing the recombinase and the plasmid containing the gate to be switched. After incubation, transformation of the plasmid containing the gate allows the quantification of switched versus non switched plasmids. Experiments have been performed as described in the protocol .
XOR1
In the absence of recombinase or in recombination assays with FimE, the resulting colonies are white. Therefore, the XOR1 gate does not present any transcriptional leakage and non-specific recombinases cannot switch the door. When XOR1 was put in the presence of Bxb1, the switch occurred as attested by the presence of numerous red colonies (RFP expression).
To test the time dependency of the reaction, the reaction mixture incubated was analysed at different times, from 15 min to 2.5 hours.
From the graph above, one can see that switching occurs after 15 min. After 2 hours reaction, over 90 % of XOR1 gates were switched and the percentage of XOR1 gates switched from 2 hours to 5 hours reaction is almost constant (not shown).
In the in vitro protocol, DNAses were not eliminated. Therefore, longer times reactions also means that plasmids containing the gates can be degraded. This could explain why, when incubation lasted longer than 2 hours, the number of colonies dropped as shown in the following graph.
We also tried to switch XOR1 with the two recombinases. The XOR1 gate was tested with the Dual Controller Plasmid provided by Bonnet (KC529324) and containing Tp901.1 and Bxb1. No switch was ever obtained. This negative result might be due to low expression levels of any of the two recombinases that would lead to partial switch in in vitro conditions. Further experiments will have to be performed to understand this phenomenon.
Finally, We analysed XOR1 switched plasmids by sequencing. The sequences correspond to the"

4. mRNA translation via ribosomes;
5. activator protein transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus;
6. the interaction of dioxin with its receptor on the synthetic activator we constructed;
7. the presence of multiple operators along the promoter sequence and their interaction with the activator.
In order to construct our model, we used the software Parts & Pools [2-4]. This software generates models for circuit components such as Standard Biological Parts and Pools of molecules (proteins, mRNA, chemicals, etc.). Complex Parts such as our regulated promoters needs many species and reactions to be described properly. Parts & Pools provides such a detailed Part representation via a “rule-based modeling” approach. Parts & Pools generates, indeed, a set of rules and passes to the software BioNetGen [5] that returns a complete list of species and reaction inside the Part. Parts & Pools converts this information into an MDL (Model Definition Language) [6] file. In this format, Parts and Pools are independent modules that can be wired up together into a circuit. We designed our circuits with the software ProMoT [7]. Finally, we exported out circuit, from the MDL to the SBML format [8] and simulated them with COPASI [9].
1. Main ideas
Synthetic gene circuits are designed as the electronic ones. We used Standard Biological Parts such as promoters, coding regions, and terminators that have a well-defined function in transcription or translation. Together with Parts, we used Pools as stores for different kind of molecules.
Parts and Pools exchange fluxes of molecules like electric components exchange a flux of electrons (current). Biological currents are, for instance, (PoPS: Polymerases Per Second) and (RiPS: Ribosomes Per Second). RNA polymerases, indeed, scan entire DNA transcription units and  ribosomes go through all the Parts on the mRNA.
Our synthetic activators are also stored into a Pool. Their flux (Factor Per Second) puts in communication the two transcription units in our circuits. Finally, the dioxin (chemical) Pool is an interface between the circuit and the cell environment. The nucleus has also a Pool for the spliceosome and RNA polymerase, whereas the cytoplasm contains as many mRNA pools as there are coding regions in the circuit, a Pool for the ribosome, and one for the fluorescent protein, the circuit read-out.  Each Part (and each Pool) has an independent model (MDL file). After wiring them together, the model of the whole circuit comes from the composition of"

This amount of similarity gives us confidence that generated protein could perform same function as proteins from the training set.
Conclusions
We have successfully built a novel Generative Adversarial Network for novel Protein generation and then showed that our ProteinGAN is capable of learning the rules and patterns of protein sequences without ever seeing one. To our surprise - the ProteinGAN generated sequences that were not only unique compared to the dataset the networks were trained with, but at the same time being similar to the members of the same enzyme class from public databases.
Therefore, we can confidently say that ProteinGAN is a fully functional neural network that has the proven potential of creating novel and useful synthetic biological parts.

Data preprocessing
In order to use collected data we had to transformed it in a way that is suitable for neural networks. That meant that letters representing amino acids had to be translated to numeric representation. As a result, each amino acid has been encoded into embedding vector of 8 physicochemical attributes (Kawashima, Ogata and Kanehisa, 1998). We opted for using embedding vector due to its memory efficiency in comparison to one-hot encoding technique. In one-hot encoding, the amino acid would be turned in the vector of length 20 with 19 zeros and single 1, whereas with embedding vector, we can use vector which is 2.5 times smaller (See"

Hi guys! I am Elif Özcelik and I am a student at department of molecular biology and genetics. This is my third year in this department and first year in iGEM. I am happy to work for iGEM. When I was a little, daydreamer child, I thought a person who creates things, works in a laboratory and devotes whole life to science should live in a science fiction book, and this thought made me excited for such a life. Now, as a university student, I know this dream is not so far for me. Of course, this is not a science fiction book :) but iGEM provides me a huge step to living for science. Spending nights at laboratory, making researches during whole free times and repeat procedures again and again are hard sometimes for some of us, even for me. I neglected painting and fencing but still iGEM gives a giant pleasure to create some good things (like painting and I hope it will"

Wednesday:
The bacteria with the last ligation didn't grow in kanamycin plates. We believe the digested parts were wrong labeled (or we just didn't understand Simon's label system). Therefore, a PCR colony was run and gave negative results. Decided to digest parts Lux CD and Lux EG + terminator again.
One liter of liquid BG11C media and two schott bottles with 1/2 liter each of BG11C solid were prepared. Expecting to grow our synechocystis soon :)
Colony PCR of bacteria with RS2+B0014+psB1C3 turned out to be negative so a massive colony PCR was run (21 colonies!) corresponding to the kanamycin plate. All PCRs were negative. Could be the primers failing?
PCR of parts Lux CD and Lux EG could not be distinguised, probably because they are the same size as the backbone. Anyhow the parts will be ligated and then transformed.
Thursday:
Lux CD and Lux EG were ligated and then transformed. Everything is being settled for tomorrow's synechocystis transformation.
We took some beautiful photos of our Lux bacteria flask :D!!! Al seems really creepy in there, although Simon believes Al is just trying to hug his new friends (message sent through facebook).
Finally we could try the arduino system and nope, it's not sensitive enough. We'll wait for the sensor which arrives on Monday.
And Carla left today (everyone is leaving us...). She'll be spending the next week in her homeland beerland.
Friday: Synechocystis transformed with: psb1A3_Int C with RFP (from Utah State team) and psbAB+GFP. DNA concentration and volume: 1 ug/uL in 10 uL.
Multi colony PCR of C4 and Lux CDEG consisting of 10 colonies was run. Another four PCRs for B0014+RS2+KanR and one for psB4K5+sfGFP were also run. Lux resulted in two bands and colony PCRs gave several sizes.
Saturday: Terminator B0014 will be replaced for B0015 as we've been having difficulties with the first part.   Synechocystis were changed to plates with half amount of antiobiotic according to protocol.  New colony PCR for LuxCDEG and B0014+RS2 positive colonies.   New RS2 E + P was obtained and then religated with B0015. E. coli were transformed and plated with the part.

How our integrated Human Practices model (iTECH) has shaped SMITe and it's future as a clinical application
SMITe has been molded and refined by interactions between all aspects of our human practices work from the very beginning of our entry into the competition. A schematic for how the exchange of ideas has influenced our project is as follows:
Original research presented to our chosen panel of supervisors
Feedback received which focused on modifying our choice of combat proteins due to possible host immune system interactions.
Presentation of basic ideas to the Bio-hacking community of Stockholm at their annual conference- Evolving
Initial consideration of 'real life' issues: how to effectively communicate the principles of the project to the wider non-scientific community, as well as practical questions on what stage of biofilm formation to target for optimal usefulness.
Revised project plan presented at NiC
Further refinement regarding best candidate combat proteins for our project and modifications to methods, based on feedback from other Nordic teams at the Mini-Jamboree. Movement away from targeting quorum sensing mechanisms.
Discussion and advice received following contact with Adekunle D. Adekile, Professor of Pediatric Hematology.
Guidance towards incorporation of nature’s antimicrobials, ultimately giving rise to research into defensin 1.
Inclusion and further research into defensin 1  leading to deeper consideration of world issues
The increasingly-apparent need for an antimicrobial or antibiotic action incorporated into SMITe was realised; the spotlight naturally then fell on to problems posed by antibiotic resistance
Contact and discussion with Professor of Clinical Microbiology Vincent O Rotimi further highlighted clinical consequences of antibiotic resistance- Health
Development of teaching programs related to this area - Teaching & Community
1) Teaching module for A-level students
2) Consideration that no one is too young for innovation in science: primary school project developed
Response to concerns about antibiotic resistance and it's relation to SMITe for researchers
CARD system devised, further consideration of patient safety aspects discussed- CARD
Request sent to clinician in endocrinology to further explore human (patient-related) issues in continued development of SMITe

INTRODUCTION
This  is an IPTG-inducible model for the expression of the fusion protein CBD  cipA-BMP2 under the control of Plac promoter and cloned in psb1c3. The vector  does not contain the ORF of LacI and thus the LacI repressor protein concentration  is that in E. coli strains (10nM per cell).1
The  model consists of systems of differential equations that were solved in Python  using Spyder 3.6 (Anaconda).

The whole team also attended the biggest event for cystic fibrosis awareness in Sweden, where we presented our project and talked to patients about the need for a new medication.
There main outcome from the patient survey was that there is an unmet need for mucus-targeting medication. In total, 228 asthma patients, 41 CF patients, and 10 COPD patients answered our survey. The reason that a majority of the answers came from asthma patients may be that asthma is a much more common disease than the CF and COPD. We took this in consideration when analyzing our results as the diseases have slightly different needs.
The questions asked to patients:
How long have you been diagnosed with this disease?
Approximately, how many times do you visit the doctor every year?
How many hours a week do you perform any type of physical activity?
Have you been trained on exercises that can improve the capacity of your lungs and help in the progress of the disease?
What is your current treatment? If you are not sure of the name, please describe your medication or state unknown.
How many times have you changed treatment?
Are you satisfied with your current treatment?
Do you have problems with excessive mucus?
On a scale of 1-5, how much has your current treatment improved your excessive mucus?  (1 being not improved, 5 being highly improved).
If a new treatment was to be released, outstanding in the performance of the current ones, would you take it if it involved the use of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) in the body?
If this treatment was to be released, which type of device would be more suitable for its administration?
Up to 50% have changed their treatments more than 5 times, which stated that the current medications do not work sufficiently enough for longer time use. 20% are very satisfied with their current treatments, 45% are satisfied and 35% are not satisfied.
About 50% answered they have issues with excessive mucus. In this answer, we also have to take into account that 228 asthma patients answered, who do not suffer from mucus in the same amount as COPD and CF does. The majority that answered the survey does not think that their current treatment is good enough against the mucus. This is probably our most interesting answer as this clearly states that there is a need for a new effective medicine targeting mucus. Although we have to take into account"

Our team called for papers once the new topic occurred to us. After collecting articles, we did the layout and then distributed new issues to all teams we had managed to get in touch with as soon as possible. With the help of Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris , Newsletter was spread all over the world. In spite of Meetups, we have Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and QQ to keep in touch with other teams in no time. Thanks to their generous help, we successfully publish our Newsletters to the public. Meanwhile, we send Newsletters as attachments to both writers and readers who we’ve contacted. In particular, we are grateful to Stockholm for offering the platform called issuu.com , which made it easier to show our issues. We really appreciated it that Professor Wayne Materi attached us a permitted version of his article named ‘Leading a Successful iGEM Team’ when we began the first issue. 'I am happy that students still consider this article useful. It is a few years old now and I haven’t been involved in iGEM for several years. I’m surprised it’s still relevant.' We’ve managed to get in touch with 76 teams who were interested in Newsletter and finally the following 52 teams from 33 countries joined us.

Paris_Saclay,2016,Team:Paris Saclay#Strategy_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 2: Biobrick design containing all the parts to characterize tripartite split-GFP and FRB*/FKBP12. All our biobricks in one plasmid and no interference.
This construction would give us the first results, validate the functionality of the tripartite GFP and the dimerization of FRB* and FKBP12.
Assessment of the minimal distance to have fluorescence
One of the goals of our project is to assess the system composed of the BDC tool and the tripartite split-GFP. To evaluate the effect of the bring DNA closer tool, we have to know the minimal distance needed to observe fluorescence emission.
This question was also the core of our model , which answers the question: What is the optimal distance between the two dCas9s to observe fluorescence?
This question is essential because the distance between the dCas9s may cause major problems. First, steric hindrance and dCas9 footprint may avoid GFP assembling if we target sequences that are too close. Secondly, the proteins size could prevent the GFP parts from assembling if they are too far away. As a result, fluorescence emission would be detected only if the proteins, as well as the DNA regions, are at a precise range of distance.
To experimentally assess such distance, we decided to design different plasmids containing the visualization target sequences separated from each other by different number of base pairs [Fig3]. To do so, we designed specific primers to carry out reverse PCR and obtain, from a plasmid in which the target sequences are distant by 1kB, different plasmids where the number of base pairs between the target sequences is reduced.  This plasmid was thought to be expressed with the plasmid pSB1C3 containing the BioBricks 3, 4 and 5 (cf design page). The target sequences would have been separated by:
1kB
500bp
150bp
75bp
50bp
Figure 3: Plasmid design to assess the minimal distance needed to have GFP fluorescence and fully characterize the tripartite split-GFP. It would be expressed with the visualization tool BioBrick. The different RT-PCRs would allow us to have different distances between the two target sequences.
Assessment of the DNA regions brought closer
In order to test our BDC tool, all the biobricks previously quoted in the design page should be expressed in E. coli, as well as all the sgRNAs (corresponding to the target sequences and their cognate dCas9s). Later, the team would"

Here is the lumio gel we ran. the order from left to right: ladder, CP, PP, VP, TP. The proteins are at ~25 kDa which is where we would expect our chromoproteins to be and they show up which helps confirm our flag lumio his-tag is present
●
Because this gel showed our flag-lumio his-tag was present we created 250 ml liquid cultures of each of the 4 color producing chromoproteins (VP, CP, TP, PP) which we put into the 37 °C incubator/shaker overnight and will move to the 25 °C incubator/shaker for another day before doing a large scale protein extraction on these 4 chromoproteins
●
Created liquid cultures of TP, VP, CP, and PP that will grow for 6 hours and then we will mini prep this afternoon

Mini prepped cultures created this morning and got ~40 ng/ul when nano dropped
Wednesday, 9/7
●
Because only 4 of our chromoproteins showed color and on plates and in liquid cultures and these 4 chromoproteins were Gibsoned with the same His-tag and backbone we decided to re do the Gibsons for the other 8 chromoproteins that did not work.
●
We PCRed the meffRed backbone with the primers previously designed and also PCRed the His-tag depending on the primers for each chromoprotein
●
We then performed a PCR clean up on the meffRed PCRs and His-tag PCRs

We wanted to see if we needed to re do our Gibson or our primers so we took 1.5 ml of our liquid cultures for the 8 that did not"

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," wanted to ensure that we were creating a project focused on two fronts: on the bees we were passionate about, and on our direct community that we wanted to impact and help. We got in contact with Elizabeth Goldie (Liz) of the Calgary Beekeeping Association and our project took off. After a lengthy phone call with Liz and multiple emails, she sent  us an article by the Calgary Herald.   This article explained how different fungi were killing bees. Not only was this bad for the beekeeping community, it was heavily affecting other industries that depend on bee pollination. Crops such as blueberries, almonds, and many more were affected. From here, we learned about Nosema - and the basis of our project was formed.
However, we did not stop there. Before finalizing this as our project, we set out to meet more beekeepers to see if this was truly an issue they were concerned about in the way Liz was. We attended a talk by Dr. Medhat Nassar at a Calgary Beekeeping Association meeting wherein he spoke about Nosema. It was apparent from this meeting the beekeepers we met there believed that finding a solution to Nosema was critically important. We had completed our first goal of finding a project that was really meaningful to both our team and the community.
From there it was our goal to ensure that beekeepers and other stakeholders were consulted with about every aspect of our project. We wanted to connect with beekeepers both commercial and hobbyists en mass. We knew that we needed to talk to those who worked with bees on a government level and take into account government regulations. We also recognized the need to speak with the people who once produced Fumagilin and wanted to get involved with beekeeping at a corporate level. We then wanted to take what we learned from each of these actors and apply it to our entire project, while also giving back to the community. All of this coalesced in the production of our documentary.
This section is broken up into beekeepers, researchers, beekeeping associations, and other stakeholders that we spoke with.
Beekeepers:
The primary stakeholder in this project is beekeepers. Through the process of the project we contacted hundreds of beekeepers through  exchanged emails, phone calls and in-person interviews with 16 beekeepers. Although  not all of the  interviews are shown in the documentary, they all contributed to our project in some way.
Though the process of making our documentary and while trying to make our project as centered around the beekeeping community as possible, we asked questions which gave us insight only beekeepers could provide about bees. We asked"

Mutation Analysis Xplorer
The Mutation Analasis Xplorer, in short M.A.X., is a python tool and an easy accessable alternative to iCG. This tool helps us to find out whether the unnatural base pair is still existent in the plasmid or not. Due to several mechanisms, the unnatural base pair can be replaced with natural bases. However, the results of this possible point mutations are predictable. This leads to our software tool M.A.X. and a simple PCR experiment to prove the existence of our unnatural base pair. The tool finds similar recognition sites of restriction enzymes and uses these to create an extended sequence with one mutated base. For any base A, C, G, or T at this position another restriction enzyme can cut. But if a new base like isoG or isoCm no restriction enzyme can recognize the sequence and the plasmid stays uncut. Since this system does not require special hardware it is a cheap alternative to iCG.
Mutations
The unnatural base pairs are not stable within the DNA.  Our conservation system handles a lot of mechanisms which remove or replace our new bases.  The process of hydrolysis changes an isoCm to a thymidine, which will lead to a replacement of isoG with adenine. Another reaction with the cause of a mutation is the tautomerisation. This leads to a change from the isoG keto tautomer to an isoG phenolic tautomer. This form of isoG can no longer pair with isoCm, but with thymidine. This will lead, like the hydrolysis, in the next step"

Anja repeated lux operon extraction with pJS-555 instead of  pSK-555 in the hope of getting better results.

Sadly no light from the cells transformed with the extracted lux operon.
Wednesday
Theo attempted to test induction of pBAD in the BMG Labtech plate reader
Thursday
We came in in the morning and viewed the results from the plate reader experiment that had been running overnight. The bacterial lux results were disappointing.  Our positive control was emitting (blue) light.  (See photo on the right), but the other cells which had been incubated with arabinose in the hope of inducing them had not emitted light.
But the most interesting results came from the cells expressing firefly luciferase ( BBa_I712019 ) under a consitutive promoter / RBS ( BBa_J13002 . These showed low light output for 13 hours and then a rapid increase in luminescence, to a level which was sustained until the evening. We left the cells in the reader overnight to continue reading.

Characterizing Base Editing
While we were designing our systems, we wanted to test a previous characterized base editor system, CAMERA, developed by Dr. Liu’s lab at Harvard University. This system consisted of a  high copy number recording plasmid and a low copy number writing plasmid with a base editor and a gRNA. These two plasmids, ordered from Addgene, were transformed into Escherichia coli S1030 that was also from Addgene. Base editor and the gRNA were induced by aTc and IPTG, respectively. By replicating their experiments, we wanted to confirm the linearity of base editing over time and wanted to test how much mutation frequency can we achieve. Different from the literature, we would not use High Throughput Sequencing to analyze the single nucleotide mutation, but would utilize Sanger sequencing and our software tool CrisPy to analyze the readout.
CrisPy
In working with CRISPR/Cas9 systems, it is important to consider off-target effects to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the gene editing. Thus, we developed a software tool, CrisPy, to provide a fast and accurate way for characterizing CRISPR on-target and off-target edits through Sanger sequencing. Software tools have attempted to numerically characterize DNA traces in the past. Mark Crowe’s SeqDoc (Perl, 2005) provided functionality for normalizing and comparing two traces, while Timothy Liu’s Sequalizer (Matlab, 2017) used these comparisons to estimate nucleotide mutation frequencies. Our system builds upon this previous work by utilizing modified versions of these algorithms in a free and concise python module. Moreover, this module creates new functionality by predicting and ranking likely off-target sequences (using Gibbs free energy) and finding their mutation frequencies. We tested this tool using a plasmid containing purposeful off-target sequences and consequently gained insight into our recording circuit’s behavior. It is our hope that synthetic biologists can use this tool to quickly test for off-target mutation frequencies that exist in their system.
Optimizing System
During the discussion with Dr. Seth Childers, the question about how can we increase the base editing rate was came up. According to his feedback and the parameters we found from literature during modeling, we realized the key limiting factor of editing rate was not the single nucleotide mutation catalyzed by"

Yield decreases with complexity of construct
Less flexibility for multiple varied constructs
Antibiotic selection is still required after transformation

Can be tricky to get optimum volumes of fragments
Summary:
While I think Gibson assembly has potential to be a lot more efficient for creating large constructs and the premise is very easy to understand, as an undergraduate who      hadn’t had much experience of planning labwork before I felt I used the technique very badly and it wasn’t surprising. It was unfamiliar to the people I talked to in the      Bioscience department so I had no prior advice, but equally we had no prior advice regarding BioBrick assembly and had no difficulties carrying out that from the protocols. It      was impossible to use Gibson more widely in our project because we needed the flexibility to use the same gene in multiple ways, which BioBrick assembly gave us. While Gibson     assembly may save time, it didn’t get anywhere in our case. It’s far from what I expected, but of the two I preferred BioBrick assembly.
BioBrick assembly was too time consuming for us to manage the operon construction in the allotted time, but it was very successful for smaller constructs in the other      miniprojects. Ideally, and impossibly, BioBrick assembly would be updated to yield a rapid method which did not rely on purification of the construct through transformation,      brothing and miniprepping, which requires a minimum of three days. The advantages of BioBrick flexibility mean it is more suited to a broader iGEM project like ours, but for      teams who want a large construct Gibson may be better.
There are, of course, other assembly methods which are newer than BioBrick and Gibson assembly. While for now it is these two which need to be examined for iGEM, and      hopefully in future there will be data to do this satisfactorily, I think it is most likely that we are a few years away from a technique emerging which gives flexibility, speed     and hopefully can be afforded by teams with less funding.
I would like to extend my thanks to members of the Cambridge 2010 iGEM Team who very kindly shared their experiences of      Gibson Assembly with me.

Introduction
The synthetic oscillatory network designed by Michael Elowitz is  pioneering work. In the first place, based on his model, we want to illustrate how to tune the parameters to get pre-defined wave amplitude and wave frequency. In the second place, besides this three node repressive model, is it possible to propose a alternative topology that could also achieve tunable oscillation. In Tim Gardner 's PhD dissertation, such a different topology is proposed. We search feasible parameter that could achieve oscillation.
Mathematical Formulation
The activities of a gene are regulated by other genes through the interactions between them, i.e., the transcription and translation factors. Here, we assume that this system follows Hill kinetic law.

Fig.11 BLOOMING MODEL
This model is actually an extension of the previous model. Simplify the 5CB into one side of the                         polygons. As the molecular shells increases, the angle between the two sides of the polygon will                         tend to be 90°.
Calculation
1. Obtain the spacing of 5CB molecules
The forces between two molecules are covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metal bonds, hydrogen bonds and                         Van der Waals force. Because no other forces are present, the main force is Van der Waals force.                         The point at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as two molecules near one                         another is called the van der Waals contact distance. Van der Waals force includes electrostatic                         force, dispersion force and induction force.
Fig.12 van der Waals potential energy
We can use a simplified formula: the Lennard-Jones potential[1].
$$E=\frac{A}{r^{12}}-\frac{B}{r^6}$$
where \(A=4\epsilon\sigma^{12}\), \(B=4\epsilon\sigma^6\).
However, there is no sigma Lennard-Jones parameters (Angstrom) epsilon Lennard-Jones parameters                         (kcal/mol) about 5CB, so we calculate the van der Waals contact distance(\(r_0\)) by statistical mechanics[2].
In statistical mechanics, the radial distribution function \(g(r)\) in a system of particles                         (atoms, molecules, colloids, etc.), describes how density varies as a function of distance from                         a reference particle.
Fig.13 The sketch map of radial distribution function
The radial distribution function:
$$\rho g(r)4\pi r^2=dN$$
where \(\rho\) is the density of 5CB, \(N\) is the total number of 5CB molecules. Integrate the                         above formula:
$$\int_0^\infty \rho g(r)4\pi r^2 \mathrm{d}r=\int_0^N\mathrm{d}N=N$$
$$g(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\rho 4\pi r^2}$$
Molecular dynamics calculation:
$$g(r)=\frac{1}{\rho 4\pi r^2"

Figure 3. Distribution of first language among our followers
On the 8th of September a commercial about our project aired on the website and Facebook page of the University of Southern Denmark. We made this commercial in collaboration with the communications department of the University of Southern Denmark, specifically a producer named Anders Boe. It was seen 27,526 times, which is equivalent to 16% of our hometowns population. The click-through rate was around 10%, which is much greater than the average rate of videos on their Facebook page. The commercial led to random people, including doctors on the hospital of Odense, asking team members about the project and about GMO in general. With all this in mind it seems fair to state that the commercial was a smash hit of our human outreach and our engagement in the social media. In combination with our easily recognisable logo and our human outreach initiatives, we have been using our social media as a platform to show interest in synthetic biology and for sharing our work.
After seeing the commercial a local newspaper reached out to us to bring an interview in their Saturday special Newspaper article from Fyens.dk (Danish) . In collaboration with the student media RUST and Beton TV we have been featured in their magazine and a video of our attendance in Boston will be shown on their Facebook page briefly after our return. This is done to ensure an awareness of the iGEM competition among the students on the University of Southern Denmark. We hope this will inspire a lot of students to apply for the iGEM team next year, since it is a hallmark of the SDU-Denmark team to be interdisciplinary.
The effort put into our social media strategy and our goal of following it has paid off. Social media has shaped our outreach and made it possible for us to talk about iGEM and our project to people we did not know. Several times our outreach has led us to public discussion of GMO and solar panels due to persons contacting us, wanting to know more.

Future Plan
It is not practical to transfer our ideas to a fully-completed project or even a portable device just after an enriched summer. We should learn more for the sake of improving our project, making it suitable for feasible usage. Therefore, we list our future plans to develop our projects.
Design-1. Though we have characterized OmpA-ST through SDS-PAGE, in many cases SDS-PAGE is not an optimal method to characterize specific protein in complex samples, like bacterial lysates. For further characterizing our OmpA-ST, we would be inclined to find monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for SpyTag and Western Blot analysis alike. Exploiting with anti-SpyTag mAb, we supposed that the band at about 50 kDa would be stained positively.
Design-2. Similar to Design-1, we would also use monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for L7Ae and SC to validate our L7Ae-SC.
Design-3. For our siRNA-C/Dbox, due to poor experimental instrument, we could only characterize the promotion of RNA level inside our engineering bacteria. The problem is that we could not ensure the presence of our siRNA target for KrasG12D. To characterize this part better, we'd like to use qPCR, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) or low-throughput miRNA target identification method[1] to demonstrate our siRNA could target KrasG12D. Through the incubation of siOMVs (OMVs containing siRNA) and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line PANC-1, the silence effect of the siOMVs could be told.
Design-4. As mentioned above, our chassis is bacterium. Some researchers have demonstrated not only bacteria but also their OMVs could be pathogenetic. Though some governments have approved the usage of OMVs vaccines, the side effects of the OMVs are still ambiguous. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), originated from eukaryocytes, which are often referred to exosomes and mircovesicles, are better choices for nucleic acid delivery for its biocompatibility and homology."

Introducing Synthetic Biology Kits at Educational Institutions
What is better than teaching one class about SynBio?
Enabling many teachers to complete this task!
""If you want to build a ship, do not drum up people together to collect wood and do not assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.""
- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
Introduction
Figure 1: Prepared Educational-Kits, ready for delivery!
Following this famous statement in pedagogics, we realized the importance to inspire and teach students in educational institutions to long for the endless immenseness of Synthetic Biology. We want to make it possible for disciples to take their first steps in the enormously evolving field of Synthetic Biology and let them take a breath of this subject, which will change the world in the near future due to its unlimited fields of application.
The idea is to send an ""Educational-Kit"" with all required reagents and lab-protocols to educational institutions. Based on the experiments we designed we'd like to inspire young prospective people to think about a promising career in science. Our experiments are styled constitutive, based on every previously performed experiment, so every student, independent of training level, is able to understand and take notice of the resulting phenomena enabled by Synthetic Biology.
The Educational-Kit
The reagents, which are necessary for the realization of the experiments are all found in the kit, except for competent cells, which have to be stored at -20°C. It was set much value on the autonomous preparation of the final reagents, so nearly all reagents will be sent in their blank shape. Our aim is teaching the students all, or at least most, of the necessary steps of the designed experiments during the execution."
Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," that the amounts of support it would need from within a health system, that are often rather weak, is going to be minimal. I’ll give you an example people have when promoting these diagnostic tools using mobile phones to look at the back of the eye for example. I bet you are familiar with some of this, but if you can use a mobile phone to look at the back of the eye and make some decisions about what is going on. That all sounds fine and cool and the technology is really attractive. But how you actually implement those is often a bigger challenge and let me go back to that statement: people are often happy to talk about a magic bullet, but in fact what we often need in many places in Africa is the magic gun. If you got magic bullets but you don’t have a magic gun the magic bullets frankly just stay on the shelf. So if we don’t invest in ensuring that the systems are strong enough to ensure it then it could end up just being a nice little piece of technology that doesn’t get used appropriately.
Daniel C.:
We also have a quick question about demographics. Because you were talking about different regions. So are there differences in infection between urban and rural areas or between the young and the old or something like that?
Dr. Courtright:
With trachoma certainly, yes. So it is a disease mostly in rural areas rather than urban. But even in rural areas it’s quite focal, so you would not just say rural areas and leave it at that. You really have to look more specifically. And certainly in terms of transmission we are looking at the highest transmission in preschool children, then it starts dropping when you are looking at the ages five, six and seven. There it’s dropping quite rapidly. Highest transmission rates are going to be in kids with three years of age rather than in the older children.
Daniel C.:
And what would be the reason for […] them to get more likely infected?
Dr. Courtright:
Children at that age […] don’t engage in any kind of personal hygienic practices, they don’t wash their face, they are not concerned about the flies that are landing on around their eyes. It requires somebody else to take to care of them. When a child gets five or six they generally start to talking on that rules for themselves. I think interesting thing you might be aware of is that although transmission in young children is pretty much the same for boys vs. girls. However, if you look at the prevalence of trichiasis (the inn turned eye lashes) in adults, women generally have about a 1.8 – 2 fold"

The electronic speed controller (ESC - Velotech Magic Multirotor 30A Electronic Speed Controller with BEC) provides two functions: controls the motor and provides a 5 V output for the rest of the electronic assembly. The ESC comes with pre-soldered female bullet connectors, matching the rotor. It accepts a PWM input (pulse width modulation) - which means short repeated bursts of voltages, from the Arduino and translates it to differential rotational speed of the motor. It has a 2A BEC, providing a 5V 2A output for the Arduino and H-bridge components that uses a 5V input. When programmed, it can provide braking (using active current to stop the motor), reverse mode, and more.
Peltier plate assembly
A thermoelectric cooler kit was used due to its low cost and effectiveness. It is prebuilt to not require drilling of screw holes and allows for secure mounting of both heatsinks. It is a complete kit with heatsink, thermal paste, Peltier plate, and 12V DC fans, making it ideal for our use. However, we opted for better quality thermal paste and a higher power Peltier plate to meet our needs.
The TEC1-12712 Thermoelectric Cooler was used for our Peltier plate, which was chosen because it allows more current compared to the one that comes with the kit. A Peltier plate works by turning electrical work into a heat differential, with a hot side and a cold side. The difference in temperature is determined by voltage, current, and the temperature of the hot side. More voltage and higher current will result in a bigger difference between the hot side and cold side, but that means more heat is generated and has to be removed from the hot side of the plate for the cold side to be cold.
For example, even if the temperature difference is 80 C because more power (voltage times current) was put into the system, if the hot side is 100 C due to the lack of efficient cooling of the Peltier, the cold side would only be 20 C. However, even if there is only a 40 C temperature difference with less power, if the hot side is maintained at 20 C, the cold side would be at -20 C. Therefore, it's a balance of the"

Human Practices
Even though the field of synthetic biology may seem difficult to define and beyond the remit of many people’s day to day lives, it's presence in our homes and workplaces is ever growing.  Many of the foods we buy, medicines we use and services that are offered would not exist without synthetic biology and are very much taken for granted.
This means that without knowledge of a product's origin, production process, proper usage and disposal, some risks are inevitable.
For these reasons, we believe it is vital to make information accessible to people in all walks of life, allowing them to make informed decisions.
We have tried to demonstrate a model for achieving this through integrating education, increased public awareness and of course, igniting curiosity in synthetic biology.
iGEM Stockholm’s human practices project extends far beyond the bench through our innovative iTECH model, integrating the four different components of our Human Practices work: Teaching, Evolving, Community & Health.
TEACHING: Schools Projects
EVOLVING: Makerspace Lab & Workshops
COMMUNITY: Integrating Human Practices & Nordic iGEM Conference
HEALTH: Expert advice and the development of SMITE
The iTECH model framework has allowed us to develop a public dialogue, which engages with different groups of the population about synthetic biology and the journey from the lab towards our product.
Overall this vastly improved the foundations of our research and challenged us to question how and why our project could be successful.
The following are different ways our Human Practices project has impacted our society:
Raising awareness of synthetic biology at all educational levels (spanning ages 9-11, 15-18 and 20+ in different arms of the project)
Providing an educational backdrop for young researchers on a practical and theoretical basis
Encouraging creative thinking in the approach to combating deep seated problems
Introducing innovative new approaches to treating chronic wounds
Promoting consideration of the global impact of human civilisation and how we can use synthetic biology in the future to adapt to a changing world
Predicting the consequences of inaction in relation to antimicrobial resistance on future generations

Stronger ribosome binding sites increase the yield of translated proteins and in turn increase the number of catalytically converted substrate nucleotides. This increase is inversely proportional to the assigned mean methylation score. Based on this fact, the activity results can be extracted from mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) and correspond to ribosome binding site strength. The catalytic activity sequencing results were compared to earlier measured in bulk RBS strength results. The comparison once again concludes the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The ribosome binding site strength, extracted from the DNA sequence reference nucleotide count correlates with the in bulk measurement data. These results display the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the strength of regulatory sequences and its ability to assign accurate phenotype to genotype linkage.
In addition to ribosome binding sites, we have constructed Toehold regulatory sequence library constituted of a different toehold and triggers pairs was constructed subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different regulatory sequence were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio).
Figure 3. The evaluation of Toehold-Trigger riboregulatory sequence orthogonality using CAT-Seq. The catalytic activity of esterase genes, regulated by different Toehold switches were measured using CAT-Seq. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded regulatory construct DNA template was filtered and assigned. Low methylation scores correspond to actively expressed protein and are only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present verifying the already measured orthogonality of regulatory parts.
The graph displays the mean methylation (reference nucleotide) scores assigned to each barcoded toehold-trigger construct read. Based on the results, low methylation score is only assigned when both Toehold and trigger sequences from the same group are present, due tue esterase being expressed. These results correlate perfectly to the standard (not in droplet) measurement results, carried out earlier. Based on this fact it can be concluded that CAT-Seq activity sequencing method can be utilized as a precise and accurate way to screen and assign the activity and orthogonality of regulatory sequences.

They would fluoresce more not just because they have accumulated more plastic, but also because their cell membranes are larger – therefore, the percentage increase in fluorescence and percent mass would not be the same.
Our lysis experiments depended heavily on having good negative controls. The cultures we were testing were cells that contained the lysis device and the genes for plastic production, and they were induced with 1M (L)-arabinose. The first negative control was a cell culture that contained the lysis device and the genes for plastic production, but it was not induced with arabinose. We would expect that culture to produce plastic, but not lyse, so there would be no plastic in the media. The second negative control was a cell culture that contained the genes for plastic production, but not the lysis device; this culture was induced with arabinose, however we would not expect it to lyse, and all of the plastic would stay inside. Initial tests showed that the cells with the lysis devices had less viable cultures the next day; however, we ran out of time before we were able to test the media for P(3HB).
Protocols
Device construction. Parts for this project were obtained from the 2015 Distribution Plates, ordered from the Registry, or synthesized by IDT. BioBricks assembly was used to construct the devices.
Transforming bacteria. Chemically competent NEB5-alpha E. coli cells from New England Biolabs were used for all parts of this project. Plates containing successful transformants were stored at 4C.
Growing Plastic. Transformed cells were inoculated into Terrific Broth (TB) medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and shaken at 37C for 72 hours.
Extracting Plastic Powder. Liquid cultures of P(3HB) were pelleted by centrifugation at five-minute cycles at 4,000xg at 4C. The tubes with pellets were then placed at -80C for at least one hour, and then rushed down to the lyophilizer, where they were allowed to freeze dry for at least 24 hours. The freeze-dried pellets were then ground up and re-suspended in a 6-10% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution. This reaction is exothermic and significant pressure can build up; we had an unfortunate incident wherein the Eppendorf tubes all popped open in the incubator after only a few minutes. To avoid"

5. Our desA plasmid sequence looks really well-aligned with the expected recombinant plasmid, but we lost a big chunk of sequence in our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene sequence.
Next step: While we re-clone our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene, we were going to transform our desA gene into wild type cyanobacteria and wait a couple days to let them grow in BG11 plate.
(08/04/16)
Repeat PCR for SFR2 and tSFR2
1. Set up the PCR reaction (refer to 08.17.16)
2. Run the gel and extract the gel.
3. Measure concentration with nano drop. SFR2 concentration: 8.1 ng/µl.
Clone SFR2 and tSFR2 PCR product into pJET plasmid
Goal: Since the sequencing result of our SFR2 and tSFR2 gene did not come out good, so we decided to clone them to pJET plasmid to see if we got the actual sequence of our genes , after PCR-ing with the Gibson overhang (~20 bp sequence from the riboswitch plasmid).
1. Set up the ligation reaction on ice:
• 5 ul 2X Reaction buffer
• 90 ng PCR product
• 0.5 µl pJET cloning vector (50 ng/µl)
• 0.5 µl T4 DNA Ligase
• Nuclease free H2O until 10 µl
2. Incubate the ligation mixture at room temperature for 10 minutes. Use ligation product directly for transformation.
3. Thaw the competent cells on ice.
4. Add <2.5 µl ligation reaction to 25 µl cells. Mix gently by flicking the tubes and incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
5. Heat shock at 42°C for 30 seconds. Place back on ice for 2 minutes.
6. Add 250 µl room temperature SOC medium. Shake tubes for 60 minutes at 37°C.
7. Plate 50 µl of the transformation reactions on LB agar plates containing carbenicillin using sterile glass beads. Incubate at 37°C incubator overnight.

While the Environmental Protection Agency primarily uses the CEA approach for nano materials, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., launched efforts to lay out a framework to apply CEA to synthetic biology [4]. This groundbreaking project set out to assess the CEA approach's relevance to synthetic biology, in anticipation of the growing demand for synthetic biology-based solutions to global issues. They arrived at the conclusion that scientists should focus on four major areas of risk assessment: altered physiology, competition and biodiversity, evolutionary prediction, and gene transfer [5].
The Woodrow Wilson Center's Synthetic Biology Project recommended that CEA be applied to more developed projects that were approaching field deployment in order to evaluate it as a risk-assessment approach for synthetic biology at large. Our project is an ideal fit for such an assessment because our collaboration with Ecovative provides an opportunity for our genetically engineered products to be commercially implemented.
We began by attempting to apply the Synthetic Biology Project's modified guidelines for prioritizing research questions to our own project as it currently stands.
Above is a simplified schematic of our risk assessment approach, as adapted from the Woodrow Wilson Center. We hope that this framework will prove useful to other environmental iGEM teams in the future.
Performing a Comprehensive Environmental Assessment on this year's project allowed us to think about crucial future work necessary to make genetically engineered fungal materials suitable for use in the consumer market. Our two largest concerns with commercialization of our genetically engineered product were horizontal gene transfer and loss of biodiversity, and to lessen these concerns we focused a lot of our effort on preventative safety mechanisms.  When implemented, our kill switch system would allow us to quickly initiate cell death.  Successful implementation of the kill switch system would greatly decrease the chance that our fungal strain could outcompete other organisms and decrease biodiversity.  The Cre-Lox recombination system would allow us to remove any potentially harmful genes from the organism before its implementation.  We are most concerned with eliminating horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes.  While these genes are necessary for the selection of transformed organisms, once such an organism is isolated, the gene is useless and potentially dangerous.  Utilizing the Cre-Lox recombination system on our transformed strains after selection but before market implementation would greatly decrease the chance of horizontal gene transfer.
While we are particularly concerned the safety of our project this year, our biosafety mechanisms can also be applied to any other fungal engineering project.  Both our kill switch and Cre-"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," facilitates the binding of Cas9 to the sgRNA. The sgRNA functions as a ‘guide’ to ensure Cas9 creates double-strand breakage at a specific place in the DNA. In eukaryotes these double-strand breaks are glued back together via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) During NHEJ, a few nucleotides are removed from the site of cleavage which leads to the disruption of the gene. This disruption might affect or even completely abolish the activity of the protein it encodes which could lead to phenotypic changes. On the other hand, most bacteria cannot perform NHEJ and therefore die when Cas9 cuts the DNA as their genome cannot be replicated. However, if the target region has been successfully modified, the sgRNA will no longer guide the Cas9 protein to this region of the genome thus preventing cleavage. This makes the CRISPR/Cas9 system an ideal selection tool when editing the genome of bacteria as wild type cells will be killed whereas mutants will survive.
Initially, the CRISPR/Cas9 tool was used to generate knock-out and knock-in genes in various bacterial species. It was quickly realised that this system could easily be altered and so can be used for a much wider range of applications. Genetic modifications of the Cas proteins has allowed scientists to use this system to purify specific DNA regions, image DNA in living cells, introduce specific mutations in the DNA code, and activate or repress target genes, the latter being the most interesting in light of this project (Clostridium dTOX). In order to use the CRIPSR/Cas9 tool for the repression of protein expression, the RuvC and HNH nuclease domains were inactivated in the Cas9 protein resulting in a catalytically inactive protein, nuclease dead-Cas9 (dCas9). Instead of creating double-strand breaks, dCas9 (temporary) binds to a sgRNA complementary DNA sequence thus preventing the mRNA polymerase from binding/continuing transcription and in doing so preventing transcription. This process of reducing protein expression levels with dCas9 is called CRISPRi.

Diagram explaining CRISPRi
Why using CRISPRi for Clostridium dTOX
Ultimately the success of Clostridium dTOX depends on how efficiently the C. difficile toxins are repressed thereby turning C. difficile from a pathogenic (toxic) strain into a non-toxigenic strain. Rather than killing the C. difficile population in the gut"

Introduction
Violacein is a fluorescent reporter with anticancer activity (Carvalho et al., 2006)    that has been used in several other iGEM projects ( Cambridge 2009 , Slovenia 2010 , Johns Hopkins 2011 , UCSF 2012 ). Although it would be a good pigment candidate for     our project, it has a complex synthetic pathway requiring five specialized enzymes      and oxygen (Fig. 2). It also presents multiple off-path reactions that can reduce       the efficiency of the pathway. Before building constructs to use for violacein        production, we needed to find a way to determine which promoters to use for        the five genes involved in the pathway. Although there are studies focused on         the optimization of the production of violacein (Lee et al., 2013), none of         the studies give a biochemical model of the rates of the reactions that take         place in the bacteria.
Objective
Create a biochemical model of the violacein production based on the synthetic pathway and violacein production data from bacteria with different promoters for  each of the five genes involved in the pathway.
Model Assumptions
The rate of dilution of the enzymes and the intermediaries is much greater than its degradation (for example by ubiquitination for the proteins or by conversion to products not included on the pathway)
There is no saturation of the enzymes and all the reactions will follow the law of mass action
Independence of external factors such as oxygen and NADH in the reactions
None of the reactions are reversible
We use the mass action kinetics because this type of equation only requires one parameter for reaction and is less susceptible to overdosing
Model Building Process
1. Modeling Promoter Strength
Because a major goal of the model is to predict the effects of the selection of promoters on the final production of violacein, we decided to find a way to characterize promoters first. To"

Procedure
Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10 µL dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes. Resuspension will be red from cresol red dye.
Label 1.5 mL tubes with part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5 mL tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack. Pre-heat the agar plates by putting them in the 37 °C incubator.
Thaw competent cells on ice: This may take 10-15 min for a 260 µL stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.
Pipette 50 µL of competent cells into 1.5 mL tube: 50 µL in a 1.5 mL tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5 mL tube for your control.
Pipette 1 µL of resuspended DNA into 1.5 mL tube: Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Tap the tube gently to mix. Keep all tubes on ice.
Pipette 1 µl of control DNA into 1.5ml tube: Pipette 1µl of 50 pg/µl control into your control transformation. Tap the tube to mix.. Keep all tubes on ice.
Add 200 uL of SOC medium to the 1.5ml tubes and incubate on 37 °C for 30 min.
Pipette 75 uL of the incubated solution to pre-warmed agar plates containing chloramphenicol. Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
Spin down 100 uL of the remaining cell solution at 6800 g for 3mins and discard 25 µL of the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the remaining 75 µL, and pipette a transformation onto a petri plate. Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples.
Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hr) at 37 °C: Incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). If incubated for too long, colonies may over"

Our primary focus at this time is to attain the proof of principle of the science upon which BEAR is designed. Once we have our proof of principle, we will expand on it and develop a working prototype. We will then make efforts to improve upon our initial designs and expand product development, making more BEAR units and variants of the system that will be able to detect different hormones.
We are consistently updating our business plan and making efforts to help Synbiologica Ltd grow. When we begin to create variants of BEAR and increase product development, we will hire a manager and research lab technicians to oversee development. At this time we will be looking more deeply into medical device certification in Canada, as well as making adjustments to meet regulations in the United States and Europe.
We have already received initial funding from Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (GeekStarter), the South Venture Business Plan Competition, and the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. In the near future, we will apply for the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax incentive program as well as the Industry Research Assistance Program. These programs will help us obtain funds that we can use as salaries for employees as well as funds that we can put directly towards the purchase of materials and equipment needed for the development of BEAR. We will also be applying for the Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Voucher program when we have a functional prototype of BEAR. This program funds a third-party opportunity assessment of our product. In other words, a company in the biotechnology industry will be funded to conduct research that will determine if our produce will flourish in the marketplace. The second Voucher program will provide funds to further the commercialization process, protect our intellectual property and continue improvements of BEAR. We will eventually be seeking private investment that will allow us to continue developing variable hormone sensitive components of BEAR and expand our laboratory capacity.

Characterization of Randomer Variants
For the three sets of randomers for T7 with and without the lac operator, we tested seventy-two different variants and characterized their expression using the same IPTG induction protocol as with the designed variants. The goal of using these variants was to examine the range of expressions that can be produced by random mutations as opposed to directed mutations. The results, as presented in the graph, indicate that the designed variants (with and without lac operator put together) produce a much higher average normalized fluorescence than the randomers.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Glossary_-_-_TEXT.html," by the codon optimized gene; because it replaces “rare” with abundant codons.
Dephosphorylation
The process by which phosphate groups are removed from a molecule by an enzyme called phosphatase. Removal of phosphate groups from a DNA fragment can prevent self-ligation.
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
They are double standard biomolecules which acts as the genetic material for almost all the living organisms. It is made up of basic units called nucleotides.
Enzyme
Proteins that catalyze any complex reaction are called enzymes. They are highly specific on where and under which conditions they react (temperature, pH) and are biodegradable.
Some of the commonly used enzymes in laboratory includes:
Restriction enzymes - also known as molecular scissors, which are used to cleave DNA at a targeted site.
Ligase - enzymes which are used to fuse two ends of DNA.
DNA Polymerase – an enzyme which assembles the nucleotides to create a DNA molecules.
Protease – enzymes which breaks down proteins (in our case, Subtilisin E).
Some of the commonly used enzymes in day-to-day life are:
Rennet - an enzyme that acts on milk proteins to form curd.
Lactase – enzyme used in ice cream production.
Trypsin – enzymes which remove hair from leather products.
Escherichia coli (Abbr. E. coli)
Escherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) are bacteria found in the environment, foods, and intestines of people and animals. It is used extensively in recombinant DNA research because it has been genetically well characterised, which makes them desirable organisms for the researchers to work with.
Esterification
The process of formation of ester from the chemical reaction of an alcohol and a carboxylic acid usually in the presence of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a characteristic pleasant, fruity odour.
Expression
The process by which the genetic information in our DNA are converted into a functional product, such as a protein. It mainly involves two steps:
Transcription – process of conversion of DNA to RNA.
Translation – process of conversion of RNA to protein.
Genetically modified organism (GMO)
A genetically modified organism, or GMO, is an organism which had its genetic material altered through genetic engineering to change a particular characteristic to a desirable one.
Genetic Engineering

NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#Collaborative Report_-_-_TEXT.html," from the Catholic Church praised the development as “a further mark of man’s great intelligence, which is God’s gift enabling man to better know the created world and therefore to better order it.” [32] The statement encouraged continued synthetic biology research, provided that the research proceeded responsibly and did not undercut the sanctity of life.
Faith-based scientists also declared: “absolutely nothing accomplished in synthetic biology by way of synthesizing the genome of a self-replicating bacterial cell from its component parts - which is the most striking and specific technical achievement of the Venter Institute team - demonstrates that life is without mystery or value that goes beyond the assembly of its parts. The mystery of life is amply great, as both religious and secular minds can appreciate, to survive even the most masterful scientific feats.” [33] In other words, we are still far from engineering life de novo, therefore it is not urgent to debate on that matter.
Moreover, discussions about synthetic biology and related technologies often raise objections that scientists are “playing God.” However, the religious communities find this language to be unhelpful at best, misleading at worst. Skeptics of the field are more likely to use the phrase “playing God” than are religious groups. While religious thinkers suggested caution regarding the human tendency toward hubris, none expressed concern that synthetic biologists were “playing God.” [34] The provocative nature of this phrase does more to obscure rather than to illuminate those important moral concerns regarding synthetic biology that deserve serious consideration.
Despite all that, there should be strict regulations in place to regulate synthetic biology research, because responsible science should reject the technological imperative: the mere fact that something new can be done does not mean that it ought to be done. Conversely, how do we ensure regulations do not impede the progress of development? Three principles are prescribed to ensure that: the precautionary principle, the proactionary principle and the prudent vigilance. The first prescribes halting or substantially slowing the progress of scientific research until risks can be identified and mitigated. The second assumes that an emerging biotechnology should be considered “safe, economically desirable and intrinsically good unless and until shown to be otherwise” [35]. The last is a middle ground of those extremes, it prescribes to carefully monitor, identify, and mitigate potential harms over time.
In conclusion, biotechnology has the potential to affect everyone, and opportunities for the public to participate in discussion and deliberation about emerging technologies such as synthetic biology are critical. Robust public participation is essential in both the development and implementation of specific policies as well as in a broader, ongoing national conversation"

Design
Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours,"

Finally, another important snake species of that area is a close relative of the puff adder, the gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica). This snake is not responsible for a major percentage of deaths, but is also very dangerous due to the enormous amount of venom that it injects with its bite, which is the highest among all snakes. This snake was chosen in order to explore the possibility of distinguishing snake venom at the species level.

AMC experiment
7-Amino-4-MethylCoumarin is a fluorescent compound that can be used to create fluorogenic oligopeptides for detection of proteolytic activity. AMC has been used for protease activity assays since 1976 [8], and other amine species, such as nitroanilides, have been used for even longer [9].
AMC emits light at 460 nm, with a maximum excitation at 366 nm.   Due to the primary amine in the aromatic ring (see figure 4), AMC is able to bind to the C-terminal end of peptides. Thus, the AMC molecule will emit light only if the bond between the C-terminal peptide and AMC is cleaved.
Figure 4: Illustration of the chemical structure of 7-Amino-4-MethylCoumarin.
Among the major classes of proteases, serine proteases are one that stands out when analysing snake venoms. As explained in the background page, serine proteases are found predominantly in the venoms of snakes belonging in the viperidae family, with only a few exceptions in other families, such as the elapids. By targeting serine proteases with synthetically designed oligopeptides, our team hypothesised that it would be possible to distinguish snake venom from viperidae from other snake families.
To test our hypothesis, we identified some oligopeptides that have been used in the past to characterise snake venom from different Bitis species. Although studies have been able to document the ability of Bitis venom to cleave blood factors such as fibrin and bradykinin/kallidin [10, 11], no comparative study has ever been carried out, researching the ability to cleave these substrates by snake venoms from across taxonomical families.
We found a suitable peptide substrate in literature [11], and we conducted our initial experiment to test"
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," The 'X-men revolution'.
E. coli naturally occurs in our intestinal flora. The optimal temperature for growth is 37°C and pH is 7-8. E.D. Frosti is genetically engineered starting from E. coli; therefore we assume the bacteria will have the same characteristics. If we were to swallow the bacteria and we would take in the foreign DNA, this could cause the ‘X-men revolution’. The “powers” someone would gain after this, are difficult to foresee. It could result in people who can control ice formation and defrosting by self-secreting the ice nucleating protein and the anti-freeze protein.  For this to take place the DNA would have to get through the nucleus and the cell membrane and find a way to escape or survive the acidity (pH 1-2) of the stomach. Given that the inside of the cell membrane is hydrophobic and DNA is a big hydrophilic molecule, this scenario is highly improbable.  A more probable scenario is that bacteria of the microbiota or the E. coli inside our body exchange DNA with E.D. Frosti. To avoid this, we added a biobrick with DNase activity in our project. We chose the DNase activity as it degrades the DNA without cell lysis and also shuts down its own induction. The degraded DNA stays in the cell, which makes the exchange of DNA with other organisms less probable to occur. The bacteria will be released into the environment once the proteins have been formed and cell death has occurred. Cell debris are found all over the world and we believe that the cell debris won’t cause any problems, because the entire DNA is already degraded and no toxic compounds are found inside the cell.
6. Conclusion
“How safe is safe enough?” We will never know the answer to this question. The only thing we can do is to try to protect ourselves and the environment as much as possible and in case something goes wrong, try to minimize the impact of the outcome. Until now reports of major health problems with genetically manipulated microorganisms are scarce, if not absent. We believe that this is the result of the extensive risk analysis that are made beforehand and the necessary precautions that are taken while experimenting. We intend to make an organism that freezes and defreezes water. It is important that this organism doesn’t overgrow the environment or have toxic properties. We have taken enough safety precautions in our project to minimize the potential negative effects.
The discussed safety problems can be used by people who are opposed to genetically manipulated organisms to scare lay people (people who don’t know anything about this subject). It is important"

Collaboration with Delhi Government:
Our team went on to meet with the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, to talk about collaborating with our team. As a consequence, Delhi Government has agreed to implement the project at a larger scale all throughout Delhi. So, basically, our project is going to affect the lives of people in an entire state, and what else can be a bigger achievement for us!   Not only that, we also made sure that the ethical restrictions on synthetic biology be eased out, thereby allowing a higher research scope and better outcomes. And, finally made him aware of the present scenario of Synthetic Biology, and made it a point that it gets publicised in a proper fashion all throughout India.
The literal impact our project can have on pollution control and the potential it has was enough for our Government to assure their tie up, which certainly is a big step taken ahead.

Verify the expression of SAHS protein
Firstly, we used the BBa_E1010 (mRFP) as our report gene to make sure the circuit for expressing the SAHS protein was constructed precisely. But we did not observe the distinct color on the plate as it was so weak unless the E.coli was cultured in a tube and centrifuged. So we had a new test by using the BBa_K592009 （blue chromoprotein）as our report gene and got a distinct color on the plate.
Figure 1. These are the pictures our fluorescently characterized plate and bacterial pellets. The report gene on the left is BBa_K592009, and the one on the right is E1010. Some colonies on the left are blue, which are the DH5α that we successfully transferred to the designed genetic loop. The leftmost EP tube in the right photo is the control, and the other two EP tubes contain DH5α which we had successfully transferred to the designed genetic loop.
And then, we transformed the plasmid to the E.coli BL21, which is always used to express proteins with high efficiency to verify the SAHS protein was produced successfully with a small scale. Besides, whether the SAHS protein with a signal peptide could be secreted was determined by SDS-PAGE.
Figure 2. The marker is on the lest, followed by our control group (the BL21 with the empty plasmid), and the third well is the concentrated supernatant.
As shown in the image above, we also explored the appropriate temperature for SAHS protein expression."

Full size CR2 Gag-Prot-RT occurs at ~90 kDa. Putative degradation products occur at 75 kDa and 50 kDa. We predict that these bands correspond with the full-size Gag (~52-54 kDa) and the Gag-Protease (~54-75 kDa).
IV. Tricine SDS PAGE purification of CR2 Gag-Prot-RT 28℃ and 35℃
Purpose: For the CR2-Gag-Pro-RT proteins induced at 28℃ and at 35℃, a Tricine Gel run based on Haider et al., 2012’s protocols was performed. The tricine gel was used to separate proteins of 5-30 kDa or less. This will separate the RT protein from the full Gag protein and allow us to extract gag via gel extraction.
Attributions: All experiments conducted relating to the Tricine gel purification was done by John Banasihan.
Materials and Methods: In this experiment Haider et al., 2012’s protocols were followed with some minor adjustments due to availability of resources. 10% APS was used to make both the stacking and resolving gels. The stacking gel consisted of 0.76 ml of 2.5M Tris (pH 8.8), 3.42 ml DI H 2 O, 150 μl APS, 0.66 ml of acrylamide bisphosphate (29:1, 30%), and 5.0 μl of TEMED. The Resolving gel consisted of 5.6 ml of 2.5 M Tris (pH 8.8), 0.90 ml of DI H 2 O, 3.33 ml of AB (29:1, 30%), 150 μl of APS, 6.0. A running buffer was made of 3.03 g of Tris base, 4.5 g Tricine, 0.5 g SDS in 1 L of DI water.
Results and Discussion: The Tricine gel does not show a clear separation of proteins 5-30 kD in size. While there are some bands that are indicative of the presence of Gag and the Gag-Pro polyprotein, there appears to be no"

“I was in a robotics club in high school, but it didn’t give me the satisfaction of working in a field related to another one of my favorite subjects: biology. So, reading about iGEM (essentially DIY biological robots) on the New York Times came as a friendly surprise to me. I joined the iGEM team at University of Washington, initially learning everything about research, and eventually contributed 4 and half years of hard work to iGEM for Washington. In 2010, our first year, my brilliant teammate Sean wrote his first author paper on the project. In 2011, our team won the grand prize in the competition! Being on such a high performance team was extremely rewarding, but the fact of the matter is that I still don’t know a lot of things, even after that experience – I came to realize this after countless mistakes I made throughout my PhD program. I know so little, which speaks for how much more there is to be discovered in this field. There are countless possibilities on where synthetic biology could lead the scientific world. If I were to have unlimited resources to put in scientific research, I would develop synthetic brains. Is it possible that we could maintain a human mind in there? Maybe we are just brains ourselves, built to power a large computing machine.”

“I find the constant problem solving in research really engaging. It’s a puzzle embedded with problems from small day-to-day issues, such as figuring out why you’re getting wonky PCR results, to those larger problems with meaningful implications that you’re working towards solving, like discovering how blood vessels form in tumors. Synthetic biology presents an exciting way to tackle an astonishing variety of problems because it’s often limited only by the imagination. “Do you have anything else to say to the post reader?” “I don’t think so.” “Okay, good.” ”

Because this survey also really helped us to improve our project and step forward, we see the necessity of communication between scientist and iGEM teams. Therefore, we also helped the iGEM teams from Aachen, Göttingen, Bonn, Hust-China and Bourdeaux, by answering their surveys.

Istanbul_Tech,2016,Team:Istanbul Tech#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM Team for our design of a Do-it-yourself FRET measurement system.
We were thinking about a measurement device for our project, but since we are all molecular biologists, we could not make any serious progress about actually doing the hardware. So, we discussed our ideas with the Washington iGEM Team.
And of course they sent us a feedback report. They approached our design from a different perspective, and ended up giving us brilliant ideas.
METU HS iGEM Team
We collaborated with METU High School teams in many aspects including sharing the protocols and mutually cloning of our parts.
Besides, we made MD simulations of FimH protein with its natural ligand HETA for their project. They wanted to know whether the ligand HETA interacts with the FimH or not, and we found the answer for them.

Game play：Synthetic bio-Farm
Download the Game to PC
Synthetic bio-Farm is a flash game developed by us; it presents how several BioBricks can be composed by function to solve a series of problems in building a bio-farm. As we all know, IGEM has accumulated a huge pool of BioBricks, hoping that one day they can be composed to apply in numerous practical areas. However, due to the limitation of our knowledge, effective composition of these BioBricks has not been achieved. But our imagination has no restriction; we would like to achieve this goal in a vivid game, presenting the potential of synthetic biology in solving daily problems.
In the game, the player’s task is to build a bio-farm on a degraded land through which a heavy metal polluted river run. He can turn to seven Biobricks for help in order to finish the task.
The seven Biobricks and their functions are as follows:
Auxin System was designed by Imperial College London IGEM 2011 to help ordinary seeds fight degradation. It works by Implementing the Auxin system into a seed coat.
Bio-decontamination Kit was designed by PKU IGEM 2010, which can accomplish the detection and absorption of heavy metals in aquatic conveniently. In the game, player should build a little water processing workshop to get clean water. Clicking the workshop, players will enter a mini-game to gather the heavy metal icons and to win IGEM coins in a limited time.
AgrEcoli is a cheap, versatile soil fertility sensor developed by BCCS-Bristol IGEM 2010. It can help map the nutrient content of the fields and thus avoid excess fertilizer use.
SynBiological Bug Buster was designed by HKUST IGEM2009. It’s a novel yeast strain that could detect, attract and eliminate pests.
E.glowli was designed by Cambridge IGEM 2010. E.glowi can generate bright light output in a range of different colours. It can provide plants with extra light in"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"idium bromide (EB) is an intercalating agent commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) to determine DNA and RNA location in agarose gel and SDS-PAGE gel. Due to its ability to intercalate and deform double stranded DNA, EB is considered as a strong mutagen and carcinogen which would impair DNA replication and transcription, as well as to damage mitochondrial DNA during cell proliferation.
Mostly, the amount of EB used in the laboratory (0.25C1 mg/ml) is below the level of toxicity. However, for students under chronic exposure to EB, the potential risk still exists.
EB may evaporate under high temperature (60oC or higher). Thus, EB should not be added into gel when it's not adequately cooled. For protection, nitrile gloves and masks are required.
The disposal of EB remains a controversial subject. Generally, purification treatments are required before the disposal according to different concentrations.
For solvents containing EB over 0.5mM, the solvents should be diluted below 0.5mM and mixed with certain amount of KMnO4 and HCl or NaOH. Low concentrations of EB can be simply mixed with active carbon for at least one hour.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important non-proton polar solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds. It is widely used in MTT stain and cell preservation.
DMSO is a combustible reagent that must be kept in sealed containers away from heat or flame. Also, it is thought to be toxic for blood vessels, liver and kidney. Also, due to its high affinity with skin, toxins and medicines dissolved in DMSO can be quickly absorbed into human body, which may cause potential side effects, including headaches, burning and itching on contact with the skin.
DMSO can be absorbed mainly through breathing and skin-contacting. For prevention, gloves and eye protectors are required in experiment with DMSO. Common nitrile gloves may provide protection from brief contact but may degrade rapidly in contact with DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15 mil) latex gloves are recommended.
Chloroform, or trichloromethane, is a colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid that is produced on a large scale as a precursor of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and refrigerants.
Chloroform may cause irritation to eyes, skin and mucous membrane. Prolonged dermal exposure can result"

Possibilities
 Bacteria motility:
The motile cell will trigger a repellent in the cell population to which it is approaching, along with a reporter, then it would move to the second cell population, and in this way they  will share roles.
Repellents -> weak organic acids such as formic, acetic acid, benzoic, and salicylic [works by decreasing intracellular pH]. Amino acids as leucine and valine, indol. Also alcohols, polyols, and  heavy cations (Co and Ni)
The stimulus is detected by a membrane receptor (MCP methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins) TSR, Tar, Trg, Tap [These 4 described in E.coli].
The signaling cascade is initialized when a conformational change is induced by the ligand in the cytoplasmic side of the protein. This change is recognized by a complex formed by CheA-CheW. CheA is a kinase that is inhibited when the ligand recognizes attractors and is activated when repellent is present. CheA donates its phosphate to CheY and CheB, CheY-P interacts with a complex that has a switch function at the base engine scourge, this switch is responsible for the change between CW [clockwise] and CCW [counterclockwise]. Studied in S. thypimurium and E. coli.
We still face the problem of degrading the existing repellent [activator], and accumulation of noise.
The point would be to generate a molecule in which we can control its expression, maybe a hormone, but we would need  to generate a chimera to recognize our hormone and trigger the cascade that indicates repression to CW-swim. As we see, it is the same as the project submitted by the Rice University but with the difference that it will be a repellent version. So if we"
