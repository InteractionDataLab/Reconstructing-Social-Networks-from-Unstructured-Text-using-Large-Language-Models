Communication
Synthetic Biology is a quickly developing field. If we want to enhance the development of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, communication is necessary. In this year, we communicated with different people, such as the researchers of SJTU in multiple fields including physics and electronics, the biologists in our city, and many new friends in different districts and the people working in corporations. Through the communication, we gave what we can offer to help people know more about Synthetic Biology and learned a lot from others.
Communication with Undergraduates in Shanghai
On April 21st 2013, we took part in the Life Science Forum of Undergraduates in Shanghai, which was held in Second Military Medical University. In the forum, we delivered a report introducing iGEM, synthetic biology, our team as well as our project last year to other schools that hasn't taken part in the iGEM competition. Many undergraduates and teachers proposed various questions about synthetic biology and our 'Membrane Magic' system construction.  Students from TJU as well as ECNU showed much interest in iGEM competition. They are planning to join our iGEM family in 2014. We also got lots of new ideas from other future-biologists through our communication!
Communication with New Friends around China
In this year we communicated with many new friends, including many iGEM participants.

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html," the more ROS it will produce. In the recent decade scientist found that the occurrence of cancer is closely related to the level of ROS. But it is not a simple positive correlation as we expect[5].
Figure 4. ROS Level
From this picture we can get to know it clearly. As we know, we use oxide stress to describe the level of ROS in our cell. There is a threshold of oxide stress which is the critical value between normal cell and cancer cell. As a normal cell, its oxide stress is lower than the critical value while the ROS production value is over the threshold. On the one hand, when the oxide stress in our internal environment increases, normal cells may mutate to cancer cells if the ROS value is higher than the threshold value. On the other hand, cancer cells may die because of the accumulation of ROS. So the key point is, when ROS value higher than the maximum, we can kill the cancer cell while ROS value lower than the threshold we may push normal cells to change into cancer cells. So the level of ROS is in a specific range which we can measure using chemical methods.
Think about a proper range of ROS's concentration. Is it familiar to you as we mentioned a similar problem when talking about advantages of oscillatory system as biosensors? H2O2 is a kind of ROS. The oscillation will happen only when the concentration of is H2O2 between the maximum and the minimum. By regulating our circuits to let it respond in the proper concentration range which matches the ROS range of cancer cells, we can use the oscillatory system as a biological cancer detector.
In our experiments, we found that we can regulate flow rate and some parameters of microfluidic chip such as the depth of the well, the width of the channel and the concentration of H2O2 to change the period and amplitude of the oscillation. So by changing parameters of microfluidic chip, we can get a proper concentration range of H2O2 if the oscillation works. From then on, we can extract some cancer tissue to detect the ROS concentration in the microfluidic chips or get some suspected tissue on chips and diagnose whether it contains cancer cell.
2 Periodical Killer
2.1 Drug delivery
Our circuit also has a great potential application in periodic drug delivery. It is amazing when we realize that the oscillate circuit can control the drug to release in a specific period and the concentration of the drug is related to the amplitude. It is well-known that nowadays drug-release is a very hot research field. Many efforts are focusing on how to modify or delivery drug using materials such as synthetic polym"

Lab work
The deadline is now really closing in. Everyone is super busy in the lab to reproduce as much data as possible to make our results ever prettier. So, less time is spend on blogging :)
Emulsifier
We tried to isolate the emulsifier proteins from the pellets we made last friday. It was a bit disappointing, but expected, that the total protein yield was lower than last time. This is probably caused by the fact that we stopped the growth of the culture before it reached the stationairy phase at OD600 of 0.6. The total finale volume per sample was 1 mL.
The rough protein yields were determined by Bradford analysis:

So it looks like Esengul was right about the higher IPTG induction at lower growth temperatures.
The samples were used in the emulsifier assay, to determine their emulsifying capacity. I used 0.75 mg of protein in each sample. This is the first draft of the data analysis:

Hugo:
ADH – significant difference between our strain and empty plasmid – Dodecanol  and NAD, measure production of NADH. Standard unit:  Micromol/min/mg protein (value – would be enough to support (some) growth)
pCaif – do it again… results don’t prove that our BioBrick works. Leaky promoter? Grow on Ethanol (2-5 gr/L) to have the promoter switched on all the time. Also try higher concentrations of Glucose – maybe 2 g/L is already keeping the GFP production on?
Solvent tolerance: done (not an empty plasmid, but K12…) Emtpy plasmid would be better
Thias:
LadA – add substrate as last, before you add this this shows a background, after you add the substrate look at the slope – this is called Substrate specific conversion.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Switch_-_-_TEXT.html," of genes that regulate one another through repressor and activator proteins that they encode.
Design of our Bi[o]stable Switch
The simplest of such biological switches is one in which each of two repressor proteins represses the synthesis of the other. When both the repressor proteins are allowed to act, one of two stable states will be observed. In one steady state, the expression of repressor ""one"" is turned on and expression of repressor ""two"" is turned off. The repression of expression of repressor ""two"" is maintained by repressor ""one"", which means that the repressor ""one"" essentially acts as its own activator by inhibiting the expression of the repressor, repressor ""two"", that would repress its expression. In the other steady state, expression of repressor ""two"" is turned on and expression of repressor ""one"" is turned off.
In a system where the repressors can be controlled by outside input signals such as inducers or anti-repressor proteins, the system can be forced into its other stable state. This is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Simple bistable switch.
We looked to nature for inspiration to design such a switch and found the regulatory systems of the lambda phage as well as the Gifsy phages. The Gifsy phages are temperate phages found in Salmonella enterica that have an overall gene organisation typical of the lambdoid phage family (for more theory please see Regulatory Systems ).
Step-wise Engineering of the Switch
In our bistable switch we have three elements of regulation:
divergent promoters with repressors from the Gifsy phages
anti-repressors from the Gifsy phages
antiterminators from the lambda phage
All these elements are included to make the switch very robust.  The step-wise construction of the Bi[o]stable switch is demonstrated here – parts will be added as we build it up.
Step 1: The promoters and the repressors
The divergent promoters from the Gifsy phages are made up of a very strong pR promoter, and a less strong pRM promoter which controls expression of a repressor that represses the pR promoter (personal communication: Sebastien Lemire), see figure 2.
Figure 2: The two divergent promoters pR1 and pRM and the repressor GogR have been highlighted.
Since the divergent promoters do not have equal promoter strength, we decided to include two sets of divergent promoters from Gifsy1 and Gifsy"

Production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius inhibition. The second plan consisted in applying the purified antimicrobial peptides, after their production in E. coli BL21 (DE3), in the bee bread we knew larvae ingested in their diet.
Learned obstacles regarding the method:
Bee bread is mainly stored in the hive so there is little chance that the peptides reach the larva.
The third plan consisted in applying the purified peptides sprinkled as a liquid solution or as a powder on the hives.
Learned obstacles regarding the method:
When the product is found scattered in the hive, it can be easily affected by external factors such as air or other insects.
We were able to arrive at the final application method with the recommendation of MVZ Ernesto Tanús who considered that the most suitable way to apply our product would be through the liquid food beekeepers provide to the hives and that nurse bees ingest to feed the larvae subsequently.
Experimentation plan
We integrated three aspects discussed during our interviews within the future  experimentation plan of the project:
Add an innocuous color dye to the nanospheres to make the track in the bee system and ensure that the product reaches the larvae. This topic was discussed during the meeting with MVZ Ernesto Tanús Sánchez, MVZ Adolfo Arroyo, and Eng. José Luis González Miranda.
Test the research on the pure Italian Apis mellifera spp. ligustica, as it is the most widespread in the world. This information was considered thanks to the video call with FAI presidential staff member Lorenzo Della Morte.
Extract the hypopharyngeal glands of the nurse bees after they consume the liquid food where nanospheres were added in order to determine if there is the presence of AMP's. Consideration taken from the conversation with Ph.D. David de Jong.
Important considerations for the project
MVZ Ernesto Tanús considered it was essential to take into consideration the factor of the microbiota of the bee, regarding the fact that there would be AMP's supplied that can alter the natural microbiota. Regarding this same subject, Ph.D. David De Jong considered that our product works like the antibiotics humans use; there is the negative part that the intestinal flora will be affected, but this is in search for a greater good, attacking pathogens. The experimentation is necessary in order to be able to know what would happen with the microbiota of the bee and what consequences this situation could bring.
Another of the considerations of Ph.D. David"
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," a better time constant was observed (even with poor cuvette drying). We transformed limonene synthase from 2013 kit plate 4. We discovered that we need spectinomycin to use the holin parts registry plates. We got colonies from the pC13AY transformation and cultured them for gel screening. For fluorescence, no colonies were found on pAK13AN and pAK13AO plates. We centrifuged potential pC13AQ cultures for 10 min at 5000g and poured off supernatant. We kept the cell pellets in the fridge for mini prepping tomorrow. We also found two colonies each on the PtrpC and GFP plate and PtrpC and mRFP plate. We picked off all the colonies and grew each up in 5 ml liquid LB with CM antibiotic. pC13M and pC13K plates are now ready for miniprepping. We could not miniprep the cultures of pC13AS, pC13W, and pC13Y due to running out of our miniprepping supplies.
We are starting cloning of limonene synthase and continuing cloning of the Cre gene.  Cloning of fluorescent constructs is going well.

We still didn’t receive a miniprep kit so we pelleted the pC13AY cultures. The PCRs we ran on pC13F to append homologous regions and append cut sites may have been successful. DNA was present but in low concentrations that we could not check on a gel. We had transformants for pC13BX and pC13CJ so we ran a colony PCR and made cultures. The colony PCRs showed little to nothing on the gel, perhaps because Taq polymerase lost activity. We will miniprep the culture and use Q5. We also attempted a restriction cocktail digest today for both mRFP and GFP inserts. We cut pC13Z and pC13AK with Xba, PstI, SacI, and ApaLI. We also performed a colony PCR of pC13AT cultures and pC13AU cultures using primer 23 and 24 to verify length of inserts. The lengths should be around .7kb for each insert. When we ran a gel of the PCR products, the colony PCR showed a .7kb insert for pC13AT colony 1 and a .3kb insert for pC13AT colony 2. The bands for"

D-aspartate and L-aspartic acid-4-benzyl ester were chosen because of their structural similarity to D- aspartate. Moreover, the four flavors – vanillin, geraniol, caffeine and sodium cyclamate were interesting to test. The most interesting chemical is 2-ethyl-hexanol, a volatile organic compound related to lung cancer [2]. As mentioned above, the library selection assay was performed (Fig. 2A). After three rounds of selection of the fastest E. coli were sequenced. Figure 16 depicts novel identified chemoreceptors. A particular color code reflects the sequence identity and structure similarity. The novel receptor colored in red with amino acid sequence LTAQPD…SSAVP was identified two times for D-aspartate, 2-ethyl-hexanol and sodium cyclamate. Another novel receptor colored in orange with amino acid sequence PPAQPP…PSAVT was found two times for L-aspartic acid-4-benzyl ester and once for caffeine. However, for caffeine a structural related receptor mutant to the orange colored receptor was identified since the amino acids proline and serine are similar in structure.
Epilogue
In conclusion the selection method worked although the selectivity was low. Nevertheless, we hold two novel chemoreceptors in our hands. All these experiments provide evidence for the functionality of the BioBrick K777001.

The key to success of these measures is that they break the parasites life cycle at the transmission stages between the host species. Whilst the implementation of modern sanitation would be a very desirable and hugely effective step to the prevention of schistosomiasis, it is also very expensive to provide whole communities with this kind of infrastructure, which on top of that would have to be maintained continuously to prevent relapses of the parasite. This is why health care organisations have taken a different approach, aiming to reduce morbidity rather than elimination of the parasite. Our project would be of great use to this strategy, as it would allow special mapping of Schistosoma presence, which could be followed up by targeted treatment of the population in the endemic areas.  So far methods to detect cercaria have been time consuming or require complex, spacious equipment. In the following section some previously developed trap designs are described.
Shiff et al. 1993
Graczyk and Shiff 2000
Ahmed et al. 2002
The traps make use of glass slides 25mm x 75mm coated with a matrix to which the cercaria adhere, such as agar or clear nail varnish, which proved to be most effective. This matrix is mixed with fatty acids, ranging from chemically pure linolic acid to locally produced seed oils, to acting as chemoattractant as well as stimulus for invasive behaviour that lures the cercaria to the trap. Once the attempt to burrow into the matrix they get stuck and can later be detected.  In order to detect cercaria with this method, the whole trap has to be submerged for 2-3 hours. The second study analyses the use of this trap to detect avian Schistosoma which works, however with the same time constraints described before. the last study examines the use of locally produced oils, such as olive oil, which works to some extent, but not as efficiently as pure linoleic acid. This trap design therefore fails to provide results fast and additionally is not very reliable, particularly in flowing water.
A different approach to detection of cercaria is the use of mice. These are partially submerged in water for some time, usually around an hour, and, after some weeks for the parasite to developed, dissected. This method is both time-consuming and requires the killing of"

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1,"
ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#ApproachA_-_-_TEXT.html,". The rotational bias resulting from the concentration difference is imaged by acquiring a video of several spinning       bacteria. To avoid aliasing when capturing the rotation, the acquisition frame rate is 28 frames per second to safely resolve the rotation frequency of 2-9 Hz[1]. The images are acquired with a light microscope, developed by our team.       By utilizing a microfluidic chip, we confine the bacteria to a known location. This has the advantage that we can image their response to multiple subsequent concentration changes.
Processing
To read out the rotational bias of the bacteria, a thorough in silico analysis is conducted for every video. First, rotating cells are selected, while completely fixed and freely moving ones are disregarded. From the small selection of       spinning bacteria, only ones rotating nicely around a clear axis are used for analysis. Then, the bacteria’s rotation is analyzed frame by frame by reading out the angle between the bacteria’s position for subsequent frames. The rotational       bias is then computed by comparing the bacteria’s natural tumbling frequency, which is 1 Hz on average [3], to its frequency right after the concentration change. This yields the desired output of the biosensor.
Chemotaxis as a biosensor to control the robot
The increase in ligand concentration will directly lead to a change in the rotational bias of the bacterium - an increase yields longer CCW rotation, while a decrease yields more tumbles. This information is directly gathered from the imaging       data. Since the bacteria quickly adapt to the new concentrations and restore their original tumbling frequency, the field of view can be kept on the same population of bacteria, which will adapt to the concentration change and therefore can be       used for subsequent measurements.
Experiments Approach A: Chemotaxis
The first try to image the reaction of the bacteria to a ligand was done by simply image the motility of freely moving bacteria on a coverslip. The bacteria showed very high activity, however, it quickly turned out to be impossible to track       the cells on the coverslip since they are moving in three dimensions, i.e. in and out of focus.       Afterwards, they were observed using a counting slide, which is confined in the z-direction. There, the first aspartate experiments were done by simply pipetting in the desired concentration into the counting slide. The experiment was done in       M9 medium, which did not contain any aspartate. This allowed us to have control over the final aspartate concentration. Even if the problem of bacteria moving out of the focal plane was no longer existing, there were still several other       problems persist"

They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.
Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Introduction
In the native DCM-degrading bacterium the following genetic construct exists:
Figure 1shows the the gene region under investigation and manipulation in the design of our biosensor. PdcmA and PdcmR describe the two directions of a bidirectional promoter that is bound and modulated by DcmR
Oxford iGEM has isolated this intergenic region that contains a bidirectional promoter. We have termed these ""PdcmA"" acting towards the right in the direction of the gene encoding DcmA, and ""PdcmR"" acting towards the left in the direction of the gene encoding DcmR.   The literature claims DcmR to be a regulatory protein acting to control the expression genes encoding DcmA and DcmR. Little is known about the different parameters in each direction.
We have observed and characterised the effect of DcmR regulating both promoters; in both directions under the influence of DcmR.
This is a new tool for molecular biologists wishing to manipulate stoichiometries of genetic products in the same construct.
We have also characterised PdcmA repression as a double repression system with DCM modulating DcmR activity resulting in derepression of genes downstream of PdcmA. This DCM sensitivity is not observed in the PdcmR direction. Wetlab Results:
Is DcmR a repressor or an activator at PdcmA/PdcmR promoters?

Timecourse fluorescence data normalised to OD (600nm) is shown and summarised in the bar charts. Data is shown for both promoter directions (PdcmA and PdcmR). Standard error bars are shown.
Conclusion: DcmR is a repressor of both the PdcmA and PdcmR promoter.

Then, to better quantify cellulose binding, we would need to assay using absorbance left after x number of washes. After this characterization is finished, we would then reconstruct a HYDRA with cellulose and spores. If we succeed, the bioHYDRAs could then be used as a reversible, biological, self-folding mechanism for biOrigami. In conjunction with bioplastics, we can then create structures that contain both reversible and irreversible folds, expanding the potential and complexity of the structures we make with biOrigami.
Protocols
Making HYDRAs (from Columbia's Chen at al.: [1]
We used 5µl of 0.1% Poly-L-Lysine to coat the polyamide tape on each spot where we wanted to put spores. We then allowed it to dry for several hours. A spore-glue mixture was made using 1µl of Elmer’s glue with 1 ml of a suspension of spores (2.55e9 spores/ml). 10µl of this spore glue mixture was applied to the poly-L-Lysine coated surfaces and allowed to dry. It is crucial to ensure that there is no surface on the polyimide tape that is not covered with spores.

The 3D reconstruction algorithm then functions as a digital lens, cutting the joint wavefronts in minuscule distances near the object, rendering a stack of cross-sectional wavefronts. Based on the stack of wavefronts, or interference patterns, the image of the object can be reconstructed in different depths, thus achieving an axial resolution for 3D imaging.
Figure 5. Simple DHM setup: From left to the right: A laser beam is split in object and reference beam with a beam splitter. A series of optics focus the beam on the sample and magnifies the interference pattern. A second beam splitter superposes reference and object beam on the camera screen (picture taken from [17]) .
The inline flavor of the DIHM kicks in when neither lenses nor beam splitters are needed as in the typical DHM setup. Instead a point light source is used, which can be produced by passing a collimated light source through a pinhole. The point source creates a spherical wave, illuminates the object, and reaches the image sensor containing the joint wavefronts of both, the reference beam and the object beam. Due to the fact that the peripheral of the wavefront passes by and remains unaffected by the object it creates the reference beam. The wavefront passing through the object forms the object beam.
Figure 6. Simple DIHM setup: From left to the right: camera, sample, pinhole and light source (LED).
In the above picture, a laser source of wavelength
λ
emanates from a pinhole, forming a spherical wave. A small object is typically placed a few thousand wavelengths from the source, reaching the image sensor much further away such that magnification is achieved. Small object means that the object should only block a small fraction of the spherical cone wavefront recorded on the image sensor. Otherwise classical diffraction dominates the image, where 3D reconstruction based on holography would no longer work due to the lack of the reference beam.
The 3D reconstruction algorithm uses the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz transform to reconstruct the wavefront one at a time, on several planes at various distances near the object. When the stacks of reconstructions are made, a 3D image with depth information can be built.

Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including expulsion. In journalism, plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics, and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include quotations or give the appropriate citation. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.
Plagiarism is defined in multiple ways in higher education institutions and universities. To name a few: Stanford sees plagiarism as “use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form”; [16] Yale views plagiarism as “the use of another’s work, words, or ideas without attribution” which included “using a source’s language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original”; [17] Princeton perceives plagiarism as the deliberate use of “someone else’s language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source”; [18] Oxford characterizes plagiarism as the use of “a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit”; [19] and Brown explains plagiarism to be “appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source”. [20] As well-known institutions, they reflect a common academic definition of plagiarism. Lack of citation, giving credit, or attribution is considered to be plagiarism. In academics, committing plagiarism comes down to failing to cite sources.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#drugdel_-_-_TEXT.html," Conjugation, when one bacteria passes DNA to another, is the only form of horizontal gene transfer involving cell-to-cell contact (Holmes and Jobling, 1996).  The physical lack of cell-surface proteins, and subsequently, the state of being completely undetectable by a host’s immune system, is not a safe set of bacterial parameters to be left free-floating within the body.  If an invading bacterium conjugates with our GEM and receives this set of genetic changes, its inability to be controlled by the body’s immune system could have devastating consequences for the host.  Unless the act of bacterial conjugation can be prevented in vivo, avoiding immune system interference may seem like a tricky task for the future.
Another issue is drug dosage.  A convenience of pills is that the amount of medicine in each capsule is constant, reducing issues related to under or overdosing.  The fear is that bacteria may overproduce or underproduce their drug, resulting in faulty treatment, or they may over-replicate, resulting in drug overproduction.  As the drug will be produced within the cell, the way to preemptively solve these problems would be to characterize the drug-producing gene to know the rate of drug production versus the rate of AMP production, as well as the rate of bacterial replication.  If we know the total time the bacteria will spend in the body before the AMPs disrupt their membranes, we can work backwards to find the maximum number of replications the bacteria can undergo in that time, as well as the rate of drug production, to find the total peptide output (and therefore, total drug production) before cell death occurs.  In vitro trial and error experiments must be run in order to validate this characterization, but the problem of dosage is not beyond the grasp of modern science.
Our Conclusions
Using live bacteria as a drug delivery vector is a wild, exciting, and as a modern day scientific practice, a rather dangerous idea.  It will take many accumulating scientific advancements to reach a level of knowledge that would make this project feasible.  However, we believe utilizing the natural biospecificity of each bacterial species to create site-specific drug vectors is the future of drug delivery.  Not only that, but being able to utilize bacterial niche specificity will allow for the drugs themselves to be better designed, with an emphasis on site of absorption that may have vast implications for drug efficacy and treatment success.  The kill switch we have created is only a small mechanism in the grand design of this delivery system, but it is vitally important to the functionality of that system.  With it, we can begin to"

The construction was successfully assembled. In Figure 4, we show that we used three different primers, allowing us to cover the whole sequence without mistakes. As visible, the mismatches are only present at the extremities of each primer sequencing. The final basepair identity is 100%.
proNGF characterization and purification
Our chassis is Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, a specific strain dedicated to producing high amounts of desired proteins under a T7 promoter. Thus, we co-transformed our bacteria with BBa_K2616000 and pVDL 9.3, generously provided by Dr. Victor de Lorenzo, from Centro Nacional de Biotecnología of Madrid, bearing HlyB and HlyD (Type I secretion system) sequences, in order to get a chance to secrete proNGF out of the cell.
Bacteria were grown at a large scale (800 mL), and proNGF expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 2 hours at 37°C.
We tried to achieve His-tagged proNGF purification using a single step Ni-NTA affinity purification column. We eluted our protein using a gradient of imidazole-containing buffer and one peak was detected (fraction A6).

Every single mite has been washed in 1 mL PBS buffer and then ground up and homogenized with 0.5 ml PBS buffer. 100 µL of the resulting mixture was mixed with 100 mL ddH2O containing NaOH. The fluorescence was measured in a platereader.
Mealworms
To feed mealworms, a 1 cm³ piece of boiled carrot has been injected with 10 mM, 1 mM and 0mM fluorescine. The mealworms were kept in a big plate with flour, oat flakes, and the piece of carrot at 37 °C. At three points in time, a mealworm was removed from the plate and its gut was homogenized with 1 mL of PBS. The measurement was the same as described in the mite protocol above.
Phage Tittering
To determine the amount of plaque-forming units inside of a phage solution, the solutions were titrated. For this, a serial dilution of the phage library up to a dilution of 10-12 in SM buffer was prepared. 100 µL of each dilution was mixed with 3 mL of 0.7 % LB top agar and 100 µL of a fresh host culture (E.coli K12 ER2738). This was poured onto an IPTG/X-GAL LB Agar plate (1.5%) and incubated at 37 °C over night. On the resulting plates, the plaques with the right morphology (blue) were counted. From these, the titre can be calculated.

In vivo Phage Display
Mites
Mites were obtained freshly from bee hives and kept on bee larvae until the experiments. To feed them phages, bee larvae have been injected with a phage containing solution in excess (the volume varied, phages were injected until the solution exited the larvae’s body again).  The mites were kept on the injected bee larvae overnight at RT in darkness. Afterwards, they were isolated from the larvae and homogenized with 1000 µL of SM-buffer. The resulting solution was spun down in a micro-centrifuge for 15 min at max speed. After that, the supernatant was filtered with a 0,2 µm filter. The resulting phage containing solution was then used for determination of the phage titre and for the next round of phage display.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," infected by the phage population, which explains the constant gradual increase observed in the phage population following its drastic increase around 1.25 hours and the appearance of the bacteria population to be zero.
Discussion
The gradual increase of phage populations proves that it is possible for our system to be sustainable. However, the extinction of the bacterial population (or, at least, the appearance of extinction, as the bacterial population is not actually zero but appears to be zero because at any moment, the presence of bacteria induces immediate infection and lysis) deviates from reality. The model suggests that the introduction of a very small amount of phage into a population of bacteria will cause the bacteria population to reach an equilibrium centered around zero. We do not believe this to be the case in real ecosystems. Hence, we carried out experiments where we collected real data on the interaction between bacteria and phage populations.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Figure 6a.
Figure 6b.
In one of our experiments, we added in the same amount to phages to different concentrations of bacteria cultures. In another of our experiments, we added in different concentrations of phages to the same concentration of bacteria. We monitored the change in the optical density of the cultures over 24 hours to investigate the influence of the initial concentrations of bacteria and phages on how the populations interact. Growth of bacteria cultures in the presence of phages. Figure 6a shows that different concentrations of phages have some influences on the growth curve of bacteria. For each group of bacteria, the highest concentration of phages results in the least amount of growth. (the lowest concentration at the end of data collection.) However, in no instances did the bacterial population perish completely. Similarly, as figure 6b shows, without the presence of phages, the bacteria population grows before reaching a carrying capacity, at which point the growth curve levels off. However, even in the presence of phages, similar growth curves can be observed. There is no sign that the presence of a phage populations causes the bacteria population to become extinct, which our previous models suggest. In fact, the culture with the same concentration of bacteria as the negative control (0.01OD) but with the presence of phages had a slightly higher concentration of bacteria at the end of data collection. Clearly, bacteria and phages can and do coexist. After obtaining these results, we proceeded to improve our model in hopes of explaining the coexistence of bacteria and phages.

BioBrick Workshop - CosmoCrops & SDU-iGEM
The DTU BioBuilders team 2016 hosted a BioBrick workshop during the spring (May 6th - May 8th) for the other Danish iGEM teams; SDU-iGEM & CosmoCrops (check out their collaboration site - link).
The scope of the workshop was to introduce all three teams to the BioBrick standard, get a feel of working with it in the laboratory and get to know the other Danish iGEM teams. During the weekend we had planned different lectures that all contributed to a better understanding of what is a BioBrick and general getting to know iGEM.
We had our supervisor, Christopher Workman give a judging perspective on the iGEM competition and we discussed the gold medal requirements.  Alumni Pernille Neve Myers and Viktor Hesselberg-Thomsen from DTU BioBuilders 2015 also held a lecture about BioBricks and 3A assembly along with exciting exercises in the laboratory.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a safe and reliable end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a simplified sample preparation, a fast, easy readout and the possibility for on-site use. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
We started by finding a relevant case in which our device could make a contribution. Through a conversation with a veterinarian, we were advised to narrow our scope to mastitis, an udder infection affecting dairy cows.
Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows.
Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)
This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity.
Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)
After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics.
Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)
Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment.
Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)
For further information about these genes check out our applied design and demonstrate page .
After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the"

We tried to make constructs containing 4 MaSp gene monomers. However, we did not manage to make a longer construct. The closest result we achieved was to make a gene containing 700 bp. In the end we found that our magnetic beads had little to no streptavidin bound, alas it was not possible to use the ICA protocol for consistent results. There is however a great potential in the protocol, but one should test each individual component before attempting the ICA.
The dream of creating a silk-bacteriocin hybrid ( Top )
Figure 8 shows the result of a fusion PCR. The result indicates that we succeeded getting silk-overhangs on ThuricinS.
We wanted to create the hybrid silk of a bacteriocin fused with one or multiple monomers of MaSp1, MaSp2 with different proportions of the gene fragments at the DNA level. This was tested using recombinant DNA technology. Two methods were tested: ICA, and restriction cloning
We managed to prepare a bacteriocin with specific overhangs, matching the overhangs present on the MaSp genes. Lane no. 5 (Figure 8) shows the bacteriocin ThuricinS with DA-overhangs. The band is expected to be 217 bp. ThermoFisher scientific GeneRuler 50 kb ladder was used.
Despite various attempts we never succeeded in cutting and ligating ThuricinS together with a silk monomer. The bacteriocin with specific silk overhangs are therefore left to further research.
In conclusion, we created standard parts containing single silk gene fragments. Each silk gene fragment was ligated to its respective counterpart. A monomer was created using the ICA protocol. We added silk-overhangs to the bacteriocins allowing for incorporation into silk gene fragments.
What went wrong - what to do?
ICA troubleshooting
Due to the multiple ligation steps in ICA, individual ligation test were made in order to establish the viability of the constructs. Individual ligation tests were time consuming but a necessity since a singular failed ligation will create negative results. As the ICA protocol is heavily reliant on everything to work as planned, alternative methods were tried. In addition, it must be noted that the small overhangs are seldom fit to ligate at room temperature. Likewise, redesigning the gene towards a larger overhang, might create easier ligations. Furthermore during ligation, constant turbation of the fluids must be applied, as the beads subside in the bottom"
Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Project#Bioabsorbent#MBPconstruction_-_-_TEXT.html,". The red line indicates the SSG linker, and the blue and green lines indicate the loop after the dimerization loop and the region after the loop, respectively. Orange dots indicate cysteines involved in Hg(II) binding[6]. (C) Predicted structure of resulted metal binding peptide. Mercury ions are indicated as black balls in metal binding pockets.
Earlier work provides us a deeper insight into the metal recognition mechanism of MerR family. Kathryn et al. constructed a hybrid regulatory protein containing the DNA binding domain of MerR and the Metal binding domain of ZntR, which showed an altered specificity to MerR’s promoter but responding to zinc[3], which suggested that the DNA binding domain and metal binding domain of MerR family function modularly to some extent. Since our bioabsorbent needs high metal binding affinity and selectivity, we then took a closer look at the metal binding mechanism and the structure of the C-terminal binding domain.
MerR family TFs share a high similarity at the C-terminal metal binding domain (Fig. 3), which indicates a similar metal recognition mechanism and metal-protein complex structure. The key factor of the remarkable selectivity and sensitivity seems to be the preorganization of geometries suited for specific metal ions through folding of the metal-binding domains in these proteins [7]. To be specific, previous mutagenesis study shows that MerR dimer binds one Hg(II) ion in a bridge fashion between the two monomers[8], and Hg (II) adopts a three-coordinate Hg-(S-Cys)3-binding mode by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy[9], though there is no crystal structure available. As is known, single α-helix has a high tendency to be oligomerized. The outer electron configuration of Hg (II) is 5d106s0, and it tends to form a complex, especially with sulfur. All these evidences above indicate that the C-terminal metal binding domain can act as a mercury accumulator without the help of the N-terminal DNA binding domain. Luckily, Qiandong Zeng et al. constructed an N-terminal deletion mutant (contain only residue 80-120) that can form a stable dimer and retain high affinity for Hg (II) [2]. This work reinforces the idea of tandeming two metal binding domains together to make a high performance and less energy consuming metal binding peptide.

Future Directions
With limited facilities such as in availability of high speed microcentrifuge, UV and fluorescence spectrophotometers, incubators with shakers, we were able to adapt several standard protocols – written in Notebook section – to achieve certains goals in synthetic biology. We have been able to construct 2 new parts namely, crr gene encoding IIA(Glc) from E. coli alone (BBa_K1508002), and crr gene with double terminator (BBa_K1508003), which we have been deposited in iGEM Registry. Both plasmids have been sequenced for confirmation.
In term of our projects goal on measuring honey glucose concentration, we already succeeded in developing protocols of measurements using (1) glucose meter, and (2) mRFP reporter gene expression based on the phenomenon of catabolite repression. The second protocol – called ECONEY – was a combination of innovative color intensity measurement with mobile phone, programming has advantage of easy use, and attractive appearance. Both protocols are very affordable for honey farmers in Sumbawa Island who still out of access for conventional method such as glucose refractometer. Therefore, our human practice has big success in introducing the power of synthetic biology to our people who were never exposed to knowledge in biotechnology although already used several products such as glucose meter and recombinant insulin which are available in drug stores.
In the future, we will use these experiences to continue constructing BBa_J04450 + our original constructs (containing either crr or cyaA) and see whether they will really influence the catabolite repression sensitivity"

Second attempt at colony PCR on chip library
It looks like none of the colonies contain an insert. In order to try and figure out what went wrong, we ran the uncut CB bottom plasmid, cut plasmid, and cut and phosphatased plasmid on a 1% e-gel.
Attempt to compare uncut, cut, and phosphatased plasmids
The gel looked extremely strange, and the ladder was not present. We tried it again, this time running uncut plasmid, new phosphatased plasmid, and old phosphatased plasmid.
Comparison of uncut plasmid, new cut and phosphotased, old cut and phosphotased
The gel isn't perferct, but it looks like there was indeed uncut plasmid present after digestion in the sample used for ligation.
Digestion of CB bottom
We decided to cut more CB bottom, and try a second ligation, only using a 5 to 1 backbone to insert ratio for the ligation. We also decided to do a double digestion with both Bsa1 and Xba1 to minimize the amount of whole plasmid left over. We used the following recipe:
4000 ng DNA (16.8 ul)
8 ul Bsa1 (40 units)
2 ul Xba1 (40 units)
10 ul 10x buffer
1 ul bsa
62.2 ul water
We let the reaction run for 1 hour at 37* and then heat inactivated the enzyme at 65* for 20 minutes. We then performed a PCR clean up on the product, eluting in 50 ul of EB and had a yield of 45.4 ng/ul. We save 2.5 ul to use as a control in the transformation.

Selection plates
We have shown that selection works in liquid media, but we would like to also be able to use plates with different 3-AT concentrations, since that would make it easier to pick individual colonies that grow successfully.  To check sensitivity, we plated 1uL of saturated culture of cells transformed with either all Zif268 spec, all negative control plasmids, or a mixture (10^-1 Zif, 10^-2...10^-6) on 3mM NM+3-AT plates.
Did not see successful growth, though this may be because plates were old. An attempt with 100"

By fusing <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> (using Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard) we could improve the BPA degradation of E. coli even further so that 120 mg L-1 BPA can be degraded in 21 - 24 h. This data is shown in the following figure:
Figure 5: BPA degradation by E. coli KRX carrying genes for BisdA and BisdB (only bisdA (black), polycistronic bisdAB (red) and fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB (green)) behind the medium strong constitutive promoter <partinfo>J23110</partinfo> with RBS <partinfo>B0034</partinfo>. Cultivations were carried out at 30 °C in LB + Amp + BPA medium for 24 h and 36 h, respectively, with automatic sampling every three hours in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. At least three biological replicates were analysed (three for bisdA alone, seven for bisdAB polycistronic and five for the fusion protein).
Additionally, we carried out these cultivations at different temperatures and BPA concentrations, but the chosen conditions (30 °C and 120 mg L-1 BPA) seemed to be the best. Higher BPA concentrations had an effect on the growth of E. coli and higher temperature led to a worse BPA degradation (probably due to misfolding of the enzymes). Lower temperature also led to less BPA degradation (probably due to slower growth, expression and reaction rate at lower temperatures). The data dealing with the effect of the temperature on the BPA degradation is shown in Figure 6.

OVERVIEW
As our project primarily involves the use of anti-microbial peptides, we designed and directed our human practices towards creating awareness about this niche topic apart from synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Talking about synthetic biology and AMPs to over 500 people during the Biofair and over 300 members from the scientific community from across the country during a national conference helped    us accomplish a part of what we had wished to do. In addition to this, we    conducted a hands-on workshop for school students from our city and it was well    received as well; the students thoroughly enjoyed it. To know more about each of these,    read below.

SCIENCE  WORKSHOP
As an integral part of Human Practices, we conducted a workshop on the 26th of July, 2017. We invited about 80 students from four different schools to participate in this workshop. This day-long workshop started with a small introduction on concepts of Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering which was followed by a presentation describing our project, why we chose to work on the track 'Food' and how we plan on applying it practically by a few of our team members.
In an attempt to make it interactive, we further organized a 'HANDS-ON' training workshop for the students. This included simple experiments like DNA extraction, Blood Typing, Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Food Aduletration tests.
DNA EXTRACTION
The first step in any rDNA technology experiment is DNA extraction. To demonstrate the importance of this step, we extracted DNA from fruits such as strawberries and papaya using shampoo.
AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
AGE is an important step in cloning experiments where DNA fragments are separated based on size after restriction. Students were given training in pipette handling and also the hands on experience of loading the sample into wells.
BLOOD TYPING
The aim of conducting this experiment was to demonstrate the agglutination reaction that takes place (principle behind blood typing )through Ag-Ab interaction (Haemolysis).  Native Latarcin possesses haemolytic activity. Our peptide of interest, a mutant of this native form has very low haemolytic activity.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," of money to get these patents probably as offensive / defensive ends instead of spending it into pure R&D. Consequently patents sometimes paradoxically discourage innovation.
Contrary to the previous case, some patents may protect wide discoveries (also known as foundational patents). For instance, the patent granted to Myriad genetics covered the whole gene functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and all applications that could follow on possible ways to diagnose and cure breast cancer. This kind of patent stood against innovation, preventing any creative use of those genes by any other actor than Myriad Genetics, or leading to any other use linked to this DNA sequence (possibly there would have been many, considering the complexity of biological regulations).
As a consequence, the patent system may allow the formation of major entry barriers on some industrial domains. It is notably the case in some markets of the pharmaceutical industry in which new companies cannot easily enter anymore because they would need to buy the licences of many expensive patents from the incumbent firms.
Last but not least, the philosophical questions raised in the last two centuries concerning patents are to be considered. As this is not a philosophical essay, we will content ourselves with a brief resume. According to the American economist Thorstein Veblen (1908), a patent is illegitimate as it privatizes a collective work any invention crucially depends on the previous ones : how would a trolley have been invented if the wheel had not been invented before ?. Veblen emphasizes this idea when he argues that:
The initiative and technological enterprise of individuals, such, e.g., as shown in inventions and discoveries of more and better ways and means, proceeds on and enlarges the accumulated wisdom of the past. Individual initiative has no chance except on the ground afforded by the common stock, and the achievements of such initiative are of no effect except as accretions to the common stock. And the invention or discovery so achieved always embodies so much of what is already given that the creative contribution of the inventor or discoverer is trivial by comparison. (1908)
This thinking still applies nowadays on different themes. So the question remains : why should a sole actor gather all the economic benefits from this collective process?
Consequently, in some cases, having an economic alternative to the patent system may actually be a good thing.In this perspective the leading economists Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz assert that :
The patent system is only one part of a society's innovation system, through which the production of knowledge is financed, incentivized and organized. Too much attention has been focused on IPR (intellectual property rights), and too little on alternatives, e.g. open source systems, publicly"

There are a lot of thing for newbies to learn when joining an unknown field. We appreciated NTCU_Formosa to offer us so many helps. From the moment we tried to found our team, we received experiments training, online lecture such as modeling and gene design from NTCU_Formosa. Without those help, we wouldn’t have operated so smoothly and wouldn’t have become what we are now!

Assumptions:
There is no delay in infection. (All infections are instantaneous.)
All infections are successful (infected bacteria subsequently die of infection)
New bacteria are introduced from the external environment at a constant rate. This is a reasonable assumption because bacteria concentration in the water that enters our multi-cistern system should be consistent.
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Intrinsic Growth Rate of Bacteria (r): aka. Intrinsic rate of natural increase or the Malthusian parameter. This rate describes the maximum theoretical rate of increase of a population per individual. Using this parameter to account for bacteria population growth instead of the traditional doubling time allows us to investigate the interactions between phages and bacteria in continuous time.
2. Influx of Bacteria: An increase in bacteria population caused by the entry of external bacteria into the system.
3. Natural Death Rate of Bacteria: Bacteria death caused by factors other than infection.
4. Natural Death Rate of Phages: Phages that become unable to infect more bacteria.
5. Contact factor (c): This parameter describes how efficiently a given phage population can infect a given bacterial population. Although the computation of c is very complex and involves many factors as described above (such as the time during a bacteria lifecycle when inoculation begins), the use of empirical evidence of the value of c from past researches simplifies this process without compromising the accuracy of our model.
6. the number of phages produced per infected bacteria.

Figure 5: Bacteria-phage dynamic in continuous time. The initial bacteria population reproduces and gradually increases. Once the bacteria population reaches the threshold (the peak observed) for mass action, the high abundance of susceptible bacteria makes the probability of phage infection increase greatly, at which time (about 1.25 hours after inoculation as shown in figure 5b) the phage population increase drastically and overwhelms the bacterial population. However, the bacteria population is never zero at any given moment due to the constant influx and the intrinsic rate of natural increase. Any presence of bacteria, though, results in the bacteria being immediately infected by the phage population, which explains the constant gradual increase observed in the phage population following its drastic increase around 1.25 hours and"

Elute the protein successively with 5 ml of buffers that contain different concentrations of imidazole (e.g. binding buffer with 40, 60, 100, 300 and 500 mM imidazole) and collect flow-through in 1 ml fractions.
For centrifugal ultrafiltration use Vivaspin 15 concentrators ( Sartorius ) with a 10000 molecular weight cut-off PES membrane. Repeat the procedure three times by adding DNA ligase buffer (4 °C) for buffer exchange (remove of imidazole).
Check each purification step and especially the purity of the protein in the final condition by SDS-PAGE analysis .
Determine the protein concentration with a Bradford Protein Assay .
For long-time storage keep the protein at -20 °C.
Deadenylation
The majority of purified DNA ligase from E. coli KRX is usually in the adenylated form. But only the apoenzyme is really useful for the NAD+ bioassay so that the AMP moiety has to be removed.
Mix the purified DNA ligase with deadenylation buffer and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.
Use Vivaspin 15 concentrators ( Sartorius ) with a 10000 molecular weight cut-off PES membrane for buffer exchange at 4 °C. Repeat the procedure at least three times by adding DNA ligase buffer (remove of NMN and formed NAD+).

Aachen,2015,Team:Aachen#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to an end, we completed it by having a concluding skype call with the people who accompanied us at the start, the members of the iGEM Team Darmstadt.
After our last meeting, the iGEM Team Darmstadt had lead a panel discussion about the ""Risks and chances of community labs"" (please visit their wiki for further information). They shared their results and we shared our experiences in outlining how we helped Community Labs and how Community Labs helped us. We then came to a joint conclusion.
Concluding discussion with iGEM Team Darmstadt
While they focussed on legal aspects, especially the detailed German laws concerning the creation of a lab at home, we layed our focus on infrastructural, educational and social aspects. The iGEM Team Darmstadt found out that the very strict laws in Germany make the establishment of a biohackerspace rather difficult. This matches the disparity in governmental support for the different Community Labs we have met. While the German Technik Garage is subjected to a lot of rules and restrictions, the Dutch Waag Society is even promoted by the government to teach about and enable DIY Biology at home.
Having a realistic risk assessment, most of the public concerns can be resolved easily. Especially the putative threat of bioterrorism is an emotional fear rather than a rational one. On the contrary, a spreading of Community Labs promotes “open science” and possesses an inherent beneficial potential. One of the great benefits would be to give the people the chance to make chemical and biological tests of water quality, food, medicine etc. This would largely increase the consumer protection. In addition, Community Labs are often very ambitious in their efforts to educate the public. They also contribute to society on other levels e.g. driving forward exeptional aspects as BioArt.
To conclude, we are convinced, that a further growing European Community Lab scene will have benefits for society and science. However, to promote the establishments of more Community Labs in Europe, we need to review the strict restrictions and increase connectivity through cross-linking networks like Medlife.

Hello, Stefan here. Second Lifer extraordinaire and now official iGEM ethicist. You might be wondering what’s been going on in our Ethics department. Well, you’re in luck, because I’m about to tell you! Mandy, Emily, Fahd and I have been keeping busy by reading a few papers on synthetic biology. These include papers about the economics of synthetic biology, bioterrorism, and general ethical issues regarding the field. The ideas expressed in these papers will be used to elucidate both sides of ethical debates surrounding our project and to present evidence for our statements. For our project, the issues that we will look at will be: Environmental, Ethical, Economical, Legal, and Societal (E3LS). We"

Vincent Libis
6th year pharmacy student and M2 AIV student.
I started learning pharmacy at Strasbourg University to become a researcher and as I was specializing in therapeutic innovation based on biotechnology I heard about synthetic biology. I became more and more convinced that this young field had a huge potential for fighting human diseases and I eventually came to Paris to study it intensively through internships in laboratories and through the AIV master. By doing iGEM I hope to have the chance to show creativity in applying the concepts I have learnt so far and to take advantage of the exciting working context of a truly interdisciplinary and multinational team.
Anne Löchner
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I am biologist from Germany and I am now in the AIV Master. Since I heard the first time of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, I wanted to participate in this challenging competition. I think the iGEM Team at the CRI is a great group as it has lots of potential as we are a group of students from many different backgrounds and nationalities. As Synthetic Biology is aswell very interdisciplinary I am looking forward to work on an exciting project with the team and learn more about science and the emerging field of Synthetic Biology.
Sarah Zahra
2nd year Biomedical Engineering Master - Paris Descartes & Paris Tech Institute.
I have a bachelor in biomedical sciences and I like to explore the interface between different disciplines, and that is why I enrolled in the master. I also got the chance to follow synthetic and computational biology in the AIV track at the CRI, which made me discover what an amazing field synthetic biology is! One of my goals is to try to adress the bottleneck of therapies through synthetic biology tools. But I am also interested in exploring new perspectives that sythetic biology allowed us to open. I am looking forward for the iGEM teamwork, because I am sure we are going to have a very exciting experiment, on both the scientific and the human level!
Yonatan Zegman
2nd year AIV Master student at Université Paris Descartes.
I come from sunny Tel Aviv, Israel. I Have a B.Sc in Biotechnology. I spent my first year of master learning the fields of system's biology and synthetic biology.

After researching the torrefaction of solid human waste process, we realised that the VCD estimation for the process is not reliable due to different resource requirements, feedstock size, and temperature. A diagram (Figure 1)  of the full-scale apparatus was created with all the materials, dimensions, and parameters. Equipment set-up, materials, and energy inputs were estimated based on experimental setup found in the literature (A. Serio, E. Cosgrove & A. Wojtowicz, 2016). The suggested equipment set-up assumes batch processing once in 3 days, mild pyrolysis 45 minutes in duration, the maximum temperature of the reaction vessel of 280 degrees Celsius, and 2.5kW power supply. The above-stated conditions should assure complete recovery of moisture (A. Serio, E. Cosgrove & A. Wojtowicz, 2016), some additional water production (pyrolytic water), a modest reduction of the dry solid mass, and the evaporation of all the required VFA.

Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in the UK is 81, [22] however for those who have NSCLC, and thus are likely to have smoked, life expectancy is at least 10 years lower. [23] The quality of life score is assumed to be 1, i.e when someone is cured of NSCLC, the years of life gained are assumed to be in perfect health or any other factors that reduced their quality of life were not considered to be due to NSCLC. Thus QALYs gained = 70 - current age. If an individual is over 66, QALYs gained are taken to be 5, as the statistics used were for 5 year survival.
Cost per QALY was calculated by dividing expected cost by expected QALYs. If this is less than £30000, screening for the next 6 years is cost effective for that patient.
When building this model we tried to use reasonable estimates to ensure we do not overestimate the cost effectiveness of our test.

who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the last 15 years
who have at least a 30 pack-year history of smoking
We entered the details for someone at the lowest thresholds: someone aged 55, quit smoking 15 years ago, has a 30 pack-year history of smoking along with the average American’s build: male, white, no history of cancer or any lung diseases, college educated and a BMI of 27. [25] They would cost £6900 per QALY to be screened, making our tool extremely cost effective by the NICE £20,000 per QALY target. It would therefore be cost effective, by our analysis, to screen people with our system with even lower risks of developing NSCLC. This is mainly due to the low cost of our test and significantly improved surival rates when NSCLC is diagnosed in earlier stages.
The one significant assumption we may have over-estimated is sensitivity, as it is unlikely to be 100% in reality. However, for the same individual it would remain cost effective to screen even if sensitivity were reduced to 34% (£19,800 per QALY). This would never be ethically acceptable, given the number of cases of cancer you"

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"How do we create a system that is self-regulating and at the same time avoid the risks discussed earlier?
To prevent one organism from outcompeting the other, there has to be some sort of communication between them. Several approaches to this has been attempted in the past. A quorum sensing (QS) system is one alternative that has proven capable of maintaining population equilibrium within a system comprised of different strains of the same species [6,7]. However, QS within the same species might be conceivable, but achieving a functioning QS system between organisms of different species that originate from completely different environments is a challenge to say the least.
Another alternative is the exchange of nutritional metabolites, e.g. amino acids. This approach has been shown to provide an additional fitness benefit due to the division of metabolic labour [8]. It has also been shown to be capable of purging cheaters from the system, i.e. cheaters do not seem to be able to outcompete the cooperating population [9]. Furthermore, in a scenario where the industrial strain escapes, an auxotrophic bacterium will have a significant fitness disadvantage without its partner and will therefore pose a very small threat to the wild flora and fauna.
These arguments lead us to construct our microbial consortia based on metabolite dependence rather than a quorum sensing mechanism. This solution has two main advantages. Firstly, amino acids are universal and most organisms on earth share the same set. Modularity becomes easier to achieve compared to a QS system, in which entire new synthesis pathways may need to be implemented for the QS molecules. Secondly, with respect to safety, a metabolic dependence based on auxotrophy of amino acids prevent the unwanted spread of the organism since it cannot survive without its partner organism providing it. Furthermore, in 2015 the Amsterdam iGEM team achieved a proof of concept in which they created a symbiotic culture between the cyanobacterium Synechocystis and Escherichia coli based on auxotrophy. This provided great inspiration in how to achieve our production system.
The system will be based on a strain of Synechocystis providing a carbon source in the form of acetate to the production organism.  In return, it would provide the cyanobacterium with a required amino acid.
Fig 2. a schematic view of the system and the symbiotic relationship between the carbon-converting cyanobacteria and the production organism.
To expand the idea further and to make the system more universal, a level of modularity was desired, therefore the production organism should be interchangeable. Different species of microorganisms relevant to the field of industrial bi"
Mexico-UNAM-IPN,2008,Team:Mexico-UNAM-IPN#Turing Patterns#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," that it’s feasible to implement.  Basically we would need to create a devise that would differentiate bacteria relying on metabolic signals such as the concentration of a nutrient or a metabolite that exist in the media. Also the differentiation should induce cells to change the metabolism of the nutrient.
Right now I have no concrete idea over how to make the construct. I’ll post ideas soon and I’ll appreciate any help.
Federico C 01 July 2008 (EDT) A couple weeks ago, while talking with Elias about cell free systems , I realized that the communication problem could be solved if all the represors would be able to freely move thorough the system. I think that we could get Turing patterns just by expressing the Repressilator in a cell free system in an analogous way to the genetarion of patterns by the Belousov-Zhabotinsky_reaction .
I strongly support this option as it will be easy to implement and simulate and we already know that it works, all our work will then be focused in characterizing the inverters that compose the repressilator, something that the Juges will highly value .
Problem #2
Federico C 27 may 2008 (EDT)
Does it work? While talking with Juan Arias he expressed his concerns about the functionality of the devise and suggested analyzing and using parts and devises that other teams have used. Here I invite everyone (not only team members but also the OWW community) to post links to papers and works that could be useful.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry"

ÄKTA Pure 25 Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) was used for all chromatography steps. Fractions in 96 wells plate were pooled at the center 90% target peak at A673 containing PSII and concentrated using a 100 kD MWCO Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Inc.). Samples were concentrated to 2-3 mg mL-1 using Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C.
Oxygen Evolution and Free Electron Generation Test:
Throughout the process of purifying PSII, oxygen evolution assays were conducted in order to ensure oxygen was being evolved by the cyanobacteria from the start to the end of the purification. More importantly, this is also an indirect measurement of free electron generation. Assays were conducted using a Hansatech oxygen electrode and a 2800 µmol Hansatech LED1 red light. The sample chamber contained the buffer (pH 6.5), 300uM DCBQ, 1mM FeCy and the sample at a chlorophyll concentration of 10-20ug, similar to literature sample components1. DCBQ and FeCY serves as an electron acceptors and how the oxygen is measured is through the detection of oxygen levels through the electrode seated in the resin2. Oxygen levels are then plotted both a minute prior and after illumination of the light source, then quantified as the rates of the oxygen activity.
Looking at one node of this toolkit, to aid in the development of greener energy solutions, we strive to incorporate photosystem II from cyanobacteria as the battery of the toolkit.
However, how will we incorporate the protein similar to a battery that runs electrons through cathode to anode?
To tackle this, we have conducted preliminary compatibility tests of connecting the protein via the Quinone channel. This shows promise as it can be incorporated in a circuit using menaquinone or DCBQ as these two substrates have shown to allow the protein to evolve the highest oxygen rates when compared to other quinone solutions.  However, in order to have an energy source for the circuit, the protein needs to be stabilized which will be discussed in the proteoliposome section.

Introduction
Due to the nature of our project, having several measures in place to ensure containment and biosafety is very important. We strongly felt that we should not experiment with introducing the invasion-listeriolysin devices into bacterial hosts until we had developed well characterised and effective safety checks. We focused on two key control measures: the Cre-lox recombination system which would delete genes encoding invasive proteins after entry into a cell, and a toxin-antitoxin system to contain bacteria to specific inducing agar plates and prevent horizontal gene transfer.
The Cre-Lox System [1]
The Cre-lox system is an efficient method for imparting deletions, insertions and translocations at specific sites on a genome. These sites are described by a Lox sequence which consists of a 13bp recognition region followed by an 8bp spacer and then closed by another 13bp recognition sequence. Cre recombinase will recognise two of these sites and effect a recombination event between them. The outcome is dependent on the sequence orientation. This can be seen in the diagram below.
Why?
Once our endosymbiont is inside the host there is no longer a need for it to possess any potential for invasion. To remove the hazardous genes we set up a Cre-Lox system that would not only delete the invasive genes, but also the Cre-lox system itself. This arrangement can be seen in the pHlow plasmid. This is not just a safety mechanism. By removing all of the material it significantly decreases the energetic burden placed on the host cell and should therefore increase the endosymbionts chance of survival.
Future Work
In theory, our Cre-Lox system should remove itself given a long enough period of time. We designed an experiment to test this self-fluxing system to investigate how long it would take. The part we designed can be seen below. A fairly standard ONPG/ONP assay could then be used to measure the deletion time. Due to time restraints  we were unfortunately unable to build the part and conduct the assay.

Sample preparation
The dried sheets were extracted for ca. 20 min with 100 μl solution 1. Then the polypropylen microtiter plates were centrifuged for ca. 2 minutes at 4000 rpm. Supernatant was vaporized at 55°C for 30 minutes at the blowing station until all liquid residues were removed. Subsequently the plate was warmed up for 1 minute at a cabinet dryer (65°C).
After drying 60 μl of solution 2 were added and the mircotiter plate tightly closed with micromates. The plate was shaken gently and heated up again for ca. 15 minutes at the cabinet dryer (65°C). Micromates were drawn off and supernatant vaporated on heating plates (55°C surface temperature) with a constant air stream. Again no liquid residues should be remaining. Samples were heated up for 1 minute in the cabinet dryer (65°C).
Finally 100 μl solution 3 were added (it is possible to dilute the sample up to factor 3 with solution 3). To avoid evaporation losses, the microtiter plate was covered with aluminium foil.
SDS-PAGE
1 ml culture was pipetted into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. This was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl loading buffer. The samples were boiled with closed lids at 98°C for at least 10 minutes under the hood, after which they were let cool down and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for another 10 minutes. 25µl were loaded in a 3-8% Tris-Acetate Gradient Gel from Invitrogen, 10 µl NOVEX Pre-Stained Standard was used and PAGE was let run for 1 hour at 180 V with Tris-Acetate running buffer from Invitrogen. The aforementioned loading buffer is composed of 800 µl ddH20, 250 µl 0.5M Tris-HCl (pH = ~7.3), 400 µl Glycerol (50%), 400 µl SDS (10%), 100µl β-Mercaptoethanol (99%) and bromophenol-blue to obtain 2ml of loading buffer.

Expression of KillerRed in the cytoplasm of different organelles in eukaryotic cells hasn’t had any effect: expression in the cytoplasm of the nucleus didn’t successfully kill the cells. Since it is most probable that bacteria are more resistant to oxidative damage than eukaryotes, this would mean that a specific target protein needs to be chosen in E. coli so as to significantly damage the cell and kill it when KillerRed produced ROS. Experiments As the first experiment didn’t yield any quantitative information, we need to develop a rigorous protocol in order to substract background noise from fluorescence measurements more precisely, as well as prove that only the bacteria that have been transformed with the correct plasmid, and induced with arabinose, are actually fluorescing. We have a microplate reader at our disposal that can perform repeated measures at regular intervals as well as injections of liquid at designated times. We can use it to keep the culture warm, shaked and to induce production of GFP with arabinose at a certain time. The experiment consisted in preparing a microplate with different solutions containing a combination of the following: Pbad-GFP transfected cells or Wild-type cells in Luria-Bertani Miller growth medium Arabinose at different concentrations Kanamycin as an antibiotic to select for Pbad-GFP transfected cells
Week 5 (27-31)
Monday
PBAD promoter characterization: we decided to try and characterize the behaviour of PBAD according to the concentration of arabinose in the media. It is more rigorous than the first PBAD experiment we did.
We used E. coli BW25113 transformed with PBAD-GFP (Kanamycin resistance in the plasmid), and untransformed BW25113 as control. Cultures were saturated over the weekedn before the experiment.
We used decreasing concentrations of arabinose ranging from 0.1% to 0.00016% with 5X dilutions.
Results show fluorescence starts rising after 3 hours of incubation on microplates.
Tuesday
Wednesday
In order to obtain better results in terms of fluorescence and in terms of bacterial growth control, we choose to use M9 for a second experiment to characterize PBAD.
M9 is supplemented in glucose. We use E. coli BW25113 which is a prototroph.
The protocol used is available on the internet. The experiment failed for multiple reasons including lack of controls, lack of time to do every step every 30 minutes.

This system is based on the penetration of our engineered E.coli under the mucosa, and production of pexiganan under the control of the AND GATE system. After the production of pexiganan under the mucose, if this peptide is toxic for mammalian cells, this cannot be used for H.pylori eradication in the gastric mucosa. Therefore, toxicity level of pexiganan for mammalian cells must be higher than the requirement of H.pylori eradication. The potential toxicity of pexiganan has been investigated systematically by measuring the peptide’s hemolytic activity in human red blood cells in other studies. The reports suggested that at least 250 μg/mL is necessary to induce 100% hemolysis. (Navon, V; Feder, R et al. 2002 and Eren,T; Som, A et al. 2008) Two phase III clinical trials have reported that no adverse side effects have been found for pexiganan.

DAMP
(A Simple and Low-Cost Platform Technology forProducing Pexiganan Antimicrobial Peptide in E. Coli,Chun-Xia Zhao, Mirjana Dimitrijev Dwyer, Alice Lei Yu, Yang Wu, Sheng Fang, Anton P.J. Middelberg)
DAMP,  a four-helix bundle protein connected to Pexiganan, used to ensure pexiganan’s intracellular antimicrobial activity was prevented successfully. A design, as showed above, was used to attach DAMP to Pexiganan with a cleavage site. That cleavage site makes it possible to release Pexiganan in an exact concentration. In addition, DAMP provides high levels of solubles in recombinant bacteria. It also forms a four helix bundle structure that  has thermo stability and remains soluble at high salt levels. Finally, pexiganan embeds into DAMP and this provides limitted electrostatic of pex. It prevents damage to the cell membrane in the E. coli.
TEV Protease
As a protease needed to cut the cleavage site between DAMP and Pexiganan, TEV protease is chosen to serve this purpose. TEV protease is the common name for the"

Figure 8: Team member Christoph working with the Zeiss LSM780 doing Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy to find out if it is possible to enclose mRFP or fluorescein inside our mutant ferritin cage after disassembling and reassembling the ferritin cage using different pH changes.
Our TEM images (Figure 7) showed that many impurities are mixed into our eluate and we therefore hypothesize that those impurities influence the speed of our fluorophores significantly resulting in the highly different speeds observed by our measurements.
Human Ferritin engineering
To engineer ferritin to build silver and gold nanoparticles, we changed certain amino acids residues in the human ferritin. The results can be found on our Part Improvement page.
Figure 9: Multiple human ferritin subunits with the introduced amino acid changes marked in red. The amino acid modifications change the outer and inner surface of the ferritin cage allowing for the storage of gold and silver ions primarily on the inside.

This protein, expressed in Stylophora pistillata, was evolving independently from the rest of coral chromoproteins. The protein has a maximum absorption of 560 nm. This characteristic confers a blue shift by at least 14 nanometers in comparison to other known coral chromoproteins, inducing the production of pink color rather than purple appearance. This version is codon optimized for the expression in E.coli K12.
When the system is in total darkness both spisPink (pink color protein) and amilGFP (yellow color protein) are expressed and a third color should be form by it´s co expression.
Assembly
For the assembly, we are working with two different constructs, both in pSB1C3, with differentiated functions. The plasmids are show below.
Figure N° 1. pSB1C3 with construct for constitutive expression for PCB (Ho1 and pcyA), and regulated expression of spisPink attached upstream to FixK2 promoter.

Devices
Several devices were designed and built, as shown in the next image.
Figure N° 5. Color-Coliroid. The figure above show how the system works.
Photoreceptors
YF1 and Cph8 are two different photoreceptors, chimeric proteins These Are That Have the Ability to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate Their respective transcription factors. For Their constant expression inside the cell.
For this, first the coding sequences joined a sequence RBS (BBa_J61100), and then were joined together, in addition to which was added a terminator (BBa_B0030) at the 3 'end and a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) upstream, in the 5 '
Transcription factors
YF1 and Cph8 are responsible for regulating the activity of two different promoters, by phosphorylation of two transcription factors. Thus, a device capable of producing FixJ transcription factor associated with YF1 and FixK2 was designed. Also, ompR is a transcription factor associated with cph8, however, since endogenous ompR use, the device was assembled to produce PCB (HO1 and pcyA), which helps the assembly of this transcription factor.

Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM) helped us with our assignment ‘Think Before Doing’ by having discussion sessions with us about how to fill in this assignment.
Zoë Robaey helped us with our application scenario, by having brainstorm sessions via Skype and via the meeting at SYNENERGENE.
Pim de Vink is a PhD student at our university in the group of dr. Lech Milroy and prof. Luc Brunsveld working on the interface between supramolecular chemistry and chemical biology. He helped us with our application scenario by brainstorming about MMPs.
We also talked to stakeholders for our Human Practices, more information about these talks can be found here.
Modeling
The first contact for modeling was with René Verhoef BSc, who was the modeling captain of TU Eindhoven 2016 and they got nominated for the best model. He gave us some code that wasn’t useful for them, and later on, it appeared that it also wasn’t useful for us.
Dr.ir. Tom de Greef is one of our advisors and sent us many papers that described the modeling of similar systems. He was the one that advised us to use NFsim and gave us the contact information of Tim Paffen MsC, a PhD student who has used NFsim himself and will receive his degree while we are in Boston.
Furthermore, we were very glad with the feedback we received from Dr. ir. Bart Markvoort about our 2D simulation and how he helped us to run NFsim on windows. Bart Markvoort also suggested to investigate more about the Gillespie algorithm (this was before we knew about NFsim) and therefore we contacted Dr. ir. Huub ten Eikelder, and he told us that Gillespie wasn’t the way to go.

Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot inhibition effect on Dsz enzymes. HBP strongly inhibits the activity of enzyme DszA DszB and DszC; HBPS has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC, but only in the early stages in the BDS. The reason is that, when the concentration of HBP increases, the inhibition of HBP will become the major one. And some researchers have found that enzyme DszC is inhibited by HBP and HBPS noncompetitively, and the substrate DBT also has certain inhibition effect on enzyme DszC. Due to the limited high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detector resolution, the mechanisms of how the effects are brought by HBP to DszA, DszB are still unable to be determined.
(1) The determination of kinetic parameters:
2.2 Determination of related parameters
1).The catalytic pathway of DszA，DszB，DszD can be described as enzymatic reaction based on traditional Michaelis kinetic theory. The kinetic data can be fitted by Michaelis equation:
In the equation, v is the catalytic rate of enzymes, kcat is conversion number, [E0] is the concentration of enzymes, [S] is the concentration of substrates, Km is Michaelis constant, and Vmax is the maximum catalytic rate of enzymes.
2)Because DszC is inhibited by substrate DBTs, the Michaellis equation is no longer fit. We could only use substrate inhibition equantion to fit the gained data:
In the equation, KSI is substrate inhibition constant.
Using the fitting statistics of MATLAB, we obtain many kinetic parameters of different Dsz-enzymes.

The degree of inhibition can be reflected by the dosage-reaction; the dosage-reaction describes the influence brought by concentration variations of inhibitor to the activity of enzymes:
In the expression, vi is the catalytic rate of enzyme when concentration of inhibitor is [I], and v0 is that without enzymes，IC50 is the inhibitor’s concentration which makes the enzyme’s activity reduce to 50%, comparing to the original one.
