Weblink to the article Münchner Unis wollen Organe drucken Studenten der beiden Münchner Universitäten TU und LMU haben einen renommierten Wettbewerb gewonnen. Am MIT in Cambridge, MA wurden sie für den 3D-Druck von lebendigem Gewebe ausgezeichnet.
Die Studierenden gewannen einen ersten Preis beim iGEM-Wettbewerb (international Genetically Engineered Machine), einer Art Weltmeisterschaft der synthetischen Biologie. Für den Druck von räumlichem Strukturen mit lebendigem Material bauten sie einen handelsüblichen 3D-Printer um: Statt mit flüssigem Plastik druckten sie mit Zellen.
Meniskus aus dem Drucker
Bereits üblich ist es, mit nicht lebendem biologischen Material zu drucken, beispielsweise mit Knorpel. Auch Gewebe wird schon seit geraumer Zeit gezüchtet und dreidimensional in Form gebracht. Allerdings wird dabei erst ein Gerüst aus so genannten Hydrogelen gebaut, was sehr aufwändig ist. Und erst danach wird dieses Gerüst mit lebendigen Zellen besiedelt.
Einsatz in der Transplantationsmedizin
Die Entwicklung der Münchner Studenten stellt demgegenüber ein deutlich vereinfachtes und kostengünstigeres Verfahren dar. Das große Ziel ist dabei letztendlich, menschliche Organe für die Transplantationsmedizin künstlich herzustellen.

Choosing Target Substrates and PCR Primers
Possible target substrate:
Single Colonies
Bacteria Solution
Plasmid
DNA Fragments
Design PCR Primers according to the purpose of the experiment
The choice of the reaction system is dictated by the specific experiment
Taq System: to primarily validate the DNA sequence.
KOD System: to amplificate long DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Golden Mix System: for rapid amplification of DNA fragments in high fidelity.
Set up the reaction system according to the protocol of the product you use
If the target substrate is single colony, use pipette to pick up a minute quantity of bacteria. Inoculate the bacteria onto a plate for further use. Then pipet up and down for several times in the solution.
If the target substrate is liquid, add proper quantity of substrate according to the protocol of specific reaction system.
Choosing the Reaction Conditions
The choice of reaction conditions mainly depends on the reaction system you choose.
Validating the Reaction
Use agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA to validate the reaction.

Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Hannah Arendt
The critical reading of Hannah Arendt is part of our new developed approach, which is bottom-up structured.
The aim is to explain why iGEM (and as a consequence our team) would like to make contact with the general public. In this contribution we will investigate how the public may judge developments in synthetic biology based on a reading of the philosopher Hannah Arendt and her interpretation of the notion of judgment as it is found within Immanuel Kant's philosophy.
The Public Judgment and Common Sense in relation to Synthetic Biology"
SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Policy&Practices#Evaluation_-_-_TEXT.html,". By the way, we invite visitors to sign on our scroll as support, and fill in our questionnaires about drug resistance for us to know their knowledge about this problem.
Social Media
Because the geographic location of our exhibition is not good enough, there are still a lot of people without access to our projects and synthetic biology. So we need to use internet if we want them be promoted to much more people. To increase the coverage of our propaganda, we cooperated with Biosns. By means of their channel, our information has been reported by over 30 media including 6 listed companys. Among them, Tencent just has Chinese news coverage up to 89.73% and users up to over 1 billion, the number of which is about summation of user number of top three Chinese operators.
Life Science Community
During the process of promoting our projects and synthetic biology, we realized that those people working on biological research are the ones really affecting on development of synthetic biology. Therefore, we hope to discuss with some large biological firms about drug resistance and synthetic biology. We have visited more than 10 biological firms this year, introducing synthetic biology. Finally, we raised interest of 5 firms and got their supports on technology and lab supplies. By the way, Biosns has showed amazing support to us. Using their mail system, we deliver messages about our projects, synthetic biology exhibition and the 10th anniversary of iGEM, to their 500 thousand users. The uninterrupted delivery repeated every 30 seconds until the user read the mail. So we can know from the background data that how many people really know our information.

Jacob Toth I am a biochemistry student at UBC going into my second year. I joined iGEM to get involved in the world-changing field of synthetic biology, and I am very excited about our project! Outside of science, other interests of mine include playing my violin, studying philosophy, and enjoying nature. My roles on the team include preparing two versions of the 1,8-cineole synthase gene to be put into yeast to be over expressed and working with the ArcGIS program to model the spread of the mountain pine beetle when treated by our products.
Laura Bain I have many loves in life including snowboarding, windsurfing, sailing, biking, gardening AND Biology! I am pumped to be on this year's iGEM team because we are a diverse bunch and have so much to learn from each other! I am very enthusiastic about biology and people so it is a natural fit for me to be spearheading the Human Practices project. I am keen to engage the community in discussions about synthetic biology in non-traditional ways: Creative art projects, videos, forums, roadside chats. Also, It is especially exciting to be partnering with Science World in mentoring and educating Vancouver high school students. We hope to inspire these teenagers to pursue future opportunities in Science and maybe even a 2012 Vancouver Highschool iGEM team!

Cornell,2014,Team:Cornell#project#hprac#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," We found that the growth rate of our engineered cells was severely impaired, such that over a period of one day, the total cell concentration was roughly half that of a wild-type cell.
Competition and Biodiversity:
In the extremely unlikely event of release from our device, our cells would likely be outcompeted very quickly by native environmental strains due to their decreased growth rate. Other cells would multiply much more quickly and overwhelm the engineered cells in most environments. However, in environments with exceptionally high metal concentrations, our engineered cells would actually have higher fitness than the wild-type cells due to their ability to sequester the metals (see Metallothionein Results ). These conditions would presumably never be reached; it would take a massive quantity of concentrated metal solution, coupled with the physical destruction of our device, for this to ever be a matter of concern. The only other circumstance in which our cells would be expected to grow more rapidly than the wild-type would be under conditions of strong antibiotic selection. Our cells currently do contain antibiotic resistance genes, but further development of our strains could remove this by a well-designed chromosomal integration process.
However, to avoid the possibility of release, we have implemented sturdy physical barriers between our cells and the environment. Within the filtration device, the genetically modified cells are held within a hollow fiber reactor, which seriously restricts the movement of particles above 20 kD, meaning that most individual proteins would be unable to escape, much less entire cells.
Evolutionary Prediction:
The only potentially dangerous component of our cells is once again antibiotic resistance, which would be eliminated in the development of a field-deployable product. A more difficult and therefore more interesting question is that of whether the cells would evolve away from their original function. The original induction of metallothionein production would saturate the cells with proteins, and in the absence of growth medium, the growth rate of the cells would be extremely slow. The proteins themselves would also be unable to escape from the reactor, so the total metallothionein concentration would in theory remain constant (barring degradation with time), even as cell concentration might very slowly increase. This then becomes an issue of timescale, and it seems that the bacterial cartridge would likely be replaced before this would become an issue.
Gene Transfer:
The issue of most concern would probably be the transfer of our antibiotic resistance genes from the E. coli to other organisms if the cells were to escape, but as mentioned earlier, this problem could be avoided entirely. It is also true that neither plasmid nor chromosomal DNA would be able to escape the fiber reactor, so engineered DNA would never have contact"

One third of all European citizens has tried an illicit drug with the number rising over the past few years 1. Deaths caused by drug overdose are mostly related to heroin and its purity as drug users are unaware of its concentration (which can vary from 13.52 to 98%3, as well as adulterants and contaminants that are present in their dose4. This has been a great issue for drug users in the UK, with the rate 38.7 drug-induced deaths per million inhabitants, with an even higher rate in Scotland of 112.5 per million inhabitants1. A study in the United States calculated the costs associated with productivity losses due to absenteeism and opioid-induced deaths can reach up to $30,594 per each poisoning event5. Our thesis has been confirmed by a former drug user, to whom we talked to in Serenity Cafe, that focusing our efforts on heroin purity would be efficient and it would potentially reduce opioid-induced deaths. Therefore it is essential to reduce harm and prevent deaths by having a quick, precise and easy to use biosensor.
There are two key enzymes for a heroin biosensor which allow the quantity to be visualised, heroin esterase and morphine dehydrogenase. Heroin esterase, a serine esterase6, de-acetylates the 6-acetylester group of heroin to produce 6-acetylmorphine. This process occurs a second time on the C-6 group producing morphine. The morphine produced is then oxidised to produce morphinone by the second enzyme morphine dehydrogenase. The NADP+ to NADPH reduction allows a coupled assay. A previous heroin biosensor used FMN oxidoreductase and luciferase as the coupled assay, which produced light in the presence of heroin7. To make the biosensor produce colour to the visible eye,"

High school Engagement
So far, there is no iGEM high school team in Wuhan city and Hubei province of P. R. China. It is partially owing to students’ heavy burden of homework, exams and the college entrance pressure, and also because of that most high school students haven’t even heard of iGEM before.
This year, we decided to change this situation and we cast our sight on popularizing the knowledge of synthetic biology in high schools. After plenty of researches, we decided to firstly target on The Affiliated High School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), which is one of the top-leveled high schools in Wuhan and has a global view by recruiting students for international class every year.
After early communication and preparation, we successfully held a seminar at The Affiliated High School of HUST on Jan 7th with over 300 high school teachers and students attending. On the seminar, we introduced the concept and basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM and presented our 2015 iGEM project to them. Students showed great interest in our presentation and were amazed by all the novel ideas of iGEM projects in the past years. After the presentation, we sent out questionnaires to the audiences and received exciting feedbacks.
These high school students said that they were introduced to a new world of biology and a new technology that they hadn’t learnt before in their textbooks. They asked us various questions about synthetic biology and iGEM on the questionnaires. After the seminar, we discussed with the teachers from The Affiliated High School of HUST about the possibility of forming a high school team to attend the competition. They listened to our suggestions and felt promising to form a new team in the future.
Since then, we also invited some students to our lab several times and taught them basic laboratory skills and the progress of our Filter project. Hopefully next year we’ll have a new iGEM high school team in the Giant Jamboree!

FR2.2
Furthermore, the system would have to adapt to utilising a range of different enzymes. This would require enzyme exchange without extensive protein modification (as was done by the 2010 Slovenian iGEM team ). This dictates some form of modularity in the system.
FR2.1
Finally, our scaffold system would have to be easy to produce and be utilised by laboratories and other interested parties in the future (FR3: Facilitate accessible use):
Current Challenge
Criteria to Satisfy this problem
Naming Convention (relating to the flowchart)
The need for a synthetic biology tool to be as simple as possible and be cost effective to assemble.
This can be achieved by having only a minimal number of subunits in the system.
FR3.1
In order to be replicated, a synthetic biology tool would need have clear characterisation.
The system should provide through characterisation of DNA parts.
FR3.2
The system should provide standardised experimental protocols that can be replicated seamlessly.
FR3.3
Concept Generation
Having developed a list of requirements our Assemblase system would have to meet, we moved onto brainstorming different components that would provide the required functions. This included going through various design iterations as a result of consultation with industry and feedback from our experimental and modelling work. Please click on the tabs below to find out about the design process for each of our Assemblase components.
Scaffold
With the functional requirements of our system in mind, the team assessed how we could construct a scaffolding platform that could add modularity and stability to past enzyme clustering methods. We steered away from the concept of substrate channelling or using physical tunnels which have been shown to be unnecessary10, and instead focused on the idea of a synthetic molecular scaffold that would co-localise proteins. With research on the stable, modular, self-assembling chaperone proteins called prefoldin having already been conducted by our supervisor, Dominic Glover, we decided to investigate its use as a potential candidate for our scaffold.
Iteration 1 – Gamma Prefoldin
Prefoldins are generally hexameric molecular chaperone complexes that bind to non-native target proteins in a cell. They have a general role in de novo protein folding in archaea and the biogenesis of cytoskeleton proteins in eukaryotes.
A distinct variant of archaeal prefoldin (PFD), gamma prefoldin (gPFD), has a unique filamentous structure composed of hundreds of monomeric subunits11. This protein complex, which originates from hypertherm"

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html," project by the Technical University of Denmark deals with mycotecture in space by making a building material of mycelium which has been modified to suit extreme environments. Although the material could be used terrestrially, the aim is for it to be applied on planets like Mars and it is therefore relevant to explore the prospects of Mars travel becoming a reality. The project by the University of Copenhagen is aiming towards making a portable system for protein production that can provide future Mars habitants with protein drugs when they need them. The system allows for producing and purification in one step, and therefore requires way less resources than conventional protein production. The system for protein production and purification can be used terrestrially as well, but the aim for it is that it should be applied for long term space travel and colonization of e.g. Mars due to it's portability. The project by the university of Exeter focuses on eliminating perchlorate from the martian surface by using genetically engineered bacteria with perchlorate and chlorite reducing enzymes that breaks down the compounds into oxide and chloride.
These projects are targeted at making Mars colonization a reality by offering sustainable solutions for living. None of our projects rely on fossil resources as these are generally not encouraged in today's society and assumably not in a Mars colony either. As seen from a practical angle, it would not be favorable to have long lines of transportation from Earth to Mars, so coming up with a self-sustainable solution has been prioritized in all three projects.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook )."

Figure 2: Transcriptional activity of PcstA during growth measured by RNA levels.
Generally during the exponential phase of the bacteria, they have a high level of transcriptional activity. However, levels of 5S rRNA are relatively constant at all times. The transcription of gfp increases as the cells enter exponential phase between the two OD600 measurements 0.1 and 0.3. As expected, very low levels of gfp can be detected in the negative control. This strain lacks the ability to generate cAMP, and thus very little transcription is induced. The small amounts of gfp could be explained by leakiness of PcstA or that CAP alone initiates some transcription.
In the setup with WT, LB it is quite clear that the amount of gfp rises, compared to WT, LB+0.2% glucose. Transcription is clearly affected by the presence of glucose. One measurement WT, LB OD600 = 0.8 stands out. The result is not readily explained, but is probably due to some error. But the tendency of the results correlates with the knowledge of the invert relationship between glucose and cAMP. Glucose signaling will repress adenylate cyclase-activity, thus intracellular levels of cAMP will be low in high-energy states, and little transcription of gfp will be initiated.
Figure 3: Northern blot of gfp-mRNA induced by cAMP
We also tried to measure RNA levels induced by cAMP. This experiment was performed in two adenylate cyclase deficient strains; MG1655ΔcyaA and BTH101. In this setup, 1 mM cAMP was added to the medium of exponential cells and samples were subsequently collected at specific times. However, levels of RNA did not seem to be affected by cAMP. But this is probably not due to insensitivity of PcstA to cAMP. The most reasonable explanation is that cAMP failed to activate transcription of gfp, because the molecule were unable pass the cell membrane. However, RNA levels were at best slightly increased after approximately 8 minutes (see figure 3). To study the direct effect of cAMP on the promotor, one must use a different approach.

Introduction
Clotho - Greek Goddess and Software Tool (Courtesy of Christine Tsin )
In any design process there exists a hierarchy of design activities. Higher level activities build upon lower level activities leading to two design approaches: bottom up design and top down design. Bottom up design begins with primitive elements. These elements are combined to form more complex designs. This process is driven by a number of local objective functions. These objectives are abstracted at each level until at the end of the process, a large global objective is met. Top down design, starts with a specification and global objectives. The problem is decomposed into smaller sub-problems each with their own local objectives. This continues until all the primitive elements are specified. As synthetic biology moves toward a more engineering oriented discipline we see a hierarchy appearing as well. This consists of:
System Design - collections of devices whereby large system behavior can be simulated and analyzed
Device Design - the composition of primitive parts to produce specific functionality
Part Design - the encapsulation of DNA sequence information along with information for composition with other parts
Each level has a number of design activities associated with it. A sample of these are shown on the right hand side in the figure below. With this hierarchy in place it now becomes a task of creating software tools which span this hierarchy. It is not enough to just put tools in place at each level however. They must be unified such that design flows are enabled which allow both top down and bottom up design activities.
Our project attempts to do just that. By beginning with the Clotho design environment as our foundation, we focused on device level activities with Eugene , Spectacles , and Kepler . In addition, we strengthened part level development by totally revamping Clotho's core data model and associated APIs . Clotho now is a much more developer and user friendly experience. The figure and sections below provide a brief introduction to each of the various sub-projects we focused on. For more in-depth information we invite you to visit the individual project pages. Enjoy!
Project Overview - Here we illustrate the five steps that our project focuses on. Also implicitly illustrated is a ""bottom"" up design process which begins at the ""parts level"" and continues upward to the ""device"" and ""system"" levels.

June 4: Microsoft
Today, our HCI lab got to visit a branch of Microsoft that was located at Cambridge, MA. I was super impressed with Microsoft. First of all, they had an amazing view of Charles River. A whole panorama! It was absolutely gorgeous and stunning even though today was cold and raining.
Their recruitment and education chair presented Microsoft 8 to us and their tablet. It was amazing. I’ll be honest and say that I had my doubts about a tablet version of Microsoft because ipad is already amazing. But I quickly learned that Microsoft has some pretty nifty ideas too. With swips on the sides and touches on the corners of the screen, Microsoft 8 seems to be as lively and useful as it can be too! I was really amazed at what other options and ideas Microsoft 8 is going to put forth in the realm of technology. And after seeing and learning about this whole thing, I am absolutely amazed and excited about the technology that I get to work with in the lab and the possibilities/ creativities of the next generation technology.
June 5: BioBuilder
We had a Synthetic Biology bootcamp in MIT and it was pretty cool. (And for once, I didn’t have to wake up at 6:30 in the morning! Wohoo!!)
First of, MIT is just amazing. There is so much stuff/ brain power here and I got the feeling that if you want to learn something or just anything, there will be at least one professor who’s speciality and interest is just that!
The Natalie, an MIT Prof, taught us and gave us an intro on Synthetic Biology. We had lectures in the morning, and labs in the afternoon. She’s amazing! She’s super knowledgeable about the biology, explains things well, and keeps the class interested. It’s very interesting to apply the biology that I learned at Swells and be able to make something out of it.

Two types of nanotubes have been observed: one was a wide cell protrusion-like structure that reached out from one cell and directly touched another cell even across a rather long distance; another type of nanotube was comparatively much thiner, but in a rather great number. The latter type of nanotubes could be found at the end of the former ones, thereby further connecting distant cells; or right from the middle of the cell bodies linking several neighboring cells all at once. Both types were supported by F-actin and were non-adherent to the substratum.

During experiment, when fluid(culture media x flowed through the channels, the shear force was applied on a thin layer close to wall. The culture media can be treated as a Newtonian flow with a constant viscosity μ,0.012dyn·s/cm2 [1] . The shear stress that medium generated on the wall is proportional to strain rate. As a result, we could relate the magnitude of stress to the velocity gradient along the transversal surface of each channel.
Due to the extremely small scale of microfluidic channel (only 0.285mm of width and 0.090mm of height), fluid in it exists as the Laminar flow. Turbulent flow is not possible with the physiology range of flow speed, even at the corners.  The head loss of the pumped inflow is also negligible in our experiment.  The modeling of flow between 2 parallel plates applies to such stable state, in which the magnitude of shear stress on the bottom is proportional to the maximum velocity ( shown as the longitudinal central line in Fig. 2).
As the shear stress is proved proportional to the flow rate in the channels, we designed the chip to achieve that each of 3 channels in observation area has the same transversal surface but the gradient (81: 9: 1 from up to bottom) flow rate, also the average speed, as shown in Fig. 3.

Alexia Vidal (INSA)
Fourth year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon, I provided support for the 2013 European Jamboree organization. This experience really motivated me to participate in the 2014 iGEM adventure! I loved working this summer with our bacteria but especially with all the INSA Lyon team members. Moreover, I was in charge of the project budget management. Outside of school, I enjoy scuba-diving, playing the flute in a harmony orchestra, running, playing golf, going out with friends and traveling. I look forward to meeting you all in Boston!
Romain Tching Chi Yen (INSA)
Now fourth year student in Bioinformatics and Modelling, I'm the waffle master of the team. Though not the most efficient, I'm dedicated to my work and spent an incredible summer with everyone working on this project. My contribution to the team was mainly with the mathematical model (no, I swear I'm nice, don't run away!) and human practice work, but I also helped in the wetlab for the cloning period, as well as whenever help was needed, be it for an experiment, making solutions, washing instruments, filling pipette tips boxes, etc. I could do everything. Kind of like a super hero... Yes, you may refer to me as WaffleMan!

The purpose of this investigation was to display the significance in the separation of Part and lower level property information, which is hidden in the header files from the Device level construction in the main file. As a result about an average of 85% less code is utilized in the main file. The real strength of the language becomes apparent with the introduced level of abstraction through the transfer of Part designs from databases to the header files. Such functionality allows the augmentation of data from other sources to the main design. The focus shifts from the low level details of the system to design validation through rule constructs and control flow implementation. The program becomes easier to manage. At the same time, the ratio of DNA base pairs to total lines of code implies the portability of very complex designs with large base pairs to other tools or systems. Sharing designs becomes much easier, especially, since the creation of the data structure is quickly achieved. The compilation times are very reasonable as"
UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-2_-_-_TEXT.html," so we will not use it in this project. To avoid gene drive, our mentor, Dr. David Bernick, suggested that we use microinjection of the Cas9 protein. However, micropipettes cannot penetrate the cell wall of Y. lipolytica, which makes this technique unusable (Riveline and Nurse, 2009). The authors of Riveline and Nurse (2009) offered an alternative method that employs microfabricated channels to hold individual yeast cells while a piezoelectric unit shears them (Riveline and Nurse, 2009). With the limited timeframe of our project, this option seemed too complex, so we abandoned CRISPR/Cas9 as our method of gene integration.
We also considered using homologous recombination (HR) to integrate our genes of interest. HR requires that our gene cassette be flanked by 1 kilobase (kb) regions homologous with a location in the Y. lipolytica genome. When a double-strand break naturally occurs within the cell, the cell can repair the break using homologous pieces, known as homology arms (HAs). HAs neighboring our genes of interest will signal the cell to repair the break and integrate our genes into the genome. Although HR is a great option for genomic integration, Y. lipolytica performs NHEJ more often than HR. In a typical strain of Y. lipolytica, using HR dramatically increases the time needed for our genes of interest to incorporate into the genome. Fortunately, Verbeke et al. (2013) showed that HR rates in Y. lipolytica increased by 56% when they knocked out the KU70 gene (Verbeke et al., 2013). The KU70 gene regulates the NHEJ pathway in Y. lipolytica, and eliminating it forces the yeast to repair breaks using HR. We chose a strain that has KU70 knocked out for this reason, so HR is a viable option for us.
Cre-lox site-specific recombination is another method we explored for genomic integration. This technique uses a recombination enzyme native to bacteriophage P1, Cre recombinase, and lox sites that the recombinase targets (Watson et al., 2008). Typical Cre-lox recombination uses two identical loxP sites which may invert or delete the genomic information between them depending on lox site directionality (Juchheim, 2015). We found a publication by Watson et al. (2008) where they used two incompatible lox sites for recom"

Also our sister team METU_TURKEY is our main collaborator.     They have provided feedback BioGUIDE at different stages of the development.     And they had the chance to analyze their constructs input/output relations     throughout this collaboration.
ALL TEAMS: The Parts Registry Survey that has been     developed by METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE got response from 253 of participant     from 94 teams. Analysis of the survey results we have received so far     indicates that we were able outreach to the iGEM community and help     them verbalize their concerns and suggestions for the parts registry     standards and the maintenance of the database.
WARSAW: Our team members have participated in their     survey abour iGEM participants profile.
METU_TURKEY: Beta testing of the algorithm developed     and the BioGUIDE software has been performed by METU_TURKEY on few case     studies. Additionally they have tested their construct for 2010 competition     with our algorithm.
Material
Our main data source for BIO Guide Software Program was the available     background information of parts distributed in 2010 iGEM plates (Total     of three384-well plates of dried DNA) to the wetlab teams. This data     was available through both the parts registry main website ( http://partsregistry.org/Main_Page )     in XML format and parts registry libraries (http://partsregistry.org/assembly/libraries.cgi?id=31)     in Excel format. Data from parts with specific part IDs have been parsed     with a custom code developed to modify SAX Parser. Then, the rest of     the data which needs to be standardized according to biological importance     have been extracted from the Registry of Parts Page manually.

PARTS
In 2018, BIT-China has submitted 16 parts. We divide our parts into 3 group, Regulator,                         Feedback and Output. Each group contains some parts with similar function or close relation.                         Different groups also connect with each other.
Regulator
Increase ROS Content
BBa_K2765026 and BBa_K2765021 is a collection of regulate components including coding                         protein and expression cassette, which can increase the accumulation of intracellular ROS                         through overexpressing yon1 induced by galactose.
Improve Tolerance
BBa_K2765030 is 1000bp homologous arm of yca1 gene, which can knock out yca1 gene                         through                         homologous recombination so that the yeast's tolerance to H2O2 could be                         improved.
Feedback
Control ROS Content
BBa_K2765000~BBa_K2765005 is a collection of feedback components that are downstream                         gene                         promoter of Yap1. We use them to turn on the expression of dCas9 which can inhibit the                         expression of yno1 gene. Considering the application of our system in the future, to realize                         different feedback effect, we verified different promoters, GLR1p, SOD2p, TRR1p, TRX2p and GSH1p,                         with different transcription level.
Output
Detect ROS content
BBa_K2765040~BBa_K2765053 is a collection of output components including promoters,                         coding                         protein and expression cassette, which can express redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein                         roGFP2-Orp1 and display ROS content in cells by its fluorescence ratio.
According to this measurement principle, the concentration of whole roGFP2-Orp1 can influence                         the final signal output strength, even detect the same sample, so we verified four promoters,                         FBA"

But even Golden Gate cloning is not 100 % efficient. In order to remove those plasmids that did not take up a vector insert, we added the restriction site of the blunt end cutter PmeI (MssI) to the PPEC. We chose PmeI because it has a 8 bp binding site, which is very unlikely to occur in the gene of an effector that you would like to fuse with the TAL gene.
So after performing the Golden Gate reaction described above, we digested with MssI fast digest (fermentas) according to the following protocol:

This linearizes all vectors that do not contain the effector (at least, we do not see colonies on the negative control plate). To be sure, these linearized vectors do not religate, perform the following digest with T5 exonuclease, which specifically removes linearized DNA:

The efficiency of our own little invention – the PPEC – actually surprised us a little bit, for details, see the results section .
Insertion of the TAL ORF into the MammoBrick vector:
Since we wanted to put the TAL ORF under the control of the CMV promoter, we digested both the MammoBrick vector (with SpeI and PstI) and the TAL ORF (with XbaI and PstI), ligated them and transformed into a ccdB-cassette resistant E.coli strain. The resulting clones were verified by sequencing and contained the eukaryotic TAL expression vector:

The N-terminal transmembrane α-helix of human EGFR ( UniProt P00533 , amino acids 622-653) was herefore chosen (see below the topology prediction of EGFR via the TMHMM 2.0 server for the prediction of transmembrane helices [6] ). A stop-transfer sequence, that is also present in the endogeneous EGFR, consisting of clustered, positively charged amino acids - being characteristic for type I membrane proteins - was added at the C-terminus, and the sequence was furthermore flanked by a (GGGGC)2-linker at the N- and C-terminus, respectively. The addition of a stop-transfer sequence as in the naturally occuring EGFR sequence, as well as the addition of flexible linkers, makes our EGFR-TMD an improvement over the BioBrick BBa_K157002 , which does not possess either of these elements.

Moreover, the receptor contains three functional elements for its detection: The intracellularly located red fluorescent protein mRuby 3 for detection of the receptor via fluorescence microscopy, an extracellular epitope domain for immunochemical detection via A3C5-antibody fragments and an intracellular Strep-tag II for the detection and purification via immunochemical methods.
The vector furthermore contains the poly-adenylation signal of human growth hormone (hGH) for functional polyadenylation of the transcribed mRNA. A description for the respective functional elements is given in the following sections.

Now he is in the board of University of Georgia and a famous scholar in science and technology, the director of the center for systems biology research at the University of Georgia. In 2009 he was awarded as a ""Changjiang Scholar"", the chair professor at Jilin University. In 2012, he was recruited as a Jilin university professor in ""one thousand plan"". Professor Xu is a world-class expert in computational biologist, bioinformatics, cancer research and so on. He has made quite a few significant contributions in the field of bioinformatics, for example: (a) biological pathways and the calculation method of networks and model research (b) cancer of bioinformatics (c) comparative genome analysis (d) Protein structure prediction and modeling. The papers he published had more than 40 H-Index. He got the Distinguished Scholar of Georgia at 2003, and was selected as American Association for Advancement of Science Fellow.
In the lecture, professor Xu introduced their recent research progress. They investigated the transcriptomes of different tumor tissue and make big data analysis.  They made two major discoveries. One is that all the tumors went through the process of chronic inflammation, but not all of the chronic inflammation can lead to cancer; and the other is that the basis of tumor proliferation is Fenton reaction.
Finally, professor Xu suggested some useful suggestions to prevent cancers:
First: Stay away from meat, red meat have higher iron content, which is the main force of Fenton reaction;
Second: Stay away from alcohol, especially the person who would show red face after drinking, the body is telling you not to drink;
Third: Male should make regular blood donation to help prevent accumulation of iron in the body; women don't have to bother before menopause.

Mutant PUF Expression Gel
This is our PUF protein expression gel. We decided to test the PUF protein expression under different conditions to optimize it our further experiments. Lanes labeled 2 through 7 were expressed in a higher, E. Coli standard temperature of 37 degrees C. Lanes 8 through 13 were conducted in a lower temperature of 24 degrees C. The lower temperature, as suggested by the Zefang Wang Lab at the University of North Carolina, has been confirmed to result in more specific and definite PUF protein expression in DH5a.
The parts highlighted in red are significant expressions of the wild type PUF protein.
YFP Fluorescence Data
With regards to our hypothetical results, our experimental fluorescence measurements were substantially faithful to our predictions. Looking at columns 5, 6, 7, and 8, our observations appear to be in line with what we have predicted in introducing the wild type PUF-PIN to constructs containing specific recognition site. However, YFP expression was silenced regardless of the binding site type present in the Y"
IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#berlin_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Berlin diagnostX team on this successful collaboration and look forward to doing more work together in the future.
How it all started?
It all began when we got in touch with the Berlin diagnostX through facebook initially followed by a skype call. We started out by increasing each other’s outreach and impact on social media platforms like facebook.
This very small collaboration worked, and we promoted each other on social media. Although this beginning seems unimportant and small, we guess it was the critical factor, that initiated our larger collaboration – because, without this pre-existing contact, we may not have talked to them through skype call.In our Skype call, we discussed at length about each other’s projects.It was then that we got to know about them researching on a disease caused by Tapeworms found in India.
The first Gasp of transcontinental research
Later in 2017 Henrik and Dimi from Berlin team came to India to build new research cooperations. They contacted iGEM IIT Delhi to ask whether they could visit their lab and exchange research ideas. Throughout our first skype call with the IGEM Berlin-Team, we got along that well, that we formed the idea to jointly built a pipeline, that allows PCR and RNA isolation on lysed, non-infectious S1-security level samples, that Berlin diagnostX was planning to acquire from India. For this reason, Berlin diagnostX tried to order some RNA isolation kits and PCR reagents to the lab of iGEM IIT Delhi, but it turned out that multinational companies like NEB, ThermoFisher, and QIAGEN are unable to send a bill to Germany and to deliver the products to India. At this point, iGEM IIT Delhi helped and bought the kits for Berlin diagnostX from a local reseller.
Jointly established RNA isolation pipeline at IIT Delhi
After visiting physicians and villages with people affected by T. solium, Dimi and Henrik went to IIT Delhi to establish RNA isolation in the lab of iGEM IIT Delhi. Having this option to do RNA isolation was crucial for diagnostX because laboratories in Varanasi did not have the equipment to isolate RNA and there was a realistic chance that isolation of RNA was necessary for export. The team from Delhi found a student dorm for Henrik and Dimi to stay in and thus we could work day and night to optimize an RNA isolation protocol that ultimately yielded high-quality RNA.

Introduction
As a bronze medal requirement, iGEM teams have to partake in the InterLab study. These experiments carried out by laboratories across the world ensure that their studies are reliable and repeatable, a key component of scientific disciplines.
Fluorescence is a property commonly measured in synthetic biology however data from different studies often cannot be compared because different units have been used, the data has been processed differently and results are given in ‘relative expression’. The InterLab study aims to address this by using a detailed protocol and data analysis to yield absolute units for measuring GFP, this year focussing on how close the numbers can be when fluorescence is measured all around the world.
Experiments
Note: Due to being a high school team we did not own a plate reader so our InterLab study was carried out at the University of Kent in conjunction with their iGEM team’s InterLab study.
Firstly we had to transform the 8 plasmids (positive control, negative control, 6 test devices) into E. coli DH5-alpha cells. This took several attempts using the parts on both Kit Plate 6 and 7.
OD600 Reference Point: This was carried out in order calculate a conversion ratio from our absorbance data (measured by LUDOX-S40) to a standard OD600  (optical density) measurement.
Plate reader Settings:
 - Wavelength: 600nm
 - Path Length Correction: Off
Fluorescein Fluorescence Standard Curve: This was done to measure the fluorescence of varying fluorescein concentrations produced from a serial dilution. A standard curve was then produced so that cell based fluorescence readings could be converted to a fluorescein concentration and therefore a GFP concentration.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#KimberlyChang_-_-_TEXT.html," the Science Center abstracts today. Orit came in to look over what I had written and offered suggestions for improvements. I finished up the abstract and submitted it to Wellesley’s website.
July 31: I finished the designs for the tangibles for the SynFlo contaminants and started working more on the ITS paper. I finished rough drafts of the Related Works, Future Works, User Studies and References sections.  Nicole and I took photos of the Surface and the cubes for use in our poster for the Science Center Poster Session. In the evening, I found out that the designs for the tangibles that I’d made would not work for the laser cutter. I needed to redraw the designs in Illustrator and export them as a pdf document. Wendy and I also took more photos of SynFlo using her camera because a lot of the photos Nicole and I took previously looked blurry.
August 1: I got the tangibles printed on the laser cutter. Each different type of tangible was printed on a color of plastic to match with the cutout shapes on the color selection cube. I took photos of the tangibles to use for the poster and finished putting together what we have for the ITS paper into the ITS format. During the evening, I got the final poster design printed out.
August 2: Today was the Wellesley poster presentation where we showed off SynFlo to the Wellesley community. We had our poster set up as well as two sets of Sifteo cubes and the Microsoft Surface to allow people to play with the installation.

Before joining the MPCR lab, he modeled the propagation of invasive species throughout Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Everglades in the FAU Geoscience Department. He has since combined cutting edge, neurally-inspired methods in machine learning with his knowledge of remote sensing and GIS to create new ways to solve geospatial problems, such as land cover classification of aerial photographs and autonomous tracking of animal species using drones. Besides working on novel applications for machine learning algorithms, he has also worked to develop new algorithms in the areas of sparse coding, compressive sensing, and locally-competitive neural networks. He believes machines can do anything and is also the CTO of VoxelRx, LLC, an offshoot of the lab dedicated to performing medical imaging using machine learning.

Back to Protocols
Transformation (OneShot® Top10 Chemically competent cells)
Get half the amount of tubes of OneShot® TOP10 chemically competent cells (tubes with a purple lid) than the transformations to be done from the -80ºC freezer and put them on ice for 10-15min.
Divide the volume of competent cells of each tube in 2. Thus, transfer 25L to a new sterile tube.
Add 1µL of plasmid or 2µL of ligation product into each tube and mix by flicking.
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Heat shock the cells for 30 seconds at 42ºC.
Put back on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 250µL of LB medium.
Incubate at 37ºC with shaking for 1 hour.
NOTE: Not at the thermoblock, use a shacking incubator.
To increase the concentration of cells before plating, centrifuge the tubes at 4000rpm for 3 minutes, remove 200µL of medium, resuspend the pellet in the remaining volume.
Plate the rest of the volume of the transformation on selective LB plates and incubate at 37ºC overnight.
Back to Protocols
Colony PCR (Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix)
Choose the colonies to be picked for testing and number them. When available pick at least 8 colonies per plate, or more if there are slots left in the PCR machine (it fits 25 samples).
NOTE: It is more convenient if the numbering is continued between plates of the same batch instead of starting at 1 in each plate. This way there is only one set of numbers per date.
NOTE: it is possible that not all samples fit in one PCR and then more than one would need to be performed, so keep that in mind for the timing of experiments. But don’t be sad, that would mean that the transformation worked so well that you have a lot of colonies to choose from!! ☺
Prepare the mix for all the samples in a single 1.5mL tube (mind pipetting error!). For one sample:

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html,", we decided to use both Cre-lox recombination and HR in parallel experiments to determine which method yields the most recombinants. We will use HR to incorporate the lox sites into the Y. lipolytica genome, and HR to integrate the progesterone pathway. In a parallel experiment, we will use Cre-lox recombination and RMCE to insert the genes into the Y. lipolytica genome. This will allow us to characterize the recombination rate of the lox sites to satisfy one of the iGEM bronze medal requirements, while keeping the HR technique as a contingency plan if Cre-lox recombination fails.
QUANTIFICATION of PROGESTERONE
Several quantification methods were evaluated based on their specificity, accuracy and time efficiency.  Each of these methods, additionally, require the purification of the products of the synthetic pathway from the yeast cells. We considered gas or liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry since they report concentrations of precursors and quantify our desired product. However, gas chromatography would require the derivatization of progesterone so it could be vaporized during the mobile phase.  We determined that we should use liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry due to the convenience of the solid phase extraction system. Solid phase extraction utilizes the affinity of mobile phase solutes for a solid in its stationary phase to separate a mixture into its components by means of a cartridge. We would also use affinity column chromatography with progesterone-antibody beads, or ELISA for a more specific detection of progesterone. These methods would require progesterone antibodies and more preparation, but allow for immediate on site results.
DOSAGE
Our project requires a method for a consumer to obtain a reliable dose of contraceptive. Initially, we considered a galactose inducible progesterone biosynthesis pathway so we could establish a concentration of substrate to product curve. We abandoned this idea after learning that galactose inducibility is repressed by glucose which is present in the fuel source. We then considered methods of ceasing production of progesterone by use of a sensor that would inhibit the pathway at a specific concentration of progesterone.
Progesterone Receptor
The human progesterone receptor has 3 common isoforms, one of which is inherently cytosolic and translocates into the nucleus to affect gene expression after binding to progesterone. We considered using this action to initiate an apoptosis event upon binding of progesterone in the cell. This idea had some problems; the natural binding affinity for these receptors was much too high for our purposes and"

Lab managers can place all of a labs protocols on openProtocol to make standardization within a lab easier.  Individual lab personnel can customize protocols to their liking, and can directly embed them in online lab-notebooks or use the beautifully formatted printed versions in a traditional lab notebook.
iGEMers can use openProtocol to clearly lay out new and interesting ways to manipulate biobricks, as well as to standardize protocols for the most commonly done procedures like enzyme digestions and minipreps.  Many common mistakes can in this way be eliminated (""with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow."")
FAQ
OK, so where can I get started?
You can sign up [ here ] . Additionally, there will be a demo of openProtocol at the iGEM jamboree during our workshop on Saturday!
Is openProtocol open source?
Yes, openProtocol is open source, and all protocols included on the site are by default licensed under a Creative Commons license.  However, if some labs desire to have a protocol be kept private or copyrighted, that does not preclude its inclusion for viewing by others on openProtocol.
Can I contribute to the openProtocol project?
Absolutely!  We are particularly interested in recruiting new members to our team that have expertise in versioning control systems, the jQuery javascript framework, and scaling database solutions.  Others are also welcome: get in touch with our project lead Eric at eric.meltzer at google's popular webmail client dot com.
If you have any other questions, let us know at openprotocol @ that google mail product dot com.
Collaboration
In the course of developing our new tech standard ""openProtocol"" we have received invaluable assistance from both the UCSF team and the Peking University team.  UCSF assisted us with the early design for the system, and tirelessly gave us protocols to test the system with.  They put up with endless changes and iterations to the design, and without them the current version of openProtocol would be unusable. In return, we have assisted them in turning all of their protocols into openProtocols, facilitating their easy dissemination and standardization. Peking University's team also contributed a large set of protocols, and has provided us with a great deal of useful advice on the internationalization of our openProtocol tool.  Thanks guys!

PSB1C3-TlpB CLONING
First of all we planned to cloning our gene that we ordered from IDT as a G-blocks to the PSB1C3 plasmid for multiply our genes and also for submitting to the iGEM as a biobrick in PSB1C3, for this purpose we cut both our PSB1C3 vector and G-Block of TIpB with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Then we inserted these G-Blocks to the plasmid with used T4 DNA ligase enzyme and we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with Verify Forward and Verify Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 314 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see  band.
After Colony PCR, for the clonings that we thought positive we put our bacteria to the 16 hours liquid culture and we isolated plasmid DNA with miniprep isolation method. We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using EcoRI restriction enzyme.
pET45-TlpB CLONING
After we cloned our genes to PSB1C3 plasmid successfully then we planned to cloning our genes to an expression vector pET45-b for high amount of protein synthesizing. For cloning our gene to this vector, we extracted our genes from PSB1C3-TIpB plasmid with using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. We performed ligation with pET45-b vector which is cutted with the same enzymes, then we transformed our plasmid to the BL21 competent bacteria which has a T7 RNA polymerase.
For verifying our cloning process we did colony PCR with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If we got the cloning results wrongly we should see 360 bp band but if we achieved the cloning we should see 2007 band.

Strangely, nothing grew on the plates that we seeded yesterday with 2ul of bacteria.  We seeded plates again for samples 78, 79, and 82 with 15ul of transformed bacteria instead, and hopefully these should grow by tomorrow.

Replating final samples, take 2
We realized that the plates we seeded yesterday (July 16) were seeded from the transformation bacteria tubes, which has a mix of bacteria that may/may not have taken up the plasmid.  These plates therefore cannot serve as the final stock plates.  We took the E. coli from our initial colony picking and put them in LB + spec to grow to saturation tomorrow, where we will replate again with those bacteria (for which the good PCR results should correlate).
Gel analysis of miniprep junction PCR
The miniprep junction PCR products from yesterday were ran on an agarose gel, with the results below:
PCR Results, expected band at ~1.4 kb
While all the bands are between 1000 and 1650 kb, there are slight variations in the size for which we are unable to account. We will send these out for sequencing, to try to figure out what is going on.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Ontour_-_-_TEXT.html," many people to it with its talks.
For three of us it started as a big challenge to walk up to different exhibiting companies. As it was our first time on such an event we were mortified to ask them for help, supplies or even money. But this fear quickly faded as the exhibitors reacted positively to our project ideas and offered us their help. One offer included the nanophotometer as a unit on loan from the company Implen, which later helped us a lot during growth curve measurements and mini preps.
A problem we encountered was that most of the exhibiting companies had attendants at their booth that were only responsible for a specific region. Since Duesseldorf is a two hour ride away (which is a lot in Germany) and is located in a completely different part of Germany, the people usually had to refer us to a different, more relevant contact of their company.
At the Lab Supply trade fair, several talks were offered. We joined the talks about autoclaving and pipetting. Thus, we learned about the different protocols for autoclaving systems and their function and advantages. Afterwards, we learned how different kinds of pipettes function and how to handle them correctly, in order to prevent diseases caused by wrong pipette handling in the lab.
Besides all that, we met the iGEM teams of Marburg (for the first time) and Bielefeld and had the chance to talk about our projects and the experiences with sponsoring.  It was especially interesting for us freshmen to talk to one of the members who had participated in the iGEM competition before.
All in all, the Lab Supply was a big success and we gained a few very valuable insights and a really useful nanophotometer.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html," be involved in using genetic engineering principles.
The other-answers:
One primary theme that comes forward from the open answers is the usefulness of applying genetic engineering. It is often stated that genetic manipulation principles should only be used when needed, when it is useful for man or science. We need to have a clear goal before engaging in using genetic engineering tools.
Some focus on the risks and safety of these techniques. They state that researchers should be fully aware of the complexity and implications, analyze the risks and predict the outcome using models. One comment states that ""organisms should be modified with care"".
Others alternatively point out that genetic engineering has been going on for centuries in the form of selective breeding, so ""why not?"",  an argument that was already incorporated in answer A.
The majority of the group thinks that modifying organisms by the use of genetic engineering should be available because of the (possible) benefits that it carries along. A minority of 19% is worried about the consequences that these techniques might have when meddling with evolution. Although the techniques are well studied, the complexity of  DNA and the translation system are not yet completely understood and should make researchers use genetic engineering with care, and only apply it for beneficial purposes. A risk/benefit assessment could help identifying when these techniques should be applied.
Venter et al.
One of the biggest contributors to synthetic biology research and possibly one of the most controversial researchers in (synthetic) biology is Craig J. Venter. His project on creating a minimal genome is groundbreaking and raises a lot of questions, primarily by media machinery. How does the synthetic-biology-research community think about his research and bold statements?
Graph 4.
4. Craig Venter is one of the lead researchers in the minimal genome project. He intends to synthesize a bacterial genome from scratch, and then insert it into a cell (a Mycoplasma bacterium, from which the original genome is removed) to see if it can have the normal functions of the organism (Hutchison, 2003). Do you think Venter's approach is typically new?
Yes, his approach is novel; he uses new techniques
No, he just uses genetic engineering principles
Other:
This question is based on the research of one specific group. Although some might not have heard of Craig J. Venter and his research, most people working in synthetic biology have heard/read about his project. Because of the controversial character that is assigned to Venter's research, we were interested about how the iGEM community perceives Venter's approach.
The media refers to Venter's research as ""new"", but the results show"

We have known that there are many scientists in the world who are working on this field. Many of the studies have done quite well. In contrast, there is a shortage of our subjects, but we also put forward our own ideas for this field. Although at present we may not see the practical value of the project, we believe that there is not a simple project in the world, we still need to do our best to complete it.
Project Evaluation
W
e know that the purpose of human practice is to explore the impact of our subjects on our lives and the impact of this world on our subjects. As for biological memory, many aspects of the problem are similar. How much information can be stored on the disk? How fast is the rate of information being stored? What are the potential applications of biological memory? In order to get further understand of these problems, we not only have collected the relevant research, but also start a “virtual interview” with the top experts in the field of biological memory.
We have investigated some of the latest developments in the relevant field of cellular memory and biological logic circuit. Through the investigation of related articles, we have made a brief summary of the basic issues in the field of biological memory.
1st. How to define ""biological memory""?
Almost all of the articles defined biological memory as a process is a kind of process that transforms the instant signal into a permanent signal. This process is different from simple logic circuits. It is more akin to a sequential logical system, in order to be used for more complex calculations or output in the future.
2nd. Why do we need to study and transform the biological memory?
Some studies suggest that the existence of biological memory determines the fate of cells. This is a determinant of cell differentiation and epigenetic inheritance. Although the cells cannot be used as supercomputers, some of them are still very interesting, they are more like a computing process. So just as a scholar said, the construction of synthetic memory circuits will improve our understanding of natural networks, further aiding the creation of useful, new biological tools.
3rd. What kind of mechanism can be used to achieve biological memory?
The simplest mechanism is the construction of a number of bistable systems. Latest statistics show the biological mechanisms include nucleic acid hybridization,"

The receptor is not directly activated by the pathogen; but by the protease produce by the pathogen which will cut a designed membrane protein; releasing a dipeptide which will be detected by our designed membrane receptor.
Amplification:
The team designed a new biobrick which provides the appropriate amplification characteristics to our system (amplification and noise filter).    The amplification is achieved thanks to a positive loop. The noise filtering is achieved thanks to a well known promoter which we used in brend new way. Indeed, we used the pAra/Bad promoter from E. coli as an AND gate.      We tested this new AND gate ( take a look at our results ).
Communication:
In order to improve the strength of the output signal,     we used a natural communication system present in E. Coli which allow bacteria to communicate using 3'-5'-cyclic Adenosine     MonoPhosphate (cAMP) ( our friend's PhD thesis ).
Our Safety project:
During the summer, we worked on the risks with biological experiments:     More precisely we focused on the risks linked to UV radiation, chemicals and biology.     For the two first, we succeeded in reducing the exposition of the team members and further users of the laboratory. This was achieved thanks    to the addition of safety measurments adapted to the experiments.
We focused our work on the biological risk.     Synthetic Biology is an emerging activity and even if the current method     to evaluate the biological risks does not reveal any risk, this does not     mean synthetic biology is safe of use. Some feedbacks about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) used in different fields     have shown drawbacks (e.g. Transgenic corn).
Since the first iGEM competition the number of teams has been increasing;     and because we think that it will continue, we tried to develop a way to store team feedbacks (experiements and observations) on the use of biobricks.     However, we developed a prototype which is why we asked for feedbacks from other teams     ( Edinburg , Gröningen , Paris Bettencourt and Virginia ) to improve its structure and content.
The result is a BioBrick Safety Sheets; this project could really improve     the structuring of the information, but a work was done to link it with     the current registry of standard biological parts. In the future, if     this structure is used this would lead to the creation of a software     that would contain every interactions for each BioBrick."

The quantity and quality of miRNAs isolated from a biological sample is also variable and miRNA levels differ in serum and plasma (and may be affected by anticoagulants). Implementing a standard process for sample preparation is key to solving these problems as well as creating better reagent sets and investigating the differences in miRNA levels from different sources.

Termites are not only in school but also in people's houses. They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture. The annoying termites strongly reduce the quality of life.
What you need to do is simple. Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT. Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen. Avoid direct sunshine and remember to keep your children away from it. 3 months later you will be glad to say goodbye to those little troublemaker termites.
WHY OUR PRODUCT
CURRENT WAYS OF DEALING
Firstly, locating the nest, then people will dig a hole as a trap near the nest and put food mixed with drug in it. Termites will die after feeding in the trap. The trap won't be cleared until no termite will feed in it. Yet locating the nest is one huge difficulty when using this way to kill termite. It requires a lot of human cost in the early days. Special techniques are also needed.
Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed. We particularly choose the drugs that have long action period. We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time. However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.
Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites. But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don't have ways to determine the range of the precautions.
CURRENT PRODUCTS OF KILLING
Beneficial nematodes
These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours. They are not harmful to humans, plants or pets, and are able to kill the entire insect colony.
Timing
Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can't simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work. Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun can kill"

Protein Extraction Kit
Background
For selective purification of proteins, affinity chromatography is one of the most efficient methods available. Often they are only suited for analytical purposes and purification of high-value products and are too expensive for large-scale products such as industrial enzymes. Furthermore, the methods are difficult to scale up [1].
Liquid-liquid extraction in an aqueous two-phase system has been applied for primary recovery of industrial bulk proteins. They are formed in mixtures between two incompatible components, e.g. PEG/dextran, polymer/salt or detergent/polymer.
Usually, aqueous two-phase systems' formation could be induced by a shift in temperature above a critical temperature (cloud point) in a detergent/water system. Non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-114, display such temperature-sensitive phase separation, and can form cloud point extraction (CPE) systems [2].
The partitioning of a protein to one of the phases may depend on its surface charge or hydrophobicity, but the driving forces are not well understood. Obviously, the selectivity and overall efficiency of purification depend on how much the target protein differs in relevant properties as compared to the rest of proteins in the mixture. To achieve selective protein purification in aqueous two-phase system, small hydrophobic tags containing tryptophans have been fused to the target protein. However, the production of these fusion molecules is not efficient, possible reasons being problems in secretion of the tagged proteins or proteolytic degradation of the tag [1].
Our Goal
1. Achieve efficient protein extraction using Janus tag.
2. Find the best Janus tag.
3. Testify this system applicative to all kinds of proteins.
4. Develop universal BioBrick Janus tag for all users. 5. Explore the universally good conditions to all kinds of proteins.
6. Propose standard protocols for Janus-based protein extraction.
Our Design
Here comes the Janus, which could perform as a perfect protein extraction tag. The size of inJanus is about 8 kDa, and sJanus is about 7.5 kDa; both of them are not very large to affect the target protein. At the same time, Janus could promote the production of some proteins in various cells, like E4GIcore-sJanus in T. reesei [2] and"
