Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html,"er Uni to oganise a London iGEM Meetup. Alberto, Thomas and Amrit met with Albert Fabregas, a PhD student from Guy Bart-Stan lab who is working with optogenetics. He told us that for 2D applications he can do the same with optogenetics and does not see the benefit of electricity. However, it would be cool to develop a toolkit for electronic gene expression --> we now have chemical toolkits, light, temperature, pressure and even pH toolkits to activate gene expression... but what about an electrical input?? Improvements on the wiki and human practice. Also we have 300£ in the VWR stores account, so that ""we can buy cheap ethanol and get fucked up"" - Josh. In the dry lab we received the carbon electrodes to test.  Luis is working on a very comprehensive modelling guide. The Arduino also arrived in the lab.
Week 4 - 23/07/18
Monday
In the morning we performed the colony PCR to clone SoxR from MG1655.  Siwat is working on the interactive HTML Science Communication guideline. Yu is making progresses in outlining the HTML architecture of the wiki. Alberto is also working on the HTML code of the Team Cohesion questionnaire. Luis and Will talked with Tom Ouldridge, who suggested to model a square wave form of Pyo as input to GFP as output (to see resoponse of different concentration of pyocyanin). Still no response from COMSOL, is it possible that at Imperial nobody works on electrochemistry? The electrodes also have been built. Lunch break in SAF cafe.  After lunch, we went to the VWR store downstairs in SAFB to pick up an Eppendorf parcel and bought some Ethanol. We did three colony PCR, the first 2 did not work (too long elongation time probably); finally the last one of the day worked.
Tuesday
In the morning we performed gel extraction of the succesful colony PCR gel from yesterday. We managed to collect 33 ng/ul of DNA of SoxR. Not a lot, but enough to engineer some genetic circuits. Also we performed the Golden Gate assembly for construct 1. We have all the parts for the 1-state system. Josh looked back at the paper and  found out that even at 0-voltage, the fluorescence is marginal. General consensus is that perhaps a degradation tag on the GFP would delete the bleed that might appear. An alternative is to set the zero point at -0.5 V.  Alberto, Thom and Siwat met Dr. Stephen Webster"

Hannah is in the process of building a higher efficiency Chemically Competent DH10B cell line. The higher transformation rate will help not only the team but is critical for her CBAR assembly of her construct for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Hannah also started planning and development of a secondary construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project to act as a control for the experiments.
Thursday, June 7, 2012
Kevin and Chris ran a gel to separate another component for the Multidirectional Promoters Project . One of the component did not run well on the gel. This component was amplified again with PCR. Kait and Victoria continued work on the Codon Optimization Project with the digestion of their plasmid, and subsequent gel extraction of the specific components. Hannah continued work on designing the primers for the CBAR reaction to create the control construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Hannah also prepped a culture in an attempt to get a stock culture of DH10B growing. Her goal is to create a higher efficiency Chemically Competent (CC) DH10B cell line to help her complete her CBAR for her Multiple Start Codon Project .

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Introduction
Abstract
The world consumes over 40 million kilograms of indigo annually, primarily for dyeing denim. Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process.
Industrial Dyeing Process
The world needs to dye 3 billion pairs of jeans with indigo annually. Currently, industrial dyeing uses an extensive process, first producing indigo from the petroleum product, benzene, and then solubilizing indigo to allow it to adhere to cloth. The chemicals used in the process include strong acids, strong bases, and the reducing agent sodium dithionite. The table shown below shows the NFPA diamonds for each chemical highlighting their reactivity and hazards. Given previous iGEM interest in indigo by teams Cornell , KAIST , and Chalmers , as well as the potential for a greener, biosynthetic alternative to denim dyeing, we started our project – Project Blue Genes.
Inspiration: Indigo Chemistry in Plants
Upon beginning our search for biosynthetic routes for dyeing jeans, we learned that certain species of plants produce indigo under stressed conditions. Below is polygonum tinctorium, an indigo producing plant. In the healthy, green part of the leaf, this plant naturally sequesters a toxic compound produced"

Oil Eating Bacteria Arrays
It didn’t even make the evening news this time. An oil tanker travelling from Hormuz to Virginia had collided with a rift and of course, he and his unit had been called to deal with the damages. They were a special firemen unit, specialized in the cleaning of oil. He understood how the responsibility of cleaning flammable fluids could be a fireman’s job, but it still felt weird to climb onto the red boat. “Firemen don’t belong far at sea”, his younger self would’ve said, “There are no fires in the sea”. He sighed while lifting the crates onto the ship. Nowadays, a moderate oil spill was as impactful as the fires he put out on other days: they didn’t even make the evening news.
That was thanks to the contents of the crates he carried. A faded, yellow biohazard sticker hinted at the many re-uses the crates had seen. Funny how that yellow sticker didn’t frighten him anymore, he remarked. It wasn’t before long that he and his men had loaded all the crates on the boat and they set out to where the oil tanker hit rock bottom.
A unit had been there before them. The oil drifted on the water, a huge and sticky darkness. Around the oil tanker barriers had been placed to keep the oil from spreading. Their job required them to come close to those barriers, so they steered their red ship towards them. Once arrived, he climbed on them and unscrewed the screen inside the barrier.  That used screen he would pass to a colleague, while another handed him a fresh screen"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

Local Public Engagement
In order to gain acceptance of our project, we need to allow the publics in Hong Kong to know about our project and synthetic biology. We achieved youth education on synthetic biology by our workshop, introduced participants to what synthetic biology is and induced their deeper thought on ethical issues connected to synthetic biology. Through in-campus activities, we promoted synthetic biology to our schoolmates of different majors and specialties, aroused attention to this topic. Holding outreach activities, we made our project more connected to the public, we gained opinions and so we could make improvements for the real-life practice of our project.
One day Synthetic Biocheimst workshop (4 FEB 2017)
There were around 30 students from 12 different high schools (as listed below) participated in the workshop for hand-on experience about synthetic biology experiments under our guidance.The day camp consisted of lab experiments, lectures of basics of synthetic biology and genetics as well as sharing of our project. We also discussed synthetic biology-related ethical issues. We conducted surveys before and after the workshop. It shows that students have increased understanding of synthetic biology after this workshop! Through this activity, we would like to inspire high school students’ interest in synthetic biology.

CUHK Art fair (14-15 SEP 2016)
We introduced students about synthetic biology and our project in CUHK Art fair, which is an annual carnival held in our university. We organised DIY Liquid Nitrogen Ice-cream for participants to experience science in daily life . By raising the synbio- vanilla ice cream issue to students, it allowed them to understand how science and synthetic biology is related to our everyday life. Our booth successfully aroused students’ interest in synthetic biology, many non-science students got new insights and better attitude towards synthetic biology.

At first, we used “Quickchange”, using the methylated plasmid as a template, which was extracted from E.coli, and we designed a pair of 25pb primers containing the desired mutation to amplify the DNA through PCR, and we got the demethylated plasmids. Finally, we treated the products with Dpn1, which was specific for methylated DNA and was used to digest the parental DNA template and selected for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. And we used the method of thermal stimulation to transform it into E.coli.
But we didn’t we get the positive clone of the plasmid. And we thought as a result of the characteristics of the promoter structure, viewing it from the secondary structure, there appears a cervical-loop structure. Also a mutation site just appears in the loop, which results in primers having a comparatively long homologous region. So the complementary pairing occurs between upstream and downstream primer, forming primer dimer, which lead PCR amplification to failure.
2. Digestion and ligation—plan B
To avoid forming the cervical-loop structure, we gave up the one-step mutation approach. Instead, we designed the mutation on the primers and planned to construct the testing circuit through the traditional digestion and ligation.
We designed random primers containing NNNNNN in -35 region.
Through PCR amplification, we purified the PCR product. We used DpnI to digest the template. Constructed the fragment on the vector pSB1C3, we transformed the ligation product into E.coli TOP10. After incubation at 37℃for 16h, we observed the formation of single clone.
Through colony PCR, we selected the clone on the plate and had successfully got the positive clones. To facilitate the characterization of promoter strength, we constructed circuits containing rfp. The whole length is 923bp, counting the region between VF and VR, the positive length should be over 1000. Results shown in Fig.1.

But what was different from the usual was that they found that the students from College of Life Science, Beijing Normal University became their teachers. Our team members organized a supporting teaching team with the cooperation of Youth League Committee of our school. Except the regular lessons, the most important thing is to combine the knowledge with the practical problem in order to cultivate the interest in science especially in life science. We held a series of extra-curricular activities such as scientific knowledge competitions to enrich their after-school life. Though we only tought them for one week, the children are familiar with us very quickly and they became more positive and optimistic under the influence of us. They are full of hope towards future.
The education in China is out of balance. In the east coastal city of China, the education is advanced while the education is not very consummate in the west of China. This is because the transportation is not convenient and the economy isn’t developed enough. In order to let them contact with the wonderful world outside mountains and broaden their horizons, we want to enlighten their thoughts and their ways of thinking. What’s more, we hope to cultivate their passion for science as well as the responsibility for the society.

Appendix the summary of interviewing Dr.Yan Houfu.
Interviewer: Is there any act aiming at the biological security in our country?
Yan: In China, there are two kinds of acts on biological security. One is about the invasion of alien species. Another is about the issue of genetically modified organisms. And there are relevant laws, administrative regulations and other related policies about transgenic organisms on various levels.
In 1993, the State Science and Technology Commission (known as the current Ministry of Science and Technology) formulated the first regulation in China on the biological safety that is still effective now. The second law about the issue of genetically modified organisms (GM organisms) was the Seed Law formulated in 2000. The article 14 prescribed that “ the selection, experiment, verification and popularization of transgenic plant verities shall be subject to security assessment, and strict security control measures shall be taken. The relevant departments of the State Council shall formulate the specific implementation measures and approaches.”
The Chinese government takes a strict look at biological products, including transgenic products, and requires the labeling of GM food. The article 69 of the Food Safety Law which was just revised in 2015 formulated that “the production and operation of GM food should be labeled according to the law.” This law will be implemented on October 1st.

We started our collaborations together with 2014 Aalto-Helsinki team, as we helped students from Stockholm in launching their own team. Indeed, we had a close relationship with Stockholm, including regular Skype sessions and a visit to their lab and universities. We also took part in the amazing Nordic iGEM Conference, organized by teams from Stockholm and Uppsala in July. We skyped with various teams including Pasteur, Edinburgh, Slovenia, and Dundee, discussing our projects and exchanging ideas. Additionally, we helped a dozen iGEM teams by answering their questionnaires.
Communicating and collaborating in iGEM - The HumHub Report
iGEM teams have both internal communication and communication to the broader iGEM community. Currently this communication is spread over various channels, mostly different social media websites. However, many of these sites are not accessible for a significant portion of iGEM teams, especially those coming from China. On social media iGEM content is also easily lost in the flood of other information. To solve this issue, Stockholm team put up an iGEM collaboration platform, HumHub, including communication and integration of tools such as the BioBrick Seeker. Together with them, we wrote a report on how we used the platform and what we felt were its pros and cons.

Question 4
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Teams should strictly abide by regulations of the laboratory. Characters and functions of parts ,devices and systems should be documented in detail online so that they could be referred to if in need. Thus it could be safer.

- Notes:
Heating the elution buffer to 55°C prior to loading on the column can slightly increase yields.
Similarly, doing the elution in two steps (first a 30 μL elution and then a 20 μL dilution) can also slightly increase yields.
6. Restriction Digest
When using parts for 3A assembly, or testing the quality of a part you'll need to run a restriction digest. We recommend using the following protocols. estimated time: 30 min. active, 50 min. incubation
- Prepare this materials below:
• Ice and bucket/container
• (1) 8-tube strip, or (3) 0.6ml thin-walled tubes
• BioBrick Part in BioBrick plasmid (Purified DNA, > 16ng/uL)
• dH2O
• NEB Buffer 2
• BSA
• Restriction Enzymes: EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI
• Thermal cycler
- Keep all materials on ice
- For single reaction, add 250ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 16uL
- Add 2.5ul of NEBuffer 2
- Add 0.5ul of BSA
- Add 0.5ul of EcoRI
- Add 0.5ul of PstI
- There should be a total volume of 20ul. Mix well and spin down briefly.
- Incubate the restriction digest at 37C for 30min, and then 80C for 20min to heat kill the enzymes. We incubate in a thermal cycler with a heated lid
- Run a portion of the digest on a gel (8ul, 100ng), to check that both plasmid backbone and part length are accurate.
7. Ligation
After growing up a part from a distribution or request, you'll want to miniprep it. At iGEM HQ, we use the following protocol.
After following our restriction digest protocol (which uses 250ng of DNA) you may follow these steps for ligation.
- Add 2ul of digested plasmid backbone (25 ng)
- Add equimolar amount of EcoRI-HF SpeI digested fragment (< 3 ul"

Figure 1 Sequence alignment of MerR and PbrR. MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases of heavy metals.
Nature has evolved numerous such regulating proteins to control the concentrations of beneficial or toxic metal ions with extraordinary sensitivity and selectivity.[1] As is known, the MerR family is a group of transcriptional activators with similar N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding regions and C-terminal effector binding regions that are specific to the effector recognized.[2] The majority of regulators in the family respond to environmental stimuli, such as oxidative stress, heavy metals or antibiotics. A subgroup of the family activates transcription in response to metal ions. This subgroup shows sequence similarity in the C-terminal effector binding region as well as in the N-terminal region. PbrR is a MerR family protein found in Ralstonia metallidurans CH34, a bacterium specifically adapted to survive under toxic heavy metal environment. The PbrR protein is responsible for regulation of lead(II) efflux pumps involved in lead detoxification inside R. Metallidurans.
Due to the highly conserved homology of protein MerR and PbrR (Fig.1), we were able to apply the strategy used for MerR engineering to the development of lead bioabsorbent. Based on the crystal structure study of MerR, the metal binding domain of PbrR was recognized by sequence alignment with MerR.(Fig 2) [3] Further, 3D structure was also conducted.(Fig3)
Figure 2 Pb binding domain predicted by sequence alignment. Three Cys-residues located at 79,114,123 specifically binds Pb(II) ions by forming a metal binding pocket.
Then we designed PbrR metal binding peptide, with consisted of two tandem duplications of α-helix 5 linked by a flexible linker, SSG, and followed by a short peptide sequence.(Fig 4) These direct tandem α-helices fold back on each other into an antiparallel, coiled-coil hairpin. Three Cys-residues located at 79,114,123 specifically binds Pb(II) ions by forming disulfide bonds within the engineered dimer.

Clotho application: Circuit List and TTEC
We transplant the software into Clotho and the name of the application is Circuit List. Since Clotho is a popular framework in synthetic biology, many people can experience our standard and software. The database is the same as the online one and the information is the same as the online one. We also transplanted TTEC, which is the last year iGEM software into Clotho, which is promoted by iGEM.

Human practice
We mainly did some human practice about publicity of synthetic biology so that more people can know what synthetic biology is, what iGEM is and what our standard and software is. Some workshop meetings were made to support other teams and get help from other teams. We also made a survey concerned with ethic issues in synthetic biology.

HokkaidoU_Japan,2010,Team:HokkaidoU Japan#Projects_-_-_TEXT.html,"tosol of RK13. In contrast in [B-4] and [C-4] you cannot see GFP in the cytosol (Fig.8). In (A’) you can find that GFP is located in the shape of the cytosol more clearly. In fact GFP began to diffuse in the cytosol 4 hrs after the exposure (data not shown). However, GFP didn’t localize into the nucleus against our expectation even 7.5 hrs after exposure.
Discussion
   According to the results it can be suggested that SPI-2 encoded T3SS can inject a heterologous protein(GFP) from outside of the target cell even if it is cloned onto the heterologous host E. coli (K-12) and that injected GFP was functional in the target cell. In the process of our project, even if the E. coli is prepared under acidic pH condition, GFP was not injected into RK13 when the exposure step is performed under neutral pH condition (data not shown), suggesting that acidic pH is required for exposure step to use this system. By the way GFP didn’t localize into the nucleus against our expectation. So, NLS domain might not be able to function correctly in the GFP fusion protein constructed this time.
Possible Future Plans
Collect quantitative and chronological data.
Clone the [T3signal-NLS-GFP] construct on a mammalian expressing vector to check the behavior of this fusion protein expressed inside of RK13.
Join NLS with the C-terminal of GFP.

We took these strains and we plate them from the liquid media to some agar plate and then we re sequenced them to make sure they are the same as those previously tested.
So as shows this histogram, we have some good results with E.coli K12 (a strain known to degrade Quercetin but in a different pathway as Pseudomonas Putida.
The strains B1 and B2 are strains that were taken from Anthocyanin degradation assay.

The inoculation was the same as last assay (500ul of overnight culture).
The important thing to notice is that the strains 96, 97, 98, 99, 102, 103, 104 were taken from M9 Quercetin Plate.
We were expecting a degradation...
One reason of this failure maybe that the overnight culture were not enough fresh. Indeed, we had some troubles to organize ourself to test so many strains.
Some overnight culture were 5 days old when we assayed them.
In fact, our 6 incubators are all busy because of the assay, so we have to wait until one is free to begin the assay.
We will organize ourself better next time to avoid this kind of problem.
For this assay we had one contamination and also no degradation from the other strains.
In this experiment we tested also the strains from F1 to F8 that were isolated on Quercetin plate. As you can see, only F4 give a good result with the liquid experiment.
Strains 118 to 136 come from non selective plate (LB agar, Tryptic Soy Agar, M9 agar)
For this experiment, we tested also 5 E. coli strains that were designed by the Protein group to express some enzyme responsible for Anthocyane degradation. We had no results with these strains but there is maybe a problem of enzyme secretion. We should restart the experiment with cell extract.
Week 26th September-2th October
For this experiments, the strains come from Australia. We isolated them on non selective agar plate.
Fungal identification
The standard sequence used to identify fungi is the ITS sequence. Amplify it we need to purify fungal DNA then do a PCR with ITS 1 and ITS 4 primer. Fungal DNA purification
We tried to purify fungal DNA, the experiment failed because at a moment open tubes fall and the fungal DNA was lost.

Stimulated Plastic Enzymolysis
Background
Since completely synthetic plastic materials came out in 1900s, it was used more and more extensively due to its cheapness and durability. Nowadays, plastics has covered our lives in many areas. However, it is slow to degrade, which has led to serious plastic pollution.
Plastic reduction efforts have occurred in some areas in attempts to reduce plastic consumption and pollution and promote plastic recycling. Scientists have come up with many methods in order to solve white pollution, such as landfill, incineration and chemical decomposition. It is a good idea to degrade plastics by enzymes. Compared with the traditional physical and chemical methods, it costs lower power and is more environmental. However, biological method has much lower degradation efficiency. Therefore, improving the efficiency of biological plastic degradation has no time to delay.
Plastic degradation is not only of vital importance for solving environmental pollution. For example, enzymatic recycling of PET basically would break down the polymer into its building blocks ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TA), which have a high value and can be reused in chemical synthesis, including the production of PET. This would avoid current limitations in plastic recycling, which requires pure plastic fractions or has to fight with enrichment of contaminants [1]. At the same time, it provides a new method for plastic surface modification, making it possible for applying finishing compounds and coloring agents.
Figure 9. The reaction of plastic degradation
Among all kinds of plastics, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plays a major role. It is the most commonly used synthetic fiber (25 million tonnes produced annually worldwide) and is forecasted to account for almost 50% of all fiber materials in 2008[2]. PET hydrolysis can be achieved by enzymes from distinct classes, such as esterases, lipases, and cutinases, the latter thereby yielding the most promising results [3]. Hence, we choose three kinds of cutinases for our project – FsC (Fusarium solani cutinase), LC (leaf-branch compost cutinase) and Thc_Cut1 (Thermobifida cellulosilytica cutinase). Especially, FsC was used and by TU_Darmstadt in 2012 iGEM, and LC by UC_Davis in 2012 iGEM.
Our Goal
1. Stimulate PET hydrolysis by FsC, LC and Thc_Cut1 with addition of four kinds of Janus"

Team
The team from Tsinghua University is comprised of undergraduates from the School of Life Sciences.
This year we want to exploit the value of E. Coli that is often overlooked, piggy-backing the metabolites as they come across.
More...
Project
This project is aimed to generate several E. Coli strains which will cooperate with each other to move forth and back and transport any desired protein along a gradient. Module composition: binding, releasing, transition, movement...
More...
Parts
We built a host of parts during our project. The idea is that after every small step, we store our sequence as a biobrick part.
This strategy marks our progress and facilitates future use of these sequences.
More...
Experiment
Our experiments are carefully recorded on a daily basis. Through the series of records, we can see our joys and sorrows.
Besides, we made the records for the purpose that our experiments can be repeated one day by someone else, thus contributing to the exploration of the unknown.
More...
Cooperation
Cooperative atmosphere is filled in our project.
We resorted to Tsinghua-A iGEM Team while building our mathematical models. On the other hand, we spared no effort helping other teams with their wet labs. We helped XMU Team with their parts building and helped verified the shuttle vector of NYMU.
More...
Protection & Publicity
As far as wet lab is concerned, safety and protection is of the highest priority. We highly valued safety in all our operations and made a detailed safety brochure.
We also devoted efforts to publicize synthetic biology. The teams in China held a summer meetup to discuss our progress and share our resources. We also invited the former team leader of PKU to give a seminar on synthetic biology and iGEM competition.

Explain the oscillations that are occuring in the output amplification model.
Research stiff differential equations.
Research on receptor (especially MAP kinase).
Finalise results for amplification model.
Prepare presentation.
During the meeting it was decided that we should test amplificiation model for its sensitivity to change of parameter values. This is to determine the key parameters to be measured in the lab.
Discuss the experiments for amplification module further.
Start on modelling the protein display on cell surface.
Completion
The task is accomplished. However, unexplained oscillations are observed for some specific values.
We got rid of the oscillations in our model (by using ode15s instead of ode45).
Presentation ready.
Reading on stiff equations done.
Key sensitive parameters determined.
Experiments initially discussed with Chris.
Further consult on experiments for determining parameters needed for modelling with James and Wolf.
Initial thought for a protein display model implemented in MatLab.

Objectives
Test the protein display model and find to what kind of values it's sensitive to.
Define the control volume around the bacterial cell.
Start on testing the model.
We realised that it would be worth adding the last step (colour production by dioxygenase) into our amplfication models.
We need to finalise testing and formulation of certain assumptions regarding the amplfication (cell death in particular).
Consider helping RMIT- Australia in modelling.
Keep exploring the prospective solutions to our system going unstable.
Try to implement the last bit of amplification in TinkerCell. Maybe it will deal with it well.
Completion
We couldn't reach the testing as the first model ""Display 1"" was simulating reactions as if the were taking place inside the bacterial cell while in reality the take place outside. Then we hit an issue of defining the size of volume around the cell. We didn't manage to resolve that problem today.
Control volume defined.
Testing of model done.
Protein model pretty much finalised.
The colour production almost complete, however complications were encountered regarding the cell death (colour compound slowly kills cells).
Basically we're stuck: scaling didn't help neither did trying idfferent solvers.
Meeting with Matthieu gave us some prospective solutions that we can explore.
Alternatively we can have a look at SimBiology or MatCont.
Helping RMIT: their request is for protein engineering simulation - we cannot do that
We know how to use the ''splinetool'' in Matlab.
Specifying the time span helps to reduce the simulation time.
Model was implemented in TinkerCell.

Our Parts
We truly believe in the iGEM ethos of maintaining a Registry of Parts of constantly improving BioBricks and feel that, while creating new entirely new BioBricks is required for the registry to grow, the further characterisation and improvement of BioBricks that already exist is the key to maintaining the registry's credibility.

Lack of specificity is a problem which many of the parts in the parts registry suffer from, and certainly a challenge which we faced when trying to detect nitrogenous species. From this potential problem spawned a potential solution; the Comparator Circuit. The two BioBricks form a pair which are designed to specifically bind to each other while ligated to two different promoters"

OUTREACH KITS: UCHICAGO & ILLINOIS
We collaborated with the University of Chicago and University of Illinois teams in the creation of an Outreach kit to be used by future iGEM teams. Interestingly enough, we were first contacted by UChicago through our blog! Although mainly used as a tool for communication within our own team, it has also provided us with the opportunities to work with other teams. Further details regarding our outreach kits can be found HERE .
AiF MEET-UPS: ALBERTA & LETHBRIDGE
We also had a chance to work with the University of Alberta and University of Lethbridge teams during our regional team meet-ups.  At the Lethbridge Presentation Skills and Wiki workshop, we were able to spend a couple hours helping each other with various Wiki issues.  The Lethbridge team for example, had a problem with using images as links, and Mandy was able to help them correct the code for this. Both Alberta and Lethbridge teams were able to help us figure out some issues with our CSS coding. The meet ups were also a chance for teams to critique each others' projects and presentations, which was very beneficial in the shaping of our final projects. For more information on the Alberta regional team meetups, visit our overview HERE .
ETHICS SURVEYS & OTHER PARTS: VALENCIA, TUDELFT, & UNIPV-PAVIA
We also helped a few teams with their ethical surveys.  Our whole team participated in the Valencia Synthetic Biology Ethics survey, becoming the largest team to have all members complete it. A few of our team members also helped out the TUDelft team by completing their Ethics survey. For more details on the Valencia team survey in particular, please click HERE .
Finally, we helped out the UNIPV-Pavia team by sending them plasmid of one of the parts that we sequenced last year (Bbapart #) as they were having problems with the DNA from the Registry.

JUDGING FORM
Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

But between the mCherry and PET-ase part is a linker. The reason for adding a linker is to put space between each part to make sure they do their function without crushing each other or inhibiting each other’s functions. Following the PET-ase is the second terminator of the construct to ensure there is an end for the protein and it is not continuous.
BBa_K2650003: BsIA mCHERRY
This construct has the same base as all of the other constructs (2 transcription terminators, Bacillus promoter, and the ribosome binding site), but this construct has the addition of mCherry and hydrophobins (BsIA)(BBa_K2650003) which is also a composite part. At the start of the construct is the first transcription terminator followed by the Bacillus promoter and the ribosome binding site. After the ribosome binding site is the secretion tag SSLipA and the BsIA (hydrophobins). After the BsIA is a linker between BsIA and the mCherry. The linker is in the construct to ensure that their functions are not inhibited by each other and to allow correct folding. Followed by mCherry is the second transcription terminator to end the process. The purpose of this construct is essentially to test the fluorescence of the mCherry and whether adding hydrophobins will help with the adherence/its binding properties, to the PET plastic.
BBa_K2650002:  PET-ase
BBa_K2650002 and BBa_K2650004 (click for full size)
This construct consists of two transcription terminators, a promoter, a ribosome binding site, and our optimized DNA coding region for the PET hydrolase enzyme. At the start of the of the construct, there is the first transcription terminator followed by a Bacillus subtilis promoter. The reason the B. subtilis promoter is in the construct is due to the fact that the DNA construct will go into Bacillus Subtilis because of its natural ability to produce hydrophobins and it is better at secreting proteins compared to the traditional E-Coli. Following the Bacillus subtilis promoter, the next part is a ribosome binding site and a SSLipA secretion tag. The SSLipA is added to the construct as it signals to the bacteria to secrete the proteins.

Human Practices
We have engaged the general public and specifically the next generation of academics, scientists and lawmakers of the opportunities of synthetic biology.
We have, together with the danish organization Biotech Academy’s Biosensor project, made a free kit that will be distributed to high schools (see more here ).
Danish legislation is strict on synthetic biology, and it is not possible for high school students to make their own plasmid modifications. We have thus done the plasmid purification for them thereby enabling them to get hands-on experience with synthetic biology at their local school  - while still prioritizing safety and respecting the regulations of the law.
We tested a simplified version of this kit at our biobrick tutorial where we invited iGEM teams from the Nordic countries: Danish, Swedish and Norwegian teams (see biobrick tutorial for more)
We have further engaged and initiated the public into the opportunities of synthetic biology through our events, lectures and our outreach activities on social media platforms.
We are being published in DTU avisen and The technologist (next issue in January). A documentary is being made about our project, where the iGEM work and our daily efforts are being documented. The documentary is filmed and edited by documentarist: Jeppe Mølgaard. For a more detailed walk through of our Human Practices, please refer to the dedicated Human Practices section of the site.

Synthetic Biology @ Sheffield
An investigation into the questions, expectations and fears around Synthetic Biology across Faculties at Sheffield University.
Lara Grew - Department of MBB
Academic supervisor: Dr Susan Molyneux-Hodgson, Department of Sociological Studies
This project was funded by the SURE scheme at Sheffield University.
Background
Synthetic biology is a relatively new technology, based on the application of engineering principles to biology and genetic modification. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) recently (2012) published a paper looking into the opinions held by the British public regarding this technology, while the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars commissioned a similar research project (2013) to be conducted within America. The UK Synthetic Biology Dialogue offers an insight into the concerns and expectations surrounding synthetic biology in particular, but in the context of other contemporary genetic and biological technologies. The aims of the SURE research were to compare the findings of the Dialogue to those based on a similar range of questions asked within the University of Sheffield, across subject areas.
The research ran alongside the iGEM competition, an international event founded by MIT in which undergraduate and postgraduate teams from around the world compete to produce biological systems based on synthetic biological approaches. Working with the Sheffield University team proved invaluable in providing a greater scientific and ethical context from which to undertake this project.
Basing this task firmly within the University of Sheffield offered the chance to compare the opinions of those within different social and economic backgrounds (as established within the Synthetic Biology Dialogue) to those of members of the University staff who have an established level of education (albeit not regarding biology) and certain social status.

3. Best Practice Requirement
In the USA, to obtain a patent, an inventor must reveal the best way to practice the invention in the patent application. They cannot keep an essential part secret. However, in Europe, no such requirement exists, inventors just have to provide one way to practice the invention, regardless of how sub-optimal it is.
4. Patent Publication
In both the USA and Europe, patents are published 18 months after they are filed, regardless of whether or not they are to be granted.
5. Rights Conferred and Opposition
Once a patent has been granted in the USA, it is a property right that prevents anyone from making, selling, or using the patented invention in the entire USA. A patented granted by the European Patent Office grants these same rights in the 27 countries signed up to the European Patent Convention. However, if a party wishes to get a patent annulled in those countries, they must approach each country individually to dispute the patent (after 9 months has passed after granting), whereas the USA has one office to handle disputes throughout the country. If a patent is challenged at the EPO within 9 months of granting, the patent holder and challenger present arguments to the EPO in writing and orally before a final decision is made. If a patent is challenged in the USA, a re-examination procedure is initiated at the patent office, where any parties (not just the challenger) can present evidence to dispute the patent. However, once this evidence has been gathered, only the patent holder discusses the validity of the patent with the patent office directly.
6. Inventive Step
The most important part of the patent application is the evidence of a novel inventive step. This holds for both the European patent system, and the USA. However, the European system is much stricter in its interpretation of a novel inventive step, in that to be inventive, it must solve a technical problem in a non-obvious way, i.e. no problem solved = no inventive step; not technical (e.g. economic) = no inventive step.

Plld+lysis and pSB1A3 cut yesterday with E+P was investigated on gel. Two fragments were obtained for Plld+lysis, but the sizes of the fragments were not as expected. Since we are not sure which fragment is which, both of the fragments were cut out of the gel and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. In case one of them is uncut plasmid, the unligated DNA from both bonds will be transformed tomorrow, and we will assume that if the cells transformed with DNA from one of the samples won't grow, that sample will contain digested plasmid. This sample will be ligated with pSB1A3, plated out on a ampicillin plate, and then, several cell cultures from this plate will be plated out on a chloramphenicol plate. The colonies that won't grow on chloramphenicol, is assumed to contain the correct plasmid.

UIUC_Illinois,2015,Team:UIUC Illinois#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of our project ideas using SCRIBE. After researching different storage capabilities using synbio, we realized that SCRIBE truly did have merit, and could possibly be a tool that our iGEM progeny could use!
Defining the Problem
We are all comfortable with how modern memory works using computers. Memory is stored as binary bits: 0’s and 1’s. We call this digital memory, and biologists can implement synthetic digital memory to store bits of information. Two main methods are epigenetic-based devices and recombinase-based devices. Both incorporate digital information, however we aim to introduce an analog set up for “tape-recording” memories.
Epigenetic switches
Epigenetic switches typically record binary bits through expression levels - 0 referring to no expression and 1 referring to expression. Epigenetic memory devices have a few problems however. They require orthogonal transcription factors, and they can lose their state due to fluctuations in the environment or because the cell dies
Recombinase
Recombinase-based switches are different than epigenetic switches in that they are able to record data directly into the DNA of the cell. Binary bits are represented by the orientation of large stretches of DNA. However, recombinase-based switches fail to utilize the full recording power of DNA, because they require tedious engineering of these recombination sites in advance, and hundreds of basepairs are used to record a single bit. We see that the recording capacity of these devices is exhausted within a few hours. Furthermore, the scalability of these devices is limited by the number of orthogonal recombinases that exist as well. Enter SCRIBE In an attempt to address the current limitations in current biological systems, Dr. Fahim Farzadfard and Dr. Timothy Lu from MIT developed SCRIBE: an inducible process for creating and inserting single-stranded DNA into a host’s genome.
Introduction:
The idea of introducing robust and practical cellular memory systems is an attractive one in the synthetic biology community due to the large storage capacity of DNA, along with its ability to maintain recorded states over long periods of time. The ability to record a cell's encountered states lends itself to sophisticated synthetic biology applications in which a cell can autonomously make complex decisions based on past events, accurately and precisely record environmental conditions for later usage by itself or researchers, and many more.[1]
Unfortunately, contemporary memory devices that autonomously function in vivo are heavily lacking in their storage capacity, along with intrinsic barriers which hinder scalability. These devices require orthogonal transcription factors or recombinases, and are either unable to maintain their epigenetic, digital state in a noisy cellular"

Checking concentration of the dope from last Thursday
We aliquoted 100 uL to check the dry weight
11 mg in 100 uL
that's 11% wt/vol... which decreased
In addition, the dope has started gelling at the bottom of the tube
I think the dope is a lost cause. We'll have to do a new concentration dialysis.
Preparing HFIP dope
75 mg lyophilized silk in 268 uL of HFIP for a 28% w/v dope
Our procedure for dissolving the dope DIRECTLY IN THE SYRINGE
Prepare a tube apparatus with a tube that was already clogged. This will serve as the syringe ""stopper."" Add the stopper to the syringe luer lock
Cut the lyophilized silk into small pieces
Place the silk pieces into the syringe
pipette in the HFIP volume
Dip the plunger tip into HFIP
insert the plunger into the syringe body
invert the syringe, then push the plunger to purge some of the dead air. Ensure that ALL silk pieces are covered by the HFIP
Wait for HFIP to dissolve the silk. Periodically remove the stopper. This will allow bubbles to form and escape.
Some of our observations on this protocol:
push silk to the bottom of the syringe as you add the pieces. DON'T let the silk get densely packed!
cut the silk into the smallest pieces that you can
Don't drop any pieces!"

This second-generation PAH can reintegrate the pathway at the previous step thanks to a low substrate specificity of E3.
B. The bio-filter substructure for the PAHs degrading enzymes
The physical support of our bio-filter structure will be composed of spider silk. The proteins forming spider silk are MaSp1 and MaSp2 from the major spindroin structure of Euprosthenops australis. Among these proteins only one has been gene synthesized and expressed in E. coli: S1, a recombinant form of MaSp1 (BBa_K2198005). The fibers will be fastened to any kind of physical support (plastics, resin, metal, glass, wood, concrete…) through mussel proteins (Mfp2, Mfp3, Mfp4, Mfp5, Mfp6) from Mytilus californianus.
The first part of the structure will be a fusion protein between Mfp5 and S1. Subsequent members of the chain will be assembled as a mix of this fusion and polymers with free S1. S1 is also designed in a form with streptavidin called S2f. Termination of the polymerization process will be ensured by this S2f protein fusion in a random way, yielding a statistical mix of chain lengths. When all components are available by gene synthesis, they will be assembled in polymer forms using the appropriate buffer. A final capping with individually biotinylated-enzymes (E1, E2, E3, E4) will provide the link between the scaffold and our purifying components: the enzymes themselves (See Figure 3).
The bio-material we have designed is composed of several proteins with distinct roles (Figure 3). On the surface is present the enzymes allowing the degradation of pollutants. Then we have a structural support for the enzymes, the spider silk protein. The spider silk polymer is linked to the enzymes by a streptavidin-biotin complex. Finally, our material can bind to many surfaces thanks to a mussel protein (S1fM1) connected to the silk (S1) by a flexible linker.

We decided to have the carrier for: reducing the loss; improving transport efficiency; targeting the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment to some extent. And why CNC? Trap Termites (termites love woods); High biodegradable and biocompatible; Achieve self-assemble esaily; Easily available and economical.
Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. These experiments helped us to understand the cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device with the function of monitoring and terminating for better achieving.
GOAL AND BUSINESS PLAN
TERMITE TERMINATOR aims to kill the whole nest of Coptotermes formosanus. Our project will be started from Zhejiang province and finally to China even more countries. Nests are terminated and could save people‘s life and numerous economic and wood resources losses.
The major working area is started in particular environment such as houses and some historical sites. Once area is limited, it become much more easier for us to control and considering safety points. And also, could cut down costs.
In the following ten years, if possible, it could acheive mass production of TERMITE TERMINATOR and could be widely used with our designed devices. Factory is the base and during improvements as well as experiments, social users data is collected for further promotion and perfection.
CONTEXT AND APPLICATION
Forest protection agency
Economic forest plays an important role in human's world. It provides people with raw materials of construction, food, medicine and industry. Thus, there is a group of people working in the forest protection agency to take care of these trees. But what make them stressfol is that the forest regions are always inhabited by termites. Trees that destroyed by termites will lost their economic value. What's more, termites have tenacious vitality and will soon spread through the forest. They are always one of the toughest problem for those forest keepers.
In order to get rid of termites in the whole economic forest region, the forest protection agency contact ZJUTT. Technical staff will go to the forest for field trips to evaluate the severity. With the map and other information that the agency provided, ZJUTT will draw up a plan with the optimum locations for killing devices placement. Tree keepers together with company technicians will bring the device to the place. Calcolated amount of food have been beforehand put into the device. After a period of time technicians will come again to check if one more dose or a new plan is needed."

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.
Dynamics of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz"
METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," the name of the group, designer and contact information, along with     the comments from the group on the parts they have submitted. Contact     information is especially important for iGEM as other groups who need     extra information about the available part can reach to the required     information. Even though contacting with the designers of the individual     parts which are available is highly encouraged by iGEM, unavailability     of contact information points at out the fact that iGEM’s parts registry     needs strong re-organization in order to serve to the synthetic biology     community properly.
Additionally, the “group favorite” and “starRating” fields are also     important for individual evaluation of the parts, which doesn’t get     the deserved attention from the iGEM groups. “Group Favorite” defines     the confidence on the part by the designer group. “StarRating” defines     the related part in terms of popularity and usage efficiency among the     groups. According to our observations, most groups are not aware of     either of the fields or they are used incorrectly or ineffectively.     For example for a part with a full reporter which is known to be functional     and gives precise and expected results the StarRating should be at least     2 stars, but for most of the parts in 2010 distribution, it is very     difficult to observe a part whose “StarRating” is above one. For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioMembrane Elastin_-_-_TEXT.html,", in case some particular component of the specific procedure was responsible for the difficulties, resulted in a smear potentially indicative of nonspecific binding. Ultimately, brute force identified two candidates from Gibson assembly with perfect sequence-verified ligation regions but deletions in the middle of the sequence, likely from initial synthesis or mutation. One of these had only a single G deletion; however, the repetitive nature of the sequence made site directed mutagenesis (SDM) seem an unlikely candidate. Elastin synthesis was temporarily relegated to the back burner. Trevor! Kalkus, one of our mentors, believed that SDM primers could provide the necessary specificity to correct the defect, and assisted with design of primers and execution of the process. Unfortunately, no corrected candidate was identified in either of two rounds of SDM after sequencing multiple resultant colonies. Ultimately, the result of this project was a densely nested folder containing 245 sequence files with increasingly confused folder names. While the particular assembly approach was clearly not optimal, the lack of results to date does not invalidate the design work done or the concept. Obviously, a smoother cloning process would have been ideal.
Salvage
Fortunately, all was not lost. Some of the collagen constructs contain N-terminal elastin cross-linking domains. Although this was not intentional and largely an artifact of other design concerns, the particular design of the circular elastin part allows for insertion of a coding sequence with an N-terminal elastin cross-linking domain, producing as many as ten or more repeats of this sequence concatenated together. While this construct, BBa_K2027046 may not produce any functional fibers, it contains a number of tags for both purification and sensitive detection of protein production. The longer region to be circularized may result in lower circularization yields, but any protein produced should be much easier to manipulate. This allows some characterization of the circularization device while avoiding the problem of the deletion, located within the coding region being replaced.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Journal#MeS#wetlab_-_-_TEXT.html,"BBa_J45700). In this experiment 4 sets were used with termperature and incubation time as variables. The first set was conducted at room temperature for 24 hours, the second set was incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours, the third was incubated in 37ºC for 8 hours, the last one was carried out at room temperature for 8 hours. In each set, we inoculated our brick BBa_K1060003 with IPTG, IPTG + salicylate (concentration ranges from 0.01mM to 1mM), and IPTG + chorismate (concentration ranges from 0.01mM to 1mM), the same was done for the MIT 2006 brick BBa_J45700. These combinations of additives were also introduced in parallel for a negative control (non-MS producing E.Coli).
We had 11 people participating in the blind test. After the test we calculated the percentage of people who smelled MS. Based on the percentage, we can conclude that the smell was stronger after 24 hours incubation time compared to 8 hours. Incubating the bacteria in 37 degrees enhanced the production compared to incubation at room temperature. Another effect is a more obvious smell in the epps where 0.1mM or 1mM salicylate was added. In addition, the effect of adding chorismate became clearer after 24 hours. The reason why chorismate requires more time to see the effect may lie in the fact that chorismate is the very first precursor of the methyl salicylate production pathway, whereas salyciate is a precursor one step before methyl salicylate.
Most importantly we can conclude that our brick worked in terms of producing methyl salicylate.

Week 15 & 16: More & More Characterisation
We Performed both a Headspace gass chromatography and a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). With the Headspace GC MeS could be detected at 12.832 minutes but only when salicylic acid was added. In the GC-MS no MeS was detected in the controle sample (BL21) but in both other samples MeS was present. For the sample without addition of SA, just a small amount of MeS could be observed.

Overview
Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body, and it is the second most common cause of death worldwide, leading to 14 million new cases and over 8 million deaths per year [1] . Besides, The financial costs of treating cancer were estimated at 1.16 trillion US dollars per year as of 2010. It has become one of the great challenges human is facing nowadays.
Fig.1 Death from cancer per million persons in 2012
In order to conquer this serious problem, many medical scientists are devoted to exploit medicines that can target cancer cells. In 1962, paclitaxel was discovered in the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, giving the name “paclitaxel”. Shortly after its discovery, taxanes have demonstrated a unique ability to palliate the symptoms of many types of advanced cancers, including carcinoma of the ovary, lung, head, neck, bladder, and esophagus. Good efficacy and little side effect quickly made the taxane class a most common addition to the chemotherapy against cancer in the past several decades.
Fig.2  Ball-and-stick model of the taxol
The great commercial success of Paclitaxel and other anti-microtubule medicines has inspired pharmaceutical companies to extract and test similar compounds, farmers to grow related plants. So an effective method is being needed urgently to discover many other similar compounds. Moreover, testing the concentration of paclitaxel from fermentation broths or plants are in high demand.
How to test the taxol and screening other compounds?
We determine to use microtubule for assisting.
As we all know, the mechanism of taxol is to kill cancer cells by obstructing the function of microtubule and consequently blocking cell division. Microtubules are a kind of important cellular structure composed of two monomers: α-tubulin and β-tubulin. These hollow rod shaped proteins are required for many cellular activities including cell division and transportation. ["

According to the results, FourU element works very well and the leak of its control is little. So the expression of PⅧ could be regulated by FourU element tightly when sensing temperature.
Test the response of FourU element to temperature changes from 30°C to 37 °C
After further verifying the working effect of FourU element, we tested the response of FourU element to temperature changes from 30°C to 37 °C, for simulating the 3rd phase of our temperature control process. We cultured both the positive control and experimental bacteria at 30°C for 30h, and change the culture temperature to 37°C, and then test the fluoresce intensity of RFP protein after 1h, 2h and 3h. The result are as follows.
<img src=""
""style=""width:700px;margin-left:0px""></a>
According to the results,after the bacteria shifted from 30°C to 37°C for 3h, the expression of RFP protein raise dramatically, that means FourU element shows a rapid response to temperature changes from 30°C to 37 °C. So under our temperature control, the expression of PⅧ could be rich enough for the generation and release of M13 phage offspring rapidly after the temperature shifted to 37°C.
Construction of inducible mRFP expression with RNAT-fourU element
Considering of the different interaction strength of ligand and receptor in the selection process achieved by B2H system, we construct the plasmid in which mRFP expression regulated by FourU element under an inducible promoter, for using different concentration of inducer to simulate different interaction strength of ligand and receptor. Avoiding destructing the structure of RNAT, we choose the araBAD promoter induced by L-arabinose, whose operon are in the upstream of promoter. In the 2014 distribution of biobricks, we found the parts of the promoter: arabinose C (AraC) with Promoter C (PC) (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13458 "">BBa_I13458</a>) and PBad (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13453 "">BBa_I13453</a>) modified by MIT in 2005, and integrated"

https://2015.igem.org/Team:UCLA/Project/Protein_Cages Protein Cages]
The goal of our project is to modify a protein cage such that disassembly can be induced by thrombin protease. Our protein cage is a previously-created synthetic cage composed of 12 subunits that form a tetrahedron. By creating mutant protein cages with inserted thrombin cleavage sites, disassembly could be induced by treatment with thrombin protease. We designed 13 mutant protein cages and successfully cloned our top candidate based on selection criteria. We were then able to successfully express and affinity purify both the native protein cage and the mutant protein cage. However, complications with protein aggregation occurred, and upon assaying for protein cage assembly using dynamic light scattering, we found that our cages did not assemble at the expected size of 16nm. Future directions will be focused on improving expression conditions for proper cage assembly, as well as on functionalizing the interior/exterior."

Fransisco Luquero assured us that the current solutions (bleach, boil water) were not the most suitable to treat water from cholera. Our device could be interesting if it is suitable to treat several liters of water and even if it contains GMM, it could be easily accepted by the population as long as it does not change the color and taste of water.

New attempt (attempt #3) to sub-clone Vh1, Vh2 and  Vh3 in their respective vector.  
Cloning
Ligation and transformation of pPICZα-cOT2 ; pPICZα-leucrocine ; pPICZα-Odr10 and pPICZα-DNY15.
Miniprep of transformants and gel migration were made. The ladder was clear but there was no DNA on tranformants colums.
Nanodrop analysis showed that there was not enough DNA.

GUI Sample
A user-friendly network-design platform is realized in our software with C# for the experimentalists. The interface is shown in Figure2.Users can input the requirement curves with uploading a data file. And the picture files for curves are also supported by our software. And the network can be designed by manually drawing the species and the interactions. The phenotypes of the designed networks will be shown with graphs that users can directly see the performances of the results and the deviation between the results and the requirement.
Algorithm
Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
The particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed to optimized the parameters in a fixed mathematic model. In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in optimizing the parameters for nonlinear system. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that it is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. Parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to search the best topologies and the best interaction forms. It is a powerful method for complex optimization problems. It realizes an essential evolution process in a computer. Under a fitness function, the members of the population will be improved from generation to generation. And the population will fit the pressure much better by the intraspecific competition. It is suitable for our problems; because it can be converged in a moderate generations and can give a population of best topologies, not only one by other algorithms.
Future
It is just the first step. We still have a lot to do to achieve the final goal. First, the link should be established between the interaction forms and the real particles, as the promoters, the proteins, the ligands and so on. We are trying to build a database to construct the links, but the experiments data now are far than enough. And there are still some problems in the measurement of the parameters. Second, the optimization space is too large for us to search. Our program should run for a long time to finish the whole job. The parallel computation is favorable here. So we will use the parallel computation to do the optimization in the next version. Third, the on-line version is also required as it will be more convenient to the users.

Based on Henrike's advice, I checked the melting temperatures for only the parts of the primers that actually bind to template DNA and they are significantly lower... So Nadine ran a PCR with 42°C annealing step instead of 62°C, let's see tomorrow if it's better.
Tuesday, 19 July 2011
Alessandro started the IPTG test and the results will be available the next day.
The PCR with 42°C for annealing step didn't work either... We'll put this assembly aside, hoping that we will be able to insert TetR in others plasmids.
The Gibson assemblies made last Friday and transformed yesterday show disappointing results:
J61002 Ptet-LacI Plac-RFP: only two colonies and they both are white
J61002 Ptet-LacI Plac-lysis: no colonies
pSB3C5 Pconst-TetR: a lot of red colonies, although they should not have RFP
For the J61002 assemblies, we will do the PCRs again to have fresh parts, and then try again. For pSB3C5 the results are really strange, as we don't think RFP should be included in the original plasmid. Also, Vincent's results for the miniprep of the original are suspiciously high (60 ng/ul is more than expected)so perhaps it's not the plasmid we think it is. We will then try to use pSB3K1 plasmid.
Nadine and Alessandro designed the plasmid for the new Gibson assembly to put P-const-TetR on a new backbone (pSB3K1) because the pSB3C5 didn't give the expected results (high DNA concentration while expected low copy number).

The results from the IPTG test (picture below) show a slight difference in RFP fluorescence between the sample (w/ IPTG) and the negative control (w/ water) but this difference isn't significant therefore we must consider this as a bad result: we know our plasmid is not as expected (the plasmid on the right) , but we don't know what we have.

Campus Activity
Since a great number of senior students have large interest in biology, we design activities of this part with a lot of easy understood examples and knowledge to describe synthetic biology. And drug resistance is known but not familiar to them. They asked us so many questions about drug resistance, especially showing their worries about antibiotics abuse in China. We introduced our project to them in the simplest possible terms, and they understood that synthetic biology might be utilized to solve the problems of drug resistance in China. By the way, some students feel excited when learning genetic engineering in university, which was familiar to them in high school learning. They then discuss with us about whether we can create ideal lives.
Public Outreach
No matter what subjects are, only the ones popularize research results to public affect people’s lives. Therefore, we took our projects out of labs to Guangdong Science Center, which is the biggest popular science education base in Asia. The number of people visiting Guangdong Center just during the National day holiday amazingly exceeds 180 thousand. People of all ages are attracted to our exhibition, which is of novel form. A great many visitors were interested in examples we gave, and interestingly some of them even asked whether it means human can fly if we utilize synthetic biology to joint features of birds and human. Besides, they also question us about the security problems of genetically modified food. Except for answering these questions, we also meet some molecular biological specialists bringing their kids to visit. After the visit, they raised some professional questions about our projects and we discussed about the problems we had met in experimental stage, from which we benefited a lot. By the way, we invite visitors to sign on our scroll as support, and fill in our questionnaires about drug resistance for us to know their"

Workshop
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to literature, expression of glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) can significantly enhance the growth rate of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In Bacillus subtilis, when consumed same amount of glucose, the dry weight of the gdh-overexpressed strain is larger. That is to say, gdh-overexpression significantly increases the metabolic efficiency of glucose1-3. Gdh works in the branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. It converts glucose to gluconate, and then gluconate is phosphorylated into 6-P-gluconate and enter the pentose phosphate pathway (Figure 3). This metabolic process generate products includes NADPH, which significantly increases the cell's reducing power and helps cells fight against oxygen free radicals, and different carbon number compounds (C3 to C7), which play an important role in cell damage repair, energy supply and so on (Figure 4). (For example, product ribose-5-phosphate is a precursor to synthetic DNA and RNA, and product glyceraldehyde triphosphate is an important intermediate in glycolysis.)

Module 2
There are some allosteric proteins in E. coli. They can works together with other genes, forming an operon to perform certain function. One of the operons, emrRAB (also known as mprA or marRAB), generally has resistance to some bacteria-harmful uncoupler. emrR, the repressor, can be expressed and bind to its own promoter and inhibit the express of emrA and emrB. When emrR bind with uncoupler like DNP, it is no longer able to bind with its promoter and open or enhance the expression of emrA and emrB. Then cell membrane’s permeability to uncoupler can increase allowing the bacteria to pump uncouplers out of the cell. According to literature, salicylic acid (SA) is also one of the allosteric inhibitors of emrR.

We were able to calculate the dissociation constant of TALE-A ( BBa_K1189029 ) and TALE-B with coils in the FerriTALE complex.
Modelling
Built an animation in Maya in order to communicate more visually how our sensor system functions from start to finish.
Built a spatial model in Maya to show how the potential mechanism of DNA-TALE binding to nitrocellulose in our prototype could result in reduction of the TALEs sensitivity. This directly influenced the way we designed our system, encouraging us to add in linkers/scaffolds.
Constructed a quantitative Mathematica model to test how amounts of target DNA versus detector proteins could influence sensitivity of the prototype.
Built a Mathematica model to analyze kinetics of several common reporter enzymes found in the registry, which culminated in the selection of our reporters.
Built a Scilab model of differential equations to show how fast we can get a detectable result from our system. This model used constants from our own experiments to make this prediction.
Human Practices
Consulted with three key stakeholders in the beef-cattle industry and implemented their suggestions into our design in terms of where we would implement our test in the meat processing chain, the time requirements for our test as well as the need for ease of use and robustness in our final system
Built upon previous outreach activities as well as took on a few new initiatives in order to engage more people in our community about our project
Collaboration
Collaborated with Paris Bettencourt to create SensiGEM , a searchable database of biosensors. Here we identified all the different biosensors in the registry over the years and categorized them by their inputs and outputs in order to guide future teams in the selection of their biosensors.
Helped establish the first Consort High School iGEM team in collaboration with the Calgary Entrepreneurial team. Consort performed amazingly well winning the Best Human Practices at the iGEM High School Jamboree!
Additional Work and Characterization
Characterized a portable prototype showing that this final system is feasible. We used a homestyle pregnancy kit to show that this is possible here . We showed that it is possible to flow DNA through the strip, add protein on the strip and get a colour output using our ferritin reporter.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html,", followed by group discussions. In this workshop there was the opportunity to learn about ethical issues that may arise from synthetic biology, acknowledge principles underlying these issues and how they are currently handled in society. They also identified possible ethical issues that may emerge from individual projects, as well as approaches that can be considered to minimize unwanted outcomes.
How does this fit into our community?
As such great discussion was generated from these ethics discussions, we chose to try and integrate the issues which were highlighted as most important into the teaching arm of our iTECH model. The resulting focus for the student case studies was based on the question of 'just because we can, should we?'.
We wrote case studies in three main subject areas: health, environment and design, and for each one decided to include an element of ethical discussion. For health we asked students about the consequences of unsupervised production and use of hormones, for environment we asked students to consider the impact of new biological solutions to natural conservation problems and how this might disrupt our natural world. Finally, for design, we incorporated questions of both the impact of biological architecture on local ecosystems and also how could bacterial based solutions to every day problems be made acceptable in our society. The results were intriguing! See the Integrated HP page for details.
Mini-Jamboree
The Mini-Jamboree was an event in which all Nordic Teams presented their synthetic biology projects during the conference. The criteria for the project presentations was based on the official iGEM criteria and a panel of judges presented this year's winners during the Gasque dinner party. The winning team has the honour of hosting the next annual NiC!
How does this fit into our community?
NiC is a fantastic opportunity for networking, discussing ideas and giving feedback on each other's work. We felt involvement in the organisation and planning of this weekend was a great dress rehearsal for the Boston Jamboree and all the Nordic iGEM teams benefited from the opportunity to receive constructive criticism from peers and also be inspired by different approaches to the competition!

Questionnaire for XJTLU-iGEM
Survey for synthetic biology, bio-safety, global warming and our project
Method for Survey: Questionnaire
Starting time：2015-8-1
Ending time：2015-8-31
People were chosen randomly from internet
Data analysis：
Question 1
Have you ever heard about synthetic biology before this survey?
您在这份调查之前是否听说过合成生物学的概念？
The iGEM competition is an annual, world wide, synthetic biology event. This question is aimed to find whether synthetic biology is well-known in China or not and let more people know about this area. According to this result, only a quarter people heard about bio-synthesis before our survey. Over half of people did not know about synthetic biology before. Also, 16 people were not sure that they had a clear idea about synthetic biology. We considered that most of people did not have biological background. Furthermore, industries working on bio-synthesis have just been developed recently in China so that it is not popular right now. Therefore, we should provide some associated information for public. If people chose ‘B’ and ‘C’, the definition of synthetic biology would be displayed. Additionally, we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel area.
Provided definition: Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes. It is an area of biological research and technology that combines biology and engineering, thus often overlapping with bioengineering and biomedical engineering. It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on engineering biology and biotechnology.
Question 2
Which conventional industries will be replaced by synthetic biology?
你认为以下哪些传统产业会被合成生物学取代?
As we know, synthetic biology can be applied in many area and even replace some conventional industries. We asked Dr. Liu, a biologist in our university, for which area could be replaced by bio-synthesis. She made a list including agriculture, metallurgic industry, cottonocracy and oil industry. Hence, we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cotton"

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"ADPH plays an important role in anabolic pathways and is also indispensable to our desired pathways of nootkatone and violacein. Glutathione is an antioxidant and redox buffer which is also found in yeast peroxisomes. It is used as cofactor by at least two types of peroxisomal proteins, the glutathione peroxidases and glutathione transferases, which reduce lipid- and hydrogen peroxides or transfer glutathione to lipid peroxides for the purpose of detoxification (Horiguchi H. et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it partly represents the redox state of the peroxisome. Knowing the pH of a compartment is important for predicting the activities of almost all enzymatic processes inside and to follow up acidification and basification upon conversion of metabolites.
We finally chose two ratiometric sensors to perform measurements with. The pH sensitive and glutathione redox state reporting green fluorescent proteins pHLuorin2 (Mahon M. J. et al., 2011) and roGFP2 (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . Our aim was to target them either to the peroxisomal lumen or the cytosol. To achieve peroxisomal targeting we attached the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 via Golden Gate cloning .
Figure 5.1 Level 1 plasmids with medium promoters and uracil auxotrophy. Top left: cytosolic roGFP2. Top right: peroxisomal roGFP2. Bottom left:  cytosolic pHLourin2. Bottom right: peroxisomal pHLourin2.
Using promoters with different expression strength in order to find optimal measurement conditions is of high interest. There is a trade-off between a high signal-to-noise ratio and self-induced effects which are both dependent on expression levels (Schwarzländer M. et al., 2016) . This is not generally the case for each sensor. For example, pHlourin2 has only a minor influence on the existing pH because of the buffer effect of proteins.
Validation of the peroxisomal localization can be achieved via fluorescence overlap of the sensor and a peroxisomal marker, in our case pex13-mRuby ( import mechanism ).
