TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#AppliedDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," 2017 ). Together, they form a technical challenge that requires enormous versatility in the detection method design. This is where nested PCR, requiring 4 known primers per target site, is hard to extend and a main point of improvement for gene doping detection methods.
2.2 Whole Genome Sequencing
A more extensive alternative to nested PCR is whole genome sequencing as an approach to tackle gene doping. One of the laboratories working on the use of this technique against gene doping is the group of professor Hidde Haisma at Groningen University. With the current technologies however, sequencing all genomes of the participating athletes in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games would cost up to 37 years ( Jain, M. et al, 2018 ), making WGS into a not very realistic solution. Therefore, efficiency is an important design requirement that we improve on.
3. ADOPE: the Ultimate Solution
Our product has been shaped under the influence of many stakeholders . In this way we integrated all design requirements in our comprehensive gene doping method that has the potential to combat gene doping now and in the future. During the complete process we have been working closely together with the Dutch Doping Authority, that amongst others led us to include our prescreening method.
Figure 1. The overview of our product with design the requirements.
“The initial costs are not very important in doping detection development. What does matter is that we should be able to efficiently upscale the detection.”
We also created a VR explanation of the prescreen in use to inform future users of our method.

4. ADOPE’s Impact on Lives
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT)
As a result of our flourishing inclusion process , we had much valuable input from many different backgrounds, from athletes and the Dutch Doping Authority to Computer Scientists and Ethicists. This prompted us to refine the analysis of our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) ( Hill et al, 1997 ) to distill our core values from our challenges. Subsequently, we integrated all values and feedback into our design requirements and we reflected on future implications and applications of our method based on our SWOT analysis. Here we describe our strengths, and how we overcome our weaknesses and threats, leaving the opportunities for our Entrepreneurship page .

E.Colipse - intelligent sunscreen
Figure 1: Spectrum of the sun. Dotted lines indicate the borders between different light types denoted with the labels at the top. 'A', 'B' and 'C' show the regions for UV-A/B/C radiation.
Sun UV radiation is unavoidable during warm sunny days. Despite the fact that suns light (Fig. 1) reaching Earth crust consists of only few percent of UV-A (320 - 400 nm) and UV-B (280 - 320 nm) radiation, it still poses serious risks and life destructive capabilities, e.g. DNA is one of the main targets which are hit by UV radiation, causing DNA breakage, mutations etc. [Sinha2002] If unattended, this can lead to sun burns, skin damage or even cancer. Thus, a proper skin protection is usually a good idea in order to avoid unpleasant experience.
However, conventional sunscreens provide relatively passive sun protection, leaving actual protection regulation to ones speculations when and how much of the sunscreen should be applied, which easily can result in inefficient layer of sunscreen and skin damage.
Thus, we tried to develop an intelligent sunscreen, which could adapt its protection factor to the exposed UV radiation and also give a warning signal if protection is insufficient.

Every year, over
fifty million people
in the US suffer from
allergic rhinitis
, the most common type of allergy. Allergens such as pollen, dust, and dander result in nasal congestion, itching, burning, sneezing, and overall
discomfort
. Current treatments include over-the-counter
antihistamines
, however, side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, restlessness, and poor concentration. For patients suffering from chronic allergies and inflammation, there is a great
need for an alternative strategy
for combating allergic symptoms
without
causing
significant side effects
.
The
2009 Brown University iGEM
team worked to treat allergic rhinitis by
engineering Staphylococcus epidermidis
, a microbe endogenous to the human nasal flora, to
secrete
a recombinant
histamine-binding protein
in response to the elevated histamine concentrations of an allergic response.  The engineered strain of S. epidermidis will function as a
self-regulating drug factory in the nose
, providing relief,
without
any negative
side effects
.
 Learn more about Allergene: a synthetically engineered, self-regulating drug factory in the  nose.
 When an allergic response occurs, our system senses a change in histamine levels above  threshold and initiates an intracellular cascade, signaling cells to respond appropriately to  the increase in histamine concentration.
 EV131 is a high-affinity histamine binding protein, that originates from the saliva of a  female tick species.
 The chassis of choice  for production and secretion of the Histamine Binding Protein is  Staphyloccocus Epidermidis, an organism endogenous to the human nasal flora. A quorum  sensing mechanism was also incorporated to regulate cell density.

They found that there is only a fixed point $p_m$ when $c$ is small enough and  the uniform solution $p_m$ becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation as $c$ increases, resulting in a stable limit cycle.
Then how the promoter strength of each gene influences the final result? We tried to use average promoter strength to simplify this question. Comparing four different mean values, we found that the harmonic mean of the promoter strengths exhibited good competence in distinguishing these two cases. If the harmonic mean of these three genes' promoter strengths is large enough, a stable oscillation can be observed easily in theory. While any one of the promoter strengths is too weak, the harmonic mean will be too small to lead to a stable oscillation, because harmonic mean is easily affected by the minimal value.
Figure 4. Distributions of average promoter strength for two cases. The red areas represent the average promoter strength distribution for those systems with a fixed point attractor. The yellow areas represent the average promoter strength distribution for those systems with a limit cycle attractor. The orange areas represent the overlapping areas of these two distributions
The model for genetic toggle switch, by contrast, is more simple. It has been acknowledged that the relative promoter strength is more important to the steady states. If the promoter strengths are approximately equal, or, in other words, if they are in the same order, the topological structure of toggle switch creates two stable and one unstable steady states. If one promoter strength is considerably larger than the another one, only one stable steady state will be produced.
4.2.2 Situations after rewiring
Not only parameters but also the initial state decides the final steady state of the toggle switch. We set $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$ and constructed an index $S$ to estimate which steady state the toggle switch reaches. $S$ is calculated by \begin{equation} S=\lim_{t\to\infty}\log_{10}\frac{x_1(t)}{x_2(t)}. \end{equation}
The simulation results indicated S had two values which represent the two stable steady states. In our design, the initial state for toggle switch depends on the phase of oscillation when the DNA sequence is inverted. We found that the oscillation with a fixed point attractor that is far from the separatrix of toggle switch was more likely to result in one steady state when the fluctuation of gene expression becomes weaker and weaker and that the oscillation with"

Secondary School Visit
During the planning stage of our project we decided that it would be an interesting addition to our project if we worked at educating secondary school students to evoke a positive interest in synthetic biology. The current junior cycle and senior cycle curriculum does not contain a lot of theory on the applications of synthetic biology in society. Our talk was given to 180 students composing girls and boys from two local schools (Coláiste an Spioraid Naomh and Christ King Secondary School). The groups we spoke to included 4th year and 5th year students (i.e. 15-17 years old).  The aim of the talk was to impart knowledge on synthetic biology which could facilitate some young people to go further in research in this exciting area and potentially solve many societal issues.
In order to help the students’ grasp what genetic modification is we produced an informational video on Golden Rice.
Another part of our presentation involved speaking to the students about a use of synthetic biology other than for scientific reasons. We presented them with the practice of bacterial painting, which is an example of how genetic modification can be exploited as a creative outlet.
Our presentation was designed to be around 30 minutes long. There were four main components to our presentation:
1. What is iGEM? 2. What is synthetic biology? 3. Ethical issues and debate on genetic modification 4. Our project
Before the presentation we handed out questionnaires to gain insight into any prior knowledge of Synbio the students had. In addition, we evaluated how they felt towards the use of GM in several industries.
The first question was “Have you ever heard of synthetic biology?”
The term synthetic biology was unfamiliar to the vast majority of students (91%). We also asked the students if they would be interested in the pursuit of a career in science. Half of the students expressed an interest and this was higher than what was expected.
To learn more about what the students knew of genetic modification we asked if there were any genetically modified products which they had heard of before.
Some examples of GM products they were familiar with are as follows:
GM fruit and vegetables (e.g: seedless oranges, grapes and bananas)
GM meat
Penicillin
Make up
Crops to increase yield
Probiotic yoghurt
Certain types of cheese
Anti-ageing cream
Food products with increased shelf life (e.g.: tomatoes)
The students indicated then if they agreed with the use of genetic modification in the following areas: Food Medicine Cosmetics Environment
It was clear that among the group the only widespread acceptance of genetic modification"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"
Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester#Description#mechanism2_-_-_TEXT.html,"2 ) [1]. The chromoproteins used were from previously characterised BioBricks by 2013 iGEM Uppsala-Sweden: amilCP with RBS ( BBa_K1033930 ) and spisPink with RBS ( BBa_K1033925 ).
Our project focuses on the ability of AlcR to bind to its binding sites on the PalcA. The alcR gene is a new BioBrick we have characterised this year ( BBa_K2092004 ).  In addition, we have also submitted another alcR BioBrick with a constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23110 ) placed upstream of the alcR ( BBa_K2092004 ) gene.
alcA promoter (PalcA)
PalcA (BBa_K678002) is one of the strongest inducible promoters in Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans) and is widely used to overexpress proteins [2]. The native PalcA consists of three AlcR binding sites: ""a"", ""b"" and ""c"" (Fig. 2).  There is evidence that two sites, either in direct or inverted orientation, are necessary for full transcriptional activation of PalcA [3]. Based on different publications [1], [3], we concluded that the number and the position of the AlcR binding sites on PalcA are crucial for the strength of transcriptional activation of PalcA. Hence, we took the factors (number and position of AlcR binding sites) into account when deciding which PalcA variants to use for our system.
Two of the PalcA variants that we used in our experiment were the native PalcA (BBa_K678002) and our synthesized PalcA variant (PalcA(var); BBa_K678003 ) (Fig.2):
PalcA is the native variant which is a previously characterised BioBrick by iGEM DTU-Denmark 2011 (BBa_K678001) . We improved this BioBrick by adding several missing restriction sites on the Prefix and Suffix (BBa_K2092002) .
PalcA(var) is a new BioBrick we have characterised this year (BBa_K2092003) . PalcA(var) (BBa_K2092003) was inspired by a research done in creating a functional, chemically inducible gene switch for monocotyledonous plant sugar cane [3] and Escherichia coli [4].

It contains the LasR receptor (C0079) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a GFP reporter (E0040). In this part, GFP expression is under the control of the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079). The part should produce LasR which receives the PAI. Binding of LasR to the PAI should be reported by GFP expression. lasR is reported to be under the control of the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011) in the part. The PLlac 0-1 promoter is a hybrid consisting of the lambda phage promoter P(L) with the cI binding sites replaced with lacO1. In nature, LasR bound to the PAI is the activator for the expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase gene (lasB).
Methods and Results
Transformation and Selection
psB1AK3[BBa_K091134] was transformed into chemically competent (DH5α). Transformed cells were plated on LB agar plates containing either ampicillin, kanamycin, or ampicillin and kanamycin. Colonies were observed on the kan plates and the amp plates but never on the amp and kan plates. Characterization was continued using a colony from the LB/kan plate.
Response to Autoinducer
In the presence of N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  at various concentrations alone (100 μM, 10 μM, 1μM, 0.1 μM, 0.01 μM, 1 nm, 0.1 nm) and N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  (same concentrations) + IPTG, DH5α/psB1AK3[BBa_K091134] did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal. However,the data are less than clear as our positive control showed no fluorescence either.
Sequencing
The psB1AK3/BBa_K091134 plasmid was extracted from the transformed cells for sequencing. Standard primers for sequencing/amplifying BioBrick parts were used: VF2 (tgccacctgacgtctaagaa) and VR (attaccgcctttgagtgagc). The sequencing was successful for both primers.

I started writing both the public and technical abstracts. Having stared at the same information for so long, and trying to reword it in many different ways is starting to make my head spin. Thankfully, Evan stepped in and helped write a version because I just didn't know how to reword it any longer.
At the end of the day, we headed out to Bikram Yoga as a lab. It was fun, and hot! I don't know if I have the strength of will to do it again, because it was really painful to be in such great heat and moving around. I have never sweat so much in my life.
Friday: We were still struggling with the internet connection. Logging in as a guest gave some of us access to our emails, but GoogleDrive access was still spotty. We got as much done as we could. We also sent our summer interns off. Those kids were great, and I hope they had a great time this summer. The team then took the afternoon and went out to smoothies at Life Alive with the BU iGem team!
Week 8: July 22 - July 26
Monday: Editing of the poster has continued. Orit has given me her feedback for the abstracts, so I spent my time before lunch heavily editing both the public and technical versions. I learned today that the abstracts are actually due next week, and not today at 4 pm, so I am greatly relieved. I have continued to edit what writing is to go on the poster. Catherine helped out greatly by writing the explanations for why tree view and behavior view are important, and helping me edit the writing of the poster. Consuelo has helped the Eugenie team out a lot by helping us edit the styling of the poster and by reading over and editing both abstracts. They still need some work, but we're getting there steadily! Evan is working on the logo for Eugenie, and they say they are almost done! I am very excited to see it.
Sravanti is continuing to work through getting the popup box to be populated with the information from the database. She has made great progress today. Eugenie is really starting to come together!
Our official, very last minute deadline for all the heavy development is next Thursday. It's crunchtime!
Tuesday: Today, I really finished up the writing for the poster. It's in a place where I would be comfortable to print the poster and print the abstract, but I know there is most likely things that Orit would like to change, but at least it won't be stressful editing by the time we"

We synthesized the vector of circular mRNA but without ribothermometer. And we transformed the vector into E. coli DH10B.
July 9
We conducted a RT-PCR to test if the mRNA had formed a circle.
July 10
We amplified the cDNA product of yesterday to see if the length is right. Unfortunately, the length was not right.

Group members met. We decided to focus on the ribothermometer and Gandi’s idea.
July 13 - July 19
After negotiating with our instructor, we had a vote and we finally set our topic----simulate the process of global warming. We began to check the genetic circuit designed, meanwhile, as the ribothermometer U6 chosen from paper showed a severe leak at 30℃, we decided to try more.
July 20 - July 26
This week’s experimental task was making new sets of ribothermometers. Sue, Melody, Victor, Polly and Jodie were responsible for that. Others rechecked the parts like promoters, operators, repressors used in the circuit.

APPLIED DESIGN
Overview
Oxidation damage, aging and relative diseases are highly related to human health. Antioxidants are currently effective treatments. However, detection approaches to antioxidant are quite limited, especially in living-cells. Traditional methods largely focused on direct redox reaction which may have non-proper relation to living systems. Living cells are integrated with multiple natural anti-oxidant systems, including anti-oxidant enzyme system, reductive system, post-damage repair system, etc. All these make it sophisticated to evaluate real effects from exogenous antioxidant. To date, substantial efforts have been devoted to developing alternative strategies that can overcome the disadvantages and difficulties of online antioxidant detection in living cells .There is still no ideal result.                             One promising and challenging method for accomplishing this purpose is to construct a ""living antioxidant detection device"" via synthetic biology method. Yeast was used as host cell as it can present a simple and accurate measuring platform for us. Furthermore, we constructed multiple functional gene circuits to implement ROS regulating, endogenous redox reaction testing, and feedback regulation, etc. These results together demonstrate the excellent potential of this project in detecting antioxidant easily, accurately, fast and economically.
Ancient times, searching for anti-aging ways and secret of life's aging attract have been                         attracting countless passionate people.
Since 19th century, people have gradually realized the significance of antioxidants in solving                         the anti-aging puzzle and launched tireless exploration.
Chemical methods (1990s)
With the development of analytical methods and detection methods (such as L-band electron spin                         resonance (ESR), various probes, magnetic resonance imaging spin trapping and so                         on)，researchers have more confidence and ability to detect antioxidants. Besides, driven by the                         public's eagerness for health and beauty, many chemical detection methods emerged around the                         20th century.

Following a similar protocol to the one performed on 5/18.
Growing up cells in 100ml of LB.
We are doing a smaller volume because we are running low on bugbuster lysis reagents, and we want to be able to do at least one more reaction after this one.
Instead of making a starter culture, we are simply inoculating a colony into a 1L flask.
I started incubating the culture at 12:35 pm 7/27, but I forgot to add the Kanamycin antibiotic until 1 pm.  (100 ul of 1000x).
Here are the steps for today's growth protocol.
Inoculate one colony in 100 ml of LB in an autoclaved flask.
Add appropriate antibiotics (kan 100 ul)
Grow and shake at 37 until OD reaches between 0.4 and 0.6.
The colony was inoculated at 12:20 pm, At 4 pm , the OD was 0.064, at 5:05 pm OD was 0.358, At 5:17 the OD was 0.502, when we induced with the IPTG (5:25 pm) IPTG was added to a concentration of 0.5mM
Continue to incubate at 37 C and shake overnight.
In the morning, spin down the cells, decant the supernatant, and freeze the pellet at -80 for storage."

Basic parts
Our best basic part: BBa_K1913025
BBa_K1913025 encodes the plac-FixK2 hybrid promoter. The sequence of upper control element and core element region are derived from the wildtype FixK2 promoter from the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum.
BBa_K1913025 can be be activated by phosphorylated FixJ, part of the YF1-FixJ light sensor. In the presence of light, FixJ is no longer phosphorylated and BBa_K1913025 is not activated. At the same time, it can be inhibited by the LacI repressor because of two lac operators that are positioned on both sides of the FixK2 promoter core.
The BBa_K1913025 was tested together with the YF1-FixJ light sensor using mRFP as a reporter. After culturing for 24 hours in darkness, BBa_K1913025 has five times higher fluorescence than a control without the light sensor.

Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," has all the information we need it. By doing this, we decreased runtime exponentially. We explored several options and began with sqlite3.  This was sufficient for our purposes but in order to ensure robustness for future versions, we switched over to MySQL just before launching our program.
Using the Django web framework, creating a database was fairly straight forward but precise organization of the database was crucial to keeping runtime and update time to a minimum.  After trying several different methods, we settled on creating a database centered on the reaction. Essentially all components can be reached through the reaction model. The picture below depicts the major parts of our database and how they are linked.
Although we decreased the time it takes for the program to run by creating our own database, there are disadvantages to this method. The biggest disadvantage is that our information will not be as up-to-date as KEGG.  KEGG updates parts of their database monthly, other parts weekly, and still others monthly. We decided that in order to keep our program useful we will update our database to ensure that it matches KEGG every two weeks.
Network
Using all the information in our database we have created a large network. Our directed multigraph contains all the compounds and their connections. Compound, compound name, and stoichiometry information is stored at each node. The remaining information is stored on the edge. This includes, reaction, reaction name, reversibility, and weight. From reaction we can also access organism, enzyme, and gene information. A visualization of our graph can be seen below.
As you can see in the top figure, there are some nodes that are very highly connected and others that are barely connected. There ones that are most highly connected are water, ATP, and H+. These are the nodes that we would refrain from using when calculating a pathway. The next pictures are enlarged versions of the pathway showing the information stored in each part.
Weighting Scheme
By default, our algorithm will find the shortest path from the input compound to the output compound. We realize that this path is not always the path that the user is looking for. In order to allow the scientist further flexibility, we have created the option to weight 6 different constraints that we thought would be useful. Listed below is a description of each constraint.
Fewest  Total Reactants/Products
Adding weight to this constraint minimizes the number of reactants and products. This allows minimal disturbance of the natural flux of the organism.
Least ATP Consumption
This weight minimizes the number of reactions that have ATP as a reactant.  This allows for a more natural flow of events through the"

This interactive platform has been used to teach the potential applications of synthetic biology, the assembly of genetic circuits, and molecular biology lab procedures. We hope that our virtual learning environment will allow for the training of future iGEMers.
MARKETING. In order to (1) get industry interested in Synthetic Biology/iGEM, (2) afford to send all UofC team members to the iGEM Jamboree and (3) fund lab, modelling, Second Life and outreach endeavours, we have pursued marketing and fundraising initiatives. Our communication with businesses in many industrial sectors allows for the discussion of the opportunities and future developments of synthetic biology and the potential applications of our wetlab and modelling projects. Our marketing endeavour is intertwined with the outreach initiative and can thus be found under the 'Human Practices' section.
Another important aspect of communication in this competition is the availability of collaborative work, within our own team and as a community itself. Our team is made up of students from health sciences, kinesiology, and engineering;  who are actively participating in interdisciplinary work. This requires the ability to communicate information to people from different backgrounds and perspectives. As well, iGEM allows us to communicate with other teams at an international scale. We hope to establish means of communication and thus cooperation with other teams in our respective projects, enhancing the iGEM experience.
The wetlab, modelling, second life, human practices, and fundraising components of our project have allowed us to establish communication at the cell, individual, and synthetic bio community levels.

Internship
Our intern Tianlang
From August 29th to September 9th we invited a high school student to do a two-week internship in our lab. Tianlang Pan is an exchange student from China who does his high school degree in Ehingen, Germany. Giving students an insight into laboratory work and the field of synthetic biology worked out well for us the year before. So, this time, we decided to give this opportunity to only one student but for a longer time and in more detail. After announcing our offer in some schools around Tuebingen, Tianlang applied and sounded very interested in doing practical work. Since his main subjects in school are natural sciences in general, he wants to get an insight into those before deciding which major to pick at the university. He told us our offer seems to be an excellent opportunity to him to take a closer look to biological work and synthetic biology.
Getting input and sharing experiences
First of all, we gave him the theoretical background and explained the idea of our project. At this point, Tianlang asked some very fundamental questions which made us think about our project in a different more general perspective. At the beginning of his practical work, we made chemically competent bacteria which was the first time Tianlang worked with microorganisms. In the following two weeks, he performed a wide range of methods in molecular biology including PCR, restriction digest, DNA ligation, transformation of chemically competent bacteria and plasmid preparation as well as agarose gel electrophoresis, and its analysis. He exhibited great interest in doing practical work and had no reservation about working in the lab. DNA fragments, Tianlang produced in his preliminary work, we used in later work on the basic part of the fructose transporter. The mix between fundamental and detailed questions Tianlang asked brought us in mind that people outside the scientific field have another perspective and will wonder about other things than scientists do.
So we are looking back with a positive feeling and already planning a new project to give students an insight into the scientific practice and synthetic biology."

In this system, when PADH oxidize formaldehyde, electrons lost by formaldehyde are transferred to nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Gaining electrons, the NAD+ are reduced to reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). By measuring the absorbance of NADH under light of 340nm, we can know the concentration of NADH, and finally know the activity of PADH.
Culture
Experimental group (E.coli with PADH gene) and control group (E.coli without PADH gene) are both cultured under 37&#8451, overnight
Lysis
Collect cells by centrifugation, and wash them with Tris-HCl (PH 7.5) twice
Resuspend cells with Tris-HCl (PH 7.5)
Lyse them by ultrasonic cell disrupter: 500w, work 5s, interval 7s, repeat dozens of times until the solute becomes clear.
Collect supernatant by cryogenic centrifugal (4℃, 12 000 r/min , 20min)
Enzyme activity assay
Prepare the reaction system in colorimetric tube: 1.5ml Tris-HCl (PH 8.0), 0.5ml NAD+ (6mM), 0.5ml formaldehyde solution (12mM), 2.5ml total
Incubate under 50℃ for 10min, measure the absorbance from time to time until"

While we see this as an advantage for work in synthetic biology (markerless additions of genes allowing for infinite replacements, more permanent method of inserting genes, no antibiotic resistance in the organism created, etc.), it also means that more care should be taken with the bacteria containing the edited genome (due to the markerless insertion, it could be potentially more difficult to figure out what had been deleted/inserted). The stability of the genome might mean that it would be more difficult to extract an added gene. On the other hand, we don't believe that this will be a major safety issue because any genetic material inserted by BRIDGE can be removed just as easily as plasmids by simply using the recombinase again.
From an engineering and scientific point of view, risk assessment deals with the probability that a certain hazard is going to happen. It is very unlikely that there could be an unplanned event or series of events involving our project that would result in undesired consequences; we have ensured that we are adhering to strict safety codes that mitigate such probability, and we are working with an experienced supervisor and a number of trained advisors to prevent such an occurrence. As stated above, our project does not require that our organism comes into contact with people or the environment.
Even if Sod's Law dictated that the statistical probabilities were against us, it would be unlikely that our device (when working properly) would represent a hazard to people or the environment. The BRIDGE protocol simply adapts an existing natural process to an existing problem in a new area of application, while glowing bacteria are unlikely to be much of a hazard in the wide world (the amount of energy they expend to glow would render them uncompetitive in any case). We are working with non-pathogenic laboratory strains of E. coli, and even after engineering it is not infectious, toxic, or interfering with human physiology or the environment. Our work focuses on intracellular proteins with no significant catalytic role, and thus a malfunction in our BioBrick parts would pose minimal threat to humans, other organisms, or laboratory equipment.
Should the absolute worst happen and our engineered organism is released to the environment, we predict a short spate of glowing trees and a decline in the sales of Christmas lights should the release be timed correctly. Barring the remote possibility that our colour-repressilating bacteria somehow mutate into the deadliest killer virus known to man, causing people to turn red, blue, and green (with different effects depending upon who is nearby) before exploding, we believe"

We approached students by handing out iGEM flyers and were happy to learn that high school students have a sincere interest in bettering their community and world through applications of synthetic biology.
Museum of Natural History Summer Program
Two members of our team spoke to a program with students that ranged from the high school to collegiate level. Since most of our team has just finished their freshman year, we felt this was a great opportunity to mentor students who are entering college. We focused most of our talk and discussions on synthetic biology and our project. We presented common misconceptions and basic terminology of synthetic biology through a PowerPoint® presentation. Students, eager to learn more, asked many thought-provoking questions, ultimately leading to more friendly discussions about the implications of synthetic biology.

During our visit to a science camp, held at the West DNA Learning Lab, three of our members presented to students in middle school and high school. Our presentation outlined the basics of biology, synthetic biology, and iGEM. Through our presentation, students were also able to learn about research opportunities at the high school and collegiate level. As an incentive and approach to have the students participate, we handed out iGEM pens and DNA tattoos. The camp was structured around learning about DNA, proteins, and plasmids. Therefore, since the students had an introductory synthetic biology background, allowing them to ask astute questions about our project, its’ implications, and overarching concepts of synthetic biology. The faculty at the DNA Learning Lab enjoyed our visit and asked us to present at future camps. In order to involve them in our project, we asked for their opinions on which promoter they would believed would be more beneficial towards society. We hope to spark further interest in students through our presentation and positive personal experiences in research.

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"os of the Werra was composed of 60-100 species.
Nowadays, the environment is dominated by only one species. The boosted river cancer, a      brackish water species from North America, is a Neozoe (unnaturally introduced species)      and became the dominant living being. In addition, the New Zealand dwarf snail, also a Neozoe,      occurs frequently. There is only a small amount of mosquitos, fly larvae and some other species from      the originally occurring species in the body of water with an extremely small share of the individual      species of the ecosystem.
To tackle the significant damage salt stress causes in rivers like the Werra, but also to find a solution for ion burden in industrial process wasters, we developed ""SALT VAULT"".
Description
The aim of our ""SALT VAULT"" system is to absorb as many sodium and chloride ions as possible to reduce the salt content in water. The system developed by us is based on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is not only a model organism, but also has a vacuole, which is of central importance for our project (details of why we chose this organism, see the >> design section).
S. cerevisiae has a large number of ion transporters and channels involved in the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride ions. These       proteins are controlled by various regulatory mechanisms and work together to maintain the ion homeostasis in the cytosol of the yeast when       the external salt concentrations vary, which is of central importance for metabolism.
There are multiple transport systems in the plasma membrane that lead to an influx of sodium,       but there are no specific sodium importers in the plasma membrane [8]. The influx is only significant       when sodium has much higher extracellular concentration than potassium [9,8] which, in our application , is the case:
- Phosphate influx into the cytoplasm is coupled to sodium and carried out by the cotransporter Pho89, contributing to sodium import [8,10].
- Low affinity nonspecific cation importers in the plasma membrane do not discriminate between K+ and Na+, leading to an import of both [11].
- Trk1, actually a potassium importer, transports Na+ in addition to K+, although with lower affinity [12].
Sodium ions play an important role for the function       of macromolecules [8]. On the other hand, an increased intracellular concentration can lead to toxic effects because sodium ions can disturb the correct       function of specific cellular pathways [9]. The most important transporters forming this"
TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Response_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescence yields and low autofluorescence because of its absorption and emission characteristics. Since Genevan et.al (2006) modified an Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) to obtain an optimized acceptor for GFP in FRET systems, we used this Resonance Energy-Accepting Chromoprotein (REACh) as the aceptor chromophore of our response mechanism.
REACh was designed by mutating an EYFP in random amino acid residues. These mutations eliminated the protein’s fluorescence without altering its absorption characteristics, which resulted in a non-fluorescent chromoprotein that acts as a dark quencher for the donor chromophore in a FRET mechanism (Ganesan et.al, 2006). Because of its absorption wavelength, REACh is a suitable aceptor for GFP, our system's donor, and one of its most advantageous features is its absence of fluorescence, which enables a selective detection of GFP's florescence emission (Ganesan et.al, 2006).
3. No more Quenched-GFP
We decided to fuse our donor chromophore (GFP) with our acceptor molecule (REACh) by a recognition peptide for TEV protease. Ganesan et.al (2006) tested this linker sequence and proved that FRET is lost upon cleavage of the linker. When the linker is cut, GFP is separated from REACh and this increase in distance prevents REACh from interacting with GFP, which results in fluoresce emission.
As we previously explained, in our system, after the Split-TEV is released from the dCas9, an intein reaction occurs that enables the reconstitution of an active TEV. Once this protease is activated, it is able to cleavage the GFP-REACh linker, resulting in a strong GFP fluorescence emission, which is shown in Figure 2. This fluorescence emission is the final response of our system and it indicates the detection of a highly specific DNA or RNA molecule; in our case, the presence of prostate cancer.

Module 3
Module 3 is going to make a standard part which is crucially important for our whole experimental design in iGEM project. Project is basically about releasing of intrinsic factor (by GIF gene) in right part of the body and module 3 aims to activate GIF gene to maximum level by pH change in that part. Sensing pH difference is going to be made with pH-dependent promoter (nhaA promoter) that is designed in 2008 by another iGEM team called NYMU-Taipei (Figure 1). (1)
NhaA is responsible gene for Na+/H+ antiporter that has a promoter which can be defined as pH sensor.(2)
In our design, nhaA promoter is going to be inserted into our part in order to activate expression of OmpA+GIF as shown in Figure 2. NhaA promoter is going to be obtained by PCR technique.
Primers were designed by depending on promoter regions, which were defined as previous researches.(3) After all primer designing, the expected PCR product which consists of 192 bases, is shown in Figure 3.
pH dependency of promoter remote the releasing different amount of intrinsic factor in different pHs. The maximum releasing of intrinsic factor ought to be at pH 8.5. (1) It is also known that small intestine has alkaline pH.
After constructing that standard part, intrinsic factor protein is going to be isolated from extracellular medium to prove that protein of interest can be released to ileum.

Hey, I'm Vic, an undergraduate senior student majoring in mathematical statistics. Yet my research field is biology statistics, and that is why I'm here.
For IGEM, I'm mainly responsible for human practice and have been giving lectures as well as other promotions on both synthesis biology and IGAM. It is this special experience that has not only made my college life amazing, but also presented me with a broader view of biology. Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

BBa_K2464000- BBa_K2464002 are the parts that comprise our “improve a part” portion of iGEM. In pSB1C3 (and all iGEM vectors) the Biobrick prefix and suffix have homology to each other and because of this, attempts at Gibson assembly usually end with self-ligation of the iGEM vector and rejection of the insert. BBa_K2464000 is pSB1C3 with the typical RFP insert, except we removed “gcggccg” from the suffix, which was homologous to the prefix. The SpeI and PstI cut sites are preserved and this iteration of pSB1C3 that we’ve dubbed pSB1C3_Gibson is more effective in Gibson assembly. BBa_K2464001 and BBa_K2464002 are the forward and reverse primers, respectively, that we designed to perform Q5 mutagenesis on pSB1C3 to make pSB1C3_Gibson.

Gram stain:
The bacterial smear was flooded with Crystal Violet for one minute before it was rinsed with distilled water.   It was then flooded with Lugol's Iodine for one minute before being rinsed again.  The smear was then decolourized using alternating applications of 95% ethanol for ten second and then distilled water until the water running off of the slide runs clear.  The smear was then counter-stained with Safrinin for one minute before one last rinse  with distilled water, and being blotted with Kim-wipes to dry the slide.
These stains were performed for each plate, after which it was evident from the naked eye that the smears with E. coli were pink, and the smears with B. subtilis were dark purple.  In order to analyze the smears  further they were analyzed under a high-tech photo-microscope, for this cover slips were placed on the smears to protect both the bacterial smears and the microscope.
Figure 6: B. subtilis Gram stain of regenerated spores.
Figure 7: E. coli Gram stain of regenerated spores.
Spore stain:
Two bacterial smears were performed for the B. subtilis spores, before the stains were done.  To collect  the spores for the smear the suspended spores were centrifuged for two minutes at 14,000 rpm, so that the spores  could be collected from the pellet.  After the bacteria were fixed on to the slide and the smear was dried, the  slides were placed onto a hot plate, at 150 °C, for the Malachite Green staining.  A piece of paper  towel was placed over the smear so that it could be completely flooded and steamed with Malachite Green for five  minutes.  The smear was continuously damped with the stain for the entire five minutes.  After the five minutes  and the paper towel was removed the smear was rinsed with distilled water.  The smear was then counter-stained with Safrinin for one minute before the final rinse and drying.  The stain was visualized in the photo-microscope and a photo was taken using a mobile device as the microscope itself could not take coloured photos which were necessary to show the spores as green and the cells as not green.

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," main idea for our project, our true motivation for dedicating one whole year to that idea lied elsewhere. There are many studies performed by public healthcare entities stating that the morbidity of harsh diseases such as cancer, and the money required to treat them, is astronomically larger than what it takes to prevent them. This happens because too often, in order to diagnose these pathologies, they must be developed enough for our limited diagnostic tests to detect them, just when it is too late for treatment or when its effectiveness is already reduced. For our project, we wanted to design a handy preventive treatment - rather than a therapy - for colorectal cancer using synthetic biology.
Polyamines
Molecules
Polyamines are polycations and thus one of their main features is to interact with negatively charged molecules, such as DNA, RNA or proteins. Given their promiscuity in binding other molecules, they are involved in many functions, mostly linked with cell growth, survival and proliferation.
Polyamines are important players in plant growth, stress and disease resistance, but they are also involved in diseases, for example Alzheimer’s or infectious diseases. The main research area for the involvement of polyamines in diseases is cancer, as high levels of polyamines are observed in cancer cells. [1]
There exist 4 different polyamine molecules: Putrescine, Spermidine and Spermine (from low to high molecular weight), which are found in animal cells. Bacteria also include Cadaverine, which has a separate pathway from the three mentioned before, which are synthesized from L-methionine, L-ornithine and L-arginine (if bacteria) in contrast with this polyamine which is synthesized from L-Lysine.
Figure 1: Putrescine molecule
Figure 2: Spermidine molecule
Figure 3: Spermine molecule
Functions
Polyamines are involved in diverse functions involved in cell growth and differentiation, such as DNA synthesis and stability, regulation of transcription, ion channel regulation, and protein phosphorylation. [3]
Polyamines are essential for promoting cell growth. They are also implicated in apoptosis but as often with polyamines, with contradictory results. Polyamines increase Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria, modulating the mitochondrial permeability transition, and triggering apoptosis. Polyamines can also directly promote cytochrome c release, a prelude to apoptosis.They can also regulate the other type of cell death, necrosis.
Finally, polyamine levels generally increase with inflammation. However, whether they are pro- or anti- inflammatory is still unclear. [1]

CRISPR as a Diagnostic Tool
What is CRISPR?
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) refers to a family of DNA sequences originating from bacteria and archaea. CRISPRs are the basis of systems such as CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-CPF1, etc. which tools for editing genomes and diagnoses.
CRISPRs were discovered in archaea as a defense mechanism against viruses. They consist of repeating sequences of genetic code interrupted by “spacer” sequences which remain from previous invaders (Broad Institute 2018). CRISPRs aid the cell in detecting bacteriophage in subsequent invasions. The system works by transcribing the “spacer” sequences into short RNA sequences (called crRNAs) which guide the system towards matching DNA sequences - in this case, that of the bacteriophage. When the target DNA is found, CRISPR produces an enzyme which binds and cuts the DNA. Cas13a is an enzyme which goes beyond gene deactivation by indiscriminately cutting surrounding RNA (Gootenberg et al 2017). SHERLOCK is a diagnostic tool which relies on additional strands of RNA which release signals after being cleaved (Zusi 2018).
Modeling Collateral Cleavage Activity of CRISPR-Cas13a
We wanted to create a model to better understand the relationship between the amount of target DNA, amount of RNA, and the resulting collateral cleavage activity. We based our ODE’s and parameter values on the work done by the 2017 Munich iGEM team. For parameter values which could not be easily be found, we arbitrarily determined the values by inspecting various solutions to the set of ODEs. This inspection is demonstrated below. We also used a “general” degradation factor for each protein, mRNA, and RNA. Since proteins have a significantly higher half-life than mRNA, further experimentation/literature review should be done to determine exact values in order to produce reliable results with this model.
\(\frac{d[Cas13a_{M}]}{dt} = k_1 - \beta \cdot [Cas13a_{M}]-k_2 \cdot [Cas13a_{M}]\)

3. Zhigang Zou
 
On September 15th, we are honored to interview Mr.Zou (Zhigang Zou) from Nanjing University. Professor Zhigang Zou is a famous Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, researching into photocatalytic material. As a physicist and material scientist, he applied the technology of crystallography to catalyzing the hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and this work was published on Nature in 2001 and simultaneously commented by Science to mark its profound significance.
 
The biggest question Professors proposed is the reason why we choose E.coli instead of photosynthetic organisms such as algae. Next, Professor Zou’s laboratory has cast light on bio-hydrogen, as Xiong Wei from Zhejiang University would also join the lab after graduation. He planned to perform experiments on hydrogen produced by algae thus Professor Zou would love to establish cooperation with us. Professor Zou suggests that they can propose new thoughts and ideas about our iGEM project and bio-produced hydrogen from subjects of physics and materials. At last we owe our great thanks to Professor Zou Zhigang, Professor Yao Yingfang and Professor Yu Zhentao for their participation and support.
 
In conclusion, we did learn a lot from the interview. Firstly, we obtained more knowledge about the background of producing hydrogen, and thus, we have a much clearer concept of the current hydrogen-producing situation in China. Secondly, we knew more detailed advantages and disadvantages about hydrogen production catalyzed by nanomaterials. No doubt we received precious encouragements for our project.

1. CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee)
 
On 2nd-4th September, our team was invited by Sun Yat-sen University to attend CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee). The summit was a rehearsal of the Giant Jamboree in September. All the 26 teams invited to the summit were asked to give presentations about their project. The audience can ask questions about them. Besides, previous captains of Peking-iGEM were also invited to give speeches about the development of synthetic biology in China. We also brought our posters with us and discussed our projects with teams all around China.
 
During CCiC, our posters and presentations were very popular among all of the teams. Some of the iGEM teams that had great interests in our project came up with lots of suggestions and advice, which were of great help to improve our"

Sampling Protocol
Prior to sampling, kits were prepared in house under sterile conditions. Each kit consisted of:
Tweezers
Large KimWipes
Nitrile Gloves
70% ethanol
12 micro centrifuge tubes (4 per ambulance)
15 mm filter paper (1 per tube)
In the biological safety cabinet, 500 µL of 70% ethanol was pipetted into 2mL micro centrifuge tubes. Filter paper was carefully added to each tube and the tube was labelled to indicate the ambulance sampled, sample location and sampling week.
Sampling took place at the main Fire Station in downtown Lethbridge over the course of one month. Ambulances 1, 9 and 10 were sampled every Friday at 7:00pm and were on call at this time. Extra precautions were put in place to maintain sterility and avoid sample contamination. Nitrile gloves were worn by team members taking samples and 70% ethanol was used to sterilize gloves and tweezers, which were used to remove the filter paper from the micro centrifuge tubes after each location was sampled. Large KimWipes were used to dry the gloves before the next location was sampled.
The first area sampled was the SPO2 finger monitor located in the heart rate monitor kit. The filter paper was removed from the micro centrifuge tube to swipe the bottom part of the finger monitor where the patients finger would be inserted. Dimensions of the area swiped was approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. The filter paper was then carefully placed back in the centrifuge tube. Gloves and tweezers were cleaned with ethanol between samples. This process was repeated for sampling of the rear interior door handle and bottom of the soft kit. The sampling area was similar in size for each location to maintain consistency throughout the sampling protocol. Following data collection, the samples were stored at"

We can confirm the expression of Mtr CAB with the band of approximate molecular weight, but the expression of CcmA-H is not sure (shown in Figure 4). We attached a His-tag to Mtr C so the expression of MtrC can be confirmed by the result of Western blot (shown in Figure 5).
Figure 5. Western blot for membrane and periplasm fraction
Figure 6. Heme staining for membrane and periplasm fraction
To insure the function of Ccm A-H directly, we employed heme staining which is a common chemical analysis method for heme covalently bonding to peptides to confirm whether Mtr CAB protein was mature or not. According to the principle of heme staining, if Ccm A-H have catalyzed the attachment of heme to MtrA&C, there will be visible blue bond at corresponding position on the gel. By comparing the position of blue bond with protein marker, we made sure that our MtrA and MtrC are mature. These results proved that Ccm A-H functions well directly and our Ccm is expressed successfully indirectly (shown in Figure 6).
In a word, as the Mtr CAB protein complex have been matured, we can proved the expression of Ccm A-H indirectly and the function of Ccm A-H directly.
Figure 7. Bacteria PCR for strain expressing Mtr CAB only and WT
Figure 8. SDS-PAGE for strain expressing Mtr CAB only and WT
Besides, we design an experiment as a negative control. We transform the plasmids containing mtr (shown in Figure 7). Then we induce the expression of mtr without ccm under aerobic condition. We run SDS-PAGE and western blot of our samples (shown in Figure 8, Figure 9) and detect the heme via TMBZ stain (shown in Figure 10). It’s obvious that our MtrCAB is expressed compared with wild type from SDS-PAGE result. But there is no blue bond after TMBZ stain so we conclude that our Mtr is immature. These results also reveal the fact that Ccm A-H have no impact on the expression of MtrCAB but play a vital role in catalyzing the maturation of MtrA&C.

Queens_Canada,2018,Team:Queens Canada#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Science Rendezvous provided an opportunity to expose children of various ages to what our team does, and better explore the topic of DNA and cell biology, we were      thrilled to partner up with Science Quest at Queen’s University for a more focused session. Science Quest is a not for profit science, technology, engineering and mathematics      (STEM) based program that operates at Queen’s University. Fortunately, we were able to lead a short mentorship program for a group of students in grades 6-8 to teach them all      about DNA. Our lesson plan consisted of a short presentation outlining what DNA is, how is is transcribed into RNA, followed by the translation process to produce proteins.      We started by doing a helix-building exercise to teach about the structure of DNA and how the base pairing between nucleotides works. To do this, we utilized licorice,      toothpicks and mini coloured marshmallows for an informative (and yummy) experiment. The second part of our lesson plan was to teach the basics about how DNA codes for      different amino acids. By providing them with both the DNA and mRNA sequences, as well as a codon chart and list of amino acids, we created a “DNA code breaker” game for them      to play. By using the mRNA, they were able to determine which amino acid it was coding for, and then use the one-letter code to spell out our secret messages. We ended our      session with some fun cell biology and DNA trivia.

SynBio Club
QGEM has always had a focus to provide a high-quality research experience to its students and others in the Queen’s University community. During the school semester,      QGEM typically runs a SynBio Club to casually discuss novel ideas and showcase research being done at Queen’s by inviting professors to speak. We believe it is      essential to create a better understanding of the diverse range of applications synthetic biology has in research, medicine, agriculture, and the environment to      truly encompass and express its importance to society.
This year, we extended the club to the summer months, extending our invitation to those within the Kingston community. We created a new series of synthetic biology      presentations, each followed by a structured open discussion period. Each hour-long session highlighted a different synthetic biology application and focused on a      specific example from a recent scientific publication.

To measure fluorescence, it’s better to use minimal media than LB, a media that has a strong fluoresce signal because of the high amount of aromatic aminoacids. After four days of trials, I repeated the transformation protocol because I thought the mistake should be there since the strain I use has no auxotrophies. Finally, my LacI deficient strain with the plasmid containig the basic toggle switch grew in the media, ready to be tested in all the conditions I can!
Week 3
My bacterium has finally grown in minimal media, so it’s time to try out the toggle switch!
I set an overnight inoculum at 30ºC, to use it as a starting point for the experiment because none of the states is induced in this conditions. Then I made plaques with different dilutions and conditions to induce each of the states (IPTG for GFP, 42ºC for RFP). The next day, I llooked them in the UV lamp... Awesome results! The induced plaques gave the expected results; whereas the one at 30ºC without IPTG, was almost the same as the one with IPTG. To check if the GFP was expressed constitutively or the colonies were mixed, we used a fluorescence microscope and a fluorescence magnifying glass.
The magnifying glass helped us to probe that the colonies really expresed the corresponding fluorescent protein. Then, in the microscope we could see which color had each bacterium, and see the differences in populations in the induction conditions.
The results showed us that the switch to red was weaker than the other one, so I grew a liquid culture at 30ºC until it reached at Optical Density of 0.2, and I put it under the red-inducing temperature: 42ºC. Al every half an hour, I took a sample and looked it under the microscope, seeing how the population changed from green to red.
Also, we needed to check the stability of the red condition so some of the induced colonies we grew them at 30ºC, to see how long the RFP expression lasted. It took it one day to start dissapearing, but I hope that with the measures that the other members of our grup are developing, the performance of this genetic device will improve.
Week 4
After the trials I made last week, where I tried our the behaviour in a qualitative way, I needed to quantify the changes in the fluorescence in both proteins. First, we set the conditions where the measures didn’t interfere with each other. For"

On September 19th, Huandi Xu, Hongyu Wang and Yunge Lou went to Baima Park, Nanjing to join an event held by patients who regained their health from cancer.  Talented members prepared entertainments for everyone.  Several people shared their stories of fighting against cancer. One of the patients we interviewed, a Mr. Liu, received novel therapy during the 90s and luckily survived all these years.  As a beneficiary of the bio-therapy, he really inspired us and helped us to compassionately feel the significance of new treatments.
[Read more] [Backwards]
Mr. Liu was diagnosed with gastric cancer in 1995 and received resection immediately.  However, six months after that the cancer was found to have metastasized to his liver.  Even worse, the cancer cells soon spread among the two liver lobes and made it impossible to perform surgery. He sought treatment in several different hospitals but most of the doctors were pessimistic enough to suggest that he give up.  But he didn’t.  At last he heard that there was a new bio-therapy in PLA 454th Hospital.  At that time, the bio-therapy was still in clinical trial and patients suffered grave pain during the treatment.
[Read more] [Backwards]
Having no other choice, Mr. Liu chose to try out the new therapy, though there was no legal insurance and no guarantee was made.  During that time, he regularly received interferon and other biologicals, hoping to kill the cancer.  After 2 years of such practice, he surprisingly found that the tumor tissues had vanished and he became cancer-free.  And now it’s 2018.  Over the years, his recovery has become a legendary example of victory against cancer, inspiration for doctors and alike patients.  Mr. Liu also described to our team members the torture and possible side effects that could be brought by chemo-therapy.  He believes that our highly specific strategy would actually be of benefit and reduce the suffering of cancer patients, which truly encouraged us.
[Read more] [Backwards]
Mr. Liu emphasized on the significance of a drug’s specificity.  He himself endured the side effects of chemotherapy as it also damaged his healthy organs.  During his visits to other cancer patients, he also noticed other side effects such as hair loss and dermatitis.  Those effects not only lower the life quality of the patients, but more importantly reduce their confidence towards cancer"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this special prize , make sure you add your part number to your judging form and delete the box at the top of this page.
Please note: Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize."

Human practices
We organised different workshops from scientists about                  malaria or primer/probe design which were open for                  all interested students. There was also a pipetting test where                  more experienced students could give their knowledge to pipetting beginners.
At our “cake and science” events we presented our project to the public.
Interlab
We participated successfully at the fifth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. At the iGEM 2018 Vibrigens InterLab Study                  from Marburg we also take place.
Collaboration
We were able to establish a very pleasant and close                  collaboration with team Munich. They have mentored us with great                  care and reliability and answered all our questions.                  So, it was much easier to start a new iGEM team in Wuerzburg.                  We also received advice from different members of team Tuebingen                  who were so kind to exchange some valuable information and experience with us."

GAM1 promoter cloned from the mosquito genomic DNA
The DNA fragment of GAM1 promoter was amplified from gDNA of Aedes aegypti by PCR. The PCR products were cloned onto pSB1C3 vector and the sequence was confirmed by sequencing.
To test the function of GAM1 promoter, the part was assembled with GFP and polyA (Part: BBa_K2543005, GAM1-GFP-polyA/pSB1C3)
Mosquito GAM1 promoter is one of the AMP promoters driven by Toll or IMD signaling and activated by mosquito-borne pathogens
Green fluorescence observed by E. coli challenge
To test the function of the devices, C6/36 cells were transfected with the vectors. And the mosquito cells were challenged with bacteria on 2 days after transfection.
EXPERIMENT
↓ C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓ Cells were transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA vectors
↓ E. coli was added on 2 days post-transfection at MOI=10
↓ GFP positive cells and intensity were analyzed by a fluorescence microscope
RESULT
The figure showed ~50% GFP positive cells were present in the existence of E. coli under fluorescence microscope.

This year, we made a toolkit based on an endonuclease Csy4 and a RNA module named miniToe then applied it to polycistron system.  Coincidentally, the project of XJTU-China involves polycistron circuit. They use an hairpin coupling device to regulate the ratio of two CDSs which is the same goal to us. Each team thought it was a great idea if we could collaborate with each other on our project. For XJTU-China, it was difficult to model based on their project. We helped them to build model to calculate the coupling efficient of hairpin they designed.

As a result, the recombination strains were gradually eliminated in this competition.
This discussion lighted our another inspiration. Since the recombination strains can get growth advantage by losing heterologous genes, maybe it is possible for us to make recombination strains’ growth velocity overcome the normal, and                     reach the target of maintaining genes by converting the evolution direction.
After consulting to the papers, we decided to use TGATG linkage between two genes as our final project.

Dr. Li Teng, CEO
Dr. Li suggested two potential areas about the application of our project. The first is an automatic cell factory that can select beneficial mutations. He also suggested engineering regulatory parts to make the self-screening system capable of applying to different substrate and desired products.
We discussed with chief information official Dr. Li model analyzing. He suggested that we can competition model for prediction of sequence candidate performance during screening. The talk inspired us a lot for how to convert our project into an application, especially in modeling and designing.
Social Activities
Biological safety is one of the major issues of consideration since the very beginning of our project. But in practice, fuzzy expression is inevitable in legal language. Therefore, we established a collaborating program with ZJUT to produce a manifesto, calling for laws to regulate the use of antibiotics and biotechnology.
Prof. Ma Jianyin
National Academy of Foreign Legal History Study
The editor of China Nonprofit Review
We contacted the experienced judges Prof. Ma to get legal opinions on our research project. They were not able to give us a legal assessment, because the state of medical controlling in China based on too many different fields of law to                     find a quick answer. Instead, Prof. Ma explained to us his personal opinion. From his point of view, as long as it was safe and good to humanity, scientific research should be as unrestricted as possible. However, the abuse of antibiotics                     has lead to a series of environmental and medical problems including decreased immunity and antibiotics-resistant superbugs. The fundamental cause is the misunderstanding of biosafty. As a result, scientists should take the responsibility                     of popularizing scientific principles and promoting the legislation about life science.

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html,"ceptions and pre-conceived notions, that have not been addressed with sound explanations and elaborations.
Like most hobbyist pursuits, DIYbio appeals to a specific group of, for lack of a better word, geeks. And since it is still in its infancy, there has been minimal publicity to the masses. A lot of people simply have not heard of DIYbio. Even if they do come across DIYbio, the non-traditional lab setting and the fact that DIYbiologists don't have to be formally trained biologists, don't inspire much confidence. 
In general, the public's perception of any experimental science is that research is always conducted in sterile laboratories by smart people in lab coats. In some sense, this imagery is comforting. People want to believe that potentially dangerous research is (only) being done by the people best/most qualified to understand and deal with it.
So, while a DIYbiologist uses the word ""amateur"" to convey the idea that his hobby is extra-curricular, the public sees the adjective as an indication of the competence level of citizen scientists.
Due to all these factors, understandably, the public is bound to have some apprehension about DIYbiologists and their work. The survey we did, to get public opinion on DIYbio, reflects this quite clearly. It may be a long time before the masses are comfortable with their fellow citizens brazenly conducting biological experiments in their own homes.
Getting the general public's support, however, will be a crucial step if DIYbio intends to be a growing community.
In 2004, Art Professor Steve Kurtz was arrested on suspicion of being a bioterrorist. Authorities investigated his role in his wife's heart attack just because petri dishes and other laboratory equipment were found in his home.
As recently as 2008, retired chemist Victor Deeb's home in Marlboro, Mass. was found to have numerous vials of varying chemicals. None of them posed any biological or radiological risk, and most were no more harmless than typical household solutions. Authorities confiscated all of Mr. Deeb's materials, even though he had broken no laws.
These can be considered cautionary tales for DIYbiologists who also intend to conduct experiments in their own homes.
Points of Concern
Is the public wrong to be skeptical about the dangers of DIYbio? Unlike the other sciences, biology is the least understood and least predictable. Our understanding of biology is not extensive, and we default to the reductionist method in biological research for a good reason.
Non-supporters ask if DIYbiologists are able to handle the situation if an accident occurs?"

A couple of notes about our linearizations:
We need to clean up our restriction digests, especially the linearizations, using a PCR purification kit.  The problem is not so much the enzymes themselves as it is the components that go into the restriction digest (such as BSA).
Adrian suggested that we use a specific, well-characterized concentration of linearized DNA for our transformations.  He also explained why we should actually run a serial dilution on one of our transformations in order to determine the transformation efficiency.  This is how we can calculate it:
1) we know the amount of linearized DNA (in ng) that we add to a known number of cells (estimated from an OD measurement right after the 4 hr incubation)
2) we know the volume of cells that we distribute onto each plate
3) if we make serial dilutions (say, 100x dilution for each dilution) and plate the results on separate plates, we can observe how many
We should also run another gel on our PCr products just to make sure that we did not get pTEF.  We should only run the gel for"

I've never had the chance to take part in a competition like iGEM before, so this is a good opportunity to challenge myself as a researcher. I worked hard on designing the gene circuit, and I hope it works in both experiments and in modeling. I may continue on to a lab that does totally different things from what I am doing with iGEM now, but I hope that I will have wonderful memories of this project.
Outside of iGEM, I like playing electronic games and watching Japanese movies. I am really looking forward to my trips to Hong Kong and to Boston. I probably won't have a lot of extra time, but I would like to go shopping and try different types of food while I'm there.

Week 3 (9.07-13.07)
A little more Clone Manager work, as well as ordering synthesis of our primers and waiting for their arrival in our lab!
Week 4 (16.07-20.07)
Our new primers finally arrived on our lab tables! We started off with ‘no template PCR’ synthesis of our new promoter and RBSes. We ran electrophoresis of these products, and guess what? Again we were successful! So we ran more ‘no template PCRs’ – this time more RBSes and terminator were synthesized. The next step was clean-up of our PCR products - we checked their concentrations on NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Despite the low concentration of our parts, we decided to digest the promoter and GFP with EcoRI+SpeI, RBSes and terminator with XbaI+PstI. Then we started ligation: promoter with RBSes and GFP with terminator. Thanks to our FastDigest enzymes, both the digestion and ligation lasted much shorter than normally – one hour. We also ran the ligation in 4 °C for longer periods like over night or even over weekend.
Week 5 (23.07-27.07)
We ran PCR on the template of products of ligation, to check whether everything went fine. Then we ran gel electrophoresis, which unfortunately showed nothing at all. We tried to repeat all the ligations. We also needed to run another set of PCRs to get some more of our parts. We decided to run standard PCR of our ligation products: e.g promoter+RBS (left primer of promoter and right of RBS)
Week 6 (30.07-3.08)
We checked the concentration of DNA in our ‘no template’ PCR products by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop), some of the concentrations were very satisfactory, some were still pretty low. We found another way to confirm the presence of our parts – digestion using enzymes cutting inside the sequence. Also this time Clone Manager was very helpful and digestion method turned out to be much more useful. Gel electrophoresis of reaction products helped us to confirm wheater ligation went fine.
Week 7 (6.08-10.08)
We cloned out parts on plasmid pJET from CloneJET Cloning Kit, to multiply our parts on a plasmid. We decided we need to make 100% sure if the sequence of our parts didn’t mutate somewhere along the way (during all"

More than One Jewel on the Crown
——Polymerization and Maximization
Crown
This Crown will help us achieve the goal of selective polymerization of enzymes.
Polymerized enzymes, different from normal scattered condition, has much more opportunities to contact with the substrates. Therefore, our project aims to increase as well as to control the efficiency of complex reactions. We'll build a framework that make multi-enzyme complex easy to form, which we call a Crown.
And based on the success of the individual fusion protein (The first jewel) expression, we tried to add more jewels on the Crown.
In order to build a polymerase system, we make more fusion proteins bind to the same Connector. Then by adding enzymes, it has the practical effect of accelerating the reactions and enhancing efficiency of the production. So far, the Crown is built with more than one jewel shining on it.
Selective Polymerization
Our fused protein can not only be used to polymerize enzymes but also to control selective combinations. As the pathway showed in the picture, we can get different product by combining E1 and E2 together or combining E1 and E3 together. Therefore, we can control the direction of pathway by simply transforming different Connectee plasmid.
All the three enzymes involves are expressed in the bacteria. Each of fused protein contain ssDsbA,Lgt,FL3,enzyme,HL and TAL while the TAL part can recognize three different sites. We design two Connectee plasmids. Connectee1 has TAL recognition sites for E1 and E2 and Connectee2 has recognition sites for E1 and E3. By transforming P1 only into the bacteria, the fused proteins containing E1 and E2 will bind to the plasmid, thus produce S3 efficiently. Analogously, by transforming P2 into the bacteria, we can expect to get higher yield of product S4.
How to be a Craftsmen
A compact machine requires bold ideas and careful practicing. Here comes how we built our Crown.

Floating Device
In our project, by transforming the buoyancy device BBa_K737010(designed by ourselves), the gas vesicle cluster from the genome of Planktothrix rubescens into E.Coli, we succeed in making Escherichia.Coli floating on the surface of the water. It can help the cells produce the gas vesicle inside, which could make densities significant stratification in the culture. Not only the gene cluster but the two parts BBa_K737006 and BBa_K737007, which produce the gas vesicle structure protein, can also make the Escherichia.Coli floating. We use the shorter length of the part achieve a better effect than BBa_K190033 and the gas vesicle application prospect.

Key to Genetic Circuit Diagrams
This key explains some of the symbols used for the genetic circuit diagrams.
A promoter is a genetic element in DNA that regulates the transcription of a downstream gene. Promoters can be induced or repressed by external factors and the expression of the downstream gene is consequently under control of the same external factors. We use promoters as the control mechanisms under which the expression of our genes is controlled.
An RBS is a ribosome binding site. This is a region of DNA to which the ribosome binds in the initiation of protein translation. An RBS is required adjacent to each coding sequence to in order to have expression.
A Protein Coding Sequence is commonly referred to as a gene. This is a section of DNA of which the nucleotide sequence is translated by ribosomes into the amino acid sequence of proteins.
Terminators are required at the end of each operon (genes under control of one promoter) in order to signal to the RNA polymerase that the operon has finished, and to release from the DNA strand during DNA transcription. We have used double terminators as standard to improve the efficiency.

UIOWA,2018,Team:UIOWA#junyan_-_-_TEXT.html,", clean                 up wine stains, convert sugar into biofuels or medicines, and much more. These teams ranged from Pakistan,                 Kenya, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and dozens of other countries. Last year, the competition expanded to Iowa – we                 had the first team to ever compete in this competition from the state. Teams and projects are entirely                 student-initiated and driven, and the tasks that students undertake gives undergraduates the chance to explore                 synthetic biology through independent research. The competition provides students with an opportunity to                 develop academic and organizational skills and promotes the values of integrity, good sportsmanship, respect,                 honesty, celebration, cooperation, effort, and excellence.
About Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a maturing scientific discipline that combines science and engineering to design and                 build novel biological functions and systems. This includes the design and construction of new biological                 parts, devices, systems, as well as the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.                 It is a multidisciplinary field requiring expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, and mathematics.

Results:
Today we viewed our plants using confocal microscopy to try and detect any GFP-labelled bacteria. After viewing a few seeds washed in L-form solution under the microscope, we found a green fluorescing dot in the correct size range to be an L-form. No green dots were found in the rod cell or mannitol controls. Following these results we have decided to use confocal microscopy four days after washing our plants in L-form solution, rather than after one. As this co-insides with when Tsomlexoglou et al. used PCR to detect L-forms in their chinese cabbage.

Sequencing of QC J*4
J*4 (4) sequencing data shown to have many extra inserts, despite the desired mutagenetic site actually being correctly replaced. Two paths will be pursued:
J*4(1) (which is from plate 1 - another PCR condition (1ng plasmid)) to be sent for sequencing - obtain 2.5µL plasmids and dilute 1:1 in 2.5µL of Milli-Q. Sent for sequencing using VF2 and VR primers.
J*4(1) (which is from plate 1 - another PCR condition (1ng plasmid)) to be sent for sequencing - obtain 2.5uL plasmids and dilute 1:1 in 2.5uL of Milli-Q. Sent for sequencing using VF2 and VR primers.
If and when the sequences are correct, we will save the corresponding tube as a complete BioBrick (annotating that it has been QuikChanged), digest out the insert, cleanup, PCR the NcoI restriction site in, digest, and finally ligate into pBAD/HisB to make a functional plasmid.

Plasmids -
pSB1C3: D*, E*
pBAD33: D#
pBAD/HisB: M#, O#
After which, send for sequencing depending on degree of success. Unfortunately the gel ran too far and ‘ladder’ didn’t show up, which suggests that it is actually a mislabeled tube of loading dye. Re-made digests as only 3 ul of original is used. Will run gel again tomorrow with fresh ladder.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," adsorbed and into the bloodstream just over 90% of MeHg is inside the red blood cells in a ratio of approximately 10-20:1. Then it goes to the liver, where it can spread to all tissues of the body. The MeHg can overcome the blood-brain barrier by gaining a form of thiol conjugate that is similar to the amino acid methionine then it is easily accumulated in nervous tissue. The slow rates of biotransformation into Hg2+ explain the higher levels of MeHg in the CNS (Central Nervous System) than in the rest of the body. The MeHg can also cause damage to the kidney tissue quite rapidly, reaching stable levels within 3 hours after intoxication.
The damage and cell loss, such as neurons and glia cells, due to the toxic effect of MeHg are represented macroscopically with loss of cortical areas of the CNS. Besides pure neurological symptoms, many neuropsychiatric symptoms were seen on children that were conceived by mothers who were exposed to large amounts of MeHg during their prenatal lives. All due to acute injuries in the encephalon, causing loss of brain mass in determined cortex areas. Besides pure neurological symptoms, many neuropsychiatric symptoms were seen on children that were conceived by mothers who were exposed to large amounts of MeHg such as Akinetic mutism, Extreme shame, Communication difficulties, Lack of initiative and Lack of facial expression.
Poisoning by chronic exposure to low doses of MeHg also has the ability to cause harm to adults, even if not to the same severity in relation to fetal intoxication. Ekino et al. (2007), have reported cases in the distal regions of paresthesia of extremities, and around the lip region, in patients that had time exposure to MeHg prolonged at low doses even if exposure to the toxic agent has already ended 30 years. Regions such as the tongue, lips, fingers and thumb represent areas with the greatest loss of sensitivity due to these regions have large areas in the cortex devoted to their sensitivity.

July 3: Microsoft 8
I have been working with Microsoft 8 Beta version (!!) for the past couple of weeks and my conclusion is that, it’s alright.
I mean, I think that the user design (metro apps/ icons) is pretty, cause they have cute little boxes. But I feel like it’s going along the idea of apps like an ipad. I guess they support this kind of design because windows8 is the software that they’re going to be using in their new tablet. The idea apps as icons does make visual nicer. But when I’m programing my code using MIcrosoft Visual Studio, the computer automatically reverts back to a windows7 mode. So though it has windows 8 on it, when I’m actually doing work it’s in windows7. This make it seems as if windows8 is for funsies. (ohwell. I might change my opinion about it a bit…)
July 3: Programming
Programming can be quite hard sometimes. (I’m dealing with UI (user interfaces) = I need to make a database structure that is nice and pretty). Somehow, I kept on getting bugs and no matter what I tried, I couldn’t really do what I want the program to do. So hopefully, I can get it done soon, because i have soo much other work to do.
And today, we got 2 kids from a nearby highschool that will be joining our lab. I got assigned to one of the kids and to think that they are like 4 years younger than me, is kinda bizarre. I remember being in their place, testing out what it means to be doing research at a college/ graduate environment, only to find that I am learning a lot of things on my own instead of being taught of it by teachers. I remembered back then, secretly wishing that they can just take the time to teach me instead of having me to learn on my own (cause it’s so much harder to do that). But now, I realized that today, I did the exact same thing to the high school kids these grad students did to me. I gave my student a basic overview of what their project is going to be like and what they are going to be working on for this summer. Then, I pretty much gave them a lot of resources"
