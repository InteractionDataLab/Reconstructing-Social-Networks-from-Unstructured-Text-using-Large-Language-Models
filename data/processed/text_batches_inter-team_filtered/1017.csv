Characterization of Fluorescent Reporters:
Fluorescent proteins have become ubiquitous tools for studying cellular processes, and are frequently used to visualize the dynamics of synthetic networks in cells. To be particularly effective for these applications, fluorescent proteins must feature fast maturation and degradation rates, and these rates must be well-characterized and documented. The 2011 VT iGEM team has worked to find and characterize fluorescent proteins and degradation tags that more quickly degrade them.  Here, we present chemical and mathematical models based on two parameters, maturation and degradation rates, which will hopefully contribute to more quantitative characterization and usage of fluorescent reporters in the future, and will inform future efforts in parts characterization. In conducting our experimentation, we tested different fluorescent proteins with degradation tags in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using automated fluorescent microscopy techniques, and then worked to determine a comprehensive, accurate mathematical basis for fluorescent protein characterization.
Our team consists of 10 undergraduates from Virginia Tech, UNC Chapel Hill, James Madison University, The University of Maryland, Bluefield State College, and The College of William & Mary.  We would like to thank Dr. Jean Peccoud and the Synthetic Biology Group at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute for lab space, financial support, and guidance.

Remember to ask Adrian about making the stock solution for ampicillin

Decided to remake EDTA solution as well as Tris-Hcl EDTA solution.
Around 3.72 g EDTA in 100 mL to make a 0.1 M solution.  Then took 1 mL of this and 1 mL of 1M Tris-HCl and added water until a final volume of 100 mL to create 10mM Tris-HCl 1mM EDTA solution.  Autoclaved both.
Also decided to remake YPD plates and media.  250 mL of liquid for each one
25.0024 g YPD broth
5.0015 g Bactoagar
Note that we used a much newer autoclave than the one we usually use.  This still resulted in darkening the mixture, which we discovered is typical of YPD media after it has been autoclaved.
Met with Jeff Laney today.  He provided us with some excellent advice concerning our construction strategy.  In particular, he helped to convince us that the easiest approach for inserting all five constructs into single yeast cells is to utilize two or three separate shuttle vectors to insert different constructs into different haploid yeast strains and then mate the two strains together.  For example, one can insert constructs #1-3 into the first yeast strain using pRS304, pRS305, and pRS306 (select using triple dropout of ura, leu, and trp) and then one can insert constructs #4 and 5 into the second yeast strain with pRS303 and pRS304 (select using double dropout of his and trp).  One would then mate the two strains and plate the resulting cells onto dropout for his and also for either leu or ura, using one selection marker that is unique to each strain.  This would ensure that only cells that had incorporated all inserts would survive, but also only necessitate the usage of four different auxotrophic markers rather than five.  He also generously provided us with two haploid yeast strains, W303_1a (3-9-1) and W303_1alpha (3-9-2), which can be mated together to produce a diploid W303.  W303 is auxotrophic for leu2, trp1, his2, ura3, and (possibly) ade. "

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With"

Figure 9: TALE capture assay was done with TALE B  ( ) BBa_K1189001 )and TALE A B-lac fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) and DNA ( BBa_K1189006 ) with both target sequences. If capture is successful, the TALE A β-lactamase is present in the well giving a colour change from pink to yellow when subjected to benzylpenicillin substrate solution within 20 minutes. The only wells that change colour are the first four wells which contain TALE B, specific DNA, and TALE A β-lactamase fusion and our positive control wells which are the controls for our fusion TALE A β-lactamase protein and our positive recombinant β-lactamase. All our other controls including our test using a non-specific sequence of DNA remained pink . This preliminary characterization data demonstrates that the TALEs are able to bind to DNA with specificity. Additionally it also shows that our system of capturing DNA with two detector TALEs and then subsequent reporting of the DNA’s presence works.
In order to alleviate concerns over the use efficacy of Phenol red as an indicator for the pH change created by the use of benzylpenicillin in our experiment we decided to investigate the use of bromothymol blue. This indicator covers a similar pH range however it produces a strong and distinct colour change from blue (pH > 7.6) to yellow (pH < 6.0). Additionally the change in colour can easily measured using spectroscopy. We can either measure the disappearance of blue colour at an absorbance wavelength of 616 nm or the appearance of the yellow colour at 453 nm.

In order to assist the modelling efforts of the team the dot assay of Prussian blue ferritin and TMB was repeated upon nitrocellulose. The goal of this assay was to determine the lowest amount of Prussian blue ferritin acting as a reporter with the naked eye. Based on the results of this assay it was determined that 2.5 ng of Prussian blue ferritin produced the minimum colourimetric output that could be detected with the naked eye. Additionally this week we tested β-lactamase using banzylpenicillin as a substrate in combination with bromothymol blue as a pH"
Austin_UTexas,2015,Team:Austin UTexas#Project#Plasmid Study_-_-_TEXT.html," a day, showing the SYFP2 gene is very unstable across generations. The SYFP2 plasmids most often accumulated IS (insertion sequence) element inserts, which completely prevented the expression of the fluorescent protein. The most common IS elements observed were IS10R and IS10L. Furthermore, S10L/R expressed preference for a particular nucleotide location (GGCGTAGTACC) within the SYFP2 gene. Two point mutations were also independently observed in two samples of SYFP2.  One mutation converted resulted in the loss of a start codon.
Plasmids that contain the YFP gene also tended to display instability. Samples with the YFP gene often broke after approximately five days, and a myriad of mutations appeared to have contributed to this instability. IS elements were another common feature among the YFP group. Point mutations in various locations also appeared in the YFP group, such as in the promoter and ribosome binding site. Two samples also featured a large deletion from the plasmid.
The BFP group of plasmids also had high instability, similar to the SYFP2 group of plasmids. This group of plasmids lasted around only a few days before their devices broke. IS elements were very common in the BFP plasmid group along with promoter deletions.
Interestingly, the EYFP and ECFP plasmid groups were incredibly stable, remaining fluorescent for over ten days. Only one sample in the entire EYFP group displayed a mutation, which was a promoter deletion. Only two mutations were shown in the entire ECFP group, a large deletion and an In-del mutation. Overall, these two fluorescent proteins have shown to be very stable (see Table 1 for full results of mutations).
Based on the patterns of mutations, it is clear that IS elements are a major source of instability in plasmids in this strain of E. coli, Top10. Furthermore, because of the common location of insertion for IS elements, they must have a sequence preference. By changing the sequence, it it may be possible to increase the stability of plasmids by eliminating a primary source of mutation. Furthermore, by elucidating the contribution that IS elements make towards the instability, we can anticipate these events and account for such instabilities when designing plasmids for future experiments.
One of our team members also developed a Computational Approach to categorizing the mutations.  We believe this will be of great help to us as we begin to analyze our larger data set(s).

Rutgers,2013,Team:Rutgers#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the peptide initiates a change in the expression of certain genes. This could result in bioluminescence in some strains of bacteria such as Vibrio fischeri, or the release of virulent factors in other strains such as Staphylococcus aureus5. S. aureus infections can be devastating or relatively minor. It can result in lesions, blood poisoning, and septic arthritis amongst other conditions.
The peptides are only effective when numerous bacterial organisms are present. If only a few are present, the effect will not be large enough to succeed. In principle, it should be possible to eliminate bacterial infections by intercepting this communication system. In fact, Park et al. demonstrated this potential. But, first, a little more information regarding S. aureus is necessary. The two main virulent factors in the organism are protein A and alpha-Hemolysin with both proteins being regulated by quorum sensing3. They showed that interrupting the signaling communication on blood agar plates diminished expression of alpha-Hemolysin. Additionally, it was shown that staphylococci infection in mice was reduced with the administration of an antibody to bind the autoinducing peptide3. This research offers promise that quenching of autoinducing peptides can be a viable treatment. Utilizing quorum quenching treatments over traditional antibiotics is advantageous because it does not provide selective pressure against the bacteria3. The expression of virulent factors is suppressed, but the essential metabolic activities of the individual bacteria are not disrupted and bacterial resistance developed as easily.
GOAL
We hope to take the research described above a step further by designing an enzyme to disrupt the quorum sensing system by degrading the autoinducers. While antibodies can bind to autoinducers, they cannot hydrolyze them. Additionally, antibodies are bulky structures, which can pose problems for drug delivery applications. The particular peptide precursor for MRSA has a thioester linkage created from a bond between a cysteine residue and the terminal carboxyl group. The thioester linkage will be the target for the enzyme to hydrolyze the peptide precursor and disrupt the quorum sensing system of the bacteria.

We are continuing to gain more knowledge of Maya, Autocad and Matlab we will be prepared to create quantitative and visual models. This week we also started looking into mathematical modelling for biological systems and gaining background knowledge in the field through literature. In particular, we looking into basic definitions, process of modelling, relation between state variables and description methods, time constants for cellular processes, fundamental of enzyme kinetics, cell division and growth. By studying and learning proper methods of quantitative analysis we will be able to directly perform this aspect of modelling when our system is ready.  We began brainstorming what important aspects of the project we can quantitatively model and what would be useful to help us in the initial design phase.  As of next week, a proposed sensor will be chosen and then we will resume our process with the Arduino Uno microcontroller and writing programs to control the device as we will be able to select a sensor based on our reporter.  Additionally we researched the potential of using a voltage or current sensor with the device and are currently looking into this option.
Week 6: June 9th - June 13th
This week we contacted two microfluidics experts to get insight on this topic and to answer some of the questions we have. Dr. Karan Kaler replied to us saying that he is away at the moment, but will be back in July and will be willing to meet up with our team to assist with the project. He said that their research lab is currently utilizing droplet based microfluidics for the detection of human pathogens using chip based real time qPCR technology developed in their laboratory. He thinks it may be relevant to us and suitable for us to explore. This week we also continued working with Maya and Matlab software. Dave submitted a request so we can get SimBiology toolbox for Matlab that will be very useful for quantitative modelling. We also got the 2013 version of Autodesk Maya instead of 2015 so that we can get ePMV plug-in that can be used for modelling and animation purposes.
After installing the software, we watched tutorials to get familiar with how the plug in works. Unfortunately, so far the tutorials we found were not very useful, so we will continue to look for more resources. Also, we reviewed the process of transformation and watched existing animations so we can create our own transformation animation in the near future for the purpose of practicing our animation skills. We also found an online written tutorial for Autodesk for Maya which is so far the best teaching resource for Maya."

End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005, working on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he in addition became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund, working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are followed: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

Sequencing
Sequencing conducted by the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center’s sequencing centers.
 
Growing cultures
Cultures grown for induction were incubated at 37C. OD600 for initial assays were measured to be around 1.5. In latter assays, cells were diluted to be OD 600 ~0.6-0.7. Initial cultures were always grown in LB.
 
Induction
Induction of rhamnose to drive KaiA expression conducted in M9 minimal media with supplements: 0.4% glycerol and 0.1% casamino acids. Induction solutions made with varying concentrations of rhamnose in order to characterize the input-output ratio of rhamnose to KaiA. This was significant for us to be able to vary the concentrations of KaiA and to develop more robust oscillations. Induction conducted for 10 hours at 30C. Induction protocol followed from Silver Lab (Chen, A. H., Lubkowicz, D., Yeong, V., Chang, R. L., & Silver, P. a. (2015a). Transplantability of a circadian clock to a noncircadian organism. Science Advance, 1(5), 1–6. http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500358 ) .
 
Synchronization
Synchronization to synchronize the KaiABC clock was conducted by incubating induced cells in M9 minimal media only (no supplements or inducer). Synchronization conducted for both 1 hour and 6 hours. Silver lab reported 1 hour synchronization while Rust lab has seen 6 hours to be adequate for cyanobacteria.
 
Oscillation Time Course
Following synchronization, cells were reintroduced in M9 media with 1mM leucine and 0.5% succinate supplements to allow for slow growth. Oscillations were tracked by freezing 2 mL cell samples every 6 hours in a -80C freezer. The time duration for tracking oscillations was set at 3 days. No rhamnose was added back, due to Silver lab’s reports of desynchronization of oscillations attributed to reintroduction of inducer with their construct.

Transfer the HiBind®DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 30-50 μL Elution Buffer or deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.
Note: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind®DNA Mini Column is dependent on pH. If eluting DNA with deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.
Let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
Note: This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.
Store DNA at -20℃.

Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," worked on developing activities that would appeal to the interests of a young audience, as well as making the activities as interactive as possible. We believed that it was important to ensure that the lessons involved low-resource activities that could be shared and used by teachers in schools, since this would enable the education of a wider cohort of school students. We also wanted to demonstrate that synthetic biology is an accessible field that all school students should feel able to pursue, and did not want to create artificial barriers by suggesting that synthetic biology could only be understood and accessed with specialist knowledge and equipment.
The structure of our lesson plan involved a brief introduction where we explained the principles of synthetic biology, followed by a carousel of activities where small groups moved around the room to participate in different stations. Each station had a task with a specific learning objective to ensure that the teaching and discussions were structured and focused. We believed it was important to demonstrate the range of tasks involved in synthetic biology and iGEM, including workshops explaining the structure of proteins, the use of Snapgene, modelling and the assessment of ethical issues associated with synthetic biology.
Station 1: Proteins and Pymol (20 minutes)
Station 2: Snapgene (20 minutes)
Station 3: Modelling (20 minutes)
Station 4: Ethics (20 minutes)
In line with Kuddell’s advice that all teaching about synthetic biology “should include sociological aspects”, we devoted an entire station to the discussion of the ethics of synthetic biology. We created a workshop containing examples of scenarios where genetic engineering has been used, and created a series of questions to prompt discussion and debate among the students. This workshop effectively addressed Kuddell’s four aims of synthetic biology teaching, since the relaxed, informal platform for debate enabled students to articulate their views on controversial scenarios and focus on a variety of issues, such as safety and possible risks imposed by the use of genetic engineering in each scenario.
The outline of our workshops on Proteins and Ethics can be viewed below.

Ethics Lesson
Feedback
Student satisfaction is an important factor determining the engagement, student understanding and success of teaching. We spoke to students and course directors after our teaching sessions to gain feedback, and acted upon this to improve our future lessons to different summer school programmes.
Feedback from initial lessons:
Some students felt that the content was difficult to understand if they didn't have an educational background in biology.
The first lesson overran quite significantly, and there wasn’t enough time for the students to complete the last station’s activity.
Some groups of students were very engaged in the Ethics station, but some groups remained reticent and difficult to"

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Some data
2050: Approximatly 40% less rain
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost:
They are using ancestral techniques. They grow the leaves high enough in order to avoid the frost damage.
Drought:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
There is more and more extreme climate change in France. Some region suffer from freezing for several years already. Our project is a good initiative for the coming years.

Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost:
To fight frost they are using wind turbines that allow to brew the air.
Drought:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
The climate change is becoming more impacting than before. Moreover, drought cause also wood diseases and there are no treatments to avoid these lost currently. Consequently, I think that your project is welcome right now and for the future years.

How do you run Clotho on a Mac? - See the information below provided by Ralph Santos.
You don't have the answer to my question!! - Sorry about that. Send us mail and let us know so we can fix it!
Clotho On a Mac
To determine whether you can run Clotho on Mac OS, you need:  * An Intel-based Mac with a 64-bit processor (Core 2 Duo) * Mac OS 10.5.2, and have Java for Mac OS 10.5 Update 1 installed.  If you're not sure whether you have this, run the System Profiler application  (open the ""Applications"" folder, open ""Utilities"", double-click on ""System Profiler"")  and look at the ""Processor Name:"" line on the ""Hardware Overview"" page.  [see figure ""profilerwindow_highlight.png""]  Even with the update installed, Mac OS normally runs Java 1.5 by default, so  double-clicking on the Clotho JAR file will normally create an error.  Mac OS  can be configured to run Java 6 by default by using the ""Java Preferences"" application.  The ""Java Preferences"" application normally lives in the ""Java"" folder in the ""Utilities"" folder inside ""Applications"".  The ""General"" tab shows the priorities  for selecting the versions of Java used for running applets and applications.   To set Java 6 as the default Java runtime, look at the ""Java Application Versions"" list and drag the line that reads ""Java SE 6"" to the top.

Johan: Interesting way of increasing expression by adding a gene for a rare tRNA
""Within Escherichia coil and other species, a clear codon bias exists among the 61 amino acid codons found within the population of mRNA molecules, and the level of cognate tRNA appears directly proportional to the frequency of codon usage. Given this situation, one would predict translational problems with an abundant mRNA species containing an excess of rare low tRNA codons. Such a situation might arise after the initiation of transcription of a cloned heterologous gene in the E. coli host. Recent studies suggest clusters of AGG/AGA, CUA, AUA, CGA or CCC codons can reduce both the quantity and quality of the synthesized protein. In addition, it is likely that an excess of any of these codons, even without clusters, could create translational problems."" - Effects of rare codon clusters on high-level expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli

Gene Contamination has been proposed as a potential hazard by Chinese specialist. Transgenic suffered from 3 aspects of nondeterminacy, the chain reactor after the altered of life structure, the potential risk of the food chain and the transgenic contamination, propagation, proliferation, and clear. Until the beginning of the 21st century, transgenic contamination has occurred in many countries world widely, such as Starlink Corn in America, transgenic canola in Canada and corn transgenic contamination in Mexico. All of these facts prove that the hazard of transgenic contamination could not be regarded. But for the limitation of the statistics, many prediction and analysis couldn’t be conducted. In our modeling process, we start from the most fundamental problem, trying to construct a right stream of proposing, analyzing and solving problem from detail to macroscopy. Two models concerning proposing problem predicted the hazard of genetic contamination. The analyzing model focused on a variety factors relating with the attitudes of four major group in society, government, industry, public and institutes. The solving model emphasized on two hands, one is the effectiveness of our project and, on the other hand, the publicizing strategy referring to the necessity of the mastery of the genetic safety knowledge. What's more, parts of our modeling can be adapted to most of the similar issues, which is a acceptable reference for the followup teams.
iGEM Project evaluation model
The Problem
Our projects need to be evaluated through eyes of public, especially through comparison with other similar projects. Evaluation are difficult to be done without comparison, to evaluate our project of genetic safety, we have compared our AegiSafe O-Key with other similar gene safety projects: that of the 2011 Imperial college of London and of the 2011 Yale University. After thoroughly investigation of how others evaluate scientific projects, we have made up an evaluation system to assess our project through eyes of people who have been introduced about our projects. What is more, this system can also be used to comprehensively"

Collaboration with the Gaston Day School iGEM Team
Henna Saqibo, Lilith Tang, Parth Patel, and William Henry conversing over project plans.
We collaborated with the Gaston Day School team this year to provide advice and analysis of their project. We maintained a line of communication and advised their team on how to proceed with Arabinose Induction to characterize certain part submissions. We sent them a specialized E. coli strain optimized for Arabinose Induction to replace the E. Coli K-12 strain that was being used. This specialized strain has been used in our lab from North Carolina and sent to them. We consulted our faculty mentor and engaged in thorough troubleshooting of their issues such that errors in procedures were identified and modified for better experimental results. We sent Parth Patel, a graduate of the Gaston Day iGEM team, to personally discuss plans, identify courses of action, and relay samples, creating a solid bridge of information and aid to the team. We analyzed a colicin sample transformed in the pSB1C3 backbone through gel electrophoresis and sent back sequencing results that could not have been readily obtained by the team to determine the status of their transformations and further troubleshoot procedures. Following the competition we will continue to aid the team by doing transformations of colicin from original stocks into plates that contain antibiotic resistance so that the Gaston Day team's project may further progress from a solid baseline."

    Radio
The university of Leicester iGEM Team has been advertised multiple times on the radio, with our project leader having an interview regarding the citizen science project to the audience of Tea Time with Ben Jackson Live on BBC Radio Leicester.
The team has also appeared on Down to Earth, the BBC Radio Leicester show hosted by Dave Andrews due to the link between the Environment Team at the University and the project leader. As it just so happened the Environmental Manager Dr Emma Fieldhouse has a plot at the Aylestone Allotments where the Down to Earth program was recording a radio show, and invited the team along to talk to the other plot holders, with many more Citizen Science kits being sold and planted in very rich bacterial locations around the allotment. This valuable link between the iGEM Team and the Environment team brought about by the aims of the project to reduce waste and recycle has made it possible for the team to utilise quite a few of their organised events to advertise.
Both of these broadcasts caused massive increases in blog views as well as resulted in increased sales of Citizen Science kits, making them a valuable advertising source to a wide audience
    In the Press
We have had many news articles in the press, from an article in the Leicester mercury to multiple appearances from the university press office, GENIE, the University of Leicester Environment team and in articles and newsletters.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Promoter Probe Plasmid
BioBricks made and used: BBa_K2205026 (New) , BBa_J61002 (Arkin Lab, 2006)
The Original Part and Our Improvements
The Arkin Lab team (2006) produced the promoter probe plasmid ( BBa_J61002 ) for the testing and characterisation of the Anderson promoter library ( BBa_J23100 - BBa_J23119 ). When using this part to characterise the synthetic promoter library produced in this project, many issues concerning expression arose.
In order to combat these limitations, a new plasmid has been designed to improve the expression of the BBa_J61002 plasmid. Firstly, a bidirectional terminator has been inserted upstream of the iGEM cloning site in order to prevent any leaky expression from the plasmid backbone in which contains a promoter in the reverse direction.  In order to obtain the ability to repress the expression of the promoter being tested, a Lac Operator sequence has been inserted immediately downstream of the promoter insertion site.  The ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 which is present within the plasmid, is not flanked by any restriction site in order for the swapping out of RBSs. In order to give the plasmid this ability, two restriction sites SacI and BamHI were inserted flanking its sequence.  This is to allow for the RBS to be changed at will if the user wishes to screen a library of RBS as well as promoters.  Finally, the reporter gene currently present in the"

To prove our concept that:
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which                         can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can                         control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The copy numbers are shown in the table below:
Table.1 The copy numbers of different plasmids.
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with                                 different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold                                 of plasmid numbers to meet different needs.
Fig.1 The device constructed to express the inhibitor with a constitutive promoter.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have chosen:
Table.2 The strengths and efficiencies of different promoters and RBS.
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the                                 concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed these circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
In the wet experiment, after the same amount of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
The strength of J23106 is stronger J23116, we can clearly know the inhibitor protein have a positive correlation with plasmids number.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship between the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the"

We used 158 µL of the supernatant with 40 µL and added 2 µL of 20 mM ABTS to measure some activity (Fig. 6). Nevertheless we couldn't see any increase in absorbency at 420 nm after 5 minutes, indicating, that we have no active laccase in the supernatants.
Sunday August 5th
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
The assemblies don't work by now in one step by now, we always get just red colonies from the original RFP plasmid. So we started to clone one part after another in pSb1C3 backbone. For this reason we want to ligate the ecol gene without any promoter in pSB1C3 backbone and in the next step do a prefix insertion with the promoter fragment. Therefore we did the restriction of ecol and ecol_HIS PCR products, the ligation in pSB1C3 and the transformation.

In order to allow more diabetic patients to realize the dangers of the development of chronic                         kidney disease in the later stage, and to help the middle-aged and the elderly to improve their                         awareness of prevention, our team members have carefully designed the Kidney Diseases Brochure.                         The brochure includes four aspects including the causes of kidney disease, how to detect kidney                         disease, warning signs of kidney disease and how to prevent kidney disease.
In July 2018, the team members came to the Jianshan Community in Dalian to hold a knowledge                         lecture on early prevention of kidney disease. At the Community Activity Center, we distributed the brochures to everyone to let them learn about the dangers of kidney disease, the causes of                         kidney disease and ways to prevent early kidney disease. After our explanation, residents’                         awareness of CKD has been significantly raised. During the promotion process, the residents                         asked many questions about diabetic nephropathy. The team members have answered them one by                         one.
Through this event, growing number of people were aware of the importance of regular medical                         examinations and have a deeper understanding of kidney disease. They also learned about the                         prevention of diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephropathy through this opportunity.

Publicity on the Campus Day
In May 2018, on the Campus Day of Dalian University of Technology, the DLUT_China_B team carried                         out a series of activities to expand the influence of synthetic biology and iGEM competition at                         Dalian University of Technology. Them designed the “Prize-giving Quiz” game to give the guests a                         general knowledge of biology. “Understanding Micro-World” provides visitors with microscopes and                         some samples made by the team members which let them to observe and understand the microbes we                         can't see. This part attracted many primary and middle school students.
This exhibition not only introduced synthetic biology and iGEM competitions, but also promoted                         our Dr. Familict project to let more people know the seriousness of kidney disease. We also got                         some valuable market research data. The public has given considerable attention to the project,                         which also makes our project more meaningful.

Bioartist Collaboration: Linden Gledhill
Linden Gledhill is a scientist inspired to art. Like us, he uses the tools of science, in his case advanced microscopy and high speed equipment to break down the physical work at different spatial and temporal scales. We noticed his pictures of azo dyes crystals on flickr and contacted him over a potential collaboration. After contacting him over azo dyes photos, discussing possible experiments we could carry out (LCMS, azodyes auxotrophy) and ending our conversation on discussing zombies and a ferro-fluidic attack on humanity, we got him on board to help us. He kindly offered us to use his pictures and videos of azo dyes cystallisation both in our website and exhibition. IN addition to the possible ways of using his images he gave us advice on how to make them ourselves, with the dyes we were decolourising in the lab. We exposed a video at out UncolourmeCurious event using some footage he sent us of the crystallisations. Unfortunately we weren't able to use the pictures on the website due to the mandatory Creative Common policy of the iGEM website. It was nevertheless very interesting to have some perspectives from a scientist and artist on the project, hearing how he moved from science to art and was then able to display the beauty of the microscopic work.
The Slade Collaboration: Putting it All in Context
We wanted to reach out even further into the Arts community, to get people thinking about dyes and how they are used. We collaborated with The Slade School of Fine Art and with them unthreaded the chemical history of the dye industry. We constructed a timeline that highlighted the ancient and pre-industrial uses of pigments, to the rise of the azo dye, to help contextualise the Slade's Salon installation in the UCL Wilkins Building, and highlight the terrific importance of azo dyes to the way we use colour.
#UncolourMeCurious Conceptual Short Film
We knew that the exhibit would engage the public but we asked ourselves, what about those who do not live close enough to visit and learn about this issue? To achieve this we created the conceptual art film #UncolourMeCurious designed to present our project in an abstract way open to interpretation, whilst maintaining the core concept of dec"

Waterloo,2013,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," developed a comprehensive project, which attempts to improve an existing system that utilizes the use of DNA as the intracellular molecule for messaging between individual bacterial populations. The process of messaging was improved by making the DNA message 1) Modifiable, 2) Controllable and 3) Re-transmittable.
Wet Lab
Submitted 21 BioBricks to the Parts Registry
Characterized 4 BioBricks
Mathematical Modelling
Modelled the qualitative difference in the dynamics of Bxb1-based and PhiC31-based invertible promoter switch systems using continuous and stochastic methods.
Modelled a two-switch system where the first invertible promoter switch controls the second one, and showed that this improves the “switch-like” behavior of the second switch in multiple copies.
Modelled a system of DNA message re-transmission in co-culture and identified potential modes of failure.
Appendix
Serine Integrase
Our design for modification of a DNA message uses the site-specific recombinase activity of serine integrase enzymes found naturally in various bacteriophages.
In nature, serine integrases (Int) allow phages to integrate into the bacterial genome through site-specific recombination between attachment sites on the phage and bacterial genomes (attP and attB), both of which are between 30 and 60 bp depending which phage serine integrase is considered.  Recombination between attP and attB leaves behind left and right attachment sites (attL and attR) (Fig 1), which cannot be acted upon by Int alone.  Thus, in the presence of Int alone, this recombination is irreversible [1].
In order for the phage genome to excise from the bacterial genome, recombination between attL and attR sites must occur; this reproduces the original phage and bacterial genomes.  To this end, phages that exploit serine integrases also have a “recombination directionality factor” (RDF) which reverses the recombination activity of Int; that is, coexpression of Int and RDF allows recombination between attL  and attR sites to reproduce attP and attB sites, and inhibits recombination of attP and attB (Fig. 1) [1].
Figure 1.  Recombination between attP and attB leaves behind attL and attR sites and allows for integration of the phage genome into the bacterial genome in nature.  RDF reverses this activity.  Adapted from Groth and Calos, 2004 [1].

Furthermore, we created calculators based on our mathematical models, which took variables--such as wastewater flow rate, bacteria concentration, and biofilm surface area--into consideration, to calculate the amount of PR bacteria or biofilm necessary to trap NPs. Lastly, we tested our PR bacteria and biofilm in realistic conditions by constructing a simulated WWTP (for example, see our biofilm trapping gold NPs in a simulated tank below!).

Video 5-2 Testing biofilm in simulated sedimentation tanks. Based on Boswell’s circular tank design, we built our own “sedimentation tanks” using clear plastic tubes, and attached biocarriers to a central spinning rotor. Three tanks were set up: biofilm + distilled water (left), biofilm + AuNP (middle), and AuNP solution alone (right). After about 30 hours of mixing, the color of the AuNP solution started to change from purple to clear in the cylinder containing biofilm. In contrast, the cylinder containing only AuNP solution did not change at all. Timelapse video shows the tanks 36 hours after the start. Experiment & Video: Yvonne W.
Boswell Wastewater Treatment Plant
Not all WWTPs are as large as the one in Taipei. One of our advisors (Jude Clapper) went to visit the Boswell WWTP in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. We learned that the same processes that occur in the Taipei Dihua WWTP also occur in the Boswell WWTP, but with different water flow rates and waste quantities. Since both facilities use a similar water purification process, we were inspired to create our current prototype design--a rotating polymeric bioreactor coated in biofilm--which is applicable to both WWTPs. This prototype will be placed in the secondary sedimentation tank, where the majority of organic solids have been removed and only smaller particles exist. The plant manager, Robert J. Blough, also confirmed that since our project is bacteria-based, it will be killed by UV light and chlorine in the disinfection tank, similar to the Dihua WWTP, before the water turns into effluent and goes to the rivers and oceans.
We plan to add our bacteria either to the deep aeration tanks or the secondary sedimentation tanks. The disinfection tank will then kill the bacteria used in previous tanks.Figure: Christine C.

The following pages thoroughly present our data. The hours of work in the lab were easily justified by the excitement of new results, and we hope that you immerse yourself. We invite you to dig deeper to view our results and to experience our excitement. But before you do that, this page points to our main accomplishments and presents a quick glance at the most cherished of our results: the production of Bacteriorganic Rubber.
To quickly recap, we had two subprojects: optimization of the MEP pathway to increase the amount of building blocks (IPP IPPIsopentenyl pyrophosphate and DMAPPDMAPPDimethylallyl pyrophosphate) for rubber synthesis; and the introduction of the rubber polymerization enzyme HRT2 prenyltransferase of Hevea brasiliensis, into the E. coli bacteria. First, let's look at the latter.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html,"ered Machine” and as the first word of this acronym indicates, countries and universities from all over the world are well represented. The iGEM competition has grown into a diverse community with a great range of nationalities, cultures and languages represented. The competition took its name in 2005, when 14 teams from 4 different countries came together to develop novel ideas based on synthetic biology. At that time, German and English were the only two languages represented. Since then, the competition has grown, reaching the 100 team milestone in 2009 and climbing to a staggering 245 teams from 32 different countries with 20 languages this year, its 10th anniversary. The competition has been expanding in all directions. Different teams compete in different tracks, for different awards and there is now a separation between undergraduate and overgraduate teams.
The language that all the teams communicate their project is English, as per lingua academica. In the spirit of synthetic biology, where standardization and application of the same principals throughout the discipline is promoted, it is certainly essential that all the stakeholders have a common language of communication. Rapid international expansion and the necessity of a single language however present many challenges which need to be addressed.
English as the lingua franca of science
The vast volume of scientific information available in today’s “Information Age” demands effective management and distribution to individuals and institutions. Such communication of ideas across cultures and national borders requires the use of a common language. During the 20th century, English became the primary language for international communication in science and business (Tardy 2006) and English-speaking countries (mainly US and the UK) are the major players in the distribution and generation of knowledge, as demonstrated by their domination in the university and journal rankings.
The status of English as lingua academica does not come without its controversies. In non-English speaking countries, the main role of English is the reporting of professional knowledge, rather than direct communication between scholars. Whilst non-native English speaking scientists may have a good level of competency in jargon and understanding written English they are still at a disadvantage when called to communicate their complex ideas in an international setting. According to SCImago Journal & Country Rankings (SJR 2014), the majority of high impact journals  are in English. This forces many non-English speaking scientists and engineers to communicate their science in English, in order to gain status and recognition. This is an additional disadvantage the researchers, who are trying to conduct high impact science from a nation with peripheral status (Tardy 2006).

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Purpose
We did not succeed in expression of tyrocidine from Brevibacillus parabrevis in Bacillus subtilis [ here ]. This inspired us to think of alternative approaches for production of nonribosomal peptide drugs besides NRPS engineering. We came up with a peculiar idea of generating short cyclized peptides with similar length to tyrocidine by using self-splicing proteins. Inteins are such short self-splicing proteins that have no function in the proteins they are a part of, besides catalyzing their own excision after translation. The splicing makes a peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids next to the inteins (Figure 1).  If the N-intein and C-intein are placed at each end of the same polypeptide; cyclisation would give a cyclized protein - or in our case a short cyclic peptide cyclized from head-to-tail.
Achievements
 
Designed constructs for expression of two short cyclic peptides using BioBrick BBa_K1362000  and two short oligo primers.
Generated the cyclisation construct
Analyzed constructs for cyclic peptides, but no products could be detected.
Background
Figure 1 N-intein and C-intein is spliced out by forming a leftover extein scar of the size of the N-extein and C-extein. The size and amino acid sequenceof the scar depends
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are not exclusive in their ability to produce short cyclic peptides. CyBase contains 818 entries of ribosomal head-to-tail cyclic peptides from 105 different species [1]. The peptides vary from "
Waterloo,2012,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," combat this reputation, we need to raise awareness of what synthetic biology is, along with an honest and unbiased assessment of its risks and benefits. As this can be a daunting task, the iGEM team decided to conduct this study as a way to help us focus our efforts and gain insight into the composition of perception.
After creating the survey questions, we distributed it online via Kwik Surveys using past co-op employers, campus clubs and other resources. Unfortunately we were not able to accrue enough responses to make any regression analysis statistically significant. Upon meeting with an econometrician in mid-September, we decided to refocus the survey on revealing the mechanism by which some groups end up with specific misconceptions regarding synthetic biology. As an (albeit very exaggerated) example, if the survey were to reveal that respondents with children were much more likely to support the notion that synthetic biology was ""playing God by creating life,"" one might speculate that these respondents feel that as parents only they have exclusive domain of creating life. The value of this past year's project was to gain experience in the areas of survey creation and distribution, as well as to build connections with those who can help take next year's Human Practices to new levels.

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook"

6. Measure the fluorescence of the samples with the flow cytometer.
Results
From the chart, we can see that cells were hardly induced in the control group, and with the concentration of inducer growing, the intensity of GFP increased by groups. The most efficient concentration of inducer was around 10-5M, and higher concentration may lead to the expression of GFP decreasing. Additionally, to most groups, the intensity of GFP reached its maximum after 4 hours.

Biota Beats and the Street Bio Youth Science Initiative
As a part of bringing Biota Beats to our community, we chose to engage with local middle school-aged                     youth through a pioneering community youth science initiative. As integrated STEAM (science,                     technology, engineering, art, and math) curriculums gain traction and prosper in today’s schools,                     Biota Beats provided Street Bio with a unique opportunity for community youth engagement. At the                     crossroads of music and science, Biota Beats gives young aspiring scientists the chance to blend                     together scientific curiosity, biotechnology and musical creativity. In order to bring Biota Beats                     to local youth, we pioneered the EMW Bookstore Street Bio Youth Science Initiative with the goal of                     immersing local, underrepresented youth at the forefront of science.

Street Bio in the Community
Of all the world’s cities, Cambridge undoubtedly stands out as a bright hub of science, education,                     and creativity. Local biotechnology startups, interdisciplinary research centers, and world-renowned                     universities contribute to a lively neighborhood that prides itself on innovation and curiosity.                     Often times, however, as a community member the opportunity to engage with such exciting activity                     can feel limited to those who possess university affiliations and professional credentials. In turn,                     the institutions that aim to contribute to the advancement of science for society can seem exclusive                     - sequestered to the “ivory tower.” In an effort to counter this institutional exclusivity EMW                     Bookstore created the community program, Street Bio. Street Bio’s mission is to explore the                     interface of engineered biology and “the street” - the people, culture, and products that will shape                     how biology leaves the lab and enters our everyday lives. Believing that biology is humanity’s next                     technological revolution, we ask, who will be empowered to participate? By bringing Biota Beats to                     our community, and in particular the youth in our community, we hope to empower young aspiring                     scientists by fostering their creativity and scientific curiosity ultimately encouraging them to let their imaginations run wild - a known prerequisite for groundbreaking science.

We also want to prove that increasing the duration of Rhamnose induction will result in more fimH KO – RPMrel production. To do so, we performed an anti-His Western Blot taking advantage of the his-tag located in the C-terminus of our construct. The fimH KO - RFP sample was used as a negative control. The image below shows the results after ECL staining.
Samples taken at 4 timepoints show increasing expression of fimH in the induced culture. As expected, the uninduced culture appears to have a low intensity band at all timepoints due to the leakiness of the promoter. There is no band on the negative control sample.
Our next goal was to examine whether fimH KO – RPMrel precipitates after induction with Rhamnose. The formation of inclusion bodies containing unfolded protein was observed through a second western blot in which we noticed a very intense band at 30 kDa in the pellet as shown in the picture bellow.
Co-culture
For the first time, instead of using indirect means such as dot blotting (iGEM Harvard 2015) or immunocytochemistry between cells and peptides (Kelly et al., 2003), we proved that the cancer-targeting adhesion system works, using direct means of co-culturing E.coli and Caco-2 cells (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells). The RPMrel oligopeptide has been shown by Kelly et al. to bind to 5 specific cancer cell types (HT29, CaCo-2, RKO, SW480 and DLD-1), thus we worked with one of them; Caco-2. For this adhesion test we used the same strains as the agglutination assay. We, again, expected fimE to play the role of the positive control as Caco-2 cells do not lack the natural mannosylated glycoproteins found in epithelial cells. Also, we did not expect the fimH KO mutants to attach to the cells at all, whilst the fimH KO strain with the BBa_K1850011 construct in a low copy backbone was expected to bind. The co-culture protocol was a modified version of Tatsuno et al. and after several trials with various MOI, cell confluences and co-culture incubation times, we managed to standardize the procedure, where both fimE and fimH KOs perfectly served their roles as positive and negative"

Calling  a laboratory
Lab interview
Status quo of melatonin measurements
While working on our biological approach using living cells to detect melatonin in saliva samples,             the next logical step was to gather the opinion of the people that are ultimately going to perform the measurements -             medical laboratories.
Dr. med. Josef van Helden leads the department of endocrinological measurements in the Stein Labor (German for laboratory) in Moenchengladbach and was kind enough to have an interview with us.
Since we were concerned about whether tubes, in which saliva samples are given, need a special coating,             we got Dr. Josef van Helden’s opinion in this. In his lab, salivettes are primarily used,             considering they are easy to use for the patient (a fiber roll is placed inside the mouth to soak it with saliva,             and then it's placed back inside the tube). But the tubes itself does not have a special coating,             because melatonin does not react with polyethylene.
For a melatonin measurement serum, saliva or urine can be used.             Since saliva delivers reliable measurement results and is most convenient.
Concerning the transport conditions, patients have to make sure, that their saliva sample is transported under 10°C.             If saliva samples are saved at a temperature under -20°C, they can be stored for a long period of time.
The most commonly used method for melatonin measurements is Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).             High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPCL) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are two further             methods that are used for melatonin measurements, but since they are costly they are not the preferred choice.             We got further insides about the advantages and disadvantages of the sensitivity of these methods from Dr. Dario Acuña.             ELISA is mostly available in 96-well strip plates. If fewer samples are analyzed than a kit offers,             it is inherently linked to a higher cost per sample. Thus, laboratories wait till 96 samples are gathered.             In case this takes a long time, the patient has a long waiting time till the results of their measurement are available.             Especially in the case of melatonin, this is a relevant point.
We also were interested in whether these laboratories use living cells for their"

On the right: SDS-PAGE of purified chitin deacetylase nodB. The arrow marks the region of expression. Fractions 1-3 show the first flow-through, while Fractions 4-8 are from Elution. Usage of PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder 10 to 180 kDa from Thermo Fischer Scientific.
Enzyme Reaction and Assay
The following figures show data in which the background of chitin is already detracted from the measured results. Since the blank showed auto-hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in ADP, they were subtracted as well.
The measurement of four replicate enzyme reactions shows an indirect detection of acetic acid via NADH consumption at 340 nm wavelength. The amount of acetic acid is stoichiometric with the amount of NAD+ in the last reaction step. This proves that NodB has generated acetic acid during deacetylation of chitin into chitosan.

Week12 (Jun 1 -Jun 7)
We designed recombinase system to fine-regulation. Meanwhile, we wanted to build a library of pH-induced promoters by error-prone PCR. So we divided to two groups to finish these works. And this week, we searched and looked around the articles to find suitable recombinase and fit condition of EP-PCR.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG again.
Week13 (Jun 8 -Jun 14)
This week, we confirmed the recombinase(Cre, Flp, Bxb1 and FimE) we used in our gene circuits and the condition of EP-PCR.
Week14 (Jun 15 -Jun 21)
We extracted the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and transformed mRFP, GFP, K137007(FimE), K907000(Bxb1 gp35) and K907001(Bxb1 gp47) from iGEM kit plates into BMTOP10. Simultaneously, we did the mutation of P-atp2 firstly and selected 157 positive bacteria from more than 500 bacteria
Week15 (Jun 22 -Jun 28)
This week, we had final examination. We didn't have enough time to do any experiments. So we searched and looked around large amount of articles to optimize our experiments.
Week16 (Jun 29 -Jul 5)
We constructed the device K137058(ILL+pTetR+ILR+GFP) according to iGEM and linked it with mRFP. We found a better approach of EP-PCR, so we did again.
We measured the intensity of red florescence at different pH to test the function of acid-induced promoter J100071 again.
Week17 (Jul 6 -Jul 12)
We constructed a new part P-atp2+B0034+K137007(FimE) by over-lap extension PCR(OE-PCR) and transformed it into BMTOP10. In this week, we did amounts of EP-PCR, and were ready to select them next week.
Through PCR, digestion, ligation, transformation and cPCR, we have successfully constructed the standard part glsA on pSB1C3.

Stress Responsive Bacteria
Envelope Stress Responsive Bacteria
The EPF Lausanne iGEM team has been working on engineering E. coli responding to stress - in particular mechanical stress – quickly and efficiently. Taking in consideration that bacteria naturally respond to various envelope stresses through the Cpx pathway, we combined protein complementation techniques with biosensors to achieve fast spatiotemporal analysis of bacteria response to stimuli.
To help you understand how our engineered bacteria work, we would like to start out by introducing two major components of our project: the Cpx pathway and the split reporter proteins.
The Cpx pathway
How can bacteria sense and adapt themselves to environmental stress? The key lies in a fairly unknown two component regulatory system: the Cpx pathway. Its natural function is to control the expression of ""survival"" genes whose products act in the periplasm to maintain membrane integrity. The three main members of the Cpx pathway are CpxA, CpxR, and CpxP.
Split reporter proteins: Infrared Fluorescent Protein
Protein complementation techniques consist in splitting reporter proteins with fluorescent, bioluminescent, or colorimetric properties at specific locations and fusing them to proteins of interest. The fused split fragments remain inactive until physical interaction of the proteins of interest leads to the reconstitution of the chemical properties and the proper folding of the split reporter proteins. This technique is widely used to characterise the interactions between proteins of interest in a given pathway.
The EPFL iGEM team however chose to implement protein complementation techniques in a new way. Our team hijacked the Cpx pathway in E. coli by fusing split protein fragments to CpxR to develop fast and precise stress biosensors. On top of being used in basic science as a stress sensor and a proof of concept of our novel way of viewing biosensors, we aimed to integrate our engineered bacteria in"

Countdown to WikiFreeze
After 10 weeks of lab work and several months of planning the final day of the project has arrived. The Wiki freeze at 5 am (BST) is the final submission deadline; after this no further additions to our website can be made.
Unsurprisingly things are a little hectic here as we try to get everything finished.  The main goal is to get all our pages coded and live on the website. So far we have finished our extensive policy and practices pages and the design page for our project. More still needs to be done and we are likely to be coding for the next few hours.
As well as this, over the last few days, members of our team have been preparing a presentation, which will tell the story of our project. We will be presenting this at the Jamboree to teams from around the world.
Other members of the team have focused on getting our poster ready to print. This is the other main way we will present our project at Boston, providing a stand-alone explanation of what we’ve been doing.
A Cheeky Visit to the Radio Station
At 10am this morning (10/09/15), Helen and Mabel left the Biochemistry Department to walk to the studios of BBC Radio Oxford, ready for an 11am broadcast. After half an hour’s walking, they were glad they’d left that much time, since the building was still on in sight. However, they trusted the map Mabel had on her phone, which said they were only two minutes away, and arrived with plenty of time to sign in, have a quick sit down and a glass of water, and to go over their plan of what they were going to say.
The producer then came and collected them from reception, being very welcoming and enthusiastic about our work, and shortly afterwards, they were introduced to the presenter of the show, Kat Orman. They had a chat about the outline of the show, including basic questions that would be asked, and then it was time to perform!

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"In China, 77.05% of iGEMers we interviewed think that their knowledge reserve is not enough rich and the research should go further whilst 42.62% of the students confirm topic selection is difficult. Some of the students believe that one of limiting factor is the lack of funds. Compared with domestic iGEMers, over 65% of overseas iGEMers argue the lack of funding is most severe. Generally speaking, the high expenses and inadequate fund are the limiting factor for most iGEMers.
3.At home and abroad, over 80% of the students is out of enthusiasm for scientific research to join iGEM teams, while other students regard rewards on material and credits as an attraction for participating in iGEM. Therefore, the majority of iGEMers pay more attention to synthetic biology itself, their mental improvement and growth and the opportunity of contacting with like-minded friends instead of material things.
4.As the data shows, both overseas and domestic team members think strengthening the relationship between iGEM involvement and credits reward can enhance students' involvement in iGEM. Meanwhile, vigorous publicity and promotion made by schools and labs and achievement reward for outstanding students and teachers are also attractive. 
5.Most foreign and Chinese teams' projects were decided through team discussion and panels instead of steming from teachers' idea, which mirrors the students' intelligence and teachers' respect. In addition, iGEM is a worldwide synthetic biology competition, but attracts students of different specialties, which is advantageous to integrate various ways of thinking and spark innovation.
Additionally, there is something iGEMers want to share with us as follow. (For more iGEMers' feelings)

Still it is a good opportunity for being a part of team and overcoming some problems and trying to catch good results and performance make me happy and more willing to work in science.""
""iGEM allows me to solve real-world problems using knowledge from classes, and has been a great way for me to gain comfort in a lab setting, insight about working on a team, and experience managing my own research project. It's been a very meaningful part of my life!""
""It is a great opportunity to do real science in a real lab, to experience challenges that a real scientist faces and to get the experience of a real teamwork that has real consequences. ""

This year 10 students started the iGEM USTC Software team: Chen Liao, Zheng Wang, Kun Jiang, Jue Wang, Luojun Wang, Yubo Qi, Zhaoyi Li, Zhengda He, Shangyu Luo and Mort Yao. There are only 8 of us in the picture, while the only female team member, Jue Wang was in Beijing engaging for her TOEFL exam, and Shangyu Luo had gone to Hong Kong for studying in The University of Hong Kong as an exchange student. What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors Hao Jiang and Zhaofeng Luo, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.

Monday
Aim - Patch and left junction PCR screening of GroEL/ES transformants followed by gel visualisation
Results - 14 colonies suspected of carrying successful clones, 3 colonies showed clear bands in gel
Friday
Aim - Colony spanning PCR putative GroEL/ES clones
Results - Cloning was unsuccessful
Modelling
Monday
New electrical components arrive for ElectroStop.
Testing of new components is successful.
Wednesday - Sunday
Begin testing TransOpt with a variety of input sequences.
Appears to provide sensible answers, though convergence (due to inefficient programming) is at this stage slow.
Utilise TransOpt to produce fluorescent protein sequences for use in experiments, both via standard codon harmonisation, fast codon utilisation, and the TransOpt method.
Friday
Solder all electrical components to ElectroStop's protoboard, as prototyping and testing has revealed that the current design functions as necessary.
Week 19: 3rd of August - 7th of August
Wet Lab
Monday
Aim - Right-junction colony PCR of pSB1C3-Gro JM109 clones
Results - No bands in PCR gel visualisation, therefore the cloning was unsuccessful
Wednesday
Aim - Digest of pSB1C3 with EcoRI and SpeI to prepare for a second attempt at GG cloning with GroES/EL G blocks
Results - Bands visualized on gel, therefore successful
Thursday
Aim - GG cloning of pSB1C3, GroEL/ES and transformation
Results - some test colonies were present, so cloning looked to be somewhat successful
Friday
Aim - colony PCR (left-junction) of pSB1C3-Gro GG clones from yesterday and visualisation
Results - successful: bands as expected
Human Practices
Monday
Began to look into the LacI co-expression as a solution to the toxicity encountered when having to produce this on an industrial scale
Modelling
Monday - Thursday
Continue testing of TransOpt, experiment with different values of alpha and beta values to determine how they affect the final outputted result.
Thursday - Friday
Assemble circuit and 3D printed components to create final prototype of ElectroStop.
Test the ElectroStop device on sample dyes implanted in a gel.
Works effectively on a range of dyes, though purple-tinted ones provide the greatest sensitivity.

● Rice is easy to plant on a large scale with a very high yield
● Rice endosperm is an excellent biomass container for Astaxanthin.
● Genetic modification technology is quite mature in rice.
● As a special nutrition storage organs, the products in rice seed are convenient to store, extract and purify
● Astaxanthin accumulation in seeds would not interrupt the normal growth of the whole plant
 
The astaxanthin biosynthetic key gene BKT, encoding a β-carotene ketolase, does not exist in rice and other plants. Meanwhile, the expression levels of a large amount of endogenous genes involved in carotenoid synthesis are very low or of no expression in rice endosperm. Thus, astaxanthin cannot be produced in wild-type rice. However, it is possible to biosynthesize astaxanthin in rice by using multigene metabolic engineering to stack multigenes involved in astaxanthin pathway. In this project, we assembled four astaxanthin biosynthetic genes to transform rice callus, which all genes are under the control of four different endosperm-specific promoters. In this way, rice endosperm serves as a special container for astaxanthin, which provides conveniences for later storage and extraction.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
