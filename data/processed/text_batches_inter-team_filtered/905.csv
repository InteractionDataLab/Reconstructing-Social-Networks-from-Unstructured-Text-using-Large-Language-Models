Regulation of killing ability
I Introduction
    Even though we have orthogonal gene circuit, the killing ability of two warriors may have great difference. (Fig.1)
    Sometimes, to mimic situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, for example, to make two warriors have same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors?
    Intuitively, many potential factors can influence the killing ability, like the catalysis rate of AHL synthase, cross-membrane rate between AHL molecules. Then what factors can we change to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggest that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins.
II Evaluation of warrior’s killing ability
    First, to simplify the evaluation, we will have some hypothesis at first:
1. The increasing rate of two warriors are the same.
2. The environmental capacity (it is mentioned in the famous Logistic model) of two warriors are the same if the environmental conditions and the initial amount of resources are the same.(By these hypothesis, we can ignore influence of growth rate on killing ability, which will make things more complicated.)
3. Also, we could only consider the condition that there is glucose inside the medium and there is only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI (More details why we detect RFP intensity but not OD600 directly in the model can be seen at Fluid Model ), so it"

Product design
After discussing our project with researcher from Peking university Hospital in Shenzhen, we realized that the amount of ct DNA is very low in blood. So we designed our project with different kinds of amplification methods to increase the amount.  T7 dCas9 system has an important role in our design. It can amplify signals and can express into different output. It can also use inside human’s body or as a detective switch. We also include NASBA to increase the amplification of our signal.
Safe
Our product adopts cell-free system for our test paper to prevent the patient from interacting with virus cell directly. Also, we provide a test tube for patients to collect their blood. They only need one drop of blood using a clean needle.
Simple
The test paper will come with a kit. The kit will include all the materials for detection with a simple protocol, so patients can use it at home by themselves.
Cheap
Once we have a template for our system, we could duplicate the test paper easily. Cell-free system will provide an environment for transcription and translation to happen. So we can lower the cost of one test paper when we have enough copies."

YOHDA sensei is a biotechnology and life science professor, and he’s also a lecturer in Engineering in Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT). He came to Indonesia as a guest lecture in Society of Biological Engineering Universitas Indonesia Student Chapter (SBE-UISC) featuring UI Synbio Club Seminar entitled “Application of Biotechnology in Industry.” He has come to several Nobel Prize Meetings and very famous, yet he still gave us many advices on our Lab Work. Luckily, he’s here with us to provide some information regarding synthetic biology application projection in Asia, also problems involving application of Synbio in Japan. Check it out!
Vanessa, Prof. Yohda, and Diana
Synthetic biology really has big prospects in the world. We need ideas––yet we need breakthroughs if we want to achieve more from it. Asia is being forward in many aspects over the past several years. However, Major findings from the Wilson Center on “Tracking the Growth of Synthetic Biology” in 2013 shows that the number of entities conducting research and commercial applications in Synthetic Biology in Europe and US is very high, but Asia has been left behind. Japan––as the most developed country in Asia––is known of its high technology development. Depart from this statement; Professor Yohda from TUAT (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) stated that there are restrictions in Japan towards GMO application. This condition biased the usual fact and in real life, a part of Japanese people are intolerant of science implementation, so the government of Japan protect all of the people including the conventionalist by restricting synthetic biology and especially GMO. Safety module might works, but back to reality. Every machine that works can’t be 100% effective, and so is safety module. There’s always a chance of failure of microorganism to escape and contaminate environment, especially because"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Summer Science Research Institute
The Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) connects New Haven high school students with research labs at Yale University. The SSRI invites guest lecturers to present Friday lunchtime workshops that supplement the students’ work. On July 24, Lionel, Holly, Jessica, and Erin had the opportunity to give a brief overview of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the controversy surrounding them, and our own summer project. After quickly reviewing the history of synthetic biology and its applications in biofuels and agriculture, we dove into a discussion of the ethical issues related to the synthetic production of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug derived from the wormwood plant. Students compared the economic and human consequences of producing artemisinin traditionally and synthetically. They weighed the importance of stable pharmaceutical prices and accessibility to medicine against the cost of driving thousands of farmers out of work. Then we transitioned into a discussion of five important ethical considerations that guide our assessment of emerging technology — public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation, and justice and fairness — and how they might apply to the production of biofuels using microbes. Finally, we explained our workflow for porting MAGE into cyanobacteria and rhizobium. The SSRI students asked many great questions about the MAGE cycle, especially regarding the synthetic oligos that are repeatedly introduced into the cells. It was enlightening and gratifying for us to explain our project to our peers who were interested in research but hadn’t really heard of synthetic biology or GMOs (besides Monsanto).

Invitation of Academic Exchange with Foreign Students
What will  happen when medicine meets synthetic biology?
National Yang Ming University, a medical school, focuses  not only medicines but also the science. Although most of the members in  NYMU.Taipei are medical students, we want to explore and create more about the  beauty of the science. Furthermore, we want to let more medical student know  the beauty and magic of the synthetic biology.
Thus, we will invite 7  medical exchange students (two Austrian, two Hungarian, one Canadian, two  Slovakian) and several medical students in Yang Ming University to participate  this meeting and to communicate with us about the synthetic biology and our  project. Why do we spend time and money on this activity? We want to build up a  system for medical students to easily understand what the synthetic biology is  and to help medical students experience more and explore more in different  fields. So, welcome to our 2012 IGEMedical fest in Taiwan!

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

The 2013 iGEM Leicester team carried out experiments to show that limonene is an effective polystyrene solvent. We were able to demonstrate that a 50% solution of limonene in a 20ml solution dissolves an 8cm x 5cm x 2cm block of polystyrene in approximately 9 minutes (video below).
limonene disolution from Quezia Toe on Vimeo .
Our idea was to characterise the limonene biobrick (BBa_K118025) created by the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team. Firstly we shuffled the biobrick into the pSB1C3 backbone. The aim was to introduce the pSB1C3 backbone, is to separate the colonies that have incorporated the limonene biobrick, because those would be the ones present on a chloramphenicol plate.
We digested the backbone and the biobrick with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Digestions were run on a gel to confirm expected fragment sizes. Quick stick ligase was then used to ligate both genes with corresponding sites. Ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli and cells were grown overnight. Colonies that were present on the chloramphenicol plates were successfully transformed with the ligated plasmid. To confirm this overnight broth was made from the colonies whose DNA was isolated using mini prep. The isolated DNA was then cut with EcoRI and PstI and fragment sizes representative of the backbone and biobrick were visualized using gel electrophoresis.
The limonene biobrick supplied had a Lac operon preceding the limonene synthase genes. We aimed to induced the production of limonene  by growing bacteria with the incorporated ligated DNA (transformants) on chloramphenicol and IPTG plates. Volatile organic compound (VOC) was carried out in order to detect the presence on limonene on the plates. This assay was carried out using a Proton Transfer Reaction- Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer which has a parts per billion sensitivity. This instrument detects protonated compounds; for instance limonene has a molecular mass of 136 therefore a sharp peak should be seen at 137 and a fragmentation peak at 81. From the graphs below, these 2 important peaks that would indicate the presence of"

PCR Clean Up
Purpose: PCR clean-up is done after digestion and ligation in order to remove salts and to concentrate the product of these reactions. By using a small amount of dd H20 at the end of the clean-up, it is possible to use all of product at a higher concentration since most of the reactions in PCR reaction tubes are volume limited. This will give more colonies with the desired plasmid inserted compared to using the same volume of a less concentrated solution.
Procedure:
Clean-up for Digestion
1. 250 µL of DNA Binding Buffer was added to the PCR tube with the Digestion products and was mixed via pipette.
2. This solution was transferred to a Zymo spin column and the column was placed in a collection tube.
3. The tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1.5 minutes.
4. The flow-through was discarded and 600µL of wash buffer was added to the center of the column.

6. Steps 4 and 5 were repeated.
7. The flow through was discarded and then the column was dry spun at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes.          Note: Dry spinning is important to remove all of the ethanol from the wash buffer because this can interfere with transformation.

Hello!!! Today we continued with identification and isolation of wild bacteria from contaminated stream and Negro river. We made PCR of 16S rRNA with the following system:
We added 7ul on agarose gel 0,8%.
Electrophoretic profile of total DNA from wild bacteria resistant to Hg in amplified 16S rRNA.
1 – 2: Sample A1* collected from Negro River
3 – 4: Sample A2* collected from Negro River
5 – 6: Sample E1* collected from contaminated stream
7 – 8: Sample E2 collected from contaminated stream
9 – 10: Sample P1* collected from contaminated stream
11 – 12: Sample P2 collected from contaminated stream
13 – 14: Sample P3 collected from contaminated stream
15 – 16: Sample S1* collected from contaminated stream
*Resistant to 100ug/ml Hg.
Regarding to our new construction, we couldn’t extract the plasmid DNA from JM110 with mRFP generator K516030. We also transformed again to take it off the dam methylation. Could be that the bacteria isn’t efficient anymore. Because of this, we also made a pre inoculum in liquid medium LB of JM110. We used positive control with PUC72.

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"A activity was tested on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) plates.
The latter test produces a zone of clearing if CMC is degraded by the endoglucanase domain. We had three successful colonies:
For more information, see the Registry page on BBa_K523025 .
BioSandwich
The BioSandwich system is outlined on its own page . BioSandwich creates parts with homologous ends, but there are a number of ways in which the final assembly could be carried out. Throughout the project we mostly used Gibson Assembly.
Parts made with BioSandwich
Parts that we believe are correct (subject to final verification sequencing) include:
BBa_K523013 : PlacLacZ-INP-YFP
BBa_K523019 : PlacLacZ-INP-cex [update: sequencing shows this part has errors]
BBa_K523020 : PlacLacZ-INP-bglX [update: sequencing shows this part has errors]
BBa_K523022 : PlacLacZ-crtEIB
Extensive tests - what can go wrong?
We also tested a number of final assembly methods, by attempting to join a promoter and LacZ construct to a Yellow Fluorescent coding sequence, making BBa_K523023 . This part will produce a polycistronic RNA transcript, coding for proteins that turn the bacteria blue (on Xgal) but also make it fluoresce yellow.
BioSandwich inserts short spacers between each part to be assembled. Note that after spacer2 we expect to see some extra bases before we reach the RFC10 suffix, because of the choice of vector. We can call these extra bases the ""stuffing"". So, the expected sequence is:
Vector -- spacerT7 -- Plac,LacZ -- spacer1 -- EYFP -- spacer2 -- stuffing
Successful assemblies are expected to generate blue colonies that fluoresce yellow under a blue light. We tried several assembly methods, all of which generated many colonies with the correct phenotype, but also many colonies with an incorrect phenotype...
From each plate we sequenced a colony with the correct phenotype (if there were any) and some colonies with incorrect phenotypes, in an attempt to understand what the failure modes were.
BioSandwich with Gibson Assembly
Like, OEPCR, this method produces many correct colonies and many incorrect colonies.
The Gibson method was described by Gibson et al (2009) . A gentle introduction was written by the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team, and is found here .
We sequenced a colony with the correct phenotype, as well"

Much of the effort directed towards accomplishing the 4th millennium development goal, a two- thirds reduction in under-five mortality by the year 2015, has been focused on battling Vitamin A deficiency in children 6-59 months. This is due to the fact they have an increased risk of dying from measles, malaria and diarrhea (1). Therefore, countries considered a high priority for Vitamin A defining by national under 5 child mortality equal to or greater than 70 deaths per 100 000, have been the focus of many campaigns.  Of the 61 countries considered high priority for Vitamin A, only 34 have conducted national assessments of Vitamin A deficiency (1). These are the countries that could be targeted with new approaches for Vitamin A delivery, including a synthetic biology approach. Since deficiency levels are reported in these countries, the efficacy of a new intervention could be roughly assessed and success of a new intervention could be highlighted and promoted for use in other countries. Within these 34 countries, specifically addressing those who have Vitamin A coverage of less than 70% in children 6-59 months is ideal. This percentage is defined as effective coverage. If supplements in these countries have not yet provided effective coverage to the population, it is possible a novel approach may be welcomed and implementation may face fewer barriers.  However, research must examine why, in any given country targeted for synthetic biology intervention, other methods did not work. It might well be that local, regional and national factors that prevented the uptake of existing intervention methods might also make a synthetic biology approach unfeasible.
In the end its important for people involved in the synthetic biology approach to Vitamin A deficiency to be aware of the barriers other Vitamin A intervention methods face, to be able to judge whether their synthetic biology approach is better in the pro/con trade off than the other intervention methods, to be aware whether their synthetic biology approach generates particular pro and con arguments locally and globally not generated by existing  methods and to determine whether their synthetic biology method is more cost effective than existing methods.
Last Words
Our research produced evaluations on the Guelph iGEM team product which would have to be considered in order for its successful implementation. We are interested in continuing to collaborate on this project in hopes that it will one day contribute to reducing vitamin A deficiencies worldwide.
As a final note we would like to thank everyone on the Guelph team. They showed great courtesy and we have had a wonderful time collaborating with them. A special thanks goes to David Johnston in the Department of Plant Agriculture at the University of Guelph for keeping in touch"

Lecture series
The iGEM competition is primarily about research, but public relations work is also a very large component.
Therefore, we have made it our business to inform all interested people about the topic of synthetic life science and genetic engineering. With a total of 4 lectures the topic was critically questioned and illuminated from different perspectives. Our goal was to sensitize the population to important and topical issues and help them to distinguish between truth and lies. At the beginning of each lecture, we captured the general mood about the upcoming aspect of synthetic biology with a few questions. After the lecture, the same questions were asked to analyse whether the lecture changed the opinion of the audience. The first lecture was presented by our advisor Tim Blomeier and offered the audience a good overview of the field of synthetic biology.
On 5th of June Nicholas Schmelling, also one of our advisors, dealt with the various fields of application of genetic engineering in agriculture in more detail. He compared conventional breeding with genetic engineering methods used today and clarified the various definitions of synthetic biology, genetic engineering and breeding.
The third lecture was given by Dr. Christian Dumpitak and was titled: “I'm making the world, widdle widdle how I like it...!? ...and what ELSA says about it: Perspectives on synthetic life sciences”. Dr. Dumpitak started his lecture by discussing aspects of the short movie “Who are the engineers of the future?” by Christina Agapakis & Patrik Boyle (Ginko Bioworks), USA 2010. After a"

Skim milk; Eppendorf liquid gun, tube (Ф15mm x 100mm), IEC CL31 high-speed refrigerated centrifuge, low temperature refrigerator, common refrigerator, FD-1A-50 freeze dryer, 3ml colorimetric tube, CL-1 magnetic stirring apparatus, BHP9511 type water toxicity analyzer, SHZ- 82 thermostatic oscillator.
4) Preparation of freeze drying protective agent
Due to use the higher concentration of skim milk, milk is not dissolved so well, and after the static, there is some precipitation, so the lower concentration of skim milk is chosen, of which the mass fraction is 12%. The mass fraction of the solution of NaCl is 2.0%
5) Preparation of luminescent bacteria freeze drying preparation
Inoculate the bacteria, which was stored hypothermal, on fresh culture medium,  undertake constant temperature oscillation culture until the logarithmic growth phase at 22℃, and the light is more bright; centrifugate the 5ml of culture with the speed of 5000r / min at 4℃ for 10min, the supernatant is discarded; with the addition of the equal volume of prepared frozen drying protective agent, heavy suspension is done in the bacterium strain; split them in different test tubes, and 1 ml for each tube; do pre-freezing at -70℃, then freeze and dry; after finishing drying these tubes, seal them with sealing compound. At last, reserve them at -20℃.
Modeling
USTC give us plenty of advice about modeling, especially in model 1 of our modeling. Model 1 is about the experiment of glycopeptide incubation and the experiment of competitive inhibition. The details is shown in “Biology-Model”.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"9-VP64-gRNA complex that is expressed under the regulation of A1 reactive astrocyte specific markers, can activate the pMLPm promoter to regulate the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3 that will trigger apoptosis.
Theoretical background:
pSTEAP4 (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 4 promoter)  and pTIMP1 (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 promoter) are regulating genes expression which are highly expressed in A1 reactive astrocyte cells when compared to other cells in the central nervous system1,2
In our therapeutic approach, we wanted to use these markers in order to express dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex that will activate a synthetic promoter to induce apoptosis.
The synthetic minimal adenovirus major late promoter (pMLPm) contains three repetitions of the ""a1"" sequence, which is complementary to the gRNA sequence, enabling dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex to target the pMLPm synthetic promoter1. When the transcription factor VP64 (an engineered tetramer of the herpes simplex virus VP16 transcriptional activator domain) is fused to dCas9 enzyme it can be guided to a specific location in the genome, in this manner we can exploit it to promote downstream translation2.
The dCas9-VP64-gRNA complex will target the pMLPm synthetic promoter and promote the expression of exogenous reverse caspase3, that in contrast to the endogenous caspase3 will be activated after transcription due to its autocatalytic processing, meaning that this enzyme will trigger an apoptotic signal that will lead to apoptotic death  (caspase3 is responsible for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation)3.
mCherry reporter protein is also expressed by the pMLPm promoter, it is fused to the exogenous reverse caspase3 with Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) peptide that is cleaved during translation4.
In order to activate pMLPm promoter and to induce apoptotic death we used 2 plasmids:
Lenti: pTIMP1 dCas9 VP64 – in this plasmid TIMP1 promoter express dCas9 enzyme which is fused to the transcription factor VP64.
pSynt – in this plasmid pSTEAP4 promoter express gRNA. And pMLPm promoter regulate the downstream translation of reverse caspase3 which is fused to mCherry fluorophore.

To demonstrate that our improved BioBrick BBa_K2812004  could be secreted, we performed another series of experiments. As documented on the part’s page, we secrete lysostaphin with E. coli ’s Type I secretion system. This requires the HlyB/D membrane protein. Since the pSB1C3 BioBrick plasmid and the pSTV plasmid containting the HlyB/D secretion proteins had overlapping antibiotic resistances, the BioBrick was assembled into a pBAD vector under control of an pBAD-ara promotor inducible by arabinose. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with both the HlyB/D plasmid and our newly assembled BioBrick plasmid. Both plasmids were then simultaneously induced. Additionally, CaCl2 was added, as this is required for Type I secretion. A co-culture of S. aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae with E. coli BL21 (DE3) on Mueller-Hinton agar plates was performed. The plates were covered with IPTG, arabinose and CaCl2 to induce our uninduced engineered E. coli bacteria to induce expression of lysostaphin-HlyA or HlyA and the HlyB/D secretion proteins. First S. aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae were plated on the inducer-agar. Subsequently, drops of uninduced BL21 (DE3) cultures were put on top of this film. The results can be seen in figure 3.
Left: Co-culture of E. coli with induced lysostaphin-HlyA & HlyB/D expression and S. aureus. Centre: Co-culture of E. coli with induced lysostaphin-HlyA & HlyB/D expression and Streptococcus agalactiae. Right:: Co-culture of E. coli with induced HlyA & HlyB/D expression and S. aureus.
In 2.1 SA, clear halo formation around the BL21 (DE3) colonies can be observed, indicating secretion of lysostaphin having a lytic effect on S. aureus. 2.1 HSB clearly shows that on another Gram positive bacterial strain, lysostaphin does not show any antimicrobial activity.

LovTAP
Overview
Design
Results
Results
We tested the LovTap construct with RFP as an output. Light activated LovTap is supposed to act as a repressor at the Trp operator and therefore we would expect a reduction of the RFP signal. Measurements with the plate reader lead to confusing results, therefore we switch to single cell analysis with FACS. The results show a decrease of RFP the first 5 hours, which might be due to the inoculation and RFP maturation.
Figure 1: Here we show the fluorescence intensity over time. As an output of the FACS analysis we used the median of fluorescence. We compared two conditions: light and no light. As a control we used the wild-type and reporter only.
If we compare the signal strength of the negative control: reporter only, in the two different conditions, light and no light, we are not expecting a decrease of RFP. The decrease of RFP shown in the figure is a result of bleaching the RFP. Also for the LovTap construct we see a different output between the two conditions, but this is most probably also due to bleaching of the RFP with the light we use to activate LovTap.
Plans
Since we are not able to get reliable results due to bleaching, we are switching our read-out system so that we will have a Galactosidase as an output. As a next step we will measure the LovTap construct in the same conditions using a Miller assay.  Also an important change we would like to make is to invert the signal output, which means that we are not repressing our output with blue light but activating it instead ( see constructs ). We are working on cloning this construct and"

Protocols.io & ProtoCat
     Our relationship with protocols.io has grown into a very rewarding partnership over the course of this last year. In the 2016 season we took the first steps to build a relationship with the company, having several meetings with their head of outreach, and out of those meetings came the idea for a project that we have been developing since the summer. This iGEM season we have created a conversion tool that easily imports protocols between protocols.io and ProtoCat. This tool takes the output of the protocols.io API, and generates a ProtoCat protocol with the same content. This makes the gap between the two services just a bit smaller, as the major overhead of leveraging the benefits of both services was in the re-upload process.
      Our organizations share the goal of improving protocol reproducibility, and the creation of this tool breaks through the biggest technical barrier that our common goal faces. Easy transfer of protocol across repositories will make it even easier for scientists to share their protocol and improve their experiments. This relationship not only helps ProtoCat and Michigan Software grow, providing a valuable opportunity for our team members to interact with industry professionals, but also removes the possibility of tensions arising in the future between our two organizations. In fact, when we send protocols.io the news that the conversion tool was up and running, their response was ""This is cool!"" and were happy to see people making use of their APIs.

Brief Answers to the Questions
Welcome to our Safety Page. We will first answer the safety questions asked by iGEM headquarters briefly, and then discuss safety issues associated with our project in detail. In addition, we will provide our ideas and practice on guaranteeing and developing biosafety.
Q1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: Researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety? No. Our design is based on the commonly used nonpathogenic E. coli K.12 strain and genes we manipulated are original genes in E. coli. The protein products, at least from current understanding, will cause no harm to researchers, the public and environment. In addition, strict lab practice is executed to further ensure safety.
Q2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, Did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience? Yes, we will discuss this question in latter part of this page (Safety Considerations of Our Biobrick parts and Our Project).
Q3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country? Yes. All materials obtained have received the approvals from the department's laboratory management committees. We are also obliged to observe the regulations of Teaching Centre of Experimental Biology and apply for approval for materials before we start our project.
Q4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? Some classified measures should be taken according to the safety of the material. For example, plasmids that may harm the safety, when submitted, should receive more attention and have a stricter package. Some harmful byproducts during experiments should be eliminated properly. We have done our human practice aiming at understanding attitude of the public towards genetically modified baceria and publicizing biosafety ideas to the public, which we think should be popularized to other teams in future iGEM competitions.

We will try two different strategies to create a genomic T7 cassette integration (Figure 2). Because it was shown, that the deletion of dns is not harmful ( Hesek et al. 2016) , we decided to integrate the sequence of the T7 cassette at the endogenous locus of dns. In parallel, we will integrate the T7 cassette in one of our successfully characterized integration sites.
Looking at the genotype of E. coli BL21 we noticed that lacI localizes at the upstream site of the T7 RNA Polymerase gene (Kim et al. 2015) . LacI is the negative regulator of the lac operon (Gilbert & Muller-Hill 1966) . In case of the T7 system, the lacUV5 promoter controls the T7 RNA Polymerase expression ( Studier & Moffatt 1986) . By integrating the repressor LacI at the same time into the V. natriegens genome we will reduce the leakiness of the lacUV5 promoter, as it was done in E. coli. Additionally we checked if there are genes encoding proteins similar to Lon or OmpT, because these two were deleted in E. coli BL21 (DE3) to minimize the degradation of proteins (Dunn & Studier 1983) , (Kim et al. 2015) . Click here to read more about the proteases! By BLAST analysis, we could find a Lon protease with a high degree of similarity to the Lon protease of E. coli in V. natriegens (Figure 1). We could not find any OmpT homologs neither by BLAST analysis nor by an ompT annotation in the genome of V. natriegens. Because of the high similarity of the Lon proteases to each other, it is likely that the Lon of V. natriegens fulfils a similar function like the Lon protease in E. coli. This convinced us to delete the lon of V. natriegens.

Cas9 in Plants Project
A CRISPR/cas9 system is a large protein guided by a self-guiding RNA, which is capable of targeting specific DNA sequences. Cas9 has been characterized previously in bacteria and mammalian cells. Often targeted to a promoter region, Cas9 acts as highly effective gene repressing tool. The goal of the cas9 project is to make this regulatory tool available to plant genetic engineering.

Introduction
A CRISPR/Cas9 system, which is found in a few prokaryotic organisms allows for very specific DNA targeting.  The system as found is used to cleave DNA or completely cut out certain sections, perhaps as a defense mechanism.  However, scientists in recent years have turned their attention to CRISPR/cas9 systems due to the highly specific targeting abilities.  Mutation of a few key areas of the protein caused the creation of dcas9.  dcas9 is catalytically inactive and can be expressed in controlled quantities and will not cleave DNA. When coupled with a 100bp engineered self-guided RNA sequence the  dcas9 protein can be bound to any 20bp DNA sequence.  This has many implications including gene-specific down regulation, localization abilities via attachment to the cas9 protein complex, and  gene-sepcific up regulation via the attachment of an enhancer targeted to a promoter region.  There are many possible uses of dcas9, and would serve as an excellent new tool in the plant synthetic biology toolkit.
Background
The below diagram describes how the dcas9-guided RNA targeting system works.
Reference:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413002110
Method
To test dcas9 we designed a vector that expressed both GFP and RFP under two different CMV35s promoters.  Transforming this plasmid into plants should show a constant GFP to RFP ratio under florescence spectroscopy.(this vector is identical to the one designed for the promoter project) Once this generic ratio is established we can modify this plasmid to include the dcas9 protein and guiding RNA sequence.  If we target the guiding RNA to the GFP/promoter polymerase binding region we should expect a ratio indicating a decrease in GFP expression. It should be noted that dcas9 and the RNA guiding sequence will both need their"
British_Columbia,2017,Team:British Columbia#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,".
Dr. Linda Delli Santi, the Executive Director of the B.C. Greenhouse Growers Association, spoke with our team to provide an industry perspective on our project. She emphasized that Crown Gall and Hairy Root are major concerns to the British Columbia agriculture industry and was excited that our team had chosen to address Agrobacterium pathogenicity. Her primary concern was the public perception of our project, as the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture can impact the consumer demand. She was also curious about how our bacteria could be released safely into the environment.
Dr. Xin Li’s lab at the Michael Smith Laboratories combines molecular genetics with biochemical and genomic approaches to understand the natural resistance mechanisms of plants against microbial pathogens. Her team works directly with A. tumefaciens, and we interviewed her to get her feedback so we could identify the potential shortfalls of our design. She was very excited that our team had taken an interest in plant pathogens and noted that methods to reduce crown gall and hairy root in the environment was an intriguing idea. She advised us to consider antibiotic assays as a testing method for both Ti plasmid reduction and pCambia inclusion.
Dr. Wanyin Deng, who currently works in the Finlay Lab at the Michael Smith Laboratories, had previously worked with A. tumefaciens during his PhD project. He is very passionate about A. tumefaciens and indicated that we would need to build mechanisms of positive selection in order to prevent plasmid loss. He also suggested that we link our CRISPR system targeting Ti plasmids to opines, in order to avoid background toxicity caused by CRISPR.
Dr. Cara Haney’s lab investigates the microbial communities associated with plant roots and we reached out to her for advice regarding the ecological impact our project. Her primary advice was that microbial conjugation was a difficult method of transfer, and was concerned about the long-term biosafety of an environmental system containing CRISPR/Cas9.
Dr. Stanton Gelvin, whose lab in Purdue University investigates how A. tumefaciens genetically engineers plants, was interviewed to determine how we could improve our project system. Dr. Gelvin indicated that rather than trying to upregulate conjugation through gene upregulation, a set of IncP plasmids have significant conjugation abilities. He also noted that our initially targeted gene, VirB6, was not as conserved as another virulence gene among all Agrobacterium and Rhizobium, VirD2.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," will look for the start sequence, then decode the     length and look foor the footer sequence after length number of base-pairs. In our example, the length is 108 base-pairs, which translates to AGTCAAAA in the length field of the header.
Checksum
Using the length and the footer is enough to verify that no     base-pairs have been inserted or deleted, but it cannot be used to    detect whether base-pairs have changed for whatever reason. To do    this we also add a checksum to the header.
A checksum is a kind of digital summary of data. The checksum    function, in our case CRC16-CCITT, takes data of any length and    computes a checksum of fixed length. In our case the checksum is 16    bits, so 8 base-pairs.
The encoding machine computes the checksum on the original     message sequence and places it in the header. The decoder reads the     sequenced message, computes the checksum and verifies that it     matches the one in the header. If they are, the message is     valid.
Because the message can be of any length (up to 65535     base-pairs), but the checksum is always 8 base-pairs, multiple     messages will have the same checksum. However, due to the way the     checksum is computed, two messages that are very similar but differ     in only a few bits will have completely different checksums. So     this method is very reliable for detecting small changes in the     sequence. Note that the checksum can only be used to detect changes     between the extracted message and the original, it cannot be used to    correct them.
The checksum of our example message is 51063, so the encoder puts GCGCGCAG as the checksum in the header. The     checksum function can be found in crc.js .
Restriction sites
All the previous issues regarding length and integrity are     fairly common in information exchange. Headers and checksums are     also used, for example in computer network protocols. The last     problem we face, however is specific to DNA. The full sequence may     not contain the five biobrick restriction sites of prefix and     suffix, namely:
EcoRI: GAATTC
PstI: CTGCAG
XbaI: TCTAGA
SpeI: ACTAGT
NotI: GCGGCCGC
To deal with this the encoder looks for occurrences of the     restriction site sequences and splices a certain number of     A-bases in the middle of each. The number of A-bases is determined     by the longest"
SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we held an iGEM South China Regional Conference. To take the essence from other teams, we also attended 5th CCIC and IGEM EURASIAN MEETUP.
How would the project be
We gained a lot from the meeting, we found our weak point, the safety problem and we made lots of collaboration through three meetings which made our project comprehensive.
Trouble we meet in project
We had already designed our experiment, and designed an initial cockroach box. But we didn’t know whether it could work well in the environment.
What we did for project
Therefore, we first went to our canteen to make an inspection about the environment cockroaches stay most. We also went to CDC to get to know living habit of cockroach. Then we asked Dr. Wang from Chongqing University for more suggestions on our box design.
How would the project be
Considering three investigations and comments from the applet, we finally designed the  second version of our cockroaches box which seemed more reasonable than the first one.
Trouble we meet in project
Since we designed new box, and changed a new prescription, we were eager to know how it worked. Additionally, we heard that some methods of killing cockroaches may affect the neighbor. We also required some data for our modeling.
What we did for project
To achieve our goal, we made a simulation about consequent of killing cockroaches with different ways like cockroach chalks, and our box with wild spores. We calculated and compared the migration rate and mortality of each product.
How would the project be
Our modeling can ran smoothly with our simulation which provided lots of data for it. Analyzing the data, we can give a guidance to the public to choose a better way to kill cockroach.
Trouble we meet in project
Now our box has been tested and we had detailed data about different ways to kill cockroach. We wanted to make an attribution to the society and test our boxes at the same time.
What we did for project
Therefore, we use our applet to make lots of communication of the public. We post our simulation result and told them a better way to kill cockroach. A teacher invited us to give a popularization after watching our project. Moreover, we gave a post showing that we hoped to distribute our boxes and finally went to Hunan to help them kill the local cockroaches.
How would the project be

Scheduled Coleen Riley to properly calibrate the balance on Tuesday. Contacted multiple offices to try and arrange a human practices meeting with BP with little success. Updated benzene quantification protocol.
Vi Ka: Continued to work on PCR for G-block 4, since the resulting DNA band was at the wrong size. Continued to modify protocol for the transport of benzene, recalculated amount of solutions needed in order to run multiple assays. Added few more contacts to HP master list.

Andrew: The stoichiometric matrix in the FBA model was adjusted not to include the consumption of benzene without an inflow of benzene to correct apparent infeasibility.  Brute force linear programming fell short of working with constraints given (especially minimums).  Wet lab work was performed including gel creation, gel running, gel imaging, and gel extraction.
Archana: Bought 10uL gel tips from Lilly Store. Filled and autoclaved tips and tubes. Ran gel for Q5 products, imaged, analyzed, and excised correct bands. Ran gel for #4 Q5 product and raw #4 DNA, imaged and analyzed gel. Performed gel purification on Q5 excised DNA bands.
Caleigh: Ate Mickey Mouse shaped food.
Katie: Autoclaved tips and tubes. Ran a gel on the Q5 PCR products. Analyzed results and excised correct bands. Started literature review and wrote an elevator pitch on the project for SURF.
Kevin: Updated benzene quantification protocol so that low concentrations could be achieved by dissolving benzene in small quantities (40uL) of ethanol. Ran a gel for the G4 DNA which failed. Purified DNA via gel extraction for G1, G2, G3, G5, and G6 DNA.
Vi Ka: Prepared PCR for all G-block products, ran at 57.1 celsius with annealing time of 30 seconds, and elongation time at 1.5 minutes. Analyzed gel, and excised band under blue light. Continued revision of protocol.

To make navigation as easy as possible, we've used the default iGEM pages and spent a long time thinking about the structure of the rest of our site. The navigation bar was significantly revised four times in efforts to make it as easy to find the relevant pages as possible, and we've tried to avoid using hidden nested subpages. If you do want a full list of pages with subpages you can see our sitemap . We set up several redirects to make it easier to guess links, although we believe they shouldn’t be required with our navigation bar. In addition, we scattered links throughout our text to prevent you having to hunt for the right page when we reference another part of our project.
We believe many teams don't take full advantage of the template system Mediawiki offers. By compartmentalizing all the repeated sections we made our code more readable, allowing members of our team with no coding experience at all to go in and edit sections (unfortunately they won’t now stop talking about how they’re programming geniuses). Templates also makes it easier to update styles - ensuring all our pages have a consistent feel that makes navigating them easier and look better.
We shared a lot of this knowledge with other teams, including Judd School, University of Westminster and Carroll High School. More information about this is available on our collaborations page .

When the Hg (II) concentration became as high as 10^-5M, cells can not tolerate the toxicity (Fig.4). However, data fit Hill function well apart from this. The ‘n’ values ranged from 2~4, determined by in silico fit of origin data.
Fig 5. The expression intensity of MerR significantly determines the threshold of sensitivity to mercury (II). Five representative lines are selected and it can be seen that the thresholds have varied apparently. The letter in the bracket after the promoter name denotes the backbone (pSB3K3 or pSB1A2) where Pc-RBS-merR was cloned. The deeper the colour, the stronger the expression level of MerR is, leading to a higher threshold.
In summary, promoters from partsregistry constitutive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity. The sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Data demonstrates that cells with different MerR intensity exhibited correspondingly different sensitivity to mercury, indicating that the stronger the expression intensity of MerR is, the higher threshold will be represented.

Motivation
   It is valuable to develop a system that can modulate cell's behavior transiently by injecting a desired ""protein"" directly into cells using a non-pathogenic strain. This system can be applied for many purposes. For example,
Inject p53 to terminate cell division of cancer cells selectively
Inject factors required for iPS cells induction
   It has been reported in 2007 that T3SS encoded in Salmonella Pathogenesity Island 2(SPI2) is functional in vitro on the E. coli (K-12) strain [9] . However, the T3SS encoded in SPI-2 naturally function inside of the phagosome of the target cell [8] . So, there was no report about whether the SPI-2 T3SS, that is cloned on E. coli (K-12) can inject a heterologous protein from outside of the target cell or not. That is why we have decided to put this challenging project into practice.
Objectives of iGEM 2010
   Though it is so exciting to create a cancer killer or an iPS generator E. coli, it is too difficult to aim these practical goals from the very first; because it was reported that some domains are not able to pass the needle of T3SS [1] [3] . So, we have established four objectives of iGEM 2010 as following.
To make T3SS available for E. coli
To inject desired proteins into target eukaryotic cells
To determine whether the injected protein function correctly
To deliver the injected protein toward desired compartment in the target cell

This year, we implemented nine plans on ""human practice"".
Our purpose of these projects is that we let many Japanese people know iGEM and participate in it. This is why we implemented nine projects. In order to achieve our purpose, we gave many people lessons the correct knowledge about Genetic Engineering and eliminate the bias toward it at many places. Besides, we attempted to communicate with local people who live in Kyoto through teaching science, synthetic biology, and ""iGEM"".
Especially, we gave high priority to two programs, ""Making iPhone app"" and ""Educational program""
The first project is that we created an iPhone app to let many Japanese know synthetic biology. This is because some Japanese people seem to have a bad impression for gene recombination, so we want to modify this bias. In addition, the number of the Japanese who know what gene recombination is still small, so we would like to show how wonderful recombination is to them.
The second project is to introduce the synthetic biology to high school students, as we would like many high school students to participate in iGEM. This summer, we carried out lectures about gene recombination and biochemistry in ""Seiryo festival"" at Hibiya high school; furthermore we held a poster session in open campus of Kyoto university.
Due to the curriculum in our country, it is rather difficult for high school students to take part in iGEM undergraduate category, so we decided to tell them about the HS division and support students who are interested in it. There will probably be many teams from Japan in the next iGEM HS division.
Application
This year we created an iPhone app named ""iColi"" that is aimed to let many Japanese know synthetic biology and bring it closer to the non-English speakers in Japan by presentation of an example of"

Because the PCR product was shorter than expected for the first Kapa PCR (construct 10), we also did a PCR of the BBa_J04500 + TALE A and BBa_J04500 + TALE B with BioBrick primers and with specially designed TALE primers to confirm the length of our TALEs. The results were good (figure 23).

We did a Kapa PCR of  TALE target sequences and the gel of the PCR products had bands of the expected size (figure 24). After PCR purification, the product was cut with EcoRI and SpeI. We also digested RFP with EcoRI and SpeI. We used the backbone from RFP as the vector for our PCR product and ligated them together.

Regarding our TALE expression and characterization, we did mini expression of TALE A , TALE B , Beta lactamase, BBa_J04500 , and RFP .
Week 18: August 26 - August 30
We did a colony PCR of construct 9 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE B -link-Kcoil), construct 10 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Kcoil) and the TALE target sequences which were transformed over the weekend. The PCR products were run on a gel, the colonies with the bands of the right size were made into overnight cultures and miniprepped. The gel of the verification digests did not have any bands and the overnight cultures were repeated with good results. Construct 9, construct 10 and the TALE target sequences were sent for sequencing.
The PCR product of construct 11 ( pSBIC3 - BBa_J04500 -His- TALE A -link-Blac) was purified and cut with EcoRI and AgeI and ligated with the vector, linker and Beta lactamase, which was cut with EcoRI and NgoMIV.

The school competition of iGEM in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China was held. After series of individual races and team competitions, excellent people were finally chosen into iGEM team of 2017: UESTC-China. Then we started to search for some useful and interesting projects. After four sessions of the group discussion and papers reading, we decided to choose TCP degradation by plants as our project. Then we started to carry out primary design of the project and then synthesized some key gene.

ETH_Zurich,2017,Team:ETH Zurich#Experiments#Anti Cancer Toxin_-_-_TEXT.html,"Freshly prepared bacterial lysate from cultures expressing azurin/gfp after induction with AHL, were analyzed via SDS - PAGE together with a concentration gradient of purified His8-azurin provided by Freiburg iGEM Team . The standard protocol for SDS-PAGE was followed.  Quantitative analysis of the SDS-PAGE gel was done with a LI-COR Odyssey CLx scanner.
RESULTS
The result of the SDS-PAGE verified the presence of the co-expressed azurin and sfGFP in the produced lysate (Figure 16). The same gel was used to quantify the amount of azurin via a concentration standard curve of purified azurin (Figure 17). Based on the OD of of the bacterial liquid culture before lysis (OD = 5) we could deduce that our lysate contained 7  mg/L of azurin (it constituted 12% of the total protein content). Considering the molecular weight of azurin (14.8 kDa), this amounts to a concentration of 570 nM in the bacterial lysate.
We also want to know what was the intracellular concentration of azurin to assess the maximimum concentration that we could achieve in our bacteria. For this we used the ""rule of thumb"" proportionality relationship between the OD and the number of cells (8.108 cells/OD) and the approximate volume of
E. coli: 1 µm3. We found an intracellular concentration of azurin of 140 µM, which is consistent with the 12% figure of protein content.
Figure 16. SDS-PAGE analysis of different bacterial lysates and concnetration gradient of purified His8-azurin. The samples analyzed were equipped with a vector expressing azurin/sfGFP,  or an empty vector. A detectable band corresponding to azurin's molecular weight only appears in the induced sample (AHL +) while it is absent in the mock-induced sample (AHL -). The purified azurin's molecular weight appears slightly higher due to the additional His-tag in the protein sequence.
Figure 17. Quantitative SDS-PAGE analysis of different bacterial lysates and concnetration gradient of purified His8-azurin. The total protein content of the lysates was, 2.4 μg for all the bacterial lysate samples. The concentration gradient was consisting of 2.4 μg, 1.92 μg, 1.44 μg, 1.2 μg, 0.96 μg, 0"

b. Does your institution have an  Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you  discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were  made based on this review.
Yes there is biosafety and ethical  research center in METU until 2000. This committee helds  many conferences about ethics, environmental  ethics in studies and the medicinal ethics based on human researchs. The below  link belongs to this committee however in Turkish language.
http://www.ueam.metu.edu.tr
      Indeed in Biology department at METU one of our professors, Prof.Dr  Huseyin Avni Oktem was one of the members of National Biosafety Coordinating  Committee. He is our pioneer for biosafety and security issues. In the case of  any safety issues, he is the one to consult   the critical safety points in our project and also discussed the project  based on safety.
      c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before  beginning your project? If so, describe this training.
Before we begin to experiments, we  firstly were taught on lab security and personal safety for cases of individual  injure, indeed in emergency situations. This interval was training for us. Also  team leaders, the experienced ones in team, prepared an exam for new team  members as a part of training for general lab regulations and project details.
Does your country have national  biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if  possible.
 
In Turkey, biosafety regulations are  organized by the Biosafety Information Exchange  Mechanism of Turkey, facility of Ministry  of Agriculture and Rural Affair.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," supposed to pay the beekeeper. He told us about when he was a US bee inspector, what they would do is when they find the disease, they would burn the colonies, quarantine the apiary, and tell the beekeeper he had five days to challenge, after that period, colonies that had symptoms would be burned.
What he would do is he would burn the frames and the columns on the bees and then crush the boxes so the beekeeper couldn't put bees in it anymore, nowadays, gasoline is used. The reason he did that is he wanted to make sure all the honey was destroyed because the honey stores were contaminated with the spores of American foulbrood and if the honey wasn't destroyed, all the apiaries around would get infected. Another way the disease is spread between beekeepers is through the places where honey is processed, they bring honey from different beekeepers or different countries and process it, if it is contaminated and bees get access to it, the disease is spread in the surroundings. Another way of spreading is when a beekeeper wants to buy or sell beehives or equipment that is contaminated because they don't see the symptoms and the person who is selling or buying, doesn't know there is a contamination.
We were curious if there were any biotechnical regulations that apply to bees in Brazil and the US regarding experimental work on them for example, for eradicating diseases. In Brazil they have no regulation affecting research with honey bees, the only regulation is involving bees in the wild. For experimental work, for instance, he is on the ethics committee of the hospital, he mentioned for human research a permission is needed as for animal research, but there are no insects’ permissions.
He offered to contact us to speak with Erica Weinstein Teixeira, she was a student of him, she set up a laboratory and it’s a good bee pathologist. Erika has worked with viruses and diagnosis and said she probably knows about AMPs. He also offered to contact us with more researchers in his lab in case we needed to.
Ultimately, he mentioned American foulbrood was not a problem in Brazil, but in Argentina is. He sent us some papers that could be useful to our research and said it was a good project. We are thankful for his help and for his willingness to keep supporting us.

Our goals cannot be achieved alone, that is a fact - it is too grand a mission to go on alone. This is one of the central values of iGEM itself, and so no less than 10 international collaborating teams would do:
Collaborating Teams
Leiden
XMU China
Imperial College
DTU-Denmark
SDU-Denmark
Munich United
Gothenburg-Chalmers
Friendship Teams
ITU iGEM
Stockholm
NiC Participants
European Meet-Up Participants (including iGEMs own Randy)
Beyond the tangible lab-cooperation of the above, we have enjoyed many friendships with other teams - discussing our ideas, meeting at international meet-ups and spending hours upon hours on Skype co-developing our ideas.
Our most considerable collaboration is with iGEM Leiden of the Netherlands, who were true examples of the iGEM spirit when they performed experiments for us in their Random Positioning Machine (RPM), allowing us to know how our organisms grow without the usual knowledge of what is up and what is down.
In return, we conducted experiments on their organisms in the Jens Martin Mars Chamber located at UCPH, with parameters such as pressure, UV-radiation, CO2-atmospheres and temperature.
Imperial College are experts on mathematical modelling, and they offered to take a look at our system with this in mind. In return we offered growth and density data for our co-culture, so that they could anchor their theoretical work in actual lab-work as well. In the end, this exact exchange had little impact on our final projects - but it made us all a bit smarter, and made sure we all knew our projects to better detail.
DTU and SDU are our fellow Danes, and we have worked with them closely. From the Biobrick Tutorial hosted by DTU to our own Human Practices Workshop and the Modelling Workshop we all co-hosted at the University of Copenhagen Campus, and all the many social events we shared together"

We are working really hard to the outreach activities!
One of the major work we focus on is the popularization of science. Inspired by one of the major incident in the debating of transgenic technology in China, our team hold six successful lecture in our university to share the basic knowledge of different areas of biology. We are not satisfied with our achievements on the campus, so we search places outside our university to make more difference. We work hard to get the chance to give a speech to all the students in a high school; we explain the simple principle of transgenic food to the passengers and hand out leaflets on the street; we introduced our project to visitors in Shanghai Science&Technology Museum.
Besides all these activity, we also run the daily activity of Betalanffy Association, which is a famous community belonging to our iGEM team. See more...
2015 Fudan is a fabulous team. We functioned specifically and managed every aspect of the iGEM competition within our team: project design, lab work, trouble-shooting, modeling, fundraising, human practice and wiki construction. With the generous help of our advisors and instructors, we brought here our final results. Also we offered our sincere thanks and acknowledgements for all the supporters involved in helping making a fabulous team. We do appreciate it. See more...
We have shown our design details of  three kinds of cyclizing device in  the DESIGN page:the Ouroboros（cyclizing device based on the inverted repeat sequence in the exon-flanking region), the Cyclizer（proteins that accelerate RNA cyclization)and the acRNA(ssRNA that accelerate RNA cyclization).
All the three types of cyclizing devices we designed were actualized into sequence and parts, and we are currently working on testing and improve these devices.
We experimentally validate that our device can accelerate the formation of cirRNA.
We measured the half-life time of the circRNA produced by our device, which shows circRNA has significant higher stability.
We designed a device to report the level of mir-21 concentration to support our experiment.
We modeled the structure of proteins to confirm our “Cyclizer” design.
We test cyclization based on acRNA and find circRNA never documented before! We are now working on new experiments to investigating it!
Our devices provide huge possibility for cirRNA research and regulating oncomiRs, and we are still working to improve our device and develop our toolbox! See"

Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
On July 23th, we went to Tsinghua University with our questions and initial ideas to communicate with the members of Tsinghua team. They helped us solve the problems and taught us more about iGEM and genetic biology. Then we discussed the ideas and programs of the iGEM teams a few years ago. This communication helped us build up a clearer understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM.
 
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
In the middle of July, We visited the iGEM team of BIT-China. They showed us the programs they made in the past two years, shared with us the difficulties and challenges they met and the ways for them to solve the problems. They also guided us on the designing and making of wiki.
Through exchange with the seniors, we got a more profound understanding of genetic engineering, which helped us to form a more reasonable and practical project.
 
 
BNDS-China
On October 2nd，2016, some members of BNDS-China visited us  to exchange their work with ours. Both of the teams presented their ideas, experiments, and results. Through this discussion, we got to know about their amazing idea and were enlightened by some of their suggestions. Meanwhile, we also gave them some advice  and showed them some good aspects of our project. To communicate with the high-school team made us understand iGEM even more deeply, helped us to check our shortcomings and improve our results.

Definition of „Artificial Cell“ and „Living Machine“ in Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is still a young field of science, which combines areas of engineering, chemistry, biotechnology, computer science and molecular biology. It can be defined by their objectives. This definition encompasses four points. One goal is to gain new scientific knowledge about the processes within cells by trying to build cells from the bottom up or the top down. Another goal is to open up new fields of possible applications for synthetic modified organisms for example in medicine. A key issue involves the creation of novel, non-naturally occurring organisms and structures, as well as modularization and standardization of repeatedly compassable components: BioBricks.
Before discussing the definitions of „artificial cell“ and „living machine“ it is crucial to define to what extend can ever be spoken about a creation of life in synthetic biology. The currently pursued research approaches in synthetic biology do not aspires the creation of life de novo. De novo can be explained from the Latin term “newly create, invent” (Pons). In connection with synthetic biology this implies the creation of new organisms without any foundation in already existing organisms. Up to this day researchers are working with organisms found in nature.
However, in the future scientists attempt to design and manufacture new biological systems, with no origin in nature (Boldt et al. 2009). Creating new life is consequently one main goal of synthetic biology.
There are three different approaches aiming at the goal: the DNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell engineering and protocell creation (O´Malley et al. 2008).
The DNA-based device construction approach engages with the method of modularization, standardization and abstraction of biological constructs (Arkin 2008). Building a collection of biobricks and inserting them in organisms gives these new functions. Creating new species, which do not occur in nature (European Commission 2003).
The genome-driven cell engineering approach aims to create a so-called „minimal cell“. Parts of the cell should be reduced to a minimal extend, leaving only necessary properties for survival. Minimizing the genome after the top-down-approach pursues the creation of an organism as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every BioBrick can be introduced into the genome"

Paris_Bettencourt,2017,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM Meetup
We attended the France iGEM meetup hosted by the Pasteur iGEM team, where 8 teams from all over France gathered. The iGEMers Bordeaux, Aix-Marseille University, INSA-UPS Toulouse, UPMC Paris, Evry Paris-Saclay, and IONIS teams were all present. In the morning, we met with all the teams and then each team presented their project for 20 minutes and then had 10 minutes of questions from a carefully selected jury. This was a great opportunity to meet other iGEMers from France, as well as a chance to practice our presentations before the Jamboree. We were able to further our acquaintance over lunch and during round-table discussions with past iGEMers in the afternoon. Finally, we had a half hour presentation on how to present elevator pitches, which immediately preceded a 3 minute pitch of the project by each team!
Talk EdTech students (CRI)
We were invited to present our project to the Master EdTech students of the Center for research and Interdisciplinary. The EdTech Master gathers around 20 students that are eager to learn about teaching, entrepreneurship and research through new ways of understanding the digital transformation happening in the world. Therefore, the creative students were excited to hear about our project as they had the opportunity to help us concretize it. We did a 15 min presentation followed up by another 15 minutes of questions, and they were extremely curious about our work as most of them were not familiar with synthetic biology. Furthermore, they gave us great advice and ways to reflect on the technological part of our project as well as the design of our proof-of-concept - the bacterial 3D printer. Many were interested in collaborating with us for the Escape Game we created, especially Mourdjen Bari, one of the teachers, who helped tremendously with the computational interface of the game.
Talk to Paris VII Diderot
We presented our project to a class of students from the SIAS bachelor (Interdisciplinary Sciences applied to Health) of the university of Paris VII Diderot. As an interdisciplinary cursus, this class was composed of students interested in various fields such as Biology, Public Health, Medicine, Political Sciences or even Business and Management. The presentation really hit the students as now some are actually interested in doing iGEM in the following year. They raised interesting questions about the project and we had a real discussion with them on how to improve our work.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#pqs_-_-_TEXT.html," in LB medium and spiked with synthetic PQS (in 100% DMSO) at finals concentrations of 50 and 500 μM. A western blot with anti-mCherry antibodies was performed on the treated cells alongside a control (DMSO). Two further controls - MC1061 cells harbouring the empty pUniprom vector (mCherry negative control) and BBa_K562011 (mCherry positive control) were also included.
As shown in Fig 4, incubation of cells with synthetic PQS, did not induce expression of mCherry. It is not clear why the biosensor did not respond. One possibility we considered is that PqsR is not correctly localized to the membrane in E. coli. We therefore fractionated E. coli cells containing PqsR-HA into soluble and membrane fractions. However, as shown in Fig 5, all of the detectable PqsR-HA was found in the membranes as it is in the native organism.
We discussed the results of the PQS biosensor extensively with the modelling team . They suggested increasing the number of promoters (by at least 10-fold). This should allow for sufficient production of mCherry, which can then be detected. We are in the process of building this new expression system.

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus"

Project: DIY-Gem
Creating the set of educational tools and learning resources to allow comprehension and accessibility to the core techniques associated with Synthetic Biology. We've discussed creating e.coli that can be added to the bb system that can actually produce the major enzymes used in these techniques so that beginner's can ""grow their own"", saving the $1 a ul that some of these can cost. We have the sequence for Pol1 (J) for Taq Aquaticus, and can put it into e. coli, but it contains a Pst1 site dead in the center of it's sequence so we'd have to create a new sequence and test it's viability, prior to formatting it in the bb format. The Pfu polymerase from Pyroclase Fusarium is usually used with BB, as it has enhanced error protection mechanisms and can withstand higher temperature cycling. The patent on Pol1 has expired. Patents exist on Pst1, none on exist on EcoR1, Xbe and Spe, couldn't find patent or sequence information, need more research. Other implementation of the DIY-Bio structure involves the construction of inexpensive hardware that is utilized in the process of synthetic biology research, i.e. microgram scales, centrifuges, PCR thermocyclers, Gel Electrophoresis kits, Devices for volumetrics, histobots, DNA sequencers/synthesizers and enhanced microscopy equipment. Many of these hw pieces have already been hacked by various groups within the DIY-Bio communities, however our goal would be to create those pieces necessary for us to continue to experiment/collaborate past the end of the iGEM timeframe.

Bio-remediation oriented project to sequester/breakdown excessive estrogen levels that are currently responsible for turning the bass populations in Maryland tributaries into intersex species. Apparently 100% of the Male Bass populations are currently intersex meaning that they are carrying eggs due to the high-levels of hormone disruptors such as Estrogen that are not being cleaned by Maryland's current water treatment facilities. Researchers at Washington State have posited using Ammonia based microbials in bio-reactor systems to help break down estrogen, and there are supposedly BB parts that can be used as Estrogen Re"

SynBioDay: Street Science in Bielefeld
Preparation
On the 28th of June all German iGEM teams were invited to the strategy process „Biotechnologie 2020+“ in Berlin. There we decided to plan and arrange a common day in all German cities with participating iGEM teams to raise public awareness for Synthetic Biology and iGEM. In the end the SynBioDay took place in Munich ( TU and LMU ), in Darmstadt , Göttingen , Marburg , Tübingen , Bonn and of course in Bielefeld. We all agreed to organize the event on the 25th of August. The idea behind our common day was to inform public not only about Synthetic Biology, but also about iGEM and our project. We also wanted to show that there are plenty of iGEM teams with great ideas, therefore, as part of our collaboration with the iGEM team from the Southern University of Denmark we invited them to present a poster at our
booth and to help us with the realization. In Germany there is an ongoing debate about modern life sciences, especially biotechnology, genetic engineering and synthetic biology and we thought that by informing and explaining we might reduce prejudices (for the german debate about Synthetic Biology take a look at our discussion with René Röspel, a member of the german parliament - see here ).
Realization
The poster to describe our project, which we presented at Street Science.
In Bielefeld we organized the booth in cooperation with Bielefeld Marketing . We prepared a lot of different things. For example a microscope to have a look at microorganisms and a “wanted poster” for the classification of organisms. For kids we organized pipettes and lab coats for them to feel like scientists. They could pipet colored water and mix it, to see how"
Lethbridge_HS,2017,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," our tour guide. He took us through the entire building, starting with the design area. This was a section in the building for workers to create designs for customers and other business affiliations. Mr. Warwick then proceeded to show us the printers that they used for the company, including printing presses and other printers used for digital printing. The printers they used were very large compared to the size of the average household printer.Their digital printers used toner, a powdered form of pigmentation, while their printing press used ink, a liquid form of pigmentation.  He shared some interesting facts with the team, like how black is the most used color by consumers, allowing for two black ink cartridges to exist in the digital printers instead of one. In another part of the building there was the printing press, which Mr. Warwick specifically explained can only print one color at a time. Four press sheets were used for the four different colours of the CMYK colour theory. There was also a printer that could print more colors at once. In addition to this, Mr. Warwick showed us a matching color palette given to a customer to allow them to choose a desired color for the product being made. The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is the standard of colour for all ink production. He explained to us how the different types of ink, depend on specific applications. For example, the ink used by the Warwick company is not the same as what we plan to provide for a proof of concept, the fountain pen. They use an ink that is a very thick liquid, almost solid. They then proceed to mix it with water and a chemical to use in their printers. Overall, this tour was helpful to our team’s knowledge in the printing business, as well as in ink marketing and production. We gained a greater understanding on the ways that ink is used in the printing industry and the different standards for the ink.
Best Environmental Practices
Figure 1: Global investment in alternative
energy sources since 2006(3).
The problem that our project is solving is the harmful byproducts of ink pigment production. The most common colorant used in ink today is Carbon Black. Carbon Black is produced by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons such as oil or natural gas(1). This results in other byproducts such as: Carbon monoxide(2), VOC’s and PCB’s. The basis of our project is to create an alternative source of colorants and pigments which will reduce the need for Carbon Black production and reduce the frequency of these harmful practices. Our use of synthetic biology to produce the pigments will allow us to have a minimal amount"

Denitrification
We received the sequencing results this week for CarAc which came back as a 100% match to the expected nucleotide sequence. We also successfully ligated both CarAa and CarAd into PSB1C3 and transformed into top 10 E. coli cells. Colony PCR verified the presence of the biobrick plasmid in these colonies. These were both miniprepped, digested and sent for sequencing by the end of the week. Using a salt gradient, addition of DMSO, and the KAPA buffer specifically designed for GC-rich amplicons we were able to amplify the Ant operon from a genomic prep of LD2. However, all attempts at ligating and transforming this sequence were met with the unfortunate presence of red colonies. Next week we will recut a PSB1C3 vector with Xba and Pst to attempt to mitigate this problem. We also reactivated the R. erythropolis using DSMZ media #1 and grew it on plates made from DSMZ media #220 at 28 degrees. Colonies grew very quickly and were used for colony PCR and to make overnight cultures for downstream applications. The colony PCR using the amidase primers was unsuccessful, so a genomic prep was performed on the overnight culture. Unfortunately we lacked some of the required equipment and the genomic prep did not work, but with a few procedural modifications and the right equipment we are confident it will work next week. A glycerol stock of the erythropoplis was also made from another overnight culture. We also started construction on the CarAc part this week by inserting a ribosome binding site (B0034) in front of the gene. Finally, since the Ant operon was successfully amplified by PCR we designed mutagenesis primers for the 2nd EcoRI site in the operon rather than making new individual primers. We also designed a mutagenesis primer to remove the SpeI site in AmdA. Now that we have conclusively proven that the LD2 strain contains the pCAR1 plasmid we aim to demonstrate its ability to degrade carbazole and other nitrogen containing heterocycles using an assay experiment similar to the one performed in Week 10.

Collaborations
It takes many recourses to accomplish extensive projects and collaborating with other teams is an important part of iGEM. In this project, our team has collaborated with several other iGEM teams in the aim to reach further. Presented below are the highlights of our collaborations, namely The Wiki Wizard, The BioBrick Workshop, No Money, No Project and What is Fracking? 
 
The Wiki Wizard
Creating and editing wiki pages, uploading files with the correct name can be a tedious task. Therefore we are making the Wiki Wizard, which helps with the naming of pages and files, making sure that they have the correct namespace etc. Also it has a WYSIWYG editor for content and syntax highlighted editors for html, javascript and css files.
It can be found on GitHub .
 
 
The BioBrick Workshop
The DTU iGEM team of 2015 hosted and prepared the content of the BioBrick Workshop from the 24th to the 26th of April, 2015. SDU , UNIK Copenhagen, and DTU collaborated to represent every iGEM team within Denmark. teams also participated. The BioBrick Workshop was an initiative to educate iGEM team members with the basic lab competences required to perform a synthetic biology project as ambitious as iGEM. It also provided an opportunity to introduce fellow iGEMers to general lab safety and cloning techniques while strengthening the social dynamics within the teams.
Highlights of the program included a general assembly tutorial for the creation of a new BioBricks independent of organism and project. In the tutorial, the teams practiced designing primers for Uracil Specific Excision Repair (USER) cloning and they integrated a green fluorescent protein expression cassette into a target location on the chromosomal DNA of E. coli. In order to teach everyone a variety of techniques, the iGEM teams were mixed and half of the groups used the USER-cloning technique while the other half used traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques. As"

BABS_UNSW_Australia,2015,Team:BABS UNSW Australia#project#phlow_-_-_TEXT.html," E. Coli, not L. lactis and that further characterisation needs to be undertaken to conclusively determine their results.
As can be seen here, there is a slight increase in promoter activity at lower pH’s for both ASR and p170. For the purposes of the pHlow plasmid we ideally desire a promoter that will have minimal expression under normal conditions, as can be seen below the overall activity of either promoter is significantly less than CP44. Further characterization attempts should look at using a weaker promoter for the standard comparison.
It can be observed that CP44 has decreased activity at lower pH values despite being normalised for OD600 (conferring cell density).
While there is evidence that both ASR and p170 can be used to upregulate expression under acidic conditions, they still have expression in a neutral environment. While this may be helpful for future iGEM projects the pHlow plasmid relies on a tightly regulated and timed expression of listeriolysin and cre-recombinase, something that these two promoters don’t appear to confer.

And we mainly explored three questions about iGEM during the conference:
1. How to build a promising and energetic team?
Click to know our conclusion
Starting from interest and diversity:
With the rapid development of Synthetic Biology, it’s definite that iGEM has become a multidisciplinary jamboree. Not only biology but also chemistry, physics, computing science, engineering science and more are involved in iGEM. Therefore, no matter which field you’re in, anybody interested in Synthetic Biology are welcome to participate in iGEM and it’s sure that you can play a role in your iGEM trip.
The most efficient way to development is gathering companions together to talk about the frontier of biology and nobody can stop the flight of our thoughts. It doesn’t matter that you don’t have relative knowledge or experience, because during training and studying, we will have some insight into our project and meanwhile, we will know more about Synthetic Biology, which makes learning more interesting and instructive.
Inheritance and innovation:
To attach more creativity and novelty to the project, it’s important that senior team members need to lead and guide freshmen, providing them effective methods in proper time and preserving their possibility. By considering items from different aspects, we can gain more solutions and ideas. Moreover, reflection and summarization are necessary. We can learn a lot from the years in iGEM, helping us to optimize and do better in the next year.
Inspection and supervision:
Appropriate inspection and supervision system is also essential for the accomplishment of the project because we are facing plenty of challenges. And this system can press us to shoulder more and dedicate more and it’s the guarantee for your acquisition and development. Inspection and supervision system can keep our teams dynamic and remind every member to stay enthusiastic and hard-working.
2. What does iGEM mean to us?
Click to know our conclusion
iGEM teams put up many original and alive concepts and projects through years. And they made great efforts on it. But how many of the projects have been really put into practice and will some previous concepts be possible to achieve now? These questions are mostly concerned from the outside. But are these all of it? What are the things iGEM actually bring to us? The question is worth discussing.
Firstly, we need to define what is iGEM and what is synthetic biology. The two are not the same concept. Synthetic Biology is developed based on multiple subjects such as biology, maths, engineering and so on. It provides us a training of thought to deal with a real-world problem. It is trying"

Confocal image of DH5alpha E.coli  transformed with BBa_K523013
A: shows YFP fluorescence (514 nm)
B: zoom of one Bacteria that shows spot of clustered YFP
Looking at E.coli we noticed that fluorescence was localized in specific specks, that the team of Edinburgh didn’t describe. We started looking for an explanation for this phenomena and found in the literature that INP forms aggregates in the cell membranes [3 ] This suggests that INP also forms aggregates when it is fused to other proteins. We continued characterizing this biobrick by first determining the percentage of bacteria that were fluorescent. We found that approximately 30% of E.coli expressed YFP.
The team of Edinburgh grew bacteria and lysed them. After centrifugation, they looked where the fluorescence seemed concentrated. On the transformed bacteria, it was mainly the pellet that appeared fluorescent, meaning that the fusion protein was embedded in the membrane. The negative control, in contrast, showed fluorescence in the pellet as well as in the supernatant with the same intensity. This method was used because their microscopy was not good enough.
The confocal microscope was really powerful. But we too, didn't succeed to proof surface localization of the fusion protein by simply looking at the intrinsic fluorescence of the YFP, because the signal was to diffuse.
So we came up with an alternative strategy: Immunofluorescent assay using an anti-YFP antibody and visualizing it with an inverted microscope.

Tufts,2014,Team:Tufts#ribosponge_-_-_TEXT.html," the mode of action of the c-di-GMP molecule itself. In silico computations predicted that the PilZ protein domain present in G. xylinus would bind the secondary messenger. As a result of this, PilZ domains have been identified in many bacterial proteins whose activity responds negatively to the presence of c-di-GMP. (7) One example, the YegR protein of free swimming E. coli, contains a PilZ site. Experiments show that the deletion of the phosphodiesterase enzyme responsible for c-di-GMP degradation in the E. coli strain leads to reduced swimming ability. In addition, subsequent deletion of the YegR protein (which binds and responds to the presence of c-di-GMP) restores motility to 80% of that exhibited by the wild type bacteria. (8)
Riboswitch aptamers (ligand-binding nucleic acid molecules) for c-di-GMP have been identified. (9) (10) These RNA aptamers can come before or after a transcribed gene. Examples of “on” and “off” regulatory c-di-GMP riboswitches have been observed in P. aeruginosa, M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, Y. pestis, and other bacterial species which latent phases which are more tolerant of antibiotics and adverse conditions. (6) (8) (9) (10) It seems that this secondary messenger is the key molecule in persistent cells.

Killing the Messenger
“The most important secret in war consists of making one’s self the master of communications.”  – Napoleon Bonaparte, Pensées
In summary, current data shows that if cyclic di-GMP is eliminated from the cells of a number of bacterial species, they cannot enter the persistent state. Theoretically, the pathogens can be prevented from shutting down and becoming tolerant to antibiotics or lack of nutrients. Experiments have already demonstrated this by overproducing the phosphodiesterases which break down the messenger or mutating the dyguanylate cyclases which produce it. (9)
Targeting c-di-GMP across all these species could be done by excising the enzymes which are responsible for synthesizing the molecule or adding more phosphodiesterases to break it down. Genetic editing that is targeted with this degree of specificity is difficult to accomplish in a clinical setting. Furthermore, the addition of new proteins would increase the metabolic burden associated with their translation.
A potential tool is presented by the gram-negative predator of gram-negatives, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. This organism also has two distinct life phases."

PCR parts of Agr operon
We received primers for Agr A,B,C, and D today - http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Cambridge/2008/Turing_Pattern_Formation/Primers
We must PCR each individual part out of the previous BioBricks (I746001 &I746101) in order to put our bacillus RBS on them.
I was concerned that the region of most homology would be the BioBrick prefix and suffix itself, so I first digested the DNA with Xbal and SpeI.
For some reason the digestion didn't work that well, so I've decided to go ahead and use the uncut BioBrick DNA as template for my reactions.

We already know that things can die at Spc100 (the double crossover test from earlier this week) so it is unlikely that the stock is bad. We should test Spc50 again with regular bacillus and with E. coli at 50-100 ug/ml and hope that they die.

FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Experiments3_-_-_TEXT.html," proved the specific and efficient toxicity to Mosquitoes larvae by bioassay. But the Bt. owns fatal weakness that they cannot live for a long time in the natural environment, especially when they are under sunshine exposure. The heterologous expression of toxins in suitable organism will be a good choice to solve this problem. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a general choice for heterologous expression in eukaryote. But to decrease the cost of this method, we decide to make use of photosynthetic organism which can live in water. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular alga which belongs to the Chlorophyte Phylum. It can be the food source for mosquitoes larvae.  According to the result of identification and clone from LLP29, Cry and Cyt proteins are the main resource of toxicity. According to the previous research, Cry proteins can improve the toxicity of Cyt proteins by combination. Therefore, we chose 2A-peptide expression system to co-express Cry and Cyt proteins.
2.The Damage of Mosquitoes
Mosquitos are the one of the most harmful in the world. They can spread various mosquito-borne by biting animals and human. Nowadays, epidemic diseases like Zika, dengue and malaria that are transmitted by mosquitoes have infected human seriously and tended to distribute around the world.
Take Zika for instance, it is spread mostly by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito (Ae. Aegyptus and Ae. Albopictus). These mosquitoes bite human and animals during the day and night.  Mother-baby transmission, sex and blood can also transmit the Zika virus. According to the latest Zika situation report of WHO, since 2015, mosquito-borne Zika virus infections have been evidenced in 73 countries or territories including 56 areas have ever occurred outbreak as Figure0. And all the continents have reported infection cases. There is no need to emphasize the damage of Zika virus because the news about damage has been known around the world by media reporters.
Recently, America and Brazil have agreed to strengthen cooperation on research of Zika vaccine. But actually, it takes a long time for the drug development. Therefore, the best way to reduce the spread of Zika is to kill the vector mosquitoes. In addition, CDC (Center for Diseases Control and Prevention) suggests that we can

Laccase TVEL5 in RFC25 (BBa_K1615067)
Laccases are glycosylated polyphenol oxidases and have four copper ions per molecule1. This allows them to catalyse the reduction of O2 to 2H2O while oxidising an aromatic substrate2. This laccase is coded by the structural gene lcc in Trametes versicolor, a species of white rot fungus3.
To increase the functions of laccase, we took the sequence from iGEM12_Bielefeld-Germany laccase BBa_K863030 and codon optimised it for the chassis Escherichia coli. We then made it RFC25 compatible by adding the prefix and suffix and removing all illegal restriction sites. This laccase can now be used in protein fusions as there is an in-frame 6-nucleotide scar.

mRFP (BBa_K1615089)
RFP is important in synthetic biology as a visualisation tool. While multiple versions of RFP exist in the registry, only one is RFC25 compatible. This RFP (BBa_K1351021) contains a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the RFC25 prefix which precludes it from using the common lac expression cassette (BBa_K314103) which already contains a ribosome"

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"icylic acid (SA) is an important organic product that can be used in the production of cosmetics, preservatives, medical supplies, and so on. Nowadays, commonly used industrial synthetic method to produce SA is the Kolbe-Schmitt method, which is a three-step reaction using phenol as raw material. However, this method costs a lot of energy and quite a long time, and phenol has a carcinogenic effect, which is very harmful to the human body and the environment. Therefore, it is promising to replace chemical synthesis method by biosynthesis method.
Fig.6 Kolbe-Schmitt phenol medium pressure solvent process flow chart
In nature, only few strains can produce SA, and they are difficult to be isolated or be screened. Recent years, some laboratories have succeed in SA’s biosynthesis in E.coli by utilizing the shikimate synthesis pathway, with a maximum yield of up to 1 g/L. Chorismate, an intermediate  product in the pathway, is catalyzed to iso-branched acid by isochorismate synthase (ICS), and then catalyzed to SA by iso-branched pyruvate lyase (IPL) (Fig.7).
Fig.7 Synthetic pathway of salicylic acid. ICS: isochorismate synthase; IPL: isochorismate pyruvate lyase.
Based on the research results from literature, we have the idea of applying our anti-degeneration loop to produce SA in order to increase production and reduce costs. It will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the industrialized biosynthesis of SA.
Previous experiments and literature have shown that both Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens contains natural ICS and IPL genes and both genes can express and work in E.coli. Meanwhile, we found pchBA (Part: BBa_J45319), an IPL-ICS genes extracted from Pseudomonas fluorescens, in iGEM2018kit. So we use this pchBA and the positive-feedback loop mentioned above to design the pathway showed in figure 8. When pchBA is correctly expressed, SA is produced in the bacteria and makes the downstream gdh expressed. The expression of gdh can give bacteria growth advantage, so that the bacteria can produce larger amount of SA. In this way, we construct a positive feedback, allowing a vigorously growth and higher production to bacteria.
