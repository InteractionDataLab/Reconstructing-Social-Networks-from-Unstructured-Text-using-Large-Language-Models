“Yes”
Second argument ""It is unnatural""
“Why do you oppose the making of Gmos""
“It is unnatural”
“In what way do you mean?”
“I mean it is unnatural because we make stuff in a laboratory that nature cannot”
“So, because GMOs are not created by evolution but human interference, you oppose it?”
“Yes, I do”
“Do you think that humans can exist without interfering with nature?”
“No. But there is a difference between doing what is needed to survive and what is possible”
“So, what is needed for man to survive is okay, but the progress of science due to curiosity is not?”
“Yes, exactly”
“Then please tell me; are we to revoke penicillin and lifesaving medication?”
“Of course not.”
“Are we to de-evolve back to the stone ages?”
“Don’t be foolish”
“Then what do you mean?”
“There is just something that feels wrong when it comes to GMO”
“Your feelings are highly justified, but they cannot count as an argument, can they?”
“No”
“So, you admit that arguing against GMO with the statement that it is unnatural is faulted?”
“Yes”
Third Argument ""We cannot foresee the consequences""
“In what way do you oppose to GMOs?”
“We don’t have a clue about the consequences”
“You are right, we don’t. But if we were to avoid actions where the consequences is unknown, then there is very little left for us to do”
“What do you mean?”
“A consequence is in causal relation to an action, right?”
“Right”
“We define a consequence as something that happens as a result of an action, and that we can trace the consequence back to the action. Do we agree?”
“We do”
“But does this mean that the only consequences that exists are the ones that we experience? It seems to me that this approach is blocked by commonsense. Imagining that the existence consequences of my actions are limited to my conscience. This implies that if I was to drop a bucket of stones from a rooftop and it was to hit and kill a person, then it wouldn’t happen if I were never confronted with it. This is absurd, don’t you think?”
“Indeed”
“So, the reality and variety of the consequences of my actions doesn’t depend on me experiencing it, right?”
“Right”
“Then you must agree that it is quite possible that there is a unfathomable amount of consequences of even the most anonymous action.  Yes?”

We ordered the Gibson assembly kit, and it ran upwards of 700 dollars for 50 reactions.
Joe successfully PCR'd out the DszD gene from Rhodococcus genomic DNA that he isolated.
Our further attempts at PCR for the yddg and tyrA genes was unsuccessful.
- Jacob Toth
July 1
There are many (hundreds) of colonies on Joe's recombineering plates, and the concentration of colonies goes up as the concentration of antibiotic goes down. It appears that the addition of arabinose to the culture did nothing to increase recombineering efficiency. There are several large, well defined colonies on the full antibiotic plate. It appears that 2 days are required for sufficient growth at 30°.
With this success in mind, I PCR purified a couple of other knockouts (ArgE Tet and TrpB Kan) and transformed them, reusing the electroshock cuvettes we borrowed from Rafael. A pack of 50 was ordered so we could do more than 4 transformations per day.
We only had one chlor plate left, and 4 potential biobricks which were to be put on the chloramphenicol resistant pSB1C3 plasmid. Since there was only one plate (and one electroshock cuvette), only the MetA biobrick ligation product was transformed.
The pKD46 recombineering vector that we received from Dr. Ramey grew well overnight at 30°C, and was miniprepped, and then transformed into the Epi300 strain. The recovery period was done at 30°C as well. If the transformation is successful, Ting will make electrocompetent cells out of the Epi300+pKD46.

Colonies with potential biobricks of trpA, tyrA, argE, metA, and dszD were successfully grown. This time, chemically competent cells were used, and they were plated on 1/2 concentration chlor plates. We also transformed and grew out the previously characterized minC biobrick.
PCR of the yddg gene failed yet again. It is possible that the primers are not correct.

pT181 Attenuator target sequence with improved repressive efficiency
An improved version of pT181 sense target with its length shortened from 287bp to 201bp and its repressive efficiency improved from 84%for BBa_K1126003( http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1126003 ) to 98%. The part achieves such efficiency through forming secondary structures that can interact with the pT181 antisense and hinder the transcription of downstream genes. With the absence of pT181 antisense, nevertheless, the expression is basically unaffected.
Usage and Biology
Our engineered cells need a Three-Node Negative Feedback Loop to construct a more sensitive and high-fidelity control system. And pT181 attenuator is the part that plays the role of repressor in this loop.
pT181 attenuator is a part composed of a sense target sequence and an antisense RNA that can regulate gene transcription and translation. Residing in the 5΄ untranslated region of the target gene, it can regulate the expression of a downstream gene at both transcriptional and translational levels.
The RNA regulators show sufficient advantages over traditional protein-based regulatory systems, including:
Programmability: As Watson-Crick base pairing is predictable, the RNA-RNA interaction can be predicted by sophisticated software tools. In this way, a RNA switch can be designed artificially, which are difficult for proteins.
Lower metabolic cost: Compared with proteins, the RNA switches dispense with translation step, which saves a great amount of resources.
Fast response: RNA switches could propagate signals faster than proteins considering the fast degradation rates of RNAs.
Despite these advantages, RNA regulators still suffer from incomplete repression in their OFF state, making the dynamic range less than that of the proteins. This leak can cause the network to function incorrectly. Therefore, we submit the dual-control pT181 attenuator, which can solve this problem.
The dual-control pT181 attenuator we submitted offers a significant advantage over previous iGEM parts that submitted in 2013:
Reduce leak: As our pT181 attenuator could regulate both transcription and translation in"

Bioplastics have a bright future
Bioplastics are made either directly by living things or from the products they make. They are usually more environmentally friendly than petrochemically derived plastics (1) and do not rely upon finite fossil fuels. Advances in how they are produced is allowing bioplastics with controllable physical properties to be produced (3) enabling uses which mimic those of oil-based plastics. The properties of some bioplastics allow novel functions to be carried out. An exciting example of this is the production of biocompatible scaffolds which can be used in surgical treatments (4) . This combination of innovations leading to improved functions and the development of novel uses combined with environmental benefits over petrochemical plastics are just some of the reasons why bioplastics are expected to flourish commercially in the coming years (5) . Currently around 10% of the plastics market consists of bioplastics, with this predicted to increase to around 30% by 2020. This is a huge increase and represents significant commercial opportunities. The predicted production of such a large amount of material requires careful consideration of what we do once we have used the products produced, called end of life solutions.
Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) and poly(lactic Acid)(PLA) are both commonly used and well studied bioplastics. Currently several different companies produce each by a variety of methods (9) .
Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate
P(3HB) is produced as an energy store in some bacteria. Commercially it is produced in bioreactors from sucrose and other sugars derived from plant biomass. P(3HB) can also be produced in the stems"
KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#Ethics#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," it takes to repair when something goes wrong? For instance in case of a nuclear disaster it will take thousands of years to revert to its normal state. Influencing a ecosystem might also change it for many generations.
These risks are hard to assess for synthetic biology. A case to case view is necessary. Indeed time could be an extra factor to assess the risk of a project. If new life is formed that is very dangerous but it dies in an instant out of the test tube, one is more inclined to allow this project then if these life forms would survive longer. Johan De Tavernier suggests that the four criteria of plagiarism of the KU Leuven could be used to assess the risk: seriousness, scale, grade and impact.
Open source
Open source makes it possible for scientists to build upon previous research, but it might also make it easier accessible for malicious applications.
Much like open source, the patent system requires the inventor to put the data online for anyone to read. If one were to use this data, consent of the patent holder is required. The information is  in both systems freely accessible if one wishes to use it with bad intent. Another possibility is to keep it entirely secret, an example of this is the recipe of coca-cola.
The difference between chemistry, nanobiology and synthetic biology
When we look at the risk analysis the difference between chemistry, nanobiology and synthetic biology is that synthetic biology creates organism that replicate themselves which is harder to control if they would escape their predetermined environment.
The organisms are capable of replicating but will be made dependant of a certain compound that is not found outside their habitat. Thus if they escape this they will not be able to survive.
People with malicious beliefs
In the scientific world there are people with a different points of view: cloning Neandterthalers, or releasing this new life in the environment on purpose.
In an organization working on synthetic biology systems are present to guide the projects, keep an eye on the development. The institution also has to select the right people, educate them and give them a sense of social  responsibility.
A question from the public.
Governmental control
Few members of parliament are informed in the subject of synthetic biology. Is it sound to let them make decisions concerning this topic?
The members of parliament are a representation of the population in Belgium. If we look at the population more than 80% does not know what synthetic biology means. To resolve this problem the parliament invites scientists to inform them about the subject.

Really interested in the ability to detect V. cholerae in water, Christophe Campéri-Ginestet asked us to provide our bibliographic research and results at the end of the iGEM project. In addition, in exchange for our financial investment in our project, we have to fill out the JEI document which attests to our R&D activity for Sunwaterlife. He also put us in touch with Alama Keita, cholera leader of UNICEF in Niger. Finally, we talked to him about our product to contain our microorganisms. He helped us to design a cylindrical device whose sections would be these membranes to ensure GMMs containment.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," emission when excited at 505 nm is shown in red squares, when excited at 585 nm is shown in red triangles. The lower red course is caused by the emission of RFP when excited at 505 nm and the higher red course is caused by RFP when excited with 585 nm.
We repeated this experiment with two biological replicates to make sure there was no mistake in the cultivation, induction, harvesting or sample preparation process. We measured three technical replicates of the cell lysate of the two biological replicates at their emission maximum (Figure 4). To our surprise the signal of our CFP was still approximately six times higher than the higher RFP signal, when excited at 585 nm.
Figure 4: Maximal emission of CFP (cyan) and RFP (red) normalized to the amount of protein in the cell lysate. The samples were excited at the specific absorption maximum (CFP: 430, RFP: 505, 585).
To make sure there was no systematical mistake in our process we repeated the experiment, now with six biological replicates each, and only did an in vivo measurement, hoping to reduce potential sources of error in the harvesting or sample preparation process.
RFP and CFP Activity of the Systems in vivo
We cultivated the replicates of the transformants in a 12-well microtiter plate (Figure 5), with a volume of 1 mL LB-media in each well. The cells were cultivated for 24 hours at 30 °C with 400 rpm. From each well 200 µL of the culture were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and measured in the Tecan Reader. The six replicates of the CFP-YFP part showed a yellowish to greenish color and the RFP-GFP part a reddish color. This implicates that both transformants expressed the fusion protein properly. Before we did the measurements we determined the OD600 of each of the replicates. The values of all the twelve replicates were very close to each other (2.22 ± 0.06). Still, we normalized the emission signal to the corresponding OD600.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#Week1#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html,"50 with plasmid pSB1AT3
Lid was applied and electrodes positioned correctly (positive electrode at end furthest from wells and negative electrode positioned nearest wells). Power was switched on and voltage set to 150 volts. This process was allowed to run for 40 minutes.
Observations and Results
Once 40 minutes had expired, electrodes were switched off and lid removed. In the gel it could be seen that the DNA had streaked from the wells to the positive electrode. Three marker bands were visible, in order from nearest wells to nearest positive electrode - a cyan band, a dark blue band and a yellow band.
Gel removed from gel tray and taken to UV scanner. The following photograph was produced:
From this photograph it can be seen that apart from the E.coli cells located in colony 9, all the colonies that had survived the negative selection and displayed either a red or a green colour in solution contained plasmid DNA. This proves that most of the colonies had been transformed with a plasmid at least. The possibilities for colony 9 not revealing a plasmid DNA readout are as follows:
Colony 9 E.coli cells did not receive the plasmid DNA and acquired it's ampicillin resistance and colour properties elsewhere
The plasmid DNA (which appears as a transparent pellet in the previous experiment) was lost when the supernatant was tipped out.
Now that Team:Newcastle has proved that the competent E.coli cells have taken up the plasmids, the next step will be to prove that the 'E.coli' have taken up the specific BioBricks that we attempted to transform them with. This will involve restriction enzymes and another DNA gel electrophoresis.
Lab session: 10th July
Experiment Recap and Introduction
In the previous experiment, we had managed to prove that most of the cultures of E.coli which had passed negative selection did include plasmid DNA. The only E.coli cells not to contain any plasmid were the colony 9 cells but that could be down to several reasons; not all of them down to biology.
The next step is to show that these plasmids contain the BioBricks we intended to transform the bacteria with. This can be done by using restriction enzymes followed by DNA gel electrophoresis. Each standard BioBrick is flanked with restriction sites, which are the target of restriction enzymes. The aim is to cut the plasmid at these sites; one cut leading to an open, linear plasmid and two cuts leading to the production of the BioBr"

Overview On Silver Medal
The silver medal criterion demonstrates that “iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the lab bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities.” Basically we classify our human practice work into five aspects, that is, education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception and industry, which tallies well with the requirements.
Education
Ⅰ: Primary School
On Sep. 23rd, 2016, we went to Baitangkou primary school to make a presentation, aiming to let more pupils learn about the conception of synthetic biology and arouse the consciousness of fighting against the plastic pollution and protecting our earth. During the class, these primary students answered the questions we raised enthusiatically, which revealed their interests in synthesis biology. The meaningful class ended up with intense debate on how to deal with white pollution.
Ⅱ: Middle School
On Sep.18th, we departed for Dagang No.1 Middle School. We gave a lecture to students about iGEM and synthetic biology. They asked questions with great enthusiasm and felt curious about the knowledge out of books. Although the speech was over till 5:30 p.m., some students were still asking about synthetic biology.They thought that knowledge they studied at school was traditional and out of date, iGEM could make them get in touch with the cutting-edge knowledge of synthetic biology. We are very delighted to bring students some new knowledge and meanwhile we invited them to visit our laboratory and conduct some experiments.
Ⅲ: University
On September 27th, five members of our team went to Tianjin University of Science and Technology (TUST) and gave a speech on what is synthetic biology and how to set up a iGEM team. Almost all the seats were occupied by audience"

RULES OF TKES JEOPARDY
Each team should prepare a small white board and a white board pen
Each question every team will have 60 seconds to discuss and write down the answer on the white board
After 60 seconds, the teacher will ask all the teams to lifted their white board simultaneously
All the team should lift their white board as soon as the teacher asked them to do so.
The team with correct answer can get a point, in the end the team with the highest  points win.
Extra rules: To make the Jeopardy more exciting, you can combine Bingo with it. If the team answer the question right, they can mark the corresponding number of the question on their bingo. Thus, instead of the team with highest point win, the team with most lines win. Other than making it more fun, the final winner can’t be determined until the game finished since it add some luck in it, they will fight to the last second.
The Process
Before start playing Jeopardy, we make sure every children understand the rules, otherwise they may fight over the result. To make the kids feel more participation, we tried to create exciting atmosphere, so they can be very concentrate on the game. All of the questions are designed by the three main teachers who were in charge of the lessons in past four weeks, making sure they have all learnt before. Most of the questions are easy but they have to think thoughtfully to answer, however some are more difficult to discriminate their level. Surprisingly, they all doing very good.
For example, almost every team remember there are 23 pair of chromosomes in Human. I can still remember when we ask them this question before, they have no idea at all. We didn’t told them to memorize it and they have no idea we will play Jeopardy in the last week, they just learn naturally, I think this is the best evidence showing that learning should be in a more pleasure way not just cramming knowledges to the students.
Other than the questions with only one answer, we designed some questions that have numerous answers, such as please write down at least one solution that can respectively turn the purple cabbage colors into purple, red and blue, they can write down the solution we use in class and the one they learnt before. Sometimes they do give us some answer that is beyond our imagination and we are kind of not"

As shown in Fig.6, the gerAa group showed a higher proportion in germination and quicker rate in germination than the control group, which indicated the gerA play a good Responder in germination to L-analine in particular at low concentration. Therefore, gene gerAa is verified to be in good condition and can work efficiently as repected.

The results represent the average (SD) of three independent spore batches The drop rate of OD600 is proportional to the germination rate and the value of gerAa group is more than twice of control group with significant difference in statistics.
THE SHELTER: TupA & nhaC
In order to strengthen the alkali tolerance of B.subtilis, which is essential for our chassis to live in the concrete, we constructed two expression vectors containing parts C125-TupA( BBa_K2232011 ) and OF4-nhaC( BBa_K2232012 )(Fig.8), both of them play a role as Shelter protecting B.subtilis from Alkaline environment.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.
Results

Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C, washed twice with PBS and analyzed using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD bioscience, voltages for fluorescence channels were all at 750 V).

Figure 16: Quantification of biotin binding and surface-localization of A3C5 tags using FACS measurements.
For the channels FITC (biotin-atto488) and Dy634 (A3C5-Fab-Dy634, detected using a HeNe laser (633 nm) and a 660/20 band pass ﬁlter) the fluorescence signal was measured and mean values are given. The cells showed a homogeneious population in the FSC/SSC plot. The A3C5-Fab staining detected high signals up til a mean of over 4000 for the eMA-autotransporter dependent on the inducer concentration. For the same bacterial cells the binding of biotin-Atto488 could be confirmed as well. The single chain Avidin (scAvidin) cells showed absolutely no A3C5 signal but a low Biotin-Atto488 background signal that could be caused by biotin-importers that transport biotin into the cells or the slow diffusion into the periplasm of E. coli. In contrast the BAP-Receptor also shows a high surface presentation as seen in the A3C5 signal of nearly 4000 for the ""high"" induced sample. The elevated biotin-Atto488 is unexpected but could be explained by the weakened and partly permeable out membrane that does not stop the small-molecule dye from entering the periplasm.
Discussion: The autotransporter is working and can present small protein cargo on the bacterial surface
The performed experiment confirm the functionality of the device including the tetracyclin repressed promoter, the secretion into the bacterial periplasm as well as the presentation of the protein cargon on the bacterial outer membrane. In agreement with the expectation the 62 kDa big scAvidin with its extremely strong fold is too big in size for the autotransporter and can not be presented on the bacterial surface. In contrast the smaller BAP-NanoLuc (19 kDa for the NanoLuc) or the eMA"

Ethics in Synthetic Biology Reddit Forum
Along with the iGEM teams of Duke and Gaston Day school, we collaborated to create a subreddit to initiate discussion about synthetic biology. Our team, the Duke, and Gaston Day teams function as the moderators of the Reddit thread called r/iGEM_Exchange . The thread was allowed us to engage with the public in discussions about ethical implications of synthetic biology. Contributors had an opportunity to talk with others about pressing current issues like GMOs and CRISPR.
Tasty-Style Lab Videos
Taking inspiration from Buzzfeed’s Tasty videos, our team created a playlist of short lab technique videos with contribution of other iGEM teams: iGEM Peshawar 2017, UNBC iGEM, and TNCR Korea. While we created a video on serial dilutions, they created videos documenting the lab techniques of transformations, agarose gels, and ligation prep. Our intention in creating these videos was to teach viewers about common lab techniques in a simple and engaging way to aid them in their scientific endeavors! We wanted to give assistance to the group of scientists who may be new at lab techniques, and give the public an idea of what happens in the lab.

OWASA (Orange Water and Sewer Authority)
On June 12th, 2017, our team went to visit the Orange County Water and Sewer Association (OWASA) to ask some questions pertaining to our project background. We wanted to make sure we fully understood where our own water comes from and how it gets treated. We met with Ken Loflin, the Water Treatment Manager at OWASA, who was kind enough to give us a tour of the facility. He outlined where our water comes from, what “treatment” entails, and where it goes when we are done with it! After the tour, we asked Loflin a few questions about their facility, including the advantages and disadvantages of fluoride. Loflin expressed his excitement for our budding project, and thought that the creation of a bioreactor for the water treatment plant to bioremediate toxic levels of fluoride was a viable idea.
Here is a study guide that we made using the information gleaned from the OWASA trip. The"

To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was performed with T7 Promoter Forward and T7 Terminator Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly the band should be 360 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, then bands should be 837 bp long.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check for a second cloning control. We used BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes for cut-check.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After cloning GadE into pET45-b successfully, we did Western Blot experiment through  N-terminal located His Tag in proteins, so we managed to show the production of required proteins.
FUNCTIONAL ASSAY
To understand if the proteins we produced are functional, we designed and performed  a functional assay. We incubated these two types of bacteria in liquid culture for 13 hours at 37 C; pET45-GadE plasmid  containing BL21 bacteria and another BL21 bacteria which contains only pET45-b plasmid for negative control. At 13. our, we added 100 mM IPTG into these liquid cultures. By doing this, we removed the suppression on GadE protein expression. After adding IPTG, we incubated 3 hours more at 37 C.
We prepared LB mediums with different pH values to show produced GadE proteins’ functionality. These LB mediums’ pH values are respectively 7, 5, 3,5; 2,5 and 2. We added thebacteria whichis incubated for 16 hours into LB mediums at the rate of 1:9. This means, for each pH value we added 0.5 ml liquid culture into 4.5 ml LB medium. We also added 1.5 mM Glutamat in each mix and incubated the final mix at 37 C. We made spectrophotometric measurement in 600 nm periodically for the samples that we incubated. Thus we observed how long the bacteria survives in different pH values.
The measurement results are shown below.

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the popularization of science and technology law. It has established a new mechanism from the angle of legislation and social promotion. It has also formed an atmosphere of popularization.
In my opinion, there is still a long way to go for the promotion of science and technology law, in which scientific research and technology development institutions, institutions of higher learning should become the main force of propaganda, such as through popular science activities, popular science publicity , held lectures and other measures to further expand the public understanding of science and technology work and support.
3. What legal developments have been made so far? What are the existing deficiencies, and if there any suggestion for Legislation in China?
So far, in the Constitution, civil law, administrative law, criminal law and other traditional jurisdictions had establish a large number of technical and legal norms in the legislation, but also carried out special legislation in the field of science and technology. Its main legal system can be divided into several aspects, such as scientific and technological progress law, science and technology contract system, scientific and technological achievement right protection and so on.
With the development of the times, China's science and technology legislation also need to improve. Such as legal gaps, some legislation is too principled and lack of operability, and some regulations are ineffective, many laws and regulations are issued in different departments in the process of reform, and therefore there are contradictory and repeated too much. Therefore, China's scientific and technological legal system construction should also continue to strengthen and perfect.
My proposal for this is: Our country should further speed up the process of scientific and technological legislation, targeted and complementary legal gaps, and further refine the relevant implementation details, make scientific and technological legislation more systematic, standardized, and adapt to the times.
4. Whether the genetically modified bacteria can be applied to human disease treatment？If so, what are the legal considerations?
With the advances in modern DNA manipulation technology, humans can modify bacterial DNA, thus affecting human health. Many bacteria have been modified to synthesize molecules needed by humans, such as hormones, interferon, and antibodies. So we can say that after the transformation, bacteria can become a cure for disease medicine, to make greater contributions to human health.
The reasons why biotechnology companies have such high risk is that there are many biotechnology industry-related regulatory laws and regulations. Common legal risks in the biotechnology industry are the risk of intellectual property right and the risk of daily business activities.
Intellectual property rights are the basis for the survival and development of biotechnology enterprises. Relevant legal risks often occur in areas such as: early R & D contractual agreement, rights attribution, patent and trademark acquisition"

There are still bands at ~400, where they usually occur, but we seem to have some bands near 1000 bp
Our gels consistently end up with products that are not where our ladder predicted them to be. From this we can conclude that the amount of template added to the PCR is not causing the bands to appear smaller than they actually are
Gels screening test:

FOOD ADULTRATION TESTS
As the track we've chosen is 'Food', we saw it fitting to conduct simple experiments in the field. In this activity, students were taught techniques by which different adulterants in food can be identified.
Thus, the day ended on a high note with the students leaving with a fresh perspective on Synthetic biology and Science as a whole.
NATIONAL CONFERENCE iGEM STALL
This year, our college hosted a National conference on 'Food and Entrepreneurship' the 15th and 16th of September We saw this as an excellent window  to interact with some of the greatest scientific minds from across the country.  To make the best use of this opportunity we decided to put up a stall at the entrance.
We presented our project and its applications to the different students and research scholars from various backgrounds of science that were present at this conference. In addition, we handed out survey forms before and after our presentation to record their feedback and suggestions.
BIOFAIR
Our team decided that in addition to academicians, we also wanted the opinion of the general public, considering that they would be the population we'd finally impact. In collaboration with team SVCE CHENNAI, we conducted 'Biofair', an initiative to spread awareness about Synthetic Biology and our respective projects. It was held at the Tower Park, Chennai, India. We set up stalls and taught the general public what synthetic biology is and how it makes a difference in our lives, apart from explaining our current iGEM projects. We also carried out simple but fun science experiments to engage the kids in the park. We spoke about the need for our project, and its application in real life. In order to impart more clarity on the subject, we explained some similar previous year projects.
A majority of our audience associated GMOs with wild mutations and a Frankenstein-like end product. After a deeper explanation into the workings of synthetic biology, we were able to change their mindset towards the subject. More queries about the feasibility of our project were addressed and explained.
SURVEY
We at REC – CHENNAI wanted to make sure that synthetic biology and our project reached the masses.  So we set on a journey collecting opinions after opinions right from 16 year olds to 60 year olds. This survey was a result of this journey and we have come to understand that the public is more educated about synthetic biology than we expected.
We gave out survey forms before and after explaining"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," nanodrop. Using the most concentrated cultures, we sent out our samples for sanger sequencing. We also carried out another Colony PCR of our old gibson in order to isolate our desired plasmid. It failed.
Once the full length genes came, we tried amplifying the genes using the forward and the reverse primers from the OE PCR reactions. We used thermocycler settings that had worked for past reactions but still saw multiple bands for some of the genes, suggesting that the primers had non-specific annealing at those annealing temperatures. We started making touch-down thermocycler settings for each gene to determine what annealing temperature would yield the least amount of non-specific bands.
We made new yeast inoculations and attempted YMC for the first time as a test for the protocol. Sadly, we forgot to include the plasmid backbone in the reaction so it failed. We performed YMC again, being sure to include all components, and allowed the transformed yeast to grow on selective (leucine-deficient) plates for several days.
After outgrowth in liquid selective media, our cultures repeatedly failed to show colonies when plated on selective media. In order to address this, we redid our protocol for making chemicompetent Y. lipolytica cells after performing a final plating with the last of our transformant cell stock. We also performed transformations to reamplify our D17 plasmid in anticipation of beginning Gibson Assembly trials.
For our second yeast transformation attempt, we accidentally used less plasmid DNA; we obtained no growth. For our third attempt, we made sure to use the sufficient amount of plasmid DNA and to eliminate the outgrowth step, which was not necessary for leucine-marker selection. This yielded a successful transformation.

As the start of the school year grew closer, we saw most of our teammates busy in lab trying to finish their lab group’s tasks before the chaos of the school year starts. For those not in lab, they were busy working on our iGEM wiki. Now that progress is being made on experiments, many teammates spent the week updating their online lab notebook to later add to the wiki.
Continuing last weeks trial, we carried out several colony PCRs throughout the week in order to isolate our desired plasmid. All of our attempts failed. In response to this we decided it would be best to regrow our colonies by making streak and index plates from the leftover colonies on our gibson p"

Unluckily, we find that there is nothing in the medium of P0440 and R0062, but the transformation of K145270 and E0420 proves to be a success. We have a discussion about the protocol of transformation. After 10 minutes, we doubt that the failure of the transformation results in the incorrect operating of DH5. Then we carefully do the transformation of P0440 and R0062.
21st, Jul
The effort we took yesterday is not in vain. We successfully complete the transformation of P0440 and R0062. Then we begin to pick the right colonies from the medium. After that, we put all the tubes into the shaker and start to shake the bacteria.
22nd, Jul
It is an awful day today, because we have to do the plasmid extraction of K145270, R0062, P0440 and E0420. Without the help of Doctor Chen, the steps of plasmid extraction are too hard for us to complete them without any mistakes. We waste many centrifuge tubes and pipet tips. However, we finally made it.
24th, Jul
After our weekends, we come back to our lab. The task today is to finish the transformation of R0040, K081016.
25th, Jul
Today, we complete the transformation of I0500, K081009, E0430.
27th, Jul
We are puzzled to find that the transformation of I0500 fails. We try to find the reason. After about 15 minutes, we don¡¯t find any mistakes in our procedure. As a result, we contact Doctor Chen. He promises us that he will come tomorrow.
28th, Jul
Today, we have a discussion about the failure of the transformation. Doctor Chen supposes that there is some problem with the Kan medium. So he writes down the medium formula and asks us to make up some Kan mediums. With his help, we learn the method to use the electronic balance. Finally we use our new Kan mediums to do the transformation of I0500.
29th, Jul
We are very disappointed when we take out our mediums. The transformation fails again. Then we decide to find some information from the Internet. Maybe other IGEM teams face the same problem.

THE IOD BAND IDEA is really a mix of two amazing concepts used by nature to engineer new cells: sexual conjugation and pheromone based signalling. Starting from the very first iGEM discussions in winter, the team has been fascinated by these systems and from the get-go wanted to use them to do amazing engineering. It so happened that during some unofficial yet regular beer-meetings with students and researchers from the Biomedical centre the problem of CTC diagnosis was raised. It did not take long before input-output blocks from engineering courses became IODs that work together to solve complex problems, such as diagnosis of CTCs.
THE TEAM includes a mix of complementary expertise. In the end the work was naturally split between the members. It goes without saying that these wiki pages are primarily the work of all team members with constant language corrections and comments on content clarity coming from the advisors and instructors. Below each member of the larger team is linked to their identifying tasks.
Jan Bejvl is a student at the Faculty of Medicine. He brought to the group a wealth of information regarding medical practice. In the lab he started off with the Interlab study and then played an integral role in Module 2 recloning plasmids and setting up the final assays.
Martin Cienciala is a bachelor student at the Charles University in Prague in the Molecular Biology program. He co-developed the idea behind location tags in Module 3 and designed as well as performed all the microfluidic experiments. Martin led the assembly, induction, and experimental validation of surface receptor antibodies.
Hynek Kasl was responsible for Module 1. He assembled the MATa and MATx synthetic loci, the reporter plasmids and the corresponding biobricks. Throughout the project he became sort of the team modeling and data guru providing supportive models for the CeCe simulator hydrodynamics and diffusion extensions. In Human Practices, Hynek presented the early IOD band concept to young engineering students.
Veronika Kolejáková studies Molecular Biology at the Charles University in Prague. She co-developed the idea behind location tags in Module 3 and assisted with our Human Practices progress. Veronika performed experiments to ensure yeast surface antibody production and assisted with experiments in other Modules.
Jiří Louda is a student at the department of Cybernetics. Early on he helped with the Interlab study. Subsequently he played a supportive roles in different modules as needed.

We have succesfully constructed the modeling of project of USTC 2009 iGEM team. Due to various reasons, the result will be shown in our final release of our software as a demo. This work could perfectly illustrate the features of our software. It include many novel biological process, such as  quorem sensing, multi-compartment, and cell killing to death. There are more than 100 reactions in total, which is almost impossible to model manually, which, in turns, shows great power of our software.
To have a first look, we provide a screenshot of the results about single compartment which contains plasmid (shown as below)

The C Project
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Reporter#PrussianBlueFerritin_-_-_TEXT.html," we constructed ( BBa_K1189018, BBa_K1189021 ) into Prussian blue ferritin the next step was to evaluate how the design of our parts could potentially affect the reporter activity of our Prussian blue ferritin. Based on the spatial modelling performed by our team it was suggested that assembly of the ferritin nanoparticle with TALE proteins directly fused was highly unlikely. This is because the TALE proteins are significantly larger than the ferritin subunits. Their size would likely result in steric hindrance and prevent the assembly of the full ferritin protein. In order to test the predictions put forward by our modelling we ensured that our protein samples were balanced in order to have the same number ferritin cores in each sample. The catalytic activity of these proteins was then compared. From the data gathered we saw that the Prussian blue ferritin with fused coils (even if TALES are additionally bound to the ferritin via coils) was more effective as a reporter than having the TALE proteins directly fused to the ferritin nanoparticle (Figure 19). The results from this experiment suggest that the predictions made by our model were correct. Using coils however alleviates this issue as these coils are small and would not interfere in the ferritin self-assembly but can be used to attach our TALES to create the FerriTALE.
Figure 19. Samples of our parts that were converted to Prussian Blue ferritin were mole balanced in order to ensure that the same number of effective ferritin cores are present in every sample. Additionally the ferritin-coil fusion was incubated with the TALE-coil fusion part in order to allow their binding for a separate trial. Negative controls include unconverted recombinant ferritin, bovine serum albumin and a substrate only control. Samples were incubated with a TMB substrate solution for 10 minutes at a pH of 5.6. Absorbance readings were taken at the 10 minute time-point at a wavelength of 650 nm. An ANOVA (analysis of variants) was performed upon the values to determine that there was statistical difference in the data gathered (based off of three replicates). A t-test was then performed which determined that the * columns are significantly different from the ** column (p=0.0012). Neither * column is significantly different from each other (p=0.67).
Future Directions
This summer we were able to successfully characterize Prussian blue ferritin as a reporter for our system as well as demonstrate that we could use our constructed parts to produce our own functional Prussian blue ferritin. This characterization included"

High school iGEM teams have relatively fewer resources available to them compared to the graduate teams. Therefore GreatBay_China and SFLS_Shenzhen hosted the Shenzhen High School Meetup together for sharing our resources conveniently with others Shenzhen high school teams as well as finding in what ways could we collaborate. Teams presented their projects, and we invited our advisor Yiming Dong to give feedbacks.

EurAsian Meetup
Where: Shenzhen
When: 24 July ~ 26 July
Hosted by: TU-Delft, BGIC-Global
From Jun/24 to Jun/26, we participated in the EurAsian Meetup organized by the teams TUDelft and BGI-College. We spared no efforts to present in an interesting and educating way and engage other teams. During the meetup, we received suggestions about the project (including how to convert nepetalactol to nepetalactone, what variables should be concerned in the co-culture system, etc.), presentation, poster and even mathematical modeling from various teams like TUDelft, EPFL, XJTLU China and SCUT China.
Apart from obtaining suggestions, we also spread out idea effectively during the meetup by presenting as well as communicating with other teams. Our presentation in the meetup received the award as one of the two ‘Best Presentation’ teams among all. During the discussion, because of our teammate Rocky’s special talk on his understanding of biosafety, he was interviewed by TUDelft as a part of their human practice.
We also learned the essence of biosafety during the meetup, which helped us a lot when we were conducting our human practice after the event. We discovered that the key idea of ensuring biosafety in our project is through ‘Value Sensitive Design’, which is to contemplate whether our product will violate the rules in biosafety or challenge bioethics and use these concerns to improve our product to make it safer. We almost applied the strategy of ‘Value Sensitive Design’ extensively throughout our human practice.

Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". As the Delft documentation did not specify whether the gene was codon optimal, codon optomisation was undertaken to potentially improve expression levels. The linear Magainin 1 construct, however, was not codon optimised in the SUMO region in order to provide a control condition.
To summarise, the protein expression devices used in our project to the following form:
The protein coding region consisted of a 6x-HIS tag followed by the SUMO protein and the relevant star or linear peptide.
 
Plasmid preparation: Cloning and acquisition of the genetic constructs
Magainin 1 Star Peptide
This construct was synthesised in the standard shipping plasmid from Life Technologies- plasmid pMK. We had originally planned to express our protein to the periplasm of E. coli, and therefore had included in the synthesis a periplasmic export tag, the TorTss signal sequence (Steiner et al., 2006).
Cytoplasmic and periplasmic expression may both allow for disulfide bond formation in the cell. We decided, however, to focus on cytoplasmic expression. There are distinct advantages to cytoplasmic expression (e.g. the absence of several periplasmic proteases and potentially higher expression levels (Baneyx, 1999)).
Another reason the cytoplasm was chosen was to allow us to test the effects of an oxidising versus reducing intracellular environment on disulfide bond formation. We planned to express the construct in both SHuffle T7 cells (oxidising cytoplasm) and BL21(DE3) (reducing cytoplasm) to probe whether there was a difference in disulfide bond formation. Therefore, we needed to remove the periplasmic export tag from the gene.
To do this, we use the following cloning strategy (noting that the top row represents the gene initially synthesised in plasmid pMK):
The gene was inserted into plasmid pSB1C3 containing the T7 promoter and ribosome binding site, BBa_K525998. It was inserted after the promoter and before the BioBrick suffix. This was accomplished by digesting the destination vector with SpeI and PstI. At the same time, PCR was used to amplify the segment of the gene containing the SUMO fusion and the Magainin 1 Star peptide, adding XbaI and keeping the PstI site existing in the gene.
Digestion of the PCR product then allowed for ligation of the insert and destination vector using the Pst"

 Parts Improved
We improved all of the basic parts we used by putting them into the composite parts that we used. The T7 promoter that we had at the beginning of each construct and our use of the T7 system in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Is an improvement to each of the basic parts. This system allows us to control when the gene is being expressed. This is a great advantage to us as large batch culture overexpression is very stressful on the cells. If we did not use an inducible promoter on our genes we would see significantly less pigment than our literature would lead us to expect. This is due to the fact that the genes we are using have been optimized to produce the maximum amount of pigment possible, and this process on a single young cell would be very stressful and significantly increase the doubling time of the cells. We have induced the cells after they have replicated many times and matured, this allows us to have more cells with the construct that can produce more pigment faster.
The most significant improvements of previously made parts worth discussing is the improvement to the melA and crtY-crtZ (zeaxanthin) coding parts.
The melA gene is coding sequence of tyrosinase from Rhizobium etli. This tyrosinase converts tyrosine to dopaquinone. Dopaquinone is intermediate product of melanin biosynthesis pathway that will polymerizes in an enzyme-independent reaction to form melanin. Melanin production in E. coli requires supplemental tyrosine and CuSO4. The part for the melA CDS was originally made by Kazuaki Amikura of the iGEM09_Tokyo_Tech group (2009-10-14, BBa_K193600 ). Previously, it had been used in an expression construct using the constitutive P(lac)IQ promoter ( BBa_I14032 ) and B0040 RBS (composite part: BBa_K193602 ). We have developed a different expression construct specifically for use in E. coli BL21(DE3) which takes advantage of the T7 RNA Polymerase expression construct in"

Main Points
Too many results/ modelling pages. Dineka royah and i propose getting rid of the modelling and results links from each module. Instead just have links from the main page to the wet and dry labs. Perhaps under 'Data' tab or something, could have a very brief overview of each? Also, if we have these tabs under each module, it will draw attention to the lack of results should we not have them by wiki freeze.
Links to different parts of the wiki should perhaps not be put as blue hyperlinks in brackets. not very obvious. might be good to have wikipedia links for words that non-biologists like me might not understand! we are simple folk after all.
REFERENCES, sooooo important. Look on OWW for the ones we have been using, otherwise search.
Layout Comments

Homepage : Completed  (Needs Checking)
Project Overview : Complete (Needs Checking)
Major Results: These should be stuck up as they come in. Also might be good to just put in some text describing our major experiments should we not get results in time. Certainly wouldn’t be good if come wiki freeze time we have a blank page for major results, sortof highlights the fact that nothing has worked.
Submitted Parts: List of biobricks looks good. My bad on putting them all as coding regions, some need to be changed to composite parts that we have had ordered.
Achievements: No text here, needs to be sorted out. What do we expect to put up? Perhaps the list of gold medal criteria with tick boxes for example.
Manufacturing Considerations: Needs a lot more writing. Also formatting, looks good, but perhaps put some of the images on the right. Also caitlins point about the quality control image being a little un-pc for some of the judges on the more conservative side.

To work further on the color pathway, first of all the genes still missing must be obtained by either DNA synthesis or by PCR on S. cerevisiae or other suitable organisms. All enzymes should preferably be tested for individual activity, which has not yet been done on the E. coli genes we provided to the registry. If enzyme activity has been confirmed, this pathway can be implemented as described by Martin et al. [4] .
If both systems are functional, they can be easily coupled because of the biobrick standardisation. This would deliver the biothermometer as we designed it.

Week 11: 8/13-8/19
My last and final week I decided to experiment with a few other constitutive promoters found in the BBa_J23100 family. The promoters were ligated with the yellow and green fluorescent proteins. The promoters found in J23100 and J23101 seemed to glow the brightest as opposed to the promoter found in J23109. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to collect characterization data to be able to submit the constructs to the parts registry.
This week we also had our final meeting, where we distributed tasks for each team member, to put the final touches to our project. There were several tasks, so there was still a lot of work ahead to do.

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," expression of genes regulated by the OmpR-regulated promoter is initiated. Excitation of PCB by red light results in a situation where the transcription factor OmpR is not regulated. The absence of phosphorylated OmpR leads to no activation of the OmpR-regulated promoter, thereby preventing gene expression.
Figure 1. Left: Red light activates PCB, which in turn inactivates the photoreceptor complex Cph8, preventing gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter. Right: In absence of light, PCB is inactive, which enables the Cph8 to phosphorylate the transcription factor OmpR. This promotes gene expression from the OmpR-regulated promoter.
The photocontrol device can be used to regulate a toxin-antitoxin system, enabling the implementation of a light-dependent dormancy system. A toxin-antitoxin system is composed of two gene products, a cytotoxin and an antitoxin, the latter which neutralises the the toxic effect caused by the toxin.  In E. coli K-12 the cytotoxin RelE and antitoxin RelB comprise such a system Gotfredsen M, Gerdes K. The Escherichia coli relBE genes belong to a new toxin-antitoxin gene family. Molecular microbiology. 1998;29(4):1065-76. . Expression of the cytotoxin RelE inhibits translation in the cells, due to its ability to cleave mRNA found in the A-site of the ribosome. RelB neutralises the toxic effect of RelE through interaction between the two proteins. Whether the cell lies dormant in response to expression of RelE depends on the ratio of antitoxin RelB and RelE present in the cell. Several studies have shown that RelB and RelE form a complex with RelB:RelE stoichiometry of 2:1 Overgaard M, Borch J, Gerdes K. RelB and RelE of Escherichia coli form a tight complex that represses transcription via the ribbon-helix-helix motif in RelB. Journal of molecular biology. 2009;394(2):183-96. Overgaard M, Borch J, Jorgensen MG, Gerdes K. Messenger RNA interferase RelE controls relBE transcription by conditional cooperativity. Molecular microbiology. 2008;69(4):841-57. .

Next we tested some filters from the light engineering of the women cultural center Bielefeld e.V. (""Frauenkulturzentrum Bielefeld e.V.""). We tested these filters in front of either the camera or the flashlight by taking picture of purified GFP, sfGFP lysate and lysate without sfGFP (for generating the lysates see here ). Different hues and different levels of brightness can be identified in the picture below. With this first impression, we decided to test different filters. The goal was to find one filter or filtercombination which was perfectly suited for sfGFP imaging, cutting out as much of the background signal as possible.
Emission and extinction spectra of sfGFP. The characteristic curve from the samsung galaxy S5 mini flash is also shown. The overlap of the different spectra shows that it is possible to excite sfGFP with a smartphone flash.
First filter test. Purified GFP, sfGFP lysate and lysate non-induced sfGFP culture were photographed through light filters to assess the feasibility of fluorescence detection using a smartphone.
Therefore we bought a lee color filter catalog, so we can test various filter combinations in the next step. A preselection of the filters was possible, because we had access to the light transmitting spectra of almost every filter. Apart we designed a handcraft black carton for taking photos under defined conditions and a constant dark background.
Lee color filter catalog
The black box: tinkered to take photos under same conditions
The filter combinations
The essential requirements for taking comparable photos are achieved. Now we had to find the ideal filter combination. So we tested every combination of 5 filters for emission with 12 filters for extinction. A lot of pictures had much background or no fluorescence was seen. All together we tested 60 combinations to find the optimal filter combination for sfGFP imaging via smartphone with less background as possible.  Afterwards we had to analyze the pictures. Hence we analyzed the pictures with the imaging procesing software Fiji. We measured all fluorescence of every reaction tube in every picture we took. After analyzing the photos with  the image processing software Fiji, the optimal filter combination was found Tokyo blue (071) in front of the flash and twickenham green (736) in front of the camera provided the best result for sfGFP.

KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,".We started with a global outline for our presentation and poster at the Jamboree in Amsterdam. Tom also had a meeting with Hilde Devoghel, and we are invited to develop a small stand for the Children's University the 15th of October and give a workshop on the week of science and day of sciende next year. We'll for sure look into the feasibility of it.
Week 11
The end is getting closer and we still have quite some work to do. Beginning this week Tom found another sponsor: Technopolis. It is an edutaining institution, we are going to give two more workshops after Amsterdam. Besides re-reading everything on our wiki, we are also started with preparing the presentation for Amsterdam and the poster. As you can see, there is still a lot of work to do!
Week 12
Last week of iGEM... We continued to work on the presentation for Amsterdam. The whole team is working really hard to get everything ready before the wiki freeze.
After European Jamboree
Now the wiki's unfrozen we continued our project. We wrote a text on possible applications for E.D.Frosti and wrote a reflection on the debate organized by the Rathenau Institue during the European Jamboree in Amsterdam. Due to all the media attention, we also drew the attention of the general public: Two highschools wanted to work together with our team: One scientific class wanted to thoroughly discuss our E.D. Frosti project during their science courses and they wanted to put in in their scienceblog, which they created to explain cool scientific facts to the general public. An economy class is creating a fictional marketing model in which a company produces E.D. Frosti. The 18th of October, we went to the European Commission to interview Dr. Lino Paula about law and patents on synthetic biology. We extended our safety text: we thought about how to prevent horizontal gene transfer and additional safety mechanisms. On Friday the 28th of October, we have an appointment with the Johan Bollue who is the sports league director of the Royal Belgian Ice Hockey Federation and LTP instructor of the International Ice Hockey Federation. In this meeting we discuss the potential applications of E.D. Frosti and how it could save energy in cooling systems in ice rinks.

Among those three pPsiA-PsiR A.t ( BBa_K2448025 ) demonstrates the best linearity and fold change simultaneously making it the best candidate for production/enzyme screening.
Influence of Fructose
Testing our psicose biosensor under real application conditions is vital. We aim to measure the concentration of psicose in high fructose level media to observe the conversion of fructose into its epimer, D-Psicose by the D-Psicose 3-epimerase from C. cellulolyticum. But to achieve this, our biosensor pPsiA-PsiR A.t ( BBa_K2448025 ), and especially our transcription factor, has to be highly specific to psicose, in order to produce mCherry in proportion only to the concentration of D-Psicose.
We can see on the graph presented in Figure 11 that fluorescence intensity and fructose concentration are not correlated since increasing concentration of fructose doesn’t influence the fluorescence. According to figure 11, fructose doesn’t influence the biosensor behavior since mCherry production isn’t a function of fructose concentration in the media. This finding implies that our transcription factor doesn’t bind to fructose and that our biosensor can be used in high fructose level media to measure psicose concentration. Therefore, the pPsiA-PsiR A.t biosensor is suitable for assessing the activity of D-Psicose-3-Epimerase converting fructose into psicose.
Figure 11. In vivo characterization of the Psicose Biosensor pPsiA-PsiR from Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( BBa_K2448025 ) in E. coli DH5α. The graph shows the mCherry measured florescence over fructose concentration in the media. Each data point is the mean of two technical duplicates and of three biological triplicates, and error bars represent standard deviations.
Improvement Prospects
In order to finely characterize the pPsiA-PsiR A.t biosensor ( BBa_K2448025 ), we assessed the effect of IPTG on the fluorescence for a fixed concentration in psicose (Figure 12). The outcome is that IPTG, regardless of its concentration, doesn’t significantly influence the production of mCherry. It means that the PsiR amount in the cell is constant. Our hypothesis is that"

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," sigma-factor, which binds to and then activates the promoter. However, anti-sigma factors also bind to sigma factors, which competitively inhibit sigma factors from functioning.
Detailed Info
The sigma factors are promoter recognition subunits of RNA polymerase. A sigma factor is associated with a part of promoters. A sigma factor recruits RNA polymerase to its corresponding promoter and initiates transcription. Sigma factors have great variety. Some of sigma factor-promoter pairs have one-to-one correspondence. Thus, if only sigma factors which have one-to-one correspondence are used, a transcription activating system in which a sigma factor activates the transcription only from corresponding promoter can be made.
Anti-sigma factors are proteins which are related to transcriptional control mechanism by sigma factors. An anti-sigma factor inhibits the binding between RNA polymerase and sigma factor. Consequently, anti-sigma factors repress the transcription from the promoters which sigma factors initiate. In the same way as sigma factors, anti-sigma factors have great variety and some anti-sigma factors prevent only a specific sigma factors from transcriptional control. Therefore a transcription control system (i.e. not only activating but also repressing) can be constructed by using specific sigma factors and anti-sigma factors which have one-to-one correspondence.[2](words underlined were grammatically modified from the original)
Multiple combinations of sigma factors, sigma promoters, and anti-sigma factors exist. Every factor we used functions exclusively within its combination and does not bind with factors of other combinations. In other words, they do not crosstalk. To make this easier to understand, factors and promoters of the same combination are presented with the same color.
Pnrd
Pnrd, another kind of a promoter, works only during cell division.

We also installed a promoter called PBAD, which works only under the existence of arabinose, drawn as pentagon in the chart.
We used part BBa_K2070018 and BBa_K2070016 as toehold switch, K2070001 , K2070009 , BBa_K1461005 as sigma factors, K2070002 , K2070010 , BBa_K1461224 as anti-sigma factors, K2070000 , K2070008 , BBa_K1461002 as sigma promoters, BBa_K847211 as Pnrd, and BBa_I0500 as PBAD.
Now we’ve seen the 4 components and they will help us understand what our team wants to make. Let’s go to the journey to the gene constructions and systems.

Introduction
Before applying a new technology in society, it is vital that research has been done into the reaction of the public. For this it is important to look at politics, the private sector, and the civil society, including family and the private sphere. Here these different groups will be called by the name stakeholder. A stakeholder is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “A person, company, etc., with a concern or (esp. financial) interest in ensuring the success of an organization, business, system, etc.” [1]  In the case of blue bio energy, examples of stakeholders would be energy companies, citizens or wildlife organizations. In the acceptance of new technologies by stakeholders, research shows that next to reasoning, emotions play an important role. Furthermore, people seem to be more accepting towards new technologies if they directly benefit from them. [2], [3]  Finding out what people find not only the most acceptable scenario, but also the most desirable one, leads us to the following research question: Which future scenarios are desirable when it comes to the application of a blue bio energy setup and/or GMOs in everyday life? Not only would it be good to find out which of the three scenarios was preferred most among our public, also the (subconscious) motivation was thought to be significant. To register what underlying principles motivates stakeholders when forming an opinion on a new technology, it was decided to formulate several future scenarios, each involving blue bio energy and genetic modification. The categories in which changes are addressed are science, technology and sustainable development, social change, economics and energy markets. The scenarios are aimed at helping stakeholders determine the extent to which they would agree with the application of blue bio energy and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in society. The scenarios are assessed using five ethical principles (link), namely human rights, environmental sustainability, climate change, equitable distribution and ethical duty. These principles help determine one’s ethical priorities. Collecting data from different stakeholders allows the mapping of interests and priorities of different groups in society. This will allow for"

Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.

EXPECTED RESULTS
In our design, Mating Switcher is a means of gene regulation. We can transform from one functional system to another system through this switch conveniently. To show the function of Mating Switcher more intuitively, we construct this RFP system to be a characterization.
First, we can successfully construct the corresponding expression vector.
Second, we expect to observe the expression of yEmRFP before the switch is on. We expect red fluorescent protein to be observed under a fluorescence microscope, and it is desirable that the fluorescence spectrophotometer can measure a high and stable fluorescence value.

Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," mutation that would render foreign insertions inactive would increase the growth capacity of the sub-population with such mutations, allowing them to quickly overtake the entire population. With mutations thus occurring [to do: insert frequency], losing an engineered function can be matter of time. Indeed, consider an engineered strain that is cultivated at a large scale biorefinery to produce iso-butanol and finding out mid-way through a commercial run that productivity suddenly declines. This might be the result of one or few nucleotide mutations or the loss of a varyingly sized gene fragment, both leading to either a loss of expression or functionality of the RNA or protein it codes for. Although this phenomenon is understood in relatively high detail in, say, E. coli, where known genes involved in the repair and/or mutation of DNA can be exploited to minimize this risk, this is not the case in cyanobacteria.
In fact, research into genetic instability in cyanobacteria is, despite the massive increase in attempts to use phototrophs for biotech purposes, surprisingly sparse -- so much so that Patrik Jones from Imperial College refers to it as an elephant in the room: “important, obvious, yet largely ignored”. Of course, such fate is often reserved for negative results; few people want to spend their time and energy following up on dead ends, which are unlikely to lead to a publications. Although this lack of information makes it hard to draw conclusions on the extent to which genetic instability is a problem in developing photosynthesis-based biorefineries, the issue is certainly pervasive enough to warrant full acknowledgement and attention when it comes to designing cyanobacterial strains for real-world applications.
The project
With our project, we aim to tackle the productivity and instability issues by harnessing the power of microbial consortia.  Of course, symbiosis between phototrophs and other organisms are well documented in the natural world, e.g. bacterial mats, and in evolutionary history, e.g. the origins of the chloroplast. In fact, microbes rarely live in isolation outside the lab - they are constantly interacting with other species. We believe these collaborative, multi-species systems can be leveraged to create products in a way that comes closer to true sustainability (although the scrutinization of the belief is of course the aim of these scenario’s). The idea is simple: phototrophs, in our case the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, normally use CO2, sunlight and water to create the biomass they need for growth. Through genetic engineering, some of this flux can be redirected to create desirable products. Although"

Introduction
2'-Deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate (dCTP) - one of the four building blocks of DNA - is as a versatile scaffold for a specific enzyme substrate immobilization. Cytosine 4th amine (-NH2) and deoxyribose 3’ hydroxy (-OH) chemical groups can be easily manipulated to add modifications of interest.
Such substrate modified dCTP molecules (sub-dCTP) establish two separate states of cytidine nucleotides: Substrate dCTP and catalytically converted Product dCTP.
The switching of substrate dCTP to product dCTP is achieved when an active enzyme catalyzes the removal of the unique modification. Take this into consideration, there could be 3 ways such stable equilibrium of different cytidines could be utilized for activity recording:
1. Substrate nucleotides can be too bulky and thus are structurally hindered to be incorporated by phi29, meaning only catalytically converted product nucleotides are incorporated.
2. Substrate nucleotides can be incorporated into the DNA sequence, however modification did on substrate as it its converted to product restricts the incorporation of product nucleotides
3. Both, substrate and product nucleotides are accessible to phi29 DNA polymerase and can be incorporated into the DNA sequence.
This creates a number of new variable – substrate deoxycytidine concentration and product deoxycytidine concentration – which are proportional to the activity of the enzyme that catalyzed the reaction. These variable can be imbedded in to the very sequence of DNA as incorporated nucleotides and read during next generation sequencing as a ratio to a reference nucleotide. The ratio of incorporated reference and"
