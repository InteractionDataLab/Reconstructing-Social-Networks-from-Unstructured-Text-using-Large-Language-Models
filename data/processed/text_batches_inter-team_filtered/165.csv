1. PgltAB can be down regulated by glutamate
PgltAB-GFP and P43-GFP were transformed into both B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam and B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 Δbam -icd strain (with stronger promoter before icd gene), which were designated as LL3-PgltAB-GFP and LL3-icd-PgltAB-GFP respectively. The two mutants were cultured in M9 culture medium for 24 hours. If needed the medium was supplemented with antibiotics or glutamate at the following concentrations: 5 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.5 g/L or 5.0 g/L glutamate. During the fermentation, 1.5mL bacteria culture was taken out every 3 hours, of which 600µL was for GFP FI measurement (395nm\509nm) by microplate reader, and 900µL for OD600 measurement.
With the extracellular glutamate concentration increasing, the FI of GFP was decreasing, which means higher glutamate concentration can indeed repress the promoter PgltAB's effect. The FI first rose and then fell, which may due to the extra glutamate adding that can promote cell growth. (Fig. 1.)

UCL,2013,Team:UCLA#Project#ProjectDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," the normal DGR system. An enormous library of unique variants can increase the chances of identifying a protein-binding species in a screen. Having a large copy number of each variant is also important, as this number invariably decreases during purification steps – too few, and an actual protein-binding variant might be lost even before the final screening step!
There are few cost-efficient methods of calculating the number of copies per mtd variant within a given sample. However, the maximum average copy number per variant within a given sample can be calculated assuming that every possible variant is present at least once before copies of the variants are formed. This maximum is only useful as a loose reference since it is unrealistic to assume that the obtained sample contains at least one of every possible variant. Our protocol involves two separate PCR setups, the second of which uses only a subset of the variants generated from the first. This step limits the sequence variation at the first mutagenic island in the variants present in the final assembled library.
Displaying Diversity
At this time of writing, we have been unable to complete mRNA display and screening of the Mtd library. However, we will discuss the steps we have taken and are still optimizing, as well as future directions. We encourage you to stay tuned for the final results which will be posted here!
mRNA display links each protein variant within our library to its corresponding coding sequence. This allows for identification of successful protein-binding variants following screening. The technique has been widely used throughout the literature for similar screening and protein selection applications. Our mRNA display protocol can be completed in two days once optimized, and like other published protocols, is done entirely in vitro.
As previously mentioned, it is important to monitor and take steps to reduce the loss of sample diversity through the purification steps. A measure of the sample’s OD can be taken after purification steps to track any losses. Following purification of the in vitro transcription products, the sample should be ligated to the puromycin-linker. Maintaining near-equimolar amounts of RNA, splint (the oligonucleotide which connects the RNA to the puromycin-linker), and puromycin-linker has given us optimal results. RNA tertiary structures can reduce efficiency in these processes and should be avoided. Heating samples at 65 degrees Celsius for a few minutes can help prevent this from occurring. Prior to ligation, it is important to heat the RNA sample in the absence of DNA ligation buffer or ligase since these reagents often include magnesium ions, which may facilitate formation of tertiary structures. Following ligation, RNA samples should be run on a gel by electrophoresis to separate the fully"

Release rates (Fick’s Law of Diffusion)
Increase volume of FD-4 injected - faster the FD-4 release rate from skin
Release rate increases when FD-4 given in multiple injections
Large molecule = lower release rate from skin
Silicon - useful material?
Questions:
So is the drug being released secreted out of the skin after secretion?

Pressure gradient - greater pressure causes drug to flow through
Diffusion gradient
Questions:
Based on methods of delivery - silicon; have to test and make sure peptide/fluid/bacteria doesn’t react with silicon
Simulate a large scale prototype of design to test if we can use pressure/diffusion to get the peptide to flow through
Problem:
For microneedles that use multiple needles (our suggested form):
1 microneedle leaks
Pressure can’t be equally applied to all needles
Fluid won’t flow through all microneedles equally
The small size of microneedles - drugs given on/within microneedles limited to microgram dose
Applications of microneedles
Biotherapeutics, drugs (peptides, proteins, DNA,RNA)
Hollow microneedles - used for insulin delivery in both rats and humans
Diffusion and active infusion worked, decreased blood-glucose levels after injection
Humans found it to be:
Decreased pain
More preferred (compared to normal needles)
Increased insulin pharmacokinetics almost 2-fold - may cause better control over post plasma glucose levels
Had faster insulin absorption and enabled more rapid onset and offset metabolic effect on blood glucose levels than injection

Proposed design - measurements for diameter length of needle, etc.
pump/syringe for injection
Need to test diffusion; if diffusion doesn’t work, use hand to press
Overdose problem
Reservoir patches give tighter control of delivery rates but can have an initial burst of drug release. If the membrane is damaged, there is also a risk of sudden release of drug into the skin and overdose as potentially a larger area of skin is exposed for drug absorption.
In a matrix patch, the active ingredient is distributed evenly throughout the patch. One-half of a patch will have half the original surface area and deliver half the original dose per hour. The matrix patch"

The x-axis shows magnesium glutamate concentration, the y-axis shows potassium glutamate concentration, and the z-axis shows sodium oxalate concentration. The ovals shows predicted CFPS concentration. The maximal CFPS activity was found at 195 mM potassium glutamate, 6 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. The minimal point was found at 65 mM potassium glutamate, 18 mM magnesium glutamate, and 2 mM sodium oxalate. This was verified as the maximum and minimum points using the surface profiler function in JMP.
Figure 9: CFPS activity for two CFPS systems utilising two different cell extract batches prepared identically. A) Results for a system utilising the same extract batch used to test the SRD. B) Results for a system utilising a new batch of cell extract. The blue lines show systems using the normal CFPS supplement premix, and the purple lines show the systems with supplement premix with ‘optimised’ magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, and sodium oxalate as identified above. The system utilising extract from the same batch used in the SRD testing had a higher CFPS activity with the ‘optimised’ premix (purple) than with the original premix (blue), whereas the system utilising extract from a separate batch had higher activity with the original premix.
Design Stage 3
All 15 supplements in the supplement solution premix were analysed similarly to how the four salts were initially analysed (i.e. a main effects screening design). A classical screening design was created with all supplements as continuous factors (the nucleotides UTP, GTP, and CTP were combined to form a single factor), and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit. The main effects screening design was then used to generate the experimental design (Table 4).
Table 4: Table of reactions performed according to the DoE full supplement solution screening design. CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each supplement according to the table above.
Experimental Procedure 3
CFPS reactions were prepared and performed as usual, except the supplement solution had components at concentrations according to the main effects screening design. The experiment was repeated using two separate batches of cell extract; one which was initially moderately active (extract"

Verify that ethanol has been added to the RNA Wash Solution. Add 20ml of RNA Wash Solution to the PureYield™ Binding Column. Cap the tube if desired. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes.
Empty the Collection Tube as in Step 4. Repeat the wash in Step 5 with an additional 10ml of RNA Wash Solution, increasing the centrifugation time to 10 minutes to empty the column and dry the Binding Membrane. Optional: To further reduce ethanol carryover, empty the collection tube and centrifuge the PureYield™ Binding Column for an additional 5 minutes at 2,000 × g.
Carefully transfer the PureYield™ Binding Column to a fresh 50ml collection tube. Save the cap for the elution step. Use care to make sure that the flowthrough does not contact the column. Note: If the PureYield™ Binding Column is contacted by the flowthrough, empty the collection tube and centrifuge the assembly for 1 minute before transferring the Binding Column to a fresh tube (Step 7).
Add 1ml Nuclease-Free Water to the PureYield™ Binding Column, preferably using an ART® Aerosol Resistant Tip. Be careful to completely cover the surface of the membrane with the water. If desired, cap the tube with the clean cap. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes to release the RNA into solution. Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 3 minutes to collect the RNA. Note that with some types of centrifuge braking and vacuum systems, some upward displacement of the membrane can occur during the elution step. This does not affect the yield or performance of the system.
Remove the PureYield™ Binding Columns and discard. Store the aliquots of the purified RNA at –70°C using sterile, low-binding (i.e., siliconized), RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes. Note: Ethanol contamination may occur with the centrifugation (spin) format. If the RNA sample is not heat denatured prior to gel loading, it may float out of the well. If this occurs, leave a portion of the sample open to the air for 10 minutes to allow the ethanol to evaporate. The RNA sample may also be incubated at 37°C to increase the evaporation rate.

Violacein
E. coli engineered by the 2009 Cambridge iGEM team to produce violacein. We are expressing the violacein pathway in yeast.
Courtesy of the Boeke Lab , our violacein biosynthesis genes VioA, VioB, VioC, VioD and VioE have been codon-optimized for yeast and designed to ligate with yeast specific promoters and UTR terminators.  To assemble full expression cassettes for each gene, the genes have been fitted with flanking restriction sites as per the Golden Gate or ""off-cutter"" assembly method. This allows for single-reaction, gapless, ordered assembly of multiple parts simultaneously.
Violacein Open Reading Frame (ORF) construct:
XmaI site/BsaI site/Violacein ORF/inverted BsaI site/SphI site.
Image courtesy of the Boeke lab
Due to the size of the above constructs, we received them in pieces, or 'building blocks'. VioA, C, D came in two building blocks.  VioE was small enough to come in one piece, while VioB--around 3kb in length--came in 4 building blocks.  Each building block overlaps its counterpart, and within the overlap region is a unique restriction enzyme site.  By digesting both blocks with the right restriction enzyme, they can be ligated together into to make a full construct such as the one above.
The flanking XmaI and SphI sites were added for the easy insertion of the OR"

Introduction on the TU Delft 2010 iGEM Project
Figure 1: Arabidopsis thaliana engineered to detect landmines. The plant turns red in the presence of landmine degradation product.
After more than 3 billion years of evolution, with slow pace of change and isolated species a new era has dawned. Synthetic Biology, an engineering approach to life intersecting biology, chemistry and physics, defines a new way of developing life. Although still in its infancy, its potential applications are enormous.
Synthetic Biology research comprises a full spectrum of challenging topics, for example the biological production of existing and novel materials, including food and biofuels. In the field of health care scientists focus on diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, an already existing example is the production of the antimalarial medicine artemisinin. A team from the University of Edinburgh has designed and engineered bacteria to function as a biological sensor of arsenic in water (1). In Denmark genetically engineered Arabidopsis thaliana was developed that changes color when exposed to landmine degradation product (2).
This year a team of students from the TU Delft will design a biological system to treat oil-contaminated environments. The project is part of the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition, annually held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The competition challenges students from around the world to develop new basic biological building blocks, called “bio-bricks”. These biobricks are used to assemble biological systems in model organisms that do not occur naturally, such as oil-degradation pathways.
Challenges in Bioremediation
Figure 2: Contaminated tailing water from Oil Sands industry
Bioremediation is defined as the use of biological systems for the treatment of environmental contaminants. All around the world pollution threatens habitats of animals and people. Accidental oil spills are among the most notorious causes of pollution, and afflict major damage to ecosystems, businesses and communities. One of the greatest pollutions is the BP Gulf oil spill, caused by the sinking of the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon. Flowing at up to 2,500,000 gallons (3) of crude oil per day, this disaster will soon outrank the biggest accidental oil spill so far (Ixtoc Oil Spill, 1979, 138 million gallons (4)). Besides, regular industrial activity also causes oil pollution that needs to be taken care"

Mission Statement
The objective of the Queen’s Genetically Engineered Machine (QGEM) Team is to provide a learning opportunity to a team of Queen’s students by supporting them to allow them to compete at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM).
The team will develop their genetic engineering project, complete it over the course of the summer and then prepare for the iGEM competition in the fall.
Completing an iGEM project will give the students experience in applying engineering and biological principles to solve real‐world problems, while allowing them to gain a broader knowledge base and learn to work in an interdisciplinary team environment.

iGEM at Local Sport Events
To show the athletic character of our iGEM team, and to make some advertising for our iGEM team in public, we participated at the old town run in June here in Göttingen - of course in our fancy iGEM shirts. Unfortunately, we could not compete with the nobel prize winning department of Stefan Hell, the “Hell's Runners”, who made the first place in the race - but we are sure that the iGEM Team Göttingen 2017 will make it!

Zak Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems. To help advance us towards our inevitable conquest, I am studying neuroscience and have decided to take part in the iGEM competition this year! This firm belief also explains my obsession with all consumer technology. I occupy the time between now and our eventual fate with bike rides, camping, and dance parties. Oh yeah, and resistance is futile.
Sutherland Dube
Hi I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I am currently a 4th year student at the U of L majoring in Neuroscience. This is my first year on the iGEM team and so far it has been great! Being a neuroscience major, iGEM has been awesome at providing the opportunity to participate in research outside of my field of study. When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading.
Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.
Katherine Gyzl
Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.

Question: Was it possible to keep a subculture growing inside the isolated compartment without contaminating the surroundings?
Experiment: Using Lysogeny-Broth (LB) medium with 10μg/ml chloramphenicol, Mock-transformed B. subtilis were inoculated into a dialysis tube filled with LB medium. The dialysis bag was closed using clips from Spectrum Labs, and carefully placed inside a 1000mL growth flask and incubated at 28°C overnight at 100rpm.
Result: The first versions of our protocol for sterilization and inoculation of our dialysis bag caused wide-spread cross contamination between compartments (Fig. 2A). This also raised the question whether the contamination came from the act of inoculating or from other outside sources, which was investigated by omitting innoculation with and without antibiotics (Fig. 2B). This showed that contamination of the outside only happened in the innoculated sample, meaning that the contamination came from the act of inoculation.
It was therefore hypothesized that by cleaning the top of the dialysis bag with 70% ethanol after inoculation, it would be sterile. By using this improved protocol it was possible to isolate growth of Mock-transformed B. subtilis to the inner compartment (Fig. 3). This is seen by a turbid medium inside the dialysis after incubation.
----------------
Question: Can S. elongatus grow in BG-11 medium?
Experiment: S. elongatus was inoculated into BG-11 medium a 250mL growth flask. The culture was incubated for 4 days at 30°C in a light chamber at 250rpm. Optical density (OD) at 730nm was measured 5 times during this period.
Result: Growth was relatively slow, but followed an almost linear trend (Fig. 4). This strongly indicates that S. elongatus can grow in BG-11 medium, which was expected.
----------------
Question: Can B.subtilis grow in BG-11 medium with and without sucrose supplement?
Experiment: Unsupplemented, 10mM and 30mM sucrose supplemented BG-11 medium were set up in autoclaved 250mL baffled flasks.

There’s always a chance of failure of microorganism to escape and contaminate environment, especially because the size of microorganism and bacteria is very small. Although there are chances of failure, Prof. Yohda as a scientist wants a higher degree of Synbio development in Japan. He’s excited about synthetic biology development because it will cope problems many industries. People need to take more risks and accept this novel development. [Read more…]

Universitas Indonesia
Ms. Aroem Naroeni is IHVCB’s Biosafety Officer located in Salemba, Jakarta. Finishes her Ph.D. in L'Universite d'Aix Marseille II in “Infectious Diseases and Tropical Pathology”, she’s been doing a research on breast cancer stem cells and microenvironment, and HIV antiviral drugs. She’s very concerned with biosafety and risk assessment in medical research and currently she’s developing a guideline for safety and risk assessment to be applied all over Indonesia. The coolest thing is: this will be the first one Indonesia ever have! She knows about our project we’re doing in the lab, so her point of view really matters. Find out her thoughts about our project’s safety assessment and the prospect of synthetic biology development in Indonesia!
Synthetic biology has been developing in Indonesia, but actually there are many issues involved. As a developing country, Indonesia hasn’t had a safety guideline regarding research in Synthetic Biology. But luckily, Indonesian are very “easy-going” and people will try to accept it as long as it can solve problems. A prove of it is shown by a biosimilar products such as erythropoietin, diarrhea drug, and other stuffs that has been commercially published. However, many aspects should be reconsidered including ethics, sustainability, and safety. UI is currently developing a guideline for biosafety and risk assessment for the first time ever in Indonesia. For our project, some things that need to be emphasize is we need to go through more specific study of the safety of virulence gene that would be inserted in the bacteria, and for further research we have to try it in in-vitro, preclinical (animal), and even clinical (human) for the last object.

208 lab
Main purposes today
Make PCR with x7-polymerase.
Who was in the lab
Kristian
Procedure
Made PCRs on pZA21, GFP SF TAT, GFP SF Sec, RFP all samples where made in duplicates.
In tube 1+2, 9+10 where pZA21. In 3+4, 11+12 GFP SF TAT In 5+6, 13+14, 17+18 GFP SF Sec In 7+8, 15+16 RFP
First program was 59°C annealing and 2:00 extension time with tube: 1+2, 3+4, 5+6, 7+8. Second program was 68°C annealing and 2:00 extension time with tube: 9+10, 11+12, 13+14, 15+16. Last program was 70°C annealing and 1:00 extension time with tube: 17+18.
Results
The gel from the days PCR. Note the head and trail the band leaves behind it. It looks like supercoiled plasmid DNA
The days PCR where not very successful. The gel pic. looks like that we can only see supercoiled plasmid DNA which must originate from the template DNA.
Conclusion from today
We might have used the wrong polymerase and the products we have gotten from previous PCRs with PHUSION-polymerase are without any uracil insertion.

For degradation of PFOA, we insert Fac-dex gene into plasmid backbone pSB1C3 for protein expression. We use a constitutive promoter to express Fac-dex gene.
BBa_K2073000
For transportation of fluoride, we use another constitutive promoter to express a kind of fluoride transporter gene called CRCB. So that fluoride anion which is the predicted by product of PFCs degradation can be transported out of the bacteria.

Electrical & Computer Engineering (2nd Year)
This summer, I have been responsible for building the physical prototypes for our system and designing and coding this website. I am pursuing a career in aeronautical robotics R&D, so I have found my time working in a research setting with iGEM this year very valuable. Besides staying up until 2 a.m. coding, I also spend my time running Foster Bikes , a non-profit, Seattle-based company I co-founded. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, skiing, and trying to learn about this weird thing non-engineers call a ""social life"".

Biomedical Sciences (4th Year)
This is my second year on the iGEM Calgary team and I have my hands in every part of the project. Formally though, I am leading team ferritin and have been nicknamed ""Christoferritin"" by my team mates. When I am not slaving in the early morning hours in our lab, you'll find me travelling on remote logging roads in the backwoods of Alberta, or covered in grease working on my pickup truck. After I conquer iGEM, I hope to start a career as a hand model, enter a travelling carnival, or failing those, continue my journey in synthetic biology as a graduate student.

Francis working on coloroid. Making small RNAs RFC10 compatible. Also ordered some site directed mutagenesis primers.

Don’t expose our gels so much, keep intensity a bit lower.
Do gel extractions, grab the insert from the gel and use that to ligate so we don’t have the binding competition from the plasmid that originally contained the insert. Zymo gel extraction kit works best. But we can grab qiagen as well.   Want about 4 times as much insert as backbone, at least 1:1 insert:backbone. We can use the kit from the south side.  Try to use bigger combs, low melt agarose, be careful about taking the comb out to not tear the gel, stick it in the fridge for a little while to make it easier to pull it out without tearing.
Maybe contaminated primers with template. Be really careful about contaminating things, change tips is anything touches it. Try just running primers and see what we get. Test the pipette by just sucking up and pipetting out, run it. We’ll see about getting a guy out here to calibrate them.
For synthesizing promoter/RBS: use oligos, 2 rounds of primer extension, purify on acrylamide gel. Design 250 bp primer and use that to synthesize the promoter/RBS.
60 base pairs is pretty much the max we can use without purifying for primers.
cut our plasmids before running them on the gel to be able to compare them the ladders"

(Figure 1. Colorectal Cancer Incidence Rate in China in 2011. )[4]
 
Colorectal Cancer: one of the MOST common cancers in the world
    Colorectal Cancer is one of the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death around the world. It is a disease that forms malignant tumors in colon or rectum. Of cancers affecting both men and women, colorectal cancer is the second leading cancer killer in the United States [1]. In China, the colorectal cancer is ranked the sixth most common cancer and one of the deadliest of its kind. The overall incidence of colorectal cancer was 23.03/100,000 and grew progressively in people of advanced years [2]. In 2012, it was estimated that 149,722 people died from the cancer which made up 7.09% of the overall cancer-related death [3].
The Limitation of Current Colorectal Cancer Detection Methods
Virtually, most colorectal cancer arises from clusters of cells, called polyp, which grow in the inner linings of colon or rectum. Although only a number of, not all, colorectal polyps become cancerous over time, detecting and analyzing these polyps are key to the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer [5]. At present, available detective methods include: Sigmoidoscopy, Colonoscopy, Double-contrast Barium Enema, CT Colonoscopy, Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test, Fecal Immunochemical Test and Stool DNA Test[6]. Despite their diversity, however, none of the listed methods offers a quick and accurate detection that can be performed at little to none negative effects to the patients. For example, methods pertaining to scopes are often time-consuming and requires accommodation on diets, leaving alone the fact that they could miss small developing polyps. Sedation"

Step 2: The user drops a drop of urine in the test area and presses the button on the kit to                         start timing. Subsequent operations will be done automatically by the system.
Step 3: The system timed reaction 40 minutes after the slide is moved to the washing buffer                         chamber for 30 seconds of rinsing and drying, after the slide moved to the detection area, the                         system drops the liquid crystal and turns on the bottom light, ordinary light passes the                         polarizer produces polarized light and produces a color change in the liquid crystal region.
Step 4: The user takes a picture of the detected image and uploads it to the APP to obtain the                         image gray scale data and the β2-MG concentration in the urine, and the corresponding                         medical advice.
Precautions:
The antigen layer glass slide will automatically drop the antibody solution only when it is                             inserted into the correct position in the groove;
When the crystal liquid is added and when you can observe and take pictures, the system will                             make a sound to remind you so you don't have to wait at the kit.
Customer Feedback
Although we have implemented the semi-automated operation of the second-generation of Dr.                         Familict design and reduced the user's operation steps, we still hope that you can provide                         constructive and valuable advice for our products, including but not limited to your hope of                         better operation process, results presentation, reaction time, and data analysis software. We                         will further improve user interface based on your feedback on our product design.

General Support and Advice
Dr. Janie Brennan, our main advisor, put the team together and handled our registration this year. When we first started, she guided us through the process of brainstorming and developing our project and reviewed basic lab procedures with us. She also reviewed basic synthetic biology concepts needed for our project design. Dr. Brennan met with us biweekly to provide advice ordering our parts, designing our experiments, and aligning with our timeline and deadlines. In addition, she provided coaching on drafting our posters and presentations throughout the year.
Jeff Czajka, our grad mentor, oversaw our work in the lab and taught us how to prepare LB media, LB agar, and antibiotic plates. He guided us through basic protocols and safety training at the beginning of the summer, and provided us with other necessary protocols and advice with working with yeast. As we performed the Interlab study, Jeff"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the sensitivity of the prescreening, the EPO target DNA is lowered to 100 pM. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 nM and 100 pM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

Under these conditions, only a few, less than 5, promoters are activated and, as result, the LuxI concentration remains low.The plot on the right shows the response to a 100 times larger lactate concentration. Even though the number of active promoters remains relatively low, the constant production of mRNA leads to a large production of LuxI.

Vgb promoter
Vitreoscilla is a gram-negative, aerobic bacteria [7] . To facilitate continued oxygen uptake, it produces bacterial hemoglobin in low oxygen environments. This production is regulated by the vgb promoter [8] that has little or low expression in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but is strongly expressed in microaerobic conditions [9] . This behaviour is caused by two proteins; Fnr and ArcA [7] .
Both of these proteins are also found in E. Coli and are involved in the regulation of at least 20 different processes in the cell [10] . Fnr contains an [2Fe-2S]²⁺ cluster that is directly oxidized in the precence of oxygen [11] . This was modelled as the unoxidized protein binding to the promoter, thus activating it. In the precense of high oxygen concentrations, however, it would be converted to an oxidized form that did not bind to the promoter.
For the ArcA protein, the system is more complicated. In anaerobic conditions, a membrane protein called ArcB will autophosphorylate. This will in turn phosphorylate ArcA which can then inhibit the vgb promoter [12] . To simplify the model, this was simulated the same way as the Fnr protein with direct oxidation, but with a higher oxidation propensity and the binding of the reduced protein caused inhibition, not activation. This gave a qualitative description of the system with little expression with high or very low oxygen concentrations and activation at intermediate levels.
In the figures below, the LuxR production and amount of active promoter is plotted for three different oxygen levels; 10, 250 and 2000. For the levels with low induction, the amount of protein remains relatively low around 100. In the high induction case, however, the concentration rapidly increases to over 900. Even for the high induction case, the amount"

①Tabacoo Scraps:Axillary buds and tobacco stems, etc., and tobacco waste produced in the processing of tobacco in the cigarette factory.
②Tobacco crumb, cut tobacoo and tobacco stems: produced in the process of tobacco drying, re-baking, and being rolled up, etc., three kinds of recyclable tobacco waste, can be uesd to synthetize papermaking tobacco slice, which would be reused in tobacco production.
③Tobacco dusts: a kind of unrecyclable tobacco waste, which is eventually made into a tobacco bar in the factory.
2. Tobacco processing tobacco waste.
The picture shows the primary process of tobacco production, which can be divided into rough and fine methods. In rough processing, including tobacco cutting, leaf selection, cigarette wrapping, etc. mainly, machines don’t  discharge too much tobacco dusts into the air, but large volume of recyclable tobacco waste, like tobacco crumb and tobacco stems, is produced. These processing processes are exposed to air . However, some processes, such as drying and dehydration, will not release the tobacco dusts because the related devices are fully enveloped and connected by tubes to avoid possible leakage. With the tube system, the tobacco dusts are easily collected together, then concentrated and burnt to dusts. Although the tobacco dusts are not recyclable, there are some valuable raw materials in tobacco dusts. The contents of dusts are same to original tobacco leaves, which means that amount of nicotine can be extracted from the tobacco dusts for further utilization. Besides, compared with leaves, it is easier to obtain nicotine from ashes in powder by simply immersing in the medium so that E.coli can absorb these nicotine to synthesize medicine precursors.  In Hefei Cigarette Factory, we learned about the quality of tobacco dusts produced is about 20 tons per month, similar to the other two factories. This information reflects we can get a abundant nicotine source for our project.
3. Talk with tobacco factory production experts and tobacco waste disposal experts.
In addition, we talked with tobacco factory production experts and tobacco waste disposal experts, reviewing the detailed process of the visit. Based on these sorts, we Re-examine our project and made corresponding adjustments. We understood that the tobacco industry already had some mature methods for recycling some tobacco waste. They will recycle most of the recyclable tobacco waste such as tobacco crumb, cut tobacoo and tobacco stems, which are reused as a part of cigarette raw materials. But they only reuse recyclable tobacco waste,"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Background
What's In Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal? Used with permission from Hakai Magazine
The Gowanus Canal, located in Brooklyn, NY is one of the most heavily contaminated water bodies in the nation. This 1.8 mile long, 100 foot wide, canal was built in the 19th century and historically was home to many industries including manufactured gas plants, cement factories, oil refineries, tanneries, and chemical plants. After nearly 150 years of use, the canal has become heavily contaminated with PCBs, heavy metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, sewage solids from combined sewer overflows, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). in 2010 it was designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a SuperFund site. Efforts are now underway to clean up some of the former industrial sites along the canal’s banks, reduce sewage overflows, and improve water quality.
-From the RiverKeeper  Website
The borough of Brooklyn has undergone a renaissance, driving up real estate prices and luring residential developers. The vision of a cleaned-up waterway flowing through the Gowanus neighborhood has developers vying for the permits to build high-rise residential units along the banks of the canal. These proposed developments are controversial. They have been challenged by residents of the neighborhood for many reasons, including  the concern that new tenants would overwhelm schools and subways, and that the buildings themselves — 12 stories in spots — would perniciously transform the low-rise mingling of factories and row houses the current canal community has come                     to love . One of the main fears voiced by by the Gowanus community is that addition of more residential units and the accompanying sewage production would adversely affect the health of the canal, which is already prone to contamination following rainstorms. “The infrastructure is not there,” said Marlene Donnelly, a designer who has lived in the neighborhood for two decades. “My biggest concern is that the project will add 700 apartments with toilets going into the canal. They’re inundating a                         system that’s overtaxed.” ( NY Times )
Considering the videos we have seen on line, these concerns are well-founded and because there"

Lab Open Day
The lab open day is an annual activity in our school held on May. This year, in 18 to 19 May, we opened our lab to welcome the public from all Hefei City and even far from Xi'an City to know what we are doing and what are genetic engineering and iGEM. We organized the following activities:
Introduce the daily laboratory appratus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot and incubator etc. We expained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge. So we continued teaching them more about the physical knowledge in it and it felt really pretty good to share them with our lose and gain and enlighten the kids who interested in science.
View microscope and anatomical len: we collected some fresh flowers and leaves as well as cell slider including our Caulobacter crescentus and our staffs teaches the kids how to use a microscope to observe the micro scale world and guide them to carefully dissect the flowers with tweezers. Many kids in China still were lack of opportunity to get in touch with the real science, which they could only read and learn from books. Consequently, we hoped this activity to trigger their motivation to not only think carefully but do meticulously.
Class for kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation particularly to kids to introduce the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures. We are surprised to know that children know the name of DNA, while they almost misunderstand the essence of DNA. So we instructed them about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and research. Besides, genetic engineering was also introduced using chocolate biscuits as example. We wished kids possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us could prosper in future:)
Fold It! Well it is a game invented by Baker Lab from Washington University and introduced by 2010 Washington iGEM. We introduced the game to the public and especially high school or college students so that the students who have a little background of molecular biology is capable of understanding the best structure of proteins in some optimums. When the students knew that the structure of a reverse transcriptase(RT) in HIV, on which scientists have worked for more than fifteen years, was solved by player in ten days, we saw their great ambitions to participate in solving global problems they are good at and intrigued in. Well, this is why we hold it!

From the above data, we can deduce that our biobrick will produce more lycopene when there is more oxidative stress in older people there creating a regulatory feedback system.
Hence, we have characterised our silver BioBrick.

We interviewed biologists and asked about the challenges they encountered in the lab. We brainstormed with them possible solutions to their problems. Largest among the challenges was the issue with contamination. Having to take gloves off to interact with a computer, to take notes, to handle certain things can lead to contamination of a sample. Our solution was a tablet interface that replaced the traditional lab notebook and improved the use experience by allowing hands-free interaction. The tablet was designed to display biological protocols, tasks, notes, lab status, and more. The switching of applications was streamlined by allowing voice activation. We also explored the possibility of using gestures to navigate the application as well.

Results
After our initial wetlab observations, the computational team created initial designs and concept ideas for the final eLabNoteook product.  We took these initial designs back to the wetlab and showed them to the rest of our team, then took their feedback to create this series of wireframes using Cacoo .  We continued to iterate on this design, bringing it to the MIT iGEM team to get their feedback, and also presenting it to Avi Robinson-Mosher of the Wyss Institute .  From the MIT iGEM team, we got a better idea of which parts of our application were tailored specifically to our wetlab at BU, and which parts would be useful to iGEM teams in general.  We also redesigned some parts of our application to be more broadly applicable: we recognized the necessity of changing the protocols between labs and for the same lab over time.  Our meeting with Avi showed us the needs of users beyond iGEM students, and we hope to incorporate functionality more relevant to graduate and postgraduate work in future iterations of this project.
Future Work
Add connectivity between multiple iPads
Create multiple interfaces for different hardware (i.e., PC access, iPad access, mobile phone access)
Create specialized functions for an advisor vs. a student
Improve the user interface
Use gesture based input or voice commands instead of touch to control the iPad
Add reference materials for use in lab setting

The goal of phase 1 to establish a consistent method of gene activation through dCAS9-VPR and well characterize the components of our system. Using MIT's CRISPR  optimization tool, we generated 20 sequences to be used as our gRNA and target site. The dCAS9-VPR complex, the target sequence and reporter gene, and the gRNA expression vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. Another set of transfections took place simultaneously with the same materials minus the gRNA expression vector as a negative control. The fold increase between the basal level of expression from the control and the activated level of expression was then recorded. The results can be found below.

Two weeks after the last immunization, mice were sacrificed to collect serum for the neutralizing antibodies assay and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test. All experimental procedures were conducted in conformity with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985). The protocol was approved by the animal care committee of JSCDC. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. 7.Antibody Responses Induced by Immunizations To evaluate humoral responses induced by recombinant VLPs, BALB/c mice were immunized with 40 µg of VLPs three times, at two-week intervals. As shown in Figure 2, in comparison to the control, which immunized with PBS, VLPs elicited significant increase in antibody titer with immunization in mice. At week 6, the average antibody endpoint dilution titer (>1:60,000), and the magnitude of humoral immune responses induced by VLPs was similar to those induced by whole influenza virions (WIV).

Project motivation
Our team is from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean is essentially in our backyard. Horseshoe crabs are seen a lot throughout the shores especially in Jamaica Bay. Unfortunately, throughout the years the horseshoe crab population has been decreasing. We wondered why this was happening and the reason why this was happening is that pharmaceutical companies are harvesting one third of the HorseshoeCrab Blood since their blood is good at detecting endotoxins by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) in injectable medicines, which is required by the FDA.
Defining the project challenges
Even though the patent on Factor C assay has expired and new recombinant methods have been created — for example, Lonza bioscience has created an rFC assay — the assay still remains monopolized and inaccessible (in order to be able to view the Lonza protocol, you have to request permission from the company). It is also inaccessible in the sense that the protocol is very demanding in terms of the dollar amount, and requires expensive equipment and reagents. Therefore, the challenge of our project was to create a more accessible and easy-to-use diagnostic tool with the rFC in a way where we could visualize the self-cleavage of the protein on a simpler system, such as a paper strip.
How did we combat the challenges
We decided that our best course of action would be to create a two-part system with Limulus Factor C and a second protein that would function as a reporter. We envisioned a fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a cellulose binding domain (CBD), linked together by a short sequence of amino acids that includes the cleavage site from the natural substrate of Factor C (Factor B) consisting of an Arg-Ser. When applied to paper the CBD should anchor this protein. The hope was that when Factor C encountered endotoxin, it would undergo self-cleavage into its proteolytic active form and act on the linker, freeing the GFP to diffuse away from the paper (or potentially wicked up a strip giving a visual signal under a blacklight"

Our team progressed at a pretty typical pace this week. Construction had its failures and successes as we attempted to ligate our repressors in front the RBS B0034. On the mutant side of the project we have set up the Tecan for mutant screening and will hopefully prove through fluorescence readings that we do indeed have mutants.
--Monday 7/11/11--
While we are making and testing promoter mutants, we started making repressor mutants.  We'll need them eventually and the mutagenic PCR's don't take too long to do while things are slow.  However, testing out these mutants and finding a good range of repression is the tough part.  We also cut the wild-type repressors for construction of our testing plasmid.
--Tuesday 7/12/11--
--Wednesday 7/13/11--
Finally got the Tecan set up how we want it for characterization of our mutants.
Miniprepped J61002 in a chloramphenicol backbone, this should come in handy later!
Completely reorganized the 4 degree room. Now we can actually find our plates!
--Thursday 7/14/11--
Uh-oh! Our transformations from yesterday failed. Colonies on all of the controls! We're going to re-digest the following parts:
C0040 (Cut with XbaI and PstI)
C0012 (Cut with XbaI and PstI)
C0051 (Cut with XbaI and PstI)
C0051 (Cut with SpeI and PstI)
E0240 (Cut with XbaI and PstI)
B0034 (Cut with SpeI and PstI)
Set up PCR reactions in order to Gibson our project together.  The parts PCR'd were c0012, C0051, C0040, I13458, I13453, E0240, R0010,"
WITS-CSIR_SA,2011,Team:WITS-CSIR SA#Project#Concept_-_-_TEXT.html,". Cre recombination will allow for irreversible “flipping” of this constitutive promoter (by lox site recombination) and thereby switch the motility function (or “direction”) from “send” to “receive”, such that bacterial motility will then be dictated by a concentration gradient of analyte B (Figure 4). Ultimately, the bacterial chemotactic movement will switch from responsiveness to analyte A (“send”) to responsiveness to analyte B (“receive”), when the bacteria reach a critical concentration of analyte A.
Figure 4. “Send” and “receive” riboswitch-controlled motility module. Featured is also an analyte A-responsive toggle switch which activates Cre-recombinase expression. Cre, in turn, causes “receive” motility activation by flipping a constitutively active promoter, and allowing motility to be controlled by analyte B. (Click to enlarge)
Unfortunately, other than Tetracycline (Dox) riboswitches in yeast, at present, an engineered riboswitch which is sensitive to a known transcriptional de-repressor does not exist. For this reason, we could not put our theoretical (ideal) genetic circuit design into practice, since no analyte in literature can act as both a riboswitch activator and de-repressor in a biphasic toggle system. Therefore, we designed a system which allows the “receive” function (expression of Cre-recombinase) to rather be activated by IPTG (lacI) – see Figure 5. Also, we focused this design on the use of two known synthetic riboswitches which are responsive to the analytes theophylline and atrazine, respectively (see “Riboswitch Design Considerations” below).
Figure 5. “Send” and “receive” riboswitch-controlled motility module. In this design, Cre-recombinase is activated by IPTG which is present only at the theophylline position (not present in the theophylline gradient - blue). As with Fig. 4, Cre, in turn, causes “receive” motility activation by flipping the constitutively active promoter, and allowing motility to be controlled by an Atrazine gradient (red). Note: analogous to the design above in Fig.4 – theophylline can be considered as analyte A, and atrazine as analyte B. (Click to enlarge)
Our initial aim was to develop a theophylline-sensitive riboswitch which is capable of regulating CheZ (motility factor) translation.
Using a high-throughput screen ("
McMasterU,2017,Team:McMasterU#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the Hamilton community and his focus on developing the next generation of healthcare leaders made him the best choice to help us develop a platform to share our research.
We started the meeting off by discussing the McMaster iGEM team, our research and the negative effects of C. difficile in Hamilton. The mayor proceeded by asking a series of questions to determine the scope of the problem and those who are most likely to be affected. With new knowledge from l researchers such as Dr.Daneman we were able to explain that in the case of C difficile,
“the majority of cases develop after admission [into a healthcare facility] or... an elderly person in a long-term care situation, or a recently discharged person who then develops symptoms in the community. “
As a team we wanted to develop a point of care diagnostic tool to prevent patients from acquiring a C. difficile infection in the first place. While our Wet Lab team has made tremendous progress, the Mayor pointed out that we should focus our efforts on what we can do now.
So after our discussion of the wet lab project and the issues surrounding C.difficile that are relevant to Hamilton, we focused the remainder of our meeting on education and outreach opportunities. We started by asking Mayor. Eisenberger the most effective ways of communicating with the public and bringing awareness to antimicrobial resistance. He laughed and said that while social media platforms are a good starting point, “good old-fashioned tv and radio” are still a great way of communicating with a wider audience, especially those who may not be active on social media. He said that once we had a solid message and had fully developed our content, he would help us to broadcast our message using mass media platforms such as the Cable 14 news. He also connected us with a number of local community groups such as the Social Planning Research Council, and the Public Health Sector of Hamilton led by Dr. Elizabeth Richardson. The mayor showed tremendous support for our project and the work we are hoping to do in the community.
The mayor's encouragement, insight on our outreach initiatives and contacts with local community organizations and Dr. Elizabeth Richardson have been invaluable and showcases the impact a student can have. We look forward to contacting these organizations, engaging with community members and speaking to Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, the Medical Officer of Health,  to better understand how the McMaster iGEM team can word to address issues in the Hamilton community.

Fluorescence
Test the expression of Pfus+mRFP+cyc1t+pRS42K in engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2, △sst2.
We research the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the amount of expression of fluorescence  as well as the the growth of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains, △far1+△sst2、△far1+△sst2+△ste2，△sst2 containing the examined circuit.
The plan and method
We set the concentration of alpha factor as 0umol/L，1 umol/L， 2.5 umol/L， 5 umol/L，10 umol/L，15 umol/L.We take out 5ml cultivating bacteria liquid of each of them after 0、4、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22、24、26、28、30h respectively and correct them by the YPD solution which not inoculated yeasts after shake culture. Afterwards,the intensity of triggered fluorescence is measured in microplate reader(584/607).We create the coordianate system of the expression of fluorescence of engeneering yeast by setting the value of that intensity of triggered fluorescence/OD600 as Y-axis and time taken as X- axis.
The results and discuss
With the increase of the concentration of α factor, the fluorescence intensity increased.
With the increase of the concentration of α factor, the fluorescence intensity increased.
The strongest expression of fluorescence belongs to △far1+△sst2, while that of △far1+△sst2+△ste2 and Cen.PK2-1C are similar.
Conclusion：From the above results we can see that in the α factor concentration range, the expression of mRFP was induced. With the increase of the concentration of the alpha factor, the fluorescence expression was enhanced. And more obvious. Knocking down the sst2 and far1gene, making the strain respond to α factor enhanced.

\[c_{f}=\dfrac{c_{bo}}{\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}-\dfrac{V_{f}}{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}\exp\left(-\dfrac{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)\left(t+k\right)}{V_{f}}\right)\]
where \(k\) constant that comes from integration.
At \(t=0\) \(c_f=0\), leaving us with
\[\dfrac{c_{bo}}{\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}=\dfrac{V_{f}}{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)}\exp\left(-\dfrac{K_{m}A_{b}\left(1+\frac{V_{f}}{V_{b}}\right)k}{V_{f}}\right)\]

UCSF,2010,Team:UCSF#Notes#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," summer was over. We were only able to validate two ANDN gates and the loading of GFP into granules. It’s too bad that the killing assays didn’t work out with our system. Our advisors mentioned that either viral methods of gene delivery or stable cell line creation would probably be necessary to run the cytotoxicity assays so that high expression levels could be obtained. It  was a great experience to come up with devices using information from the literature and natural systems. Using combinations of CARs to construct logic gates had not been reported before and it was also very cool to see that we can use cellular zipcodes to localize proteins to granules.  The CPL is interested in some of our devices and will hopefully follow up after iGEM is over.

SCU-WestChina,2017,Team:SCU-WestChina#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". But the protein can’t be expressed                     in our constitutive promoter gene expression structure.
Table 1 Characteristics of the three enzymes and transporter.
Our quantitative gene expression is based on the Anderson‘s Promoters. Anderson's promoters are the most widely used constitutive                     promoters family. Those promoters are well characterized by RFP fluorescence. However, a key problem                     of generalizing the results of characterizations is that the dynamics of gene expression are influenced                     by the protein coded for. The RFP expression result might not be compatible with our gene expression.                     In 2016 iGEM competition, team William_and_Mary tried to use insulator RiboJ to make relative expression                     levels similar between different proteins. They have verified this phenomenon as a paper published before.                     We adopted the same RiboJ insulator design to measure the 10 promoters from Anderson’s Promoters family                     by expressing eGFP to avoid the influence brought by different coding sequences for our pathway construction[5,6].
The reason why we start to do the measurement is that we need to calculate to evaluate if our pathway is efficient enough                     to reduce the urate in the gut based on the gut urate concentration, to theoretically avoid our pathway                     expressing unnecessary extra protein to reduce the cell burden as much as possible to maintain colonization. In this condition, absolute protein concentration expressed by different promoters should be known. We                     have to find out the relationship between eGFP quantitative protein concentration and the promoters.                     And that's the first time in iGEM to evaluate the absolute protein expression of a promoter with the                     help of insulator to predict the metabolic ability of a pathway. Our measurement provided a prospective                     for future teams to evaluate the efficiency of a pathway.
To achieve this, we decide to draw a standard curve of eGFP fluorescence-eGFP absolute protein quantity. We expressed the                     eGFP-6x his-tag in pET28a driven by T7 promoter. We purified the protein and drew the standard curve                     successfully (See measurement, protocols for purification and measurement experiment details). The final                     results are as follows.

Based on the eGFP measurement and modeling, we designed our molecular biology experiment. Considering the urate concentration                     in the gut (about 100uM"

This BioBrick required the integration of some specific sequence between the split-YFP and the VVD receptor. Those ‘linker’ have been provided by Samuel Juillot, supervisor of our iGEM team. The linkers as well as the Split YFP (YC155-YN155) have been initially sent by Tom Kerppola, Ph. D, investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as Professor in the University of Michigan. The choice of linker is critical as their sequences must meet the flexibility and the length required for the two split part to join and to become effective. The linker chosen have been shown to work with the provided split-YFP.  Hu, CD, Chinenov, Y and Kerppola, TK.  Molecular Cell 9: 789-798, 2002.
VVD system strategy
The main point of our strategy is based on the Gibson Assembly.       It is a method to assemble easily multiple DNA fragments independently of the fragments size or extremities compatibilities without any scars.
Kill switch biobricks: pDawn – Toxin & pDusk- Toxin
We aim to construct an efficient kill-switch triggering by light.        In this way we will construct two different parts.        The first one will be composed of pDawn and ccdB reverse. Toxins will be produced after light stimulation and induce lysis.        The second part will be composed of pDawn and HokD, this will lead to the cell lysis when the bacteria is exposed to light stimulation.
For future iGEM teams, we want to create simple parts composed of ccdB reverse ( BBa_K1616012 ) ,HokD reverse ( BBa_K1616008 ) or Holin/ Endolysin ( BBa_K1616005 ).        Those parts could be used with a reverse promoter or complex systems as pDawn/pDusk.
Strategy
As the VVD strategy; the construction of the BioBrick composed of pDawn and pDusk are based on the Gibson Assembly.  The Gibson assembly allows to assemble together pDawn, ccdB reverse in pSB1C3 and also assemble pDawn, HokD reverse in pSB1C3.

Collaboration with Aalto-Helsinki
We collaborated with Aalto_helsinki team as well. We contacted them because they were working  on a similar project we were working on: producing boifuel with the tools of synthetic biology. While  they focused on producing propanol, we focused on producing butanol.
We kept in touch regularly trought e-mail, but also held a skype conference, where we talked about  our projects and the ways we could help each other. We both ordered gene fragments from IDT and  talked about that expreience and we gave each other tips on how to best accomplish other tasks of  iGEM. At the time, Slovenia HS has already done some work on our Human Practices, such as  presentations for students and appearences in media, while Aalto-Helsinki was just starting to  prepare their Human Practices, so we talked and echanged information and ideas about that. On teh  other hand, aalto-Helsinki already had experience creating wiki pages (their team won the award for  best wiki in 2014), while Slovenia HS was beginning to learn, so we were glad to also be able to ask  some questions about creating wiki.
We did some work for them in the laboratory as well. Aalto-Helsinki sent us one of their BioBricks (BBa_K1655001) for validation and to be able to compare their results with ours.  This BioBrick is a GFP that can be fused into any protein's aminoterminal. We first attempted to  validate this brick by fusing it with one of our genes (CtfB) that was already tested and proved to be  functional and active.
Our construct with CtfB and double terminator (K1669005) was first ligated as a back insert into their  plasmid pSB1C3 with GFP (BBa_K1655001) .
Restriction of plasmids with CtfB and double terminator as back inserts and plamids with GFP as back vectors. The inserts and vectors were isolated from the gel and ligated.
Colony PCR after ligation of CtfB and double terminator after the GFP. Longer products are succesful.
The fused construct was then ligated as a back insert into a plasmid with a strong promoter and a  strong RBS (BBa_K608002) .

Until here, a short resume of what has to have been done:
Codon optimise
Check for restriction enzymes and correct (BpiI, BsaI and BsmBI)
Attach the 5’ extremity (A) and delete ATG
Attach the 3’ extremity (C) and delete the STOP codon
Design primers that are specific
Next, we need to design our CDB and attach to it the BsaI sites to clone it in the vector, Phytobricks and attach it to our CDS.
To the 5’- attach a BsaI recognition site that will allow you to fit the part in the Phytobrick with our gene in frame. The sequence must be as follows, to be able to fit in the already defined iGEM parts.
To the 3’- attach the His-tag and a BsaI recognition site as before. This will allow us to purify the protein and also fit the part in the Phytobrick.

Mind the Gut: Effectors
We re-ran the 1% agarose gel for GAD and FldHC-TPH1with 6ul of DNA but to our dismayal, we did not see two bands on the gel, rendering our experiment inconclusive.
In the afternoon, we did PCR cleanup of GAD,KAT,FidHC-TPH1, Pyear-TPH1, pSB1C3(3)and pSB1C3(4) USING PROMEGA PCR cleanup kit. We had yields ranging from 30-50 ng/ul.
For transformation of these effectors into our plasmid pSB1C3, initially we carried out digestion of  5ul of GAD and Pyear-TPH1 and 6.7ul of KAT,FldHC-TPH1 with XbaI and Pst. We also double digested our plasmid with the same enzymes. The digested samples were all incubated for half an hour and heat shocked at 80 degrees for 20 minutes. Ligation carried out at 1:5 molar ratio.
The antisenseTNA1,2 from last Tuesday finally had some colonies growing in them. The CHAT and TPH1 were both assembled from g blocks using Gibson assembly and been plated at different concentrations overnight. Only two colonies in 100 ul and numerous in 200 ul of CHAT was found whereas TPH1 only had colonies in the concentrated 500 ul plate. We picked the colonies and inoculated them overnight.
Meanwhile, we obtained aliquot of competent Nissle, we also received a plated Nissle colonies as well as inoculations in Falcon which was grown overnight.

For the DNA detector in our system, we decided to use Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs). These are naturally occurring proteins that specifically bind to DNA. TALEs are an advantageous tool in synthetic biology because they can be engineered to recognize any chosen DNA sequence as long as it begins with a thymidine. For our system, we want them to bind to a sequence in enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). We have engineered TALEs that are specially designed to bind segments of the stx2 gene in the EHEC genome ( BBa_K1189032 and BBa_K1189033 ). Click here to find out more about how we designed our TALEs. This summer we also worked with TALEs from the iGEM Parts Registry to build and test our constructs, for our proof of concept . To see what we accomplished with our TALEs, check out our results section. To learn more about TALE proteins, see our background section.
Background
Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are proteins produced by bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas and secreted into plant cells. These naturally occurring TALEs play a key role in bacterial infection, as they are responsible for upregulation of the host genes required for pathogenic growth and expansion (Mussolino & Cathomen, 2012).
All TALEs are made up of three main parts: N-terminus, DNA binding domain, and C-terminus. The N-terminus contains a type III secretion signal (T3SS), which allows the proteins to"
UCSF,2013,Team:UCSF#ALHS Project1_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA from the samples we had centrifuged the previous day. After mixing the contents of the tube, we placed them into the thermal cycler. Finally, we used gel electrophoresis to see if fragments of DNA that would indicate that the sample is a GMO were present in the samples or not.
Lab Results
To detect if the food products were GMOs, we analyzed the samples by gel electrophoresis and looked for the CaMV35S promoter and NOS terminator base on the base pair size of each gene. If a food was genetically modified, it showed a 203 bp band of CaMV35S promoter and a 225 bp band of NOS terminator. Whereas, a non-GMO food would not have these two bands. During the course of the lab we tested eight foods: Fritos brand corn chips, Hawaiian papaya, Inka Roasted Corn snack food, Santitas brand tortilla chips, raw soy beans, soy crisp snack chips (brand unknown), Bob’s Red Mill Cornmeal (labeled “all natural”) and Bob’s Red Mill Cornbread Mix. Four of these eight foods proved to contain the CaMV35S promoter and the NOS terminator: Fritos, papaya, tortilla chips, and the “all natural” cornmeal. The students were surprised to find no proof of genetic modification in fresh soy beans or soy crisp snack chips, even though some sources claim that 91% of the U.S. soybean crop is genetically modified. However, in testing the soy foods, the CaMV35S and NOS terminator bands did not appear. Interestingly enough, the cornbread mix did not show evidence of genetic modification while the same-brand cornmeal did. Please see the full data represented in the chart below:

5/6 Miniprep and Making Glycerol Stocks of Silk and promoter + silk constructs
These two constructs are BBa_K1763001 and BBa_K1763000
The overnight cultures were taken out of the incubator.  They looked nice and opaque.
500 ul of the 6 inoculated cultures were used to make 6 different glycerol stocks.
These were placed in the Honeybee Glycerol Stocks box in the -80 in Sri’s lab,  It is on the second row of boxes, second column."
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," sponsored or borrowed, making the entire set-up nearly cost-free. With our minimal set of available tools, we calculated and designed the optics in such a way that we could image fluorescent cells, while photobleaching was minimized. After days of laser aligning, we managed to do so. More information on the design of this setup can be found on the hardware page .
Using our custom-built setup, we analysed our ‘Biolaser’-cells, to see if they were able to produce a laser-like emission of light.
Experiments and Results
The first and foremost experiment to be done with the setup was to image the cells in order to see if the setup works properly and to see whether we can image cells with it. Once we have confirmed that the setup works properly, we can measure the output intensity of the cells to see whether the cells are able to emit laser-like light.
Imaging our biolaser using our home-built setup
Introduction
Building an optical setup is a very precise work. First, it is important to calculate the positions of all components in such a way that the laser beam will reach your sample, and the light emitted by the sample consequently reaches the detectors of the camera and spectrometer. Once this is done, all optical components are positioned on an optical table. This special table is made to prevent vibrations in you system and has mounting holes so all optical components can be screwed into place. Once the components are positioned on the table, the alignment begins. In this step, the beam coming from the laser is guided throughout the system. By slightly adjusting and repositioning all optical components the light is guided through the components until it reaches the detector of the camera. It is essential that the components are aligned correctly and are free of vibrations, because this could change the path of the light.
Figure 1: the design of our custom self-built setup.
After tens of hours of carefully placing components and aligning the light through the setup, we managed to direct the light from the laser, through all components onto the detector of the camera. However, this does not necessarily mean that when we add fluorescent cells to the setup it we are able to image the cells with the setup. Any error in the setup could cause it not to work. Therefore, we first had to confirm whether our setup was working.
Methods
In order to confirm whether the setup was working, we used E. coli BL21 cells that were transformed with our constitutive mCerulean BioBrick. In previous fluorescent plate reader experiments , we have confirmed that these cells are able to fluoresce and that they can be excited at "
Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#FabProteinModel_-_-_TEXT.html," described above. For all cases of the Protein in water, a protocol derived from the “Lysozyme in Water” GROMACS tutorial (by J. Lemkul, Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Tech) and optimized for βHACdH was used. Briefly, a cubic cell of 2 nm in diameter with the protein centered was used and filled with the generic single point charge 216 (SPC216) water configuration[12]. The system was neutralized to a salt concentration of 150 mM by adding Na+ and Cl-. Energy Minimization (EM) was performed using the Steepest Descent Algorithm[13] with a tolerance of 1000 KJ mol-1 nm-1, to remove any steric clashes or inappropriate geometries.  In the simulation, the long-range electrostatic interactions were modeled using the Particle-Mesh- Eswald (PME) method [14][15] and the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm[16] to preserve chemical bond lengths. Temperature and pressure coupling were performed independently, using a modified Berendsen thermostat[17] at constant temperature of 300 K at a time constant of 0.1 ps and the Parinello-Rahman barostat algorithm[18] at a constant pressure of 1 bar, for a time constant of 2 ps and V-rescale, respectively.  The Molecular Dynamics simulations trajectories were analysed with the GROMACS analysis tools[19], to output structural molecular dynamics trajectories and PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Education-Use-Only, Version 1.3 Schrödinger, LLC) used to visualize and create both still structures and videos. All calculations of progression plots from the simulations were produced using the GROMACS analysis tools with output files viewed in the Microsoft Excel 2011.
Getting a working GROMACS simulation for βHACdH
To study the motions of the N- and C-Termini of βHACdH with molecular dynamics, we first had to get an optimized system preparation protocol, which we based on the “Lysozyme in Water” GROMACS tutorial by [20]. Firstly, we built a simulation box of 2nm around βHACdH, which was sufficient to satisfy the minimum image convention and the simulation cut-off schemes without adding excess solvent. βHACdH had to then be solvated within this box by a solvent configuration compatible with the solvent model applied to the protein, in this case the SPC216[12], which is compatible with"
