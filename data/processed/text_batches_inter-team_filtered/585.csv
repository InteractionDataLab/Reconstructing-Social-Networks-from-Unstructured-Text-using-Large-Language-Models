Tuebingen,2013,Team:Tuebingen#Notebook#Journal#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html,"1, Padh1-mig1, GAL-mig1, and GAL-rox1! Also, the ligation of Panb1 in pSB1C3 seemed to be successful.
Week 20
Another Panb1 PCR was successful! Thus we digested Panb1 with E/P and continued with a PCR-purification. Control restrictions of Padh1-mPR Xl-pTUM, mig1-pSB1C3, Panb1-pSB1C3, mOrange-pSB1C3 and RFP-pSB1C3 had mixed results. All parts that were ready at this point (Psuc2, Pfet3, Padh1, mPR Xl, mPR Dr, and mOrange) were prepared for 3A-Assembly by restriction digestion and eventually ligated in pTUM (mig1 and GAL (distribution-kit) were ligated in pSB1C3).
Week 19
After last weeks gelextractions we were able to ligate! We had Pfet3, Tadh1, mOrange (from distribution-kit), and mig1 ready for ligation in pSB1C3 and continued with transforming them. First gels of the resulting plasmid preparations confirmed that Pfet3 had finally positive results!
Week 18
This week, we mainly did gelextractions. We started the week off with gelextractions of Pfet3-pSB and mig1-pSB and continued with gelextractions of pSB E/P, pSB X/S, mig X/S, Pfet3 E/P, Panb1 E/P, and Tadh1 E/P. A very important step was our first 3A-Assembly of Padh1-mPR Xl in pTUM!
Week 17
We had some transformations going on and were able to pick Pfet3-pGEM, luc-pSB1C3, mPR Dr-pSB colonies. Therefore, we could continue with plasmid preparations of these parts. We also did preparative restrictions of mig1-pSB1C3, luc-pGEM, and luc-pSB1C3. Finally, we ligated mig1 in pSB and luc in pGEM, Psuc2 was ligated in pSB.
Week 16
Unfortunately, we found out that colony-PCRs do not work that well and result in wrong positives! In order to optimize our colony-PCR protocol (we had some issues with the amount of cells in the tube and the temperature) we made a gradient"
KULeuven,2008,Team:KULeuven#30 July 2008_-_-_TEXT.html," the ligation probably failed.
We punched out the DNA of the new memory and checked the concentration with the nanodrop. Despite the doubtful results we did try to electroporate these parts into Top10 cells.
In the evening we prepared some liquid cultures of the following parts: C0062 , R0062 , P1010 , R0011 , C0060 , I712022 , C0012 , B0015 and F1610 . They will be miniprepped and digested tomorrow.

General
Tomorrow, primers for checking the EnvZ::KmR mutation will be completed with the help of Sigrid. The Restriction Cut Sites seems not be in the same place as indicated in the Japanese paper.
Modeling
All the CellDesigner and Matlab models as the model pictures are updated. Everything is now ready for some extra simulations and a sensitivity analysis for the different models...
Wiki
We worked further on the detailed descriptions of the project. More attention will go to figures and easy reading.
New drop-down navigation bar has been posted, allowing subsubmenu's that toggle. Hacks have been added to conform with the most important browsers (IE, Mozilla, Safari). If any trouble occur, mail me (avdmeers).
Some bugs have been fixed in notebook.

The class as a whole was a rewarding experience for us. Not only did we reach out to people far beyond the scope of MIT to both explain and explore the field of synthetic biology, but we began to understand the possibilities and problems of synbio on a whole new dimension through teaching the concepts to others.
Safety
The safety of our students was a high priority. Every student in the lab section was trained by the MIT Environmental Health and Safety department in BL1 practices and Hazardous Waste Disposal. We (the instructors) cleaned and prepared the lab space every night before class and made sure all reagents and materials were available to the students in the morning. The Knight Lab was a safe place to perform our BL1 experiments. No risks were taken in our classroom. Our lectures were given in meeting rooms and presentation rooms throughout the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory building, well outside of the Knight Lab setting.
Lack of organization and sufficient space looked to pose a problem early on in the class. However, by splitting the students into two groups and dividing the class between two rooms, we were able to avoid crowding in the lab space and teach a successful class on synthetic biology and its scientific and social influence.

The mechanism of these promoters are different from each other. However, basically, mechanisms consist of: - micF, an antisense ncRNA targeting ompF RNA, main endogenous porin of Escherichia coli, participating in post-transcriptionally regulation of this outer membrane protein F(ompF). micF is also regarded as one of the promoter of soxRS-regulated gene.
SoxS, a transcriptional activator of oxidative stress genes in E. coli. SoxS in vitro binds the promoter of soxRS-regulated genes such as micF, sodA and recruits RNA polymerase to the promoters.
In accordance with relative effective response of antibiotics, we are determined to implement micF to sense the existence of sulfamethoxazole and sulfadimethoxine in water sample,
and SoxS to detect the concentration of tetracycline or oxytetracycline.
In the circuit, micF and SoxS won't directly reporter fluorescence signal, instead, information will deliver through quorum sensing for positive amplification. In antibiotic substance sensing module, LuxI will be expressed directly for Bacteria II processing.
Quorum Sensing Module
Using community with different compartments would further improve the signal amplification, as known, quorum sensing is a system for stimulation(some signaling molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcrpt certain genes) that is related to the bactieral concentration in the system. Many gene expression is naturally regualted by quorum sensing, which is also treated as social interation in bacterial community.
In some gram-negative bacteria, such as Vibro fischeri, biosynthesis of autoinducers is used for yield of bioluminescence through luciferase. The signaling molecule used by V. fischeri is an acylated homoserine lactone(AHL),called N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone, which can be engineered into E. coli. The signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthease enzyme and then secreted through the cell membrane to the extracelluar surroundings. When N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria, LuxR will recognize the existence of N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone with a threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL. Finally, target gene such as"

Overview
“Prevent is Better than Cure”
Indonesia is an agricultural country that most of their society works as farmer. One of commodity in Indonesia is tea plantation which is located in Malang (Brawijaya University takes place). Malang is resited at 440-667 (mdpl) altitude, one of the tourist destinations in East Java because of the potential of natural and climatic owned. Malang climate conditions during 2008 temperatures recorded ranging from 22.7 ° C to 25.1 ° C. While the maximum temperature reached 32.7 ° C and minimum temperature of 18.4 ° C. The average air humidity range 79% - 86%. With a maximum moisture content of 99% and a minimum at 40%. These conditions favor the development of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis).
Tea extract contain EGCG used as the most effective antioxidant to against cervical cancer. But, levels of EGCG (Epigallocathecin gallate) in tea is very slightly. So, we will increase the level of this EGCG compound using siRNA to knockdown gene non-EGCG with expectation it will produce high yield of antioxidant. The applications are for supplement or feminine hygiene.
Tea plant (Camelia sinensis) has catechin compounds that contains antioxidants.  Catechin family that most effective used as antioxidant is Epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG).  Based on research in vitro or in silico, EGCG is able to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells because stop over-expression between L1 HPV 16- EGFR (Epithel Growth Factor Receptor) bond but there are few of EGCG content in tea plant. Based on these problems, we would to over- expression EGCG by knockdown non-compound EGCG gene, so hopefully the content of EGCG on tea are more prominent"

IP and Open Source Technology | Letter to Representatives
Intellectual Property and Open Source Technology
We have explored the history and associated intellectual property (IP) issues that have surrounded zinc finger technology.
Because teams are trying to solve real-world problems, the vast majority of iGEM projects intersect with the IP landscape. Aside from its immediate relevance to our project, we argue that the story of zinc finger discovery, development, and commercialization presents a useful and enlightening case study of how IP affects the synthetic biology community.
Additionally, we wrote and sent a letter to multiple representatives regarding the conflict between IP and open source technology.
The History of IP and Open Source in Zinc Finger Technology
Discovered in 1985, zinc finger proteins have rapidly become a staple of gene therapy innovation. A cascade of research has transformed our understanding of the zinc finger domain from a natural transcription factor to a tool for highly specific genome alteration. As the zinc finger motif was domesticated and fused to DNA cleaving domains, its practical application through targeted gene alteration rose to the forefront of gene therapy research.
Seeking to harness zinc finger potential, researchers and entrepreneurs collaborated to form Sangamo Biosciences in 1995, which emerged as the sole commercial provider of the protein. Today, the Sangamo monopoly raises a variety difficult ethical and economic questions about intellectual property within the zinc finger field, and synthetic biology as a whole. As an open-source alternative to Sangamo’s proprietary system and commercial dominance, Keith Joung and others have published the OPEN system [5] of zinc finger creation. However, while the OPEN system and subsequent improvements are promising for massive zinc finger production, the methods are difficult and time-consuming to implement, and gaps remain in the list of available DNA binding targets.

Проект Greenhardtii
Земля - это система, находящаяся в постоянном равновесии, которое достигается благодаря нескольким циклам круговорота веществ. В частности, существует углеродный цикл, который главным образом состоит во взаимодействии фототрофных и гетеротрофных организмов. Первая из названных групп организмов потребляет углекислый газ, а вторая производит его. Но это равновесие нарушилось из-за сжигания ископаемых видов топлива и непрерывного сокращения площадей зеленых насаждений, что привело к накоплению CO2 в атмосфере. Растущая концентрация этого газа приводит к созданию глобального парникового эффекта, увеличивая количество тепла, улавливаемого атмосферой, и повышая температуру на всей планете на несколько градусов. Но эти несколько градусов означают значительные изменения в экосистемах и гидрогеологических условиях, вызывающие таяние ледников, повышение уровня моря, засухи, наводнения, аномальную жару, пожары, опустынивание и другие тяжелые последств"

By adding the RFC25 prefix without the Shine-Dalgarno sequence we hope to improve the utility of this RFP.
We visualised RFP using multiple methods to show that it was folding and expressing.
This plate shows our RFP under the control of the lac expression cassette from iGEM10_Washington (BBa_K314103).
When grown in 10 mL of LB + chloramphenicol and spun down, a pink pellet can be visualised.
To ensure the fluorescence of our RFP we aliquoted 200 µL of the crude cell lysate into a 96 well plate and visualised it under blue light transilluminator. As you can see, it fluoresces consistently in all three samples.
We wanted to test to see how long it would take to fully saturate an isostandard Whatman 54 paper chad with RFP. This graph shows that the chad is saturated almost immediately.
We tested the dissociation of this part on Whatman 54 using isostandard chads. This involved incubating the chads in the crude cell lysate for 10 minutes and then washing them with PBS for various periods time to test the binding affinity of this CBD. The results show a gradual loss of fluorescence indicating the RFP leaving the paper.
Design: There is an existing RFC25 compatible RFP (BBa_K1351021) in the registry from iGEM14_LMU-Munich which was the basis for our sequence. We then added the RFC25 prefix without the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.
CBDcipA (BBa_K1615111)
Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) mediate the binding of enzymes to cellulose1. CBDs are divided into over a dozen families based on their sequence homology 2. Family III of CBDs is divided into a, b and c with CBDCipA belonging to family III a; the clostridial scaffoldin CBDs3. CBDCipA was identified in Clostridium thermocellum and is capable of binding to crystalline cellulose in a reversible manner4. CBDCipA includes endogenous linker sequences at both the N and C-terminals which help to prevent the CBD from interfering with the folding of any other protein it may be fused to.

SYSU-China,2014,Team:SYSU-China#HumanPractice#Newsletter.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. The interview with the glorious team: SYSU-China in 2013
The previous honor in 2013 of SYSU-China is an exhilarating memory, and their experience is interesting and inspiring not only for us, but perhaps all teams. In the Newsletter No.5, XMU-China interviewed the two previous leader and wiki designer of SYSU-China in 2013, who took the team to the finalist and get 2nd Runner Up and best wiki.

</p1>
To some degree, there is a consensus in every team that team-construction is a one of the key points (even maybe most important) to achieve great success in iGEM. Accordingly, XMU-China Designed several questions for Mengyi Sun (see Fig-2), the previous captain, which focus on member selection, team difficulty, and work efficiency.
The Answer, not unexpected for us, is simple but clear: interest of science of synthetic biology and enthusiasm on experimental work lay the foundation of success. Based on such gist, we believe that the member selection (if there is a selection for your school) might first consider whether this person is willing to contribute to the project with interest and enthusiasm, rather than skill and knowledge background. If most members are intrinsically engaged in the project, other problems will not be critical.
To our great surprise, the interview also invited Yuchen Zhao (see Fig-2), another previous captain, who wrote an open letter for current SYSU-China in Newsletter No.5, additional memoir. The letter recalled the memories we went through, and we were still somehow moved deeply by her words, even though one year was past and the team was brand-new.
Additionally, XMU-China released the readme of one of our previous wiki designers, whose brilliant work got Best Wiki last year. They optimized cute-but-simple style and created a clear and attractive wiki, which significantly helped us explicit our work. We hope this self"

Knockouts of germination genes
We incubated our mutant strains in Difco sporulation media (DSM) shaking at 37°C for 18-24 hours to induce sporulation. We heated 1 mL of each of the DSM cultures at 80°C for one hour to kill vegetative cells, and used 1 mL at room temperature (allowing vegetative cells to survive). From here, we quantified the cells and spores per mL of each culture using a Neubauer cell counting chamber. Then on LB-agar, we plated different dilutions of the cultures, with heated and unheated cultures on separate plates. The purpose of plating both heated and unheated cultures was to demonstrate the viability of the unheated vegetative cells in each culture. This makes evident that the lack of colonies on heated plates is not due to the inability of the strain's vegetative cells to grow, but from the inability of spores to germinate into vegetative cells capable of growing. For all germination mutants, vegetative cells were able to grow and form colonies. Plates were incubated at 37°C for at least 24 hours. We then quantified the colonies on each plate, and used this to check for cell growth and calculate the spore germination rate for each mutant strain. For details on this germination assay, see Protocols . The germination assays were carried out several times, and yielded similar results each time. The results are shown in Fig. 1.

Final Gel Image
Redigest M2-9 and M1-9 using different sequence verified plasmids than yesterday.
Digest using same conditions, enzymes
Run on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Redone Final Gel image of ICA constructs. The incomplete digestion as well as the smear on M1-9 and M2-9 respectively are still present.
The continued presence of the strange digestion patterns leads me to believe that this may be a problem that originates in the sequence of these plasmids. The possibility of two plasmid species is probably ruled out by clean sequencing reads.
If we desire, we may repeat this image using XbaI and PstI to digest.
Protein Purification
Grew 10 mL starter cultures for the 5 12-mers, which include the hybrid constructs.
Inoculated M1-12(T7), M1/2[1:2]-12(T7), and M2-12(T7) into 1 L cultures.
[2:1] and [1:1] did not grow very well, possibly due to age of plates.

Heidelberg,2015,Team:Heidelberg#Sandbox_-_-_TEXT.html,"hacking and the implications of it on society, the scientific community and the communication between the two entities. Question were asked about ethical problems and implications of in vivo and in vitro technologies, but also about dreams and wishes of the scientists regarding future developments in this field. The question iGEM team Cambridge nicely summarizes the last part of the discussion: “How can synthetic biologists better communicate their research to the public?” This includes the role of politicians and law makers, as well as the responsibility of everyone who is involved in research to put a focus on the outreach and the interaction, not only with the scientific community, but also with the broader public.
So far, many iGEM teams have organized discussion evenings and invited people from the broad society to join an interdisciplinary evening. This approach is great and helps a lot to improve the communication between scientists and the public. Nonetheless, there are still barriers to overcome:
The interested population of one city is not representing the entire society. Hence, we decided to provide the opportunity to join us online via live stream. This should not be limited to watching the discussion passively, that is why everyone could ask questions via twitter by #askigemheidelberg. These questions were then shown in the discussion, so that our invited guests could reply or reflect on them.
The lingua franca in research is English, however not everybody is capable of speaking English fluently. Therefore, we deliberately chose German as the language the discussion was held in. This way, everyone who was interested had the possibility to follow. In order to keep the event international and also understandable for those who watched online, we translated the event simultaneously to English.

To achieve that tough goal, we need to not only spend a ton of time in the lab but also do something relative to the society who will be our real beneficiary. Therefore, we took some actions.
Yakult
    At Yakult, we understand the great benefits of probiotics for human health. Yakult's live probiotics have strong acid resistance. Because of company secrets, we can't know how its acid resistance was improved. It is known that it is screened from many strains, which gave us some inspiration.
Meiji
    First, we watched the propaganda film of Meiji and learned about the company's products, market and corporate culture. Then, we visited the company's workshop under the guidance of the staff. The streamlined production made us feel the advanced technology of the company. After discussion with the marketing staff, we learned that Lactococcus lactis has a large share of the probiotic market.
Biogrowing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co. Ltd
    Guided by the head of the R&D department, we visited the company's laboratories, learning a lot about some high-tech equipment. In the conference room of the R&D department, we conducted a far-reaching discussion with the person in charge. He told us the application regulations and policies of genetically engineered bacteria, which made us realize that genetically engineered bacteria cannot be eaten directly, which caused substantial changes in the direction of our project. We no longer stuck to the probiotics direction and try to find new application directions.
Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Limited by Share Ltd
    Firstly we went to Xinhua pharmaceutical company. At this company, we learned that most of their current drugs are still relatively common drugs, and they are also used in the traditional way of taking drugs. However, some drugs need to be prepared in the form of coating, and need to control the time and dosage, which is not very convenient. Also, the granules are relatively large. We have initially explored the possible application of our project in pharmacy, such as making a live vaccine, etc. They gave affirmation, especially in the safety, and also proposed some problems, which is also the problem we need to solve in the future.
Shandong Vland Biotechnology Co. Ltd
    Later, we went to Vland biotech company to discuss the problem of frozen stress in the process of microbial fermentation and preservation and transportation. Although protective agents can be added to reduce the harm of acid stress and frozen stress, the advantages of Lact"

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," colonies in LB and RM medium were prepared and plasmid preparations were performed. The plasmid from the RM medium could be digested with SmaI, but the gel showed only an empty vector.
MutB construct:
The MutB fragments were amplified with the improved primers by PCR and the PCR products were purified and digested with BamHI. The ligation afterwards was successful and a gel extraction was performed.
Competent cells:
New electro competent cells for E. coli DH5α were prepared.
Week 2: LK, GH, AB, TK, ME
MutB construct:
We tried to amplify the ligated MutB, but the amplification did not work. Therefore, the ligation was repeated. PCR proved the successful ligation. MutB was then amplified by PCR and purified by gel extraction.
GlmS construct:
GlmS was transformed into TOP10 and E. coli LMG194 cells. The TOP10 cells could afterwards be grown in RM medium for the following expression study which was done according to the pBAD202 D-TOPO manual. Additionally, the GlmS construct was modified excluding the thioredoxin sequence (GlmS w/o Thio) and amplified by PCR.
BtuF construct:
The transformation of TOP10 with BtuF was unsuccessful and had to be repeated. After DNA preparation, the product was digested with SmaI.
Test transformation:
The newly prepared E. coli DH5α cells were checked for electro competence and the preparation of the kanamycin vector PLP03 worked.
E. coli LMG194:
Electro competent cells of E. coli LMG194 were prepared and tested by transformation with kanamycin vector.

I'm Nick, and I'm an engineer that enjoys working out and disguising myself as a large bag of popcorn.
Robert Mayall
I'm Robert, a fourth year student studying Biomedical Science at the University of Calgary. I like long walks on the beach and genetically modifying bacteria to do my bidding. My main focus in our iGEM project is FRED, and I get to do a lot of the electrochemistry. This is my second year in iGEM and I still love it.
Peter Qi
I am a fourth year Bachelor of Health Sciences student (biomedical sciences stream). Before iGEM, my research interests are in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. I was part of the Calgary iGEM team last year. I am super excited to be part of the iGEM project this year again. I am working towards finding genetic elements that acts as a specific and sensitive sensor for the environmental toxin, naphthenic acids. In my spare time, I like to play basketball, the clarinet, or watch movies.

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," tend to set up four conditions for the E.coli to work by paring the light and the temperature controls. Distinguished by whether red light exists or not, the pathway is divided into two parts, the Red Light Induced Circuit and the Dark Response Circuit.  We use four different fluorescent proteins as reporter genes to test that whether the switch of our pathway is successful.
Red Light Induced Circuit
At 25 °C and under red light, Pred is activated for translation proceeding. However, ribosomes can only bind to the normal RBS, as 37 °C RBS forms a hairpin structure, forestalling ribosomes from binding. The only gene downstream of the normal RBS is RFP, so only RFP would be expressed.
On the other hand, with red light, 37 °C RBS unfolds at 37 °C , resulting in the expression of both LuxR and GFP. LuxR would bind with AHL to form a complex that activates Plux. The activation of Plux produces sRNA that binds to the normal RBS on mRNA level, blocking it from ribosomes. As a result, RFP would not be expressed and only GFP remains at 37 °C.
Without red light, Pred would not be activated, and therefore, the red light induced circuit is completely shut down in the dark.
Dark Response Circuit
Pred activates in the presence of red light, producing tetR that represses Ptet. In other words, the dark induced part is inactive in the exposure to red light and active without red light. At 25 °C in the dark, only normal RBS functions to express YFP while 37 °C RBS remains as a hairpin structure.
At 37 °C, however, 37 °C RBS unfolds to express LuxR and BFP. Just like the mechanism employed in the light induced part, LuxR forms a complex with AHL to activate Plux that produces the sRNA to block normal RBS. This way, the YFP downstream of rRBS cannot be expressed and BFP is expressed at 37 °C.
Summary
This is the pathway summary of the E.colightuner. There is one kind of fluorescent protein in each condition we set. It means that we can control four gene expressions by using the E.colightuner. The only thing we have to do is changing the different environmental conditions for specifically expression.

After a year of hard working, we have manage to accomplish our project modeling, assembling our E.colightuner as well as tissue culturing. The most significant event is we've"

- KP We started today with each group presenting their research and game plan for the coming weeks/months. It seems like we all know, or at least have a direction, to our next plan of action. Our E. coli turned out well and we were able to single out a colony in order to prepare overnight. After further research, it is clear that we will not be able to use T phages in our E. coli as a means to destroy cholera biofilm. We have all done more research on lambda, and it appears to be our best lysogenic phage choice. It is well studied and the mechanism for turning on the lytic cycle is very well understood.

- KK Not this Friday, but next Friday, we will have our Final Presentations. They will be done by sub-group; my sub-group is the cholera-phage approach. As part of the project, I need to attend a science seminar. Tomorrow I’ll attend the seminar by John Roth on something to do with molecular biology, then write a one-paragraph summary of HOW the presentation was done, the showsmanship of the presentation. On the day of our presentation we need to explain the background of what we have done, then go into our methods and results, then give our conclusions. Today we followed the mini-prep/Alkaline lysis procedure to purify plasmids from our overnight samples. We followed the step-by step protocol given in the kit we used. We chose to use 1 mL of our E.Coli overnight solution in our samples ... and at the end, our plasmid concentrations were low (24 ng/microL and 16ng/microL, respectively). We used the spectrophotometer in Dr. Grose’s lab to determine the concentrations of our plasmids. So, in the future, we ought to a) include Dr. Grose as we follow the protocol to ensure we are doing things correctly, and b) probably use more of the E.Coli sample to get more plasmids and hopefully a higher concentration.
- KP April Today we purified the plasmids and got them ready to be sequenced. We used Dr. Grose’s spectrophotometer. We learned how to analyze the graph in order to know if we just have DNA or if there is something else in our mixture after the purification process. The bump of our graph was right over 260"
Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack_-_-_TEXT.html,"Found primers to amplify pACYC184. Ordered these and the ones for pBR322. The reverse promoter was the same for both pACYC184 and pBR322.
Two 0.8% agarose gels were made.
Checked transformations from yesterday: 4 colonies grew on the UV+pACYC184 on the low concentration chlor plates (50ug/mL) and 2 colonies grew on the UV+pACYC184 on the high concentration chlor plates (150ug/mL). These 6 colonies were PCR amplified diluting them with 200uL of water, and then taking 20uL out from here and combining that with 2.5uL of the forward and reverse promoters for the inputs. These were PCR amplified with two controls, DH5alpha with input promoters, and UV with input promoters. We also PCR amplified some HSP and GFP just to get more g-blocks.  The 6 PCR products along with the two controls were run on a gel. It appeared that H2 (The second colony from the high concentration chlor plates) had a faint band. Since only 1uL of each was used for the gel, it was repeated for the 6 PCR products, without controls, using 5uL each. Again, H2 had a band. YAY!  More 10X primers were made from the 100X stock. 10uL of primer was added to the existing 10X epindorf along with 90uL of water.  The UV, HSP and GFP from today's PCR and Monday's PCR were purified. However, we maybe mixed up some UV and HSP so after purification, 2uL of each of these purified samples were run on a gel to see if there are two bands that appear in either one. There weren't!!!! YAY!  We NanoDropped the three PCR'ed g-blocks, after there were purified. The concentrations were UV: 105.2ng/uL, HSP: 64.1ng/uL, and GFP: 77.6ng/uL.  We inoculated our GFP+pBR322 (that the gel showed it actually had the insert inside of it) and left it to grow overnight. We inoculated at 5:30PM.  The UV+pACYC184 that the gel showed actually had the insert in it was restreaked and left to incubate and grow overnight. Incubated around 5PM.  Devora made more LB media.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Community_-_-_TEXT.html," we created a suite of small, automated software tools for the purpose.
We hope that the whole iGEM community will embrace the CollabSeeker, and that in the years to come it will become a mundane part of the project that everyone will use in a similar manner as Aalto-Helsinki’s BioBrick and Team Seekers.
How to use the CollabSeeker
The CollabSeeker search engine can be used without logging in. However, every team has a team page which can be edited only by the team in question, and this requires login. The iGEM teams are able to log in using Facebook, Twitter or login credentials provided by the Aalto-Helsinki team.
The teams are able to edit their own pages by logging in with Facebook, Twitter or login details provided by Aalto-Helsinki. The CollabSeeker can also be used without logging in.
The team descriptions and links to Facebook and Twitter accounts have been automatically uploaded on every team’s team page. The teams are able to modify their project descriptions, specify their collaboration desires and add contact information.
Every team has a team page, which can be edited by the team in question. All the team descriptions are already found on the team pages, so it’s only for the team to specify their collaboration details and add collaboration categories, so that the team will be easily found by other teams. We highly recommend the teams to add contact information to their team profile e.g. email (Facebook and Twitter accounts are already linked), to make the contacting process easier.
To easily find collaboration partners we added the opportunity to add collaboration categories to the team pages. All the collaboration categories can be found on the front page of the CollabSeeker.
Searching for teams based on their team names and team description is possible by using the search bar. The user has also the option to browse through all the teams available on CollabSeeker.
The search bar can be used to search for teams based on their team name or team description.
How we did it
In order to implement more advanced functionality in the CollabSeeker, we rewrote the engine entirely in Java using the Spring MVC framework and the Thymeleaf templating engine. In the process, the old html templates had to be heavily modified as well, so even though we preserved the looks of last year’s version, under the hood everything has changed.
The search engine is implemented using the popular Apache Lucene search framework, which was chosen due to it’s support of boolean search operators. In addition, we implemented both Facebook and Twitter login using Spring Social. However, our implementation of Facebook"

Discard supernatant. 3) Resuspend cells in 500 uL of glycerol, and place on ice. Pipet 50 uL of cells into a microcentrifuge tube with 5 uL of plasmid. Pipet the solution into a silver-plated cuvette that has been sitting on ice. 4) Insert the cuvette into the electroporator and shock. 5) Return cells to ice for a few seconds.  Draw up cells with 1 mL LB and pipet into a clean 2mL tube. 6) Incubate cells at 37°C for 30 minutes. 7) Plate 100-200 uL cells
To determine if the procedure itself interferes with lambda, we are going to take samples at each stage of the procedure – after resuspending in glycerol, after shocking, and after incubating – and do a H202 top agar assay to see compare plaques.

Shocking the cells significantly reduces the number of plaques we see compared to pre-shock cells suspended in glycerol! See the photo comparison of top agar plates before and after shocking.  I give that an ambivalent “great.”  It’s great that we’ve learned that bit of information; not-so-great that, well, how are we going to get a plasmid in there? We’re going to redo the experiment to confirm our results.
Even if we do manage to transform pIG87 into a cell that is plaque-susceptible, we don’t know if overexpressing CRO will cause lysis.  For that reason, Dr. Grose thinks it is wise for us to prepare a plasmid that overexpresses a gene known to cause lysis.  We know the E.Coli SOS pathway triggers phage lysis, so we are going to clone the RecA protein in the same position CRO is in, and then overexpress that protein … supposing that we figure out HOW to get a plasmid into the cell.  If we can’t do that, cloning RecA is"

Collaboration
Collaboration is a most beautiful part in iGEM competition, and this year we put great efforts into promoting collaboration in the iGEM community. We've been staying in very good relationship with iGEM teams in Wuhan, and have a nice relationship with iGEM teams in other country.
Meetup
Meetup this year is very interesting. It allows us the opportunity of in-depth talking with other iGEM teams. This year we held The Central China iGEMers' Conference during August 23rd -24th which was a success beyond our expectation. Oh, what an experience! We also attended the Meetup held by NCTU Formosa.
Humanities
Science lives in the real world of humans. As a rising field, synthetic biology might need to explore its relationship to other disciplines. Here are some ""other"" implications of synthetic biology in relation to our project. Enjoy!
Social Sciences
When the proud products of genetic engineers meet the market, the story is no longer a fairytale. On the one hand, interactions of different stakeholders become a decision game that's out of the reach of scientist; on the other hand, what about the intellectual rights if the bacteria suddenly begin making innovations by itself?
Pubic Outreach
We held a activity called Future scientists aimed at kids aged 10-15 years old, we have taught them what is DNA, what is iGEM, even how to extract the DNA from plant. Also we have launched weekly assembly called iGEM Talkx, it's open to every single student and we talk everything about biology!

EVENTS RELATED TO SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Entering the international arena is being held in order to draw attention of entrepreneurs and specialized investors. That's why the Colombian government is creating new instruments to support bioentrepreneurs and to finance research projects and more ambitious development. So far, has been great success: Bogotá has been chosen for the first edition of the international fair BIOLATAM, which met in December 2013, companies and investors around the world who are already eyeing Colombia (Garmendia, 2014). The city has also been the headquarters of Latin America iGEM Jamboree in 2012 where several teams took part providing to the academic community the ability to share knowledge about genetic engineering and the development of the iGEM competition.

N-terminal linker + double CBD
Double cellulose binding domain (dCBD) using two cellulose binding domains from Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolases, with an N-terminal linker and internal linker sequence between the two domains which are derived from the endogenous cellobiohydrolase linker sequence. This part is in RFC(25) Freiberg fusion format to allow for easy use in protein fusions. dCBD binding affinity for cellulose was characterised using sfGFP fusions.
BBa_K1321339
CBDcenA + Linker
Cellulose binding domain (CBD) of Endoglucanase A (cenA) from Cellulomonas fimi with an endogenous C-terminal linker. The part is in Freiburg format (RFC 25) for ease of use in protein fusions.
BBa_K1321014
CBDcipA with N and C-terminal linker
This CBD is from the Cellulosomal -scaffolding protein A (cipA) of Clostridium thermocellum including the endogenous linker sequences at the N and C-terminus. It is in RFC25 format to allow for easy use in protein fusions. At present the cloning for these constructs is still in progress to correct an illegal EcoRI site which was identified in the parts with this CBD. This can be achieved with a silent mutation via site-directed mutagenesis and we aim to send these parts to the registry once this is complete.

Mona is a final year Biochemistry and Cell biology student who joined the HKUST-Rice iGEM Team last year. As an advisor this year, she was involved in every tutorial and training offered to new comers just to ensure we all could gain a correct and thorough understanding of Synthetic Biology. She must be the best “lecturer” in that she always teaches you from the very basics. When we were presenting our weekly progress report, she could always raise thought-provoking questions which directly address the crux of the problem we encountered. One thing to note is that we are all very much impressed by how she aces academically, as there have been rumours of her getting A+ in exams simply by skimming through the textbook!!

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"pressure.
Our lab work also includes using UV light to trigger our sensor. UV light is a known carcinogen and can cause skin irritation, therefore special precautions are needed. In general we are using the UV lamp in a darkhood, which poses no hazards as no UV light can escape. While handling a portable UV lamp, we use special glasses and avoid any exposure to the skin.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public and Environmental quality if released by design or accident?
Though we pay attention to keep our system isolated from the external environment, there is always the possibility of modified organisms leaking by accident. Therefore a (horizontal) transfer of genetic material between our bacteria and other bacteria in the wild is possible. Instead of causing a risk to health of the general public, our device aims for protecting the skin and prevent damage from UV radiation. Testing is needed to guarantee the safety of our device before it is used to this purpose.
Risks to security through malicious misuses by individuals, groups or states?
Our system is designed to sense UV light and produce a fluorescent protein or a pigment  as output. We do not see a realistic way to use this system to cause harm. With a malicious intent, it is nonetheless possible to switch the reporter to a more dangerous gene.
Question II
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, our new BioBrick parts do not raise any safety issues apart from the fact that the switch  needs UV light to be activated. Warnings will be put in the Registry for people that will use our part. We managed the UV light safety issues as described above.
Questions III
Does your university have a Biosafety Committee or equivalent?
Our lab follows the general- and bio-safety guidelines provided by the Safety, Security, Health and Environmental Protection (SSHE) unit of ETH Zurich ( http://www.sicherheit.ethz.ch/index_EN ). For an S1 lab two relevant documents are the Safety and Waste Disposal Manual ( http://www.sicherheit.ethz.ch/docs/health_docs/safety_manual_en.pdf ) and the Biosafety-Concept ( http://www.sicherheit.ethz.ch/docs/concepts_safety_at_work_hygiene/Biosicherheitskonzept ).
Have you consulted with your Institutional Biosafety Committee regarding your project?
We are not working with any organisms or parts which would require containment arrangements above BSL1.

Results show the aptamer does have response to theophylline and it would be safe for us to utilize and improve.
Through Fig9 and Fig11 we find that when theophylline concentration scale is 0-1mM (especially 0-0.5mM); the response of fluorescence protein to theophylline is more significant with bigger slope. So we decided to carry out our alloscaffolds’ characterizations with theophylline concentration scale 0-1mM.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Biofilms: Growing New Biofilms and Control Testing with Different Antibiotics
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Ronja Kothe, Jonathan Kwan, Anileen Pageni, Aum Patel, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: New biofilms were created so that testing of various sorts could be continued. To make sure the RFP biofilms that have been recultured in the past are actually from the plates, different antibiotics were used to reculture the biofilms. If RFP persisted in the different types of antibiotic we can ensure that the recultures are not our cultures –and therefore no contamination.
Procedure: New Biofilms
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µL of RFP, and 21 µL of KAN was pipetted into it. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then put in the incubator for 24 hours at 37 ˚C.
Procedure: Reculturing Biofilms

In this case, error function (Equation 2) was used to describe the non-steady chemoattractant distribution. The simulation of chemotaxis of 100 bacteria placed 6cm away from the 5mM malate is shown in the movie below.
2.2. Chemotaxis of bacteria population in Soil
Malate is used as the chemoattractant in our project, the malate is constantly secreted in the root tip, and the concentration is 0.3mM[9]. In this case, the malate source is always replenished due to continuous secretion from the root tip, the distribution pattern can be considered as steady (i.e. independent of time), and steady state Keler-Segel model was used to demonstrate this distribution (Equation 3 and Equation 5). The distribution was displayed in Figure 7.  And Figure 8 shows the position of lower threshold where the bacteria start to response to malate and the saturation level where the chemoreceptors start to loss efficiency.  Finally, the animation of bacterial chemotaxis in steady chemoattractant distribution is demonstrated in video below.

Figure 8: Malate distribution. Red: malate concentration = 10-8mol/L,Blue: malate concentration = 10-6mol/L

This protein and its mutants are often used by synthetic biologists “as control elements to regulate gene expression”   due to their detailed characterisation, but also because of the limited number of proteins available for use in the repressor-TF class.
We want to enhance the diversity of the repressor-TF class by engineering new transcription factors that can bind unique promoter sequences different from the wild-type DNA binding site normally associated with TetR. Our proposed research plan for this summer is as follows:
1) introduce mutations in the TetR sequence and its binding site
2) identify promising TF-binding site pairs (using in vivo and in vitro techniques)
3) conduct multiple rounds of selection to improve affinity and specificity to optimize new pairs of repressor-TFs.

In the context of pricing, we would like to highlight two key quotes from our interviews:
CTO of Company A: ""In the pharmaceutical industry, you set the price by yourself. If your product serves the need of a customer, he pays more than enough to use your product. We sell our products to different customers with a price range of over almost € 50,000. One advice: Just don't go too low with your price!""
Head of Research of company C: ""A five-digit price is more than acceptable for your product.""
6. Business Model
Based on the business model canvas in appendix 5 we split our business model into seven parts:
Fig. 6: The business model is based on selling our customized 3D cell cultures to the pharmaceutical industry.
Key Activities. We sell 96-well plates with individualized 3D cell structures to pharmaceutical companies for drug testing. Our USP bases on the statement that our 3D-printed cell structures are the first feasible and reliable 3D models for drug testing that greatly improve the viability of in-vitro tests before animal tests (Appendix 6: Positioning Statement). The models will consist of liver cells. The great majority of all drugs is first processed in the liver, which is why toxicology tests are usually performed first on liver cells. Our hypothesis that this kind of cells promises the greatest market potential for us was confirmed in the interview with company B. We plan on offering one standardized version with liver cells and an excellent quality that can be individualized completely by the customer to enable tests for certain diseases with genetically engineered cell lines.
Customer Segment. Our primary customer segment are pharmaceutical companies and service providers conducting pre-animal drug testing. Their great advantage for us as customers is the high willingness to pay and the high demand they have for testing material. Research institutes may be a possible additional customer segment at a later point. Our product is localized in the pharmaceutical industry and we are in the B2B market. We produce the 3D structures according to the customer’s wishes and prepare them for the tests using the standardized 96-well plates. As visualized in Appendix below we buy 3D printers, the medium for the cells, the plates and the prepared cell cultures from suppliers. In the beginning there will be a high investment for the 3D printers. We considered this investment in our calculation (Appendix 7).
Key Ressources. We produce our models in a rented laboratory and need employees to operate the "

Help from Dr. Haoqian Zhang
As we had not made final decision on our project, we discussed with Doctor Zhang about it on 2nd April.
Personal profile:
Dr. Zhang received his Ph.D. in Integrated Life Sciences (Biology) at Peking University in 2017 and B.A. in Biological Sciences at Peking University in 2012. He presently serves as the chief technology officer (CTO) of Bluepha Co., Ltd., a pioneering synthetic biology startup focused on organism engineering for the production of biopolymer polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and commercialization of SynBio technologies. He has over 14 peer-reviewed publications. He has also instructed many iGEM teams including Team Peking over the past nine years and has won many prizes in the iGEM competition.
Firstly, Dr. Zhang denied Alexln 2 Ceratinase 3 Mitochondria because of the obstacles we cannot overcome. Then he introduced us the current situation in the field and the problems that urgently need to be solved.He also shared his own practical experience with us. What’s more, he offered us  biological database resources and some of contacts when knowing our financial difficulties and resources needs. At last, Dr. Zhang gave us some comprehensive opinions on team management and social skills with teams and various people.
In the second conversation, Dr. Zhang introduced his experience and standards of iGEM item by item, and also provided opinions related to our experimental design. He specially pointed out that we lacked a video that could systematically introduce laboratory biosafety level.
After making the final decision on Melanoma, we communicated with Dr Zhang and simply introduced our theory and experiments to him. He raised some valuable questions on various aspects, such as how certain we are to ensure that knocking BRAF can cure Melanoma. What’s more, if we are going to manufacture medication that can be practically used, how will we transport it. He also offered us advice on how to prepare"
Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," many hydrolases is the specific recognition of their substrates. A cell can produce more than one hydrolase by independent stimuli and those hydrolases can target and cleave their substrates in solution. Many electroactive compounds (analytes) have different oxidation potentials and conveniently can be bound to substrates of the hydrolases. Therefore, different electroactive substrate-bound compounds could be freed from their substrate by the hydrolase that can recognize them specifically, to elicit independent responses that could be observed electrochemically. Analogous to this is the ability to simultaneously observe independently labelled blue, green and red fluorescent particles in a cell.
Figure 5: Developing a Multiplexing Electrochemical Sensor
CPR, PDP, and PNP were used for analytes. Since we were able to confirm that they could be independently detected (Figure 6, left graph), we went on to observe whether hydrolases from living cells could cleave substrate-bound versions of these compounds. The hydrolase was put into standardized plasmid DNA expression systems in laboratory Escherichia coli, under control of an inducible promoter for testing. Other hydrolases were endogenously expressed in the strains of Escherichia coli used for these experiments.  Peaks in the graphs represent the appearance of the analytes, using the technique cyclic voltammetry. The graphs in Figure 5 (middle and right), demonstrate that they could cleave their respective substrates to produce detectable analytes. With enzymes capable of cleaving the substrate to release analytes with independently observable peaks, we have produced a system with the potential to multiplex output signals.
Figure 6: Enzymatic production of electro-active compounds in live cells.  The oxidation/reduction peaks of the analytes PDP, CPR and PNP are discernible from each other such that they can be observed independently using cyclic voltammetry (left).  Cells expressing endogenous  hydrolases were exposed to their substrates PDPG and PNPG respectively for the indicated times (middle). Oxidation peaks could be observed corresponding to the where PDP and PNP would be expected. Similarly, cells expressing endogenous hydrolases were exposed to their substrates CPRG and PDPG (right) Oxidation peaks could be observed corresponding to the where CPR and PDP would be expected.

3) Add 1 - 2 µL of the re-suspended DNA to the 2ml tube. Pipet up and down a few times, gently. Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice.
4) Add 1 µL of the RFP Control to your control transformation.
5) Close tubes and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
6) Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ºC for 60 seconds.
7) Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
8) Add 600 μL of LB media (make sure that the broth does not contain antibiotics and is not contaminated) to each transformation
9) Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 45min while the tubes are rotating or shaking. 
10) Label a petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 100 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This ensures that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
11) For the control, label one petri dishes with LB agar (AMP). Plate 100 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
12) Incubate the plates at 37ºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
13) You can pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture and  miniprep .
Strain Reservation:
In the clean bench, using Micro pipette tip pick a single colony and put it into a LB liquid medium. Put into shaking table 10-12 h. In a clean centrifuge tube, add 200uL bacterium liquid and 300uL glycerin, then put into -20℃ refrigerator.

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," a lined hole in the ground. The operation costs the government about £1.5m  a year to run and the lime itself has to be ferried from Derbyshire, making the whole affair unsustainable economically and ecologically. This could be balanced out by attempts to retrieve and sell the metals, although this is not being attempted.
Where we come in
As members of the community in Devon and the South West we thought it was important to solve such a disastrous local issue. That is why we decided to run a synthetic biology project that would target remediation of harmful waters spreading from the Consolidation Mine Site. Half the team made a trip to an old mine site to see first hand the effects of the contamination and to analyse the water composition .
Having previously looked at biofilms and bacterial virulence mechanisms as an area of interest, we discovered the potential power of Type I pili in E. coli and saw that Harvard's 2015 iGEM team could become a solid basis for our research as they investigated the use of Histag and a metal binding domain (MBD) in the pilin of fim H to bind to nickel beads and stainless steel. Our aim from then was to fuse metal binding domains with the terminal proteins of pili and to house the modified bacteria in a robust and responsible filtration unit .
What are pili?
Pili are small, hair-like protein structures on the surface of bacterial cells, that are used for cell-cell signalling and biofilm formation. Their most significant ability is mannose-binding. This is integral to the mechanism of the infection of the human urinary tract by E. coli. We have focused on type I pili, which are present in some gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and coded for by the fim operon. The type I pili are a complex of a number of Fim proteins, some of which make up the structural body of the projection, others are integral to the the chaperone-usher pathway, while the terminal FimH protein is responsible for binding to mannose. Our approach is to repurpose this protein for our own benefit - to bind metals.

Implementation and responsible approach

To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help from"

Innovation in Measurement
The DIHM Analysis Technique
We have developed a digital inline holographic microscope and related software that can be used in conjunction to analyse the shapes, sizes and growth rate of microorganisms. We also speculate that, with some improvement, the same hardware and software could be used to observe and quantify the motility of cells.
On our Results page, we have provided evidence to show the validity of our technique with respect to shape , size and cell-count measurements. As can be seen therein, we have been able to measure the features and density of cells in mono-cultures and samples containing more than one species. We therefore propose that the use of digital inline holographic microscopy is suited to characterising the effects of Parts which influence (or are expected to influence) the growth rate or structure of microorganisms.
As an example of growth rate related characterisation, consider the characterisation of the registered Part BBa_K1893016 (iGEM Imperial College 2016), which inhibits the growth of E. coli. This characterisation could have been performed by DIHM analysis. A parallel can be drawn to the optical density measurements that Imperial College used during their characterisation, since the growth rate would be calculated through repeated cell-counting via our technique. Moreover, along with being able to calculate the growth rate, the DIHM analysis allows for individual cells to be observed. It is plausible that other characteristic effects of BBa_K1893016 could be found by observing the behaviour of the individual cells.
For another example, consider a Part that alters pili production, such as BBa_K1850006 (iGEM Harvard BioDesign 2016). This has been shown by Harvard BioDesign to affect agglutination of yeast. It would be straightforward to observe this under our DIHM since the clumps of cells that are formed during agglutination are likely to be orders of magnitude larger than individual cells - a difference in size that we have shown it is certainly possible to observe with our hardware and software. It is, therefore,"

As part of our discussion with the students, we were able to emphasise how difficult bTB eradication has been within the South West, and what we, as undergraduate students, are doing to tackle real world issues. These sessions were valuable for us in terms of outreach as the students were highly receptive and inquisitive towards the work we are doing.

Integration and Design
Risk Assessment
Our project had a number of important factors that had to be considered in terms of risk. Firstly we designed a test that is meant to be used in the field by vets on a day to day basis. Clearly this poses concern for the containment of any genetically modified organism in our test. However, as our test is planning to be cell free it removes the issue of organism containment. Phil Leighton explained to us the process of blood sampling a cow and also showed us a current standard blood tube. We decided to contain our test within the current blood collection tubes that are used universally in veterinary practice, removing the need for specialist training to use our test. Our RNA based test has a number of factors that also reduce risk.
Our test would use either a blood sample or dairy sample from each individual cow to test for bTB. Blood samples are taken from the base of a tail. Phil and Dick explained how cows are particularly anxious of people approaching and feeling their neck area, yet are much more comfortable with blood being taken from the tail. As most bTB tests are done in a crush (a safe way to contain the animal), they were unanimous in agreeing our test offers a safer alternative to the current Tuberculin skin test. Also, if our test could work with milk as a sample, risk of injury to the vet during sample collection is completely minimised due to the highly automated milking process that is seen across the UK Dairy Industry.
Feasibility Assessment
Due to the large scale use of our test, calculating a cost was important. Cell free kits are currently expensive"

It was concluded that MazF should be induced under the condition that the arabinose concentration is 0.02% so that MazF functions as a toxin and GFP fluoresces sufficiently in mazEF system assay.

Fig.1-3-1-1 Relative value of Turbidity, Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) of GFP and RFU of GFP / Turbidity of medium where E. coli was cultured vs concentration of arabinose. E. coli A and E. coli B were cultured in the presence of indicated amounts of arabinose, and turbidity (upper graph), RFU of GFP (middle graph), and RFU / turbidity (lower graph) were measured. Also, the same cells were cultured in the absence of arabinose, and measurements were performed similarly as above. The ratio of the former values to the latter values were calculated.
1-3-2. mazEF System Assay
Since MazE resuscitates E. coli after MazF expression inhibits cell growth and translation, MazF inhibits cell growth and translation after MazE expression, it was suggested that using mazEF system can regulate cell growth and translation.

Conclusion
To sum up, the result of this InterLab Study is quite satisfying. All the related replicates shared the similar curve（posted in the previous section）and we were able to figure out that the number of each colony was positively related to the corresponding absorbance. So we roughly concluded that it is possible to simplify the original process with calculated formula（the transition from Absorbance to colony amount）. We are honored to participate in this session of InterLab. We hope that our work could help advance the development of engineering biology.

Gold
We helped AUC-Turkey High School Team by mentoring and training them in their project including experiments, human practice and designing their parts.
We worked to evolve a new approach to scientific research and reasoning called SynPhilo. Science cannot only remain in the boundaries of quantified results but can form a bridge with Philosophical thinking. We organised o conference for 200 people in which they were enlightened on the behaviour of cancer and how we humans are actually similar to it. Through acknowledging its actions we may be able to make the right decisions in our daily lives. SynArt was also another approach of ours where we looked at cancer and Synthetic Biology from an artistic view. This involved collaborating with teams such as Imperial and UCL in which they sent us their paintings and writings for the exhibition in our university and Jamboree.

MAGE round 3 samples:

Thio kan-ZFB results:
PCR run out on E Gel: not successful.  We do not know what is still causing our PCR to fail.
pSR01-transformed selection strain:
We discovered that hisB is a two-function protein, with the N-terminal region acting as an HPase and the C-terminal region as an IDPG. His3 only complements the IDPG activity, so even if our MAGE worked, it might destroy our selection system.  The two aa deleted in hisB are in the C terminal region, so maybe they do inactivate it.  We emailed Keith Joung whose lab made the selection strain to see how HisB was deleted.
In case this mutation is correct but lambda red in the selection strain still eludes us, we designed MAGE oligos for use in EcNR2 to either delete the two aa or put 3 stop codons after the HPase region.
culture PCR results: cultures 3-4 had a strong band (and 2 and 5 weak ones) around 850-1000bp.  It is interesting how different these results are from yesterday's colony PCR gel.

The first step is the establishment of the reaction of delftibactin with soluble gold. Therefore we plan an experiment (one to two weeks), where we reproduce the results of the paper [<bib id=""pmid23377039""/>]. After mixing the Acidovorax complex medium (ACM) and adding 4g Chelex-100 resin / 1L ACM  we prepare 25 agarplates (0,5 L ) and two media for liquid culture (1L +0,5L). The second day is about the resuspending of the strain D. acidovorans in 5 ml [recepy in methods] and letting it grow over night. The next day 5 agarplates are inoculated with D. Acidovorans by fractional streak and 5 agarplates with streak over half of the plate. In addition to these 10 agarplates, also the two flasks with the liquid media are inoculated with the strain. The rest of the resuspended cells is stored in a glycerol stock. After 3 days of culture growth (shaking at 190rpm, at a temperature of 30°C) the cells are big enough to start with the delftibactin purification (liquid culture) and the fast test on the agarplates. For the fast test on the agarplates we prepare an soft agarose solution (0,5% agarose and 10mM AuCl3) and incubate every plate with 10 ml solution for two hours at rooms temperature. If delftibactin is present there can be observed a ring structure around the cells.
For the purification of delftibactin, the liquid culture will be centrifugated at  7000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant will be treated with HP20 resin (20 g/L) and then shaken 2h at 220rpm. With the Buchner funnel filtration the resin will be collected and washed with 400 ml dH2O. Afterwards the resin is again washed with 400 ml methanol which will be evaporate under rotary vacuum. The leftover is resuspended in 2 ml of ddH2O:MeOH (1:1). The solution is added to a HPLC column and the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) is analysed in a mass spectroscopy facility. The mobile phase consists in 2%-14% acetonitrile and  98% water +5 mM (NH4)2CO3.

Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CI"

(A) Neurons were put in culture in Neurobasal, B27, GlutaMAX medium. (B) Neurons were put in culture in DMEM FBS 10% medium.
As we can see, we succeeded in growing the cells inside our device in the presence of Neurobasal, B27 and GlutaMAX medium. It is possible to see neurons passing through one chamber to the other in this experiment. Unfortunately, the PDMS of the microfluidic chips detached from the bottom of the glass culture dish, leading to the growth of cells not inside of the microchannels, but below them (Figure 13).
Figure 13: PDMS detachment from the glass bottom culture dish, we can observe the axonal development under the microchannels. Neurons were put in culture with Neurobasal, B27, GlutaMAX, and commercial NGF 50 ng/mL.
We also tested the action of commercial NGF on our culture. Neurons were put in culture in the presence of commercial NGF at different concentrations: 50 ng/mL, 250 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 750 ng/mL and 900 ng/mL. The optimal concentration was determined by modeling of NGF diffusion inside the medium. It was possible to capture the cells passing through one of the chambers of the microfluidic chip to the other side during a time-lapsed using phase-contrast microscopy recorded for the first 48h of culture at the BioImagerie Photonique platform, proving that our device was working as expected (Video 1).

Investigation and Improvement of Our Insoles
we need to know how our products perform in the market. Therefore, we completed the Insole 1, we do a user survey. Then we return to the laboratory to think about the new design which is based on user’s feedback. Ultimately, we have adopted the third Insole 3.
Insole 1:
Insole 1 was a resin and sponge based insole, the main body of which was a honeycomb like resin skeleton with sponge inset. The sponge was filled with culture liquid so that the engineered E. coli strains can grow in it. This insole had four layers, in the middle was the main body. It was covered by the bacterial filter membrane which can prevent the bacterial from escaping. Outer were the sponge layer and skin care cloth layer.
When we finished it. We took some samples to do an investigation out of our lab. People said: OK. Interesting, yet your insole was so tough and inflexible that may be uncomfortable for people to use. After thinking deeply about people’s feedback. We decided to make a thorough change. So we designed another hydrogel based insole—the second insole.
Insole 2:
This insole was made of a kind of high mechanical strength hydrogel, which was tough enough for people to stand on it as well as flexible and soft enough to provide a better user experience. Also it had four layers, yet there was only one sponge layer which was beneath the hydrogel main body.
When we produced it, again, we went to the community to chat with people to collect the feedback of it. When we brought the samples to people, they were highly think of. People said: well, amazing soft insole! And they showed great willingness to try it on. Also, we had collected several constructive suggestions. Such as: “Your hydrogel insoles maybe a bit cold for people to use in winter.”Or “How about your insole"

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"10 ul and 1 ul essentially had a lawn of bacteria growing on them. We re-plated these samples, using 1/100 ul and 1/10000 ul of bacteria in 50 ul of LB. We will leave these plates to incubate overnight at 37*.
We also made a culture from the old 85 culture, which we will plate tomorrow.
Minipreps of colonies and controls
Our minipreps from Saturday had low yields, especially for culture 85. We suspect this is why the PCR [[#Gel analysis of miniprep junction PCR on Sunday did not work for this sample. Unfortunately, 85.3 and 85.4 did not grow even after being left in the shaker overnight. These were two cultures we made by picking new colonies from plate 85. This may have occurred because we did not actually pick the colony, or the colony was a cheater. Thus, we performed minipreps on 80.1, 80.2, 81.1, 81.4 (the controls, chosen for their wide range of concentrations after our first miniprep), and 85.1 and 85.2.
In order to figure our why our minipreps were resulting in unexpectedly low yields and increase our yields:
We tested the pH of our water and Buffer EB.
The pH of our aliquot of water was ~4-5 (too acidic...we are unsure why)
The pH of our Buffer EB was ~7.
Ideally, the DNA should be eluted by a solution of pH 7, so we decided to use Buffer EB during the elution step.
We also checked the copy number of the origin of replication used in our plasmids. ColE1 apparently has a low copy number, which might also explain our low yields.
We had made 5 ml of culture in an attempt to increase our yields.
Our yields were larger than our first round of minipreps, although the purities were rather low. We decided to proceed anyway.
Concentration and purity of our miniprep product
PCR of miniprep products
We then ran a PCR for the cross-junction on all 6 (80.1, 80.2, 81.1, 81.4, 85.1, 85.2) samples, using our usual cross junction protocol.
Gel results, expected product size of 1.4 kb

Well, maybe neither physics nor programming does he really well in, but still passion remains in his life for getting to know about technological stuffs. Of course, there are many things that are his enjoyments, such as travelling, reading books, and writing essays to express his love to his life occasionally. In this year’s competition, his work is coding team’s wiki along with his teammates, and he is having a lot of fun in finding the beauty of programming!
Wulonghao, and you can call him Bill. This guy is a young geek OTAKU who is deeply in love with ACG and science. Maybe sounds awesome, but that is really creepy actually. When not knowing how to write the code, he will go around the room or the building even the whole house. And all what he has done or what he is dong have nothing to do with his major, Physics.
Zongxin Yang, often called St. Yang, who comes from School of Information Science and Technology, USTC, has just entered sophomore year in this semester. His frankness and easy-going make him quite welcome in our team. Also, he is a crazy fan of football and chess. It is worth mentioning that he is one of the members of school football team. His hometown lies in the north of Guilin, which is famous as one of China's most picturesque cities. In our project, he has undertaken mainly the front-end code, and proves to be hard-working.
Liu Miaofeng, is a sophomore student from USTC. He helps the team for the editor of wiki. He is interested in programming and DIY something useful, for example, he participated the robot competition. Besides, he is friendly to others, but he may be a little shy. So you could try to communicate with him and enjoy the conversation.
LI Zitian, is a junior in Physics and Computer Science and Technology.He has a great interest in computer programming. For example, he is skilled in C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. He has wrote several websites because of the interests during the school life, so he is experienced in Front-end web develop. What's more, he is also interested in biology. For the reasons given above, he wants to join the team USTC-Software.
Henry, or Li Hanwen, was a freshman in electrical engineering. He works in front-end group and makes the wiki. He is so zhuangbility that he knows a lot about computer technology cursorily but not profoundly. He loves"

Daniel C.:
More people are getting diagnosed with chlamydia. Is it because chlamydia spreads more, or the diagnostic methods are improving?
Dr. Meyer:
I think both are important. The improvement of the diagnostic method is one reason for increased reporting. Awareness about chlamydia may also be important. We have now screening systems in Germany and other european countries and the more people using                                 these screening systems the more infections will be detected, so this may also cause an increase in numbers of infections, however this is just 10-12% of the target population that is really using the offer of screening. So that there could be much more. And I don't think that screening will be increased to 50% of the population. But if it does increase to 25% you must consider that there must be twice as much chlamydia infections.
Daniel C.:
What symptoms are usually associated with Chlamydia trachomatis?
Dr. Meyer:
The numbers are probably much higher because most infections do not produce symptoms, this is considered to be around 80%, maybe 90% in women and also in men the most infections do not produce symptoms, so if you have no symptoms, you will not go to a physician and there is no reason to take a test, only if you do participant screening programs these asymptomatic infections would be detected, but nevertheless, even if they are asymptomatic, they can be transferred to other people and other people may become infected and produce symptoms. So the asymptomatic infections is a good way for the                                 chlamydia to spread.
Daniel C.:
How does one calculate the risk of Chlamydia trachomatis developing an antibiotic resistant strain?
Dr. Meyer:
So far, there has not been found antibiotic resistance in chlamydia, even though they were treated for a very long time with antibiotics. This may be due to the special life cycle of chlamydia, the intracellular life cycle, but you can never be sure that at some point there be a development of resistance, so it must be followed closely and therefore itˋs important to not only and exclusively use DNA amplification tests but there should be some laboratories, maybe the reference centers of chlamydia that from time to time should culture the bacteria in order to test antibiotic resistance. This is a bit more"

There again appeared to be a strong link between the creation of startups and the DIY Bio movement.
We concluded our survey with a qualitative question where we asked respondents to describe any other factors that influenced them to start up a company. Some of the answers included looking for “alternatives to academia” and “academic career path was unappealing and almost equally as risky”.
It appears that there is a strong link between the creation of startups and iGEM/ DIY Bio on the basis of the results of this survey which may be indicative of the role iGEM will play in the rise of the next generation of startup companies.
I like it Lactis
During the course of the summer, one of our team members James Meeke wrote a musical piece called ‘ I like it Lactis’. James assembled a guitar version of the song which he played himself, a violin version of the song which was played by another member of our team, Kevin Ryan and the lyrics were sung by one of James friend, Renilson Mapele. While, another one of our team member, Seema Subedi worked on the lyrics video which is available to view on the front page of our wiki and also on our Youtube channel. The idea of the ‘I like it Lactis’ song was to interest people about our project through music and to bridge science to art.
We contacted the radio station in our university called UCC98.3FM and they were happy to allow us to record the song in their studio. James, Reni, and Kevin also performed the song live on the radio station and also spoke about iGEM and how the competition worked. Below is a link to the recorded version of the ‘I like it Lactis’ song and the radio interview.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," advantages over other scaffolding systems. Confusion from the lab group about the exact size and arrangment of our scaffold led us to the goal of conducting molecular dynamics, or other physical simulations of our model to allow for better visualisation of its structure. Finally the group made us aware of the importance of designing our mathematical model with respect to the types of experiments that can be used to validate it. From this we verified that the assumptions of our model were able to be replicated under experimental conditions, paving the way for future experimental validation of the model.
Lotte Von Richter
Science Facilities Coordinator - The Australian PlantBank
Lotte von Richter is the Science Facilities Co-ordinator at the Australian PlantBank, a science and research facility of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust. Lotte has over 23 years of experience with the Botanic Gardens Trust, managing the PlantBank research facilities and developing the conservation of Australian native plants through tissue culture and cryopreservation. Lotte gave us a tour of the restricted public access lab spaces and allowed us to view their facilities and equipment up close.
She explained that researchers at PlantBank typically use auxins to stimulate adventitious root growth in their tissue culture specimens. Lotte also explained that seed germination typically does not require the application of exogenous hormones as seeds are self-contained units which already possess any hormones they require to germinate (or the ability to synthesise them). Regarding the auxin indole-3-aecetic acid (IAA), Lotte told us that another auxin, indole-3-butric acid (IBA) was exclusively used by PlantBank researchers who had found in previous experiments that IAA showed no benefits and that IBA was easier to work with. This caused us to alter the direction of our project, as we realised that IAA synthesis was not an appropriate pathway to purse for commercialisation with our scaffold. These comments also influenced us to adapt our proof of concept plant experiment , first germinating A. thaliana seedlings in liquid MS media before transplanting the germinated seedlings to new media containing various concentration of IAA.
Lotte also walked us through the practices PlantBank researchers use to prevent contamination. All materials used in the tissue culture process are sterilised through a variety of processes including the use of autoclaves, filter sterilisation and disinfectants. The importance of being conscious to maintain sterile technique when handling specimens was emphasised. Additionally, the PlantBank facilities are structured to regulate and limit the movement of personnel in specific areas, preventing unnecessary contact with outside contaminants. Wearing protective covers over shoes also helps to prevent"

How to use it
How to use it
To initiate the program with the selected variables you just have to click on the setup button. If you want to adjust all variables to the values by default just click on reset.
To initiate the simulation click on the go button. (aquí me falta añadir junto al texto las imágenes de los botones a los que me refiero con sus correspondientes pies)
The user can modify many variables and see which are the effects of modifying these variables in the simulation:
He can change the number of starting molecules or select the number of repressors that can admit every promoter.
Sliders to select the number of molecules
The user can also control the life-span of RNA and repressors. The life-span of these molecules is distributed according to a normal distribution.
Mean life and standard deviation of several species
He can regulate the strength of the interaction with several molecules. The repressor strength is inversely proportional to the given number, because it gives the chances per second that an attached repressor to the DNA falls from it. Since the strength of the promoters gives the chances (in percentage) that a given RNAP which detects a promoter starts transcription.
Interacition Strength of repressors and promoters
The parameter called time-constant gives us the number of steps (or ticks) of simulation that the program performs by each second of evolution of the system and has a value of one hundred per default. The movement of the proteins in the cytoplasm and the speed of the RNAPs and ribosomes when they are “reading” has an optimal value if this number is 1000, but it also makes the program run slower. Taking as reference a medium-size protein (40 kDA)  which moves with a speed of 5 nm per ms, the program"
