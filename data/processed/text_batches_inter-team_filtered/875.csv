DTU-Denmark,2011,Team:DTU-Denmark-2#Project#PlugnplayAssembly#customization_-_-_TEXT.html," different purposes, for instance the removal of undesired restriction site or for alteration of a proteins catalytic function. When introducing mutations it is only necessary for the primers to overlap in the complementary region (linker). Depending on whether the point mutation should be degenerate or not only one or both primers needs to carry the mutation. Degeneration means that more than one codon may code for the same amino acid. Thereby, a degenerate mutation can give different outcomes in use of tRNA's.
Introducing a point mutation with non-degenerate codons
Both primers have to carry the desired mutation to ensure that the codon and the resulting amino acid are generated by the mutation.
1. To introduce a point mutation in a vector, the mutation has to be defined first.
2. To design the primers the software PHUSER can be used. Remember to introduce the desired mutation into the primer. Two primers are used per mutation.
3. The primers are ordered from your favourite company. Notice that the price can be a bit higher and delivery time a bit longer, when ordering primers with a uracil incorporated. We have had a good experience with the price, delivery time and quality of the primers ordered from Integrated DNA Technology.
4. To amplify the BioBricks the protocol Amplification of biobricks by PCR can be used.
5. Check the PCR reaction on an agarose gel before assembly. The new BioBricks can be used directly or purified by agarose-gel purification if needed.
6. The assembly of new BioBricks should be performed according to the protocol USER cloning .
7. A BioBrick, device or plasmid with the desired point mutation should now have been assembled.
Introducing a degenerate point mutation, which can give a different codon usage
Only one primer has to carry the desired point mutation. The procedure of assembly is the same as for the non-degenerate point mutation above.
It is also possible to introduce several point mutations in different regions by customizing the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard. This only requires one round of PCR and one round of cloning. The difference is that the PCR fragments made for each mutation will have to be fused together meaning that the introduction of two mutations would require the fusion of three PCR fragments, and so on.
Deletions
With this guide a gene or part of a gene or any other desired sequence of a plasmid, device, or BioBrick can be deleted.
1. First the site of the deletion should be defined.
2. The primers need to be designed so that"
Goettingen,2013,Team:Goettingen#Project#OurProject_-_-_TEXT.html," we aimed to reveal the protein structure of a not yet characterized diadenylate cyclase domain.
First we tried to express the complete CdaA protein of L. monocytogenes in E.coli. Unfortunately, we couldn't get any clone after several attempts. The full length protein might be toxic expressed in E.coli, so we focused on a truncated version of the whole protein excluding the trans-membrane domains. The 173 amino acid protein fragment (100 – 273 of CdaA) harbors exclusively the catalytic domain of CdaA, also referred to as DacA. We attached an N-terminal Strep-tag to the cyclase domain and expressed the protein driven by a T7-promoter. HPLC-MS/MS measurements determined the presence of c-di-AMP and, thus, the activity of the catalytic domain in also in the Gram-negative bacterium E.coli in vivo.
Excluding the trans-membrane domains, the protein localizes to the cytoplasm and can be purified using streptavidin purification columns. After we purified the DAC protein, we wanted to prove the functionality also in vitro. The results showed that the purified catalytic domain of CdaA is still functional in vitro in proper conditions. Thus, the truncated diadenylate cyclase domain is qualified to construct a screening system with the ectopic production of c-di-AMP in E.coli, as a further goal of our whole project. Also our experiments went on to our final step, crystallization and, finally, the determination of the 3D protein structure.
In collaboration with Dr. Achim Dickmanns , we successfully obtained protein crystals and with the help of Dr. Piotr Neumann , we managed to determine the 3D structure from the X-ray diffraction pattern.
We believe that the 3D structure of the diadenylate cyclase domain of Listeria can help pharmaceutical industry in developing novel antibiotics that interfere with DAC function.
In our progress we also created a new BioBrick, to know more, please go to our subteam page and parts page .

Introduction
Figure 1. Fusion of Tn5 transposase with dxCas9. During purification, the Tn5 part of the protein forms a dimer with another Tn5 structure from another fusion protein, thus forming the fusion dimer structure represented here in proportion.
The core of our detection method is our novel targeted Next Generation Sequencing platform. This technology reduces the enormous amount of data generated by whole genome sequencing and reduces the time and resources invested in analyzing multiple samples, for the detection of gene doping. We accomplished our goal by designing an innovative dxCas9-Tn5 fusion protein shown in figure 1. The dxCas9 part is responsible for guiding the fusion to the target site via complementary matching between the sgRNA and target site. Whereas the Tn5 part is responsible for performing the integration of the adapter. This fusion thus has the capability of performing target specific integration of adapters required for sequencing. We could therefore replace the random enzymatic protein, Tn5, used for fragmentation during sequencing library preparation, transforming the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform to targeted Next Generation Sequencing.
Fusion protein In Vitro functionality
We constructed, expressed and purified the fusion protein, and demonstrated its intended activity: targeted integration of specific DNA sequences. For this, we analyzed the integration of small DNA sequences (DNA adapters) directed with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to a specific site on a substrate gene, generating two DNA fragments of known length based on the position that the sgRNA targeted.
Figure 2. (A) Experimental design to prove targeted integration of our fusion protein. The fusion was directed by sgRNA at position 179 bp in EPO cds, adding two adapters of 50 bp (one at each side). The product of the integration are two separate DNA molecules of different lengths that can be seen by PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis, (B).

Each sample was grown with a different concentration of potassium nitrate, from left to right: 0 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, 10 mM.
The figure suggests that fluorescent proteins have been expressed by the bacteria grown in media containing potassium nitrate due to the fluorescence shown under the UV box. It also suggests that different concentrations of potassium nitrate correlate with different intensities of expression due to the observable differences in fluorescence as the tubes are viewed from left to right, going up the gradient. The negative control of 0 mM potassium nitrate appears to show no fluorescence, suggesting it is indeed the potassium nitrate that is inducing the promoter.
Creating Novel Hybrid Promoters: B-M and M-B into BioBricks
The DNA for the synthesised genes of B-M and M-B had been supplied in the pUC57 backbone, therefore it was necessary for B-M and M-B to be digested from the pUC57 backbone and ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone. The synthesised gene was transformed into competent ’’E. coli’’ cells, which in turn were grown on agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin (due to pUC57 containing ampicillin resistance); colonies that had grown were then inoculated into liquid culture, and the liquid culture was subsequently mini-prepped using either the Bioline ISOLATE Plasmid DNA Mini Kit or the Promega Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System. The DNA that had been extracted through mini-preps and the pSB1C3 backbone, as provided by the iGEM registry, were then digested using EcoR1 and Pst1 and a ligation was carried out using standard assembly protocol. The product of ligation was then transformed into competent E. coli cells, which were grown on agar plates containing 2.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol (due to pSB1C3 containing chloramphenicol resistance); this was done to eliminate any bacteria that had been transformed with undesirable ligation products.

Mapping Myth
If a myth is a lie that tells the truth,now its time to construct a new myth for synthetic biology. First, what is the existing myth of synbio. We need to analyse the promises, issues, characters, ideologies that make up the construct of this new approach to genetic engineering. Next, we'll start to create our new myth. How do we see it? What do we think it should be like. Synthetic biology functions in a binary world, of good versus evil, solution versus problem. How can we start to describe the more complex ecosystems of biology and context, our visions, fears, questions, hopes? Can we tell it in a narrative form, bringing in the ideas we've constructed, bioprospected from Indian mythology to create our new story. Quite a task, but if we can pull it off, it'll be a wonderful story.
We'll start by looking at the genre's 'classic text', Adventures in Synthetic Biology , a comic published in Nature in November 2005, co-authored by Drew Endy.
Next, we'll unravel the synbio myth to find the key messages. What are we promised? We need to map out the current myth of synbio, before we can write our own.
The New York Times recently published an article on the perils of powerpoint, highlighting the case of this mindmap of American military strategy , though highly complex, it tells the story... The team quickly drew a map of the key characters in synbio. More on this soon!
Now, its back to biobricks and time to map out this morning's presentations with biobricks and design experiments to describe the concepts.

As we have already mentioned, there was no content about iGEM in Portuguese on Wikipedia, one of the most important online source of information. So, we created a new article by translating content already available in English and also adding novel information regarding the Brazilian participation on the iGEM competition. The article may be accessed on https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGEM
Furthermore, plans to develop a project to make more content regarding synthetic biology available in Portuguese are currently underway. The ideia arrised from an invitation from a Wikimedia Foundation representative and a big collaborative network is supposed to be built.

Escherichia coli T7 Express cells producing IaaM and IaaH were grown in tryptophan-enriched Luria broth, and Salkowski assays were performed on cell pellets collected and the resulting supernatant (Figures 4 and 5). However, these were inconclusive due to contamination of the control sample. Salkowski assays to determine how readily the purified enzyme IaaH converted IAM to IAA showed us that the Salkowski reagent is not able to differentiate between the two molecules (Figure 6). From this, we learnt that a more precise assay was required and so we opted to perform HPLC.
Figure 4: A Cell based Salkowski Assay was performed on the supernatants of cells expressing IaaM and IaaH, incubated in the presence of tryptophan for varying time periods. Control denotes the vector contains no IaaM and IaaH producing gene. The concentration was produced by the ‘Figure 3’ standard curve, with upper limit of 250 µM, therefore, the insert value at 4 hrs is inaccurate.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a technique used to analyse, measure, separate and identify components of a mixture. The mixture passes through a column packed with an adsorbent material, which causes different flow rates for the different components of the mixture. We present a method to prepare the supernatant from lysed cells containing the enzymes. This allows for the measurement of the 3 key intermediaries using HPLC; tryptophan, indole acetamide, indole"

In fact, both coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs, including some miRNAs, have been found in human saliva. Although mRNAs are highly degraded in saliva, miRNAs are stably and abundantly present in saliva. Recently, there are many reports on cancer-related miRNA expression in saliva. Featured miRNA expression are reported to be found in oral squamous cell carcinoma, parotid gland tumors and esophageal cancer, indicating potential salivary miRNA to be biomarkers for detecting these diseases. According to the test done by Zijun Xie group, there are three type of miRNAs significantly upregulated in the whole saliva from the esophageal cancer patient group in contract to normal control group – miR-10b, miR-144, and miR-451 (p value 0.001, 0.012 and 0.002, respectively; AUC 0.762, 0.706 and 0.756, respectively). And four miRNAs are significantly upregulated in saliva supernatants from the esophageal cancer patient group – miR-10b, miR-144, miR-21 and miR-451. Among them, miR-21 is the most frequently reported one for its high performance in specific expression level related to esophageal cancer (according to one of the reports, p < 0.05, AUC = 0.8820, sensitivity = 90.20% and specificity 70.69%; different tests may report different results).
Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.

Xavier Gavend, theologist and chaplain at EPFL gave us another view on this subject by invoking the great importance of humility (which Prof. Benaroyo also mentioned as being a necessary quality for a scientist): “From a Christian perspective, it is with humility that greatness can be achieved. That is the whole paradox: we are responsible, we are in charge, but we are not Gods ourselves. We do not want to make ourselves Gods”. According to Xavier Gavend, the responsibility stemming from research might be too much for a human being to bear.
Moratoriums, necessary safeguards or obstacles?
Another way to discuss a breakthrough technology, how it should or should not be used, consists in declaring a moratorium, meaning that all research involving the specific technology is interrupted until a general agreement is found between researchers and all other stakeholders. A well-known example of such approach occurred in 1975 when a moratorium concerning genetic manipulation took place in Asilomar. Earlier this year a group of scientists who participated in the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 called for a worldwide voluntary moratorium in order to discuss the ethical consequences of being able to easily edit and modify the human genome in an inheritable way [4].
Of all the topics covered with the experts, moratorium is the one that caused the most contrasted reactions. We encountered three different points of view on the subject. Some specialists insisted on the necessity of moratoriums, as they allow scientists to avoid making disastrous mistakes in the future and keep working in line with ethics: “I think that the word of caution made by these scientists matches with a broad consensus in the scientific community: we do not wish to modify the human germline in any way”, Prof. Trono affirms, also reminding us that the question of human genome manipulation is not a new one. Jean-Christophe Méroz, member of the legislation division at Swissmedic, emphasized that a moratorium on clinical applications of a technology is not to be confused with a moratorium on the technology itself. “This is my personal opinion”, he precises, “I’d say yes to a moratorium on any research applied to humans (like the one Prof. Jennifer Doudna called for). But let’s keep on doing our research on cells and animals to verify how precisely we can master this technology. [...] A moratorium should avoid future interruptions of preclinical research”. Méroz also made clear the regulatory assessment of the risks of a potential clinical treatment and ethical debates are two totally different things that should not be mixed up nor lead by the same institutions.

Transcriptome Analysis of T. solium
RNA Isolation
Toehold switch sensors are based on synthetic biology. Essentially, they are RNA molecules which code for a reporter protein. They consist of a specific toehold sequence, a ribosome-binding site (which is important for the production of proteins) and a sequence for the reporter protein. The reporter protein can only be produced if the sensor has bonded with its specific target RNA sequence [4]. When producing the sensors, we can select both the toehold sequence and the reporter protein with complete flexibility to match our needs. In this way we can fashion our Wormspotter so that it only sends a desired signal when it binds to RNA molecules specific to T. solium. We are planning to use T. solium-specific RNA sequences for the toehold sequence and beta-Galactosidase as a reporter protein.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,". This concern is that science and new technologies can cause a tremendous catastrophe on the environment. We want not only to make diffusion of synthetic biology but also to make sure that people fully understand the science behind it.  We are responsible students who want to know what other people think about synthetic biology and our project, but also want to comprehend other's way of thinking.
Several opportunities present to those who give their best. Having said this, we were able to collaborate with the translation of the ERA guide mentioned before. With this, we could help the doctors that wrote this guide contribute something transcendental to the Cartagena Protocol. As we mentioned in the button above, we also decided to register ourselves as part of Youth Biotech.
These two factors opened doors for us. Ph.D. María Mercedes Roca gave us great news, iGEM Tec-Chihuahua and all the members of Youth Biotech are invited to attend the United Nations Biodiversity Conference.
In this conference, biotechnology masters will discuss environmental and safety issues. This event will take place at Sharm El Sheik, Egypt from November 17th to 29th of 2018.  The meetings that will take place in this conference will be the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 14), the 9th meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (COPMOP9) and the 3rd meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (COPMOP3).
The theme of the Conference is “Investing in biodiversity for people and planet.” Here, governments will address important questions raised by emerging technologies, including how approaches in synthetic biology can be regulated to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing the risks, according to Dr. Cristiana Paşca Palmer, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The ERA guide we collaborated with is going to be presented and discussed in a side-event at this Conference by Ph.D. María Mercedes Roca.
Tec-Chihuahua 2018 wants to know different points of view, good or bad, and contribute something to the community so people could make their own point of view based on great backup information. Therefore, we found incredibly important to review alternatives for this topic.
We are truly grateful for being helpful in this incredible work and we are very honored to have contributed to something so important for those who want to put their biotechnology company using GMOs, as established"

However, from the comparing results, we found that different aptamers have varied consensus sequences and secondary structures. Thus, the aptamer sensor sections have little or nothing in common. Therefore, we should contain the sensor section and design the standard versatile platforms in our future work.

Since bound + unbound = 100%, and the Hill equation models the bound component, it can be said that

The FindFit function of Mathematica was used to find the unknown constants Kd and n for the modified Hill equation above. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 28.130 and n ≈ 1.3540. The final equation is

Human GzmB Inhibitor ACT3m
Given our model of Serpina3n, we also wanted to create a model for the protein used in our device, ACT3m. The dataset obtained from the ACT3m paper (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014) is the result of a colorimetric assay. Data was presented as absorbance values (A405), which correspond to the concentration of free GzmB, at different inhibitor concentrations. The paper used this to prove that their novel ACT3m inhibitor was the strongest out of their entire pool of possible candidates: treatment with ACT3m resulted in the lowest A405 values, which suggests the strongest inhibition of GzmB.
To model this set of data, similar adjustments had to be made. First, the dataset was scaled so the numbers ranged between 0 and 1 (in this case, increased by a factor of 2). The same modified Hill equation was used from the Serpina3n analysis. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 13.336 and n ≈ 0.605, so the equation looks like

We prepped hard for our meeting at Armstrong global headquarters in Lancaster, PA, knowing we had one hour to make our presentation and pitch before senior staff, technical experts, and a VP. This was a new experience for us. Armed with our PowerPoint presentation, we focused our pitch on our approach to their problem, corroborated it with experimental results, and ventured into ideas and rationale for further work towards a future implementable solution. The Q&A and discussions that followed contributed to the strong impression we left them with on the potential for exploring synthetic biology as a viable solution. Later, this was followed up with an year of collaboration; with written funding proposals and Armstrong’s generous support of our iGEM team with $5,000, email communications with Mr. Paul Hough our main contact at Armstrong and communications with other technical experts, Mr. Craig Hoosier, Mr. Thomas Woolley, and Mike McCarty.
United State Gypsum (USG)
As we were researching the butyric acid problem at Armstrong’s plant in the context of the use of recycled and renewable materials, we sought insight on the extent of this problem in the rest of the industry; we wanted to know if this problem was limited to Armstrong or if other manufactures also experienced the same issues, or if they had a different set of problems. It was important for us to know this as we were looking for solutions that had industry-wide applications. Consequently, we reached out to United States Gypsum, the second largest manufacturer. Explaining our iGEM research that was associated with Armstrong and our overarching goal for finding biological solutions, our communications with Dr. Paul Shipp (see Industry Communication) provided valuable information that we did not previously have, thus providing affirmation and guiding us in the focus of our solution design.

Our collaboration with Farmwell Station Middle School evolved from last year when we made presentations of our iGEM research in science classrooms. Our own experiences through middle and high school led us to believe that the ideal target age group for engaging students to explore the sciences by inquiry and doing, is middle school. Middle school students have gained some exposure to scientific experimentation and are eager to try new things.

Description
In this work, we aim to develop a light inducible CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene activation system in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic cells, to precisely manipulate target gene activation upon the light induction. We fused two light-activated plant proteins, CRY2 or CIBN, to a transcriptional activator VP64 or the catalytic domain deleted tCas9, generating CRY2-VP64 or tCas9-CIBN chimeric constructs. In the presence of a specific sgRNA guide, the tCas9 domain from the tCas9-CIBN binds to the promoter sequence of a reporter gene. Once exposing to blue light, the CRY2 domain from the CRY2-VP64 can form a protein complex with tCas9-CIBN, which in turn brings the VP64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene. We have successfully generated a prokaryotic cell strain that the activation of reporter gene is regulated by blue light.
Light-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system
The NEU-China iGEM team sought to create a new mode of gene editing and manipulation for use in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic cells. We generated two expression systems harboring CRY2-VP64 and tCas9-CIBN chimeric constructs. The introduction of a specific sgRNA, the tCas9-CIBN protein binds to the promoter region of the reporter gene (GFP) through tCas9-sgRNA complex, without the activation of reporter gene. In the presence of blue light, the CRY2-VP64 forms a complex with tCas9-CIBN, via CRY2 and CIBN protein-protein interaction. The expression of the reporter gene is then activated by VP64.
Over the summer, we accomplished the following:

Week of 7/4/2011
Members of the Wellesley HCI lab testing out the Surface.
Continue designing notebook application
7/4: no research today; 4th of July!  Worked instead on the Lab Notebook.
7/5: Lots happened today:
Today the other half of the team presented in the Science Center CS Lecture Series.  The first group presented last week Tuesday on inspirations and brainstorming ideas for the design process.  This week, the lab presented on designs and future plans for beyond iGEM.   We continued designing the LabBuddy/ electronic notebook application.  Consuelo and I decided that instead of a checklist or a protocol list, a flowchart of some sort with annotations on the side could work, allotted that there is room for figures and the notes can be printed separately later.   Something also to consider is a function that displays lab reminders from Traci, Suma, and James, a “training mode” in protocols, that could help prevent wet lab errors and increase productivity.   Also, I did further background research on related works, either in the LabBuddy application or frequently-used tools in synthetic biology.  There are a few tools that are already in use for note taking in an iPod or iPad setting, but they are not specifically for lab usage, and are fairly pricy.
7/6: Continued writing the user scenario- should eventually incorporate all aspects of the GnomeSurfer Pro suite in the content Continue updating aspects of the lab notebook- what kind of pictures are needed?
Continue doing related works ppt and adding features 7/7-7/8:The research for related works continues still!  Michelle and I are refining the scenario for presentation to the BU team.
Week of 7/11/2011
7/11-7/12:  Michelle and I continue working on the user scenario.  Monday night we both went to a writing workshop, and used information compiled from all the interviews that we learned to continue writing the usability scenario.
7/13:  Kelsey, Michelle, Megan, and I sat down and worked on visuals for a primer design.  Kelsey and Casey ended up working on the primer design.  Since Orit gave us a new copy of the scenario to edit, Michelle and I ended up working on explaining a user scenario for the primer designer how is using a primer designer different for the MS Surface than for a computer?  How can collaboration techniques vary?  How will the team approach this project?  What kind of visuals"

Restriction Digest and PCR with gene-specific primers of LuxOD47E in the psB1AC3 vector
Objective: to verify that the gene of interest LuxOD47E has been biobricked (contains the biobrick restriction sites).
Restriction Digest
Protocol: Digest 10 μL LuxOD47E BBK (C1- [60.3 ng/μL] and C2- [92.9 ng/μL]) with 1μL Not1 restriction enzyme (Invitrogen, CA), 2 μL REact 3 Buffer and 7 μL ddH20.  Left for two hours in 37ºC water bath.  Then heat activated in a 65ºC water bath for 10 minutes.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," everything needed for making 100 biosensors; deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with BioBricks from the iGEM registry, enzymes, antibiotics, buffers, ligases, cells and sterile equipment.              The students can create biosensors by assembling a detection and response gene using 3A assembly to genetically modify E. coli. Until now GMO exercises have been unavailable for Danish highschools due to costs and law, but with the biosensor project it is no longer a problem. We tested the kit at a local highschool and raised almost 135,000 USD from both Danish and international sponsors and we expect the kit to be distributed by the end of this year. We hope it will inspire and encourage the next generation to work in the field of synthetic biology. Please see the Biosensor page
Software Tool
One of the numerous capabilities and features that iGEM is providing to current and future science disciplines and societies around the globe, is the ability of “building interdisciplinary bridges”. Therefore, the DTU BioBuilders team confidently believes that the developed TaiCO tool will bring wetlabs and computational biology a step closer to bidirectional understanding. This tool is a stand-alone cross-platform software developed in Python (using only standard libraries) and provides comprehensive codon optimization of DNA sequences from protein sequences. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that the researcher can specify the organism and the desired protein sequences to optimize according to the tRNA adaptation index (TAI) for the specified organism. This is novel in terms of codon optimization methods approach is framed by a user friendly GUI along with the option of removal of desired restriction sites from the resulting DNA sequences. Please see the codon optimization page for elaboration.
Hardware
When taking your synbio project to real applications, fast growth is crucial for the viability. The optical density is commonly used as a proximation for cell count and numerous instructions for DIY spectrophotometers exist. However, in order to estimate growth rates, cultures must be sampled over a long period of time. During our project, this was done by a robot handling microtiter plates. We are aware that this is a technology not everybody has access to. Therefore, we took the concept of a DIY spectrophotometer and expanded it to a platform that carries out small scale fermentations comparing growth of your modifed strain to a wild type or other organisms. To take it even further, we encapsuled it in a compact housing that fits on any lab bench. It can be rebuild or modified by anyone with access to a PC, a 3D-printer and a laser cutter.

Following electrophoresis, stain the gel for 15 min with ethidium bromide, SYBR Green, or RED Safe, using whichever method is standard to your lab.
Note: A high quality PCR product will yield a bright band of the expected size, with only faint traces of unspecific product contaminants. If the product band has an intensity that is at least as intense as the 500 bp,1000 bp, or 3000 bp ladder bands (60 ng/band; select the one that is closest to your product size for comparison), then the PCR yield is at least 60 μg/μL, an acceptable concentration for further steps. If not, then more PCR reactions may be required.

Brown,2008,Team:BrownTwo#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Placed these cultures inthe incubator around 8:45 pm.  Should take them out around 10:45 am tomorrow for making glycerol stocks.
6/16/08
No one took the cultures out of the incubator yesterday.  Glycerol stocks were not made.
A conversation with Caroline served to be quite informative.  It appears that it will be better to simply test the activity of the PGAL1 and PMET25 promoters while they are driving the production of their respective activators or repressors.  Promoter activity can change depending upon what the coding sequence is.  However, will still continue on with the other ligation process (between J63001 and J63002) for practice.  To this end, the next step is application of Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIAP) to the vector only, preventing ligation to itself.  After this, one does an ethanol precipitation before doing the ligation itself. The protocol that I have in my lab notebook for CIAP indicates adding 4uL of CIAP 10x Reaction Buffer and 1 uL of CIAP enzyme to 34 uL of the gel extraction.  Promega's protocol, however, requires diluting the CIAP to 0.01u/uL.  The CIAP we have in the fridge is at a concentration of 1u/uL.  They then recommend using up to 5uL of this diluted CIAP in 50uL of reaction, to yield a final concentration of 0.001u/uL.  Also in Promega's protocol is the use of 40 uL of DNA (up to 10 pmol of 5' ends, where 1μg of 1,000bp DNA = 1.52pmol DNA = 3.03pmol of ends) and 5 uL of 10x Reaction Buffer.
Concentration of J63001 gel extract: 8.4 ng/uL => 40 uL contains 336 ng  (note: don't need to do CIAP on this sample)
Concentration of J63002 gel extract: 13.7 ng/uL => 40 uL contains 548 ng
0.05u CIAP/10 pmol 5' ends => 0.005u CIAP per pmol 5' ends
So we only need about 0.025u CIAP for 40 uL of J63002.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," temporary campus at a vacated military barrack near my home. (Both colleges had been completely destroyed by the atomic bomb.) I was admitted to the pharmacy college in April 1948. Although I was not planning to be a pharmacist, I didn't have any other choice, under the circumstances. My grandmother presented me with a suit of silk clothes upon my entrance to college. There was no cloth to buy at the time, but she had a mulberry field. So she raised silkworms, reeled silk thread off the cocoons, dyed the thread, hand-wove the thread into cloth by herself, and then tailored the clothes.
Most of the pharmacy students lived in the dormitory, and they were always hungry due to an extreme shortage of food. I lived at home, and we owned farm land, so I was very lucky concerning food. Despite great effort by the professors, the resources and equipment at the pharmaceutical college were poor. We had a lot of difficulty carrying out experiments. Instruction in analytical chemistry and physical chemistry seemed fine, but I learned very little organic chemistry. In experiments on organic synthesis, we often set fire to solvents, due to poor technique and poor glassware. But many of us were experienced firefighters due to growing up in wartime, and we had no problem putting the fires out.
My interest in chemical experiments developed, but due to equipment limitations, the only experiments I could carry out were inorganic ionic reactions. With the permission of Professor Shungo Yasunaga (Fig. 2, left) of the Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab, I prepared many glass capillaries 1 mm in diameter, and packed them with alumina powder. When a small amount of a mixed solution of metallic ions was applied to the tip of the capillary and then it was dipped in a developing reagent, the reagent quickly rose up by capillary action. In the process, metallic ions were separated and colored bands appeared corresponding to the ions separated. It was a kind of chromatography. With Prof. Yasunaga's permission, I brought back a small amount of various chemicals to my home and studied the conditions of separation in detail. The results were reported in the Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan a few years later, as my first paper (Yasunaga and Shimomura, 1953).

The Public BioBrick
One of the inspirations for our company was provided by an extensive human practice activity from last year. We were strongly involved in the Public BioBrick project, a 5-month collaboration between UCL iGEM and the London Biohackers to explore the potential of citizen scientists to access and contribute to the Registry of Parts .
The project included molecular biology work in the London Hackspace as well as UCL's teaching labs, into which we invited the citizen scientists. In the end, the work culminated in the first BioBrick submitted to the Registry that was completely designed and made by a public, non-academic group. Finally, the result was exhibited and discussed at the Grant Museum in London by a large audience from a variety of backgrounds.
This collaboration was our first of many interactions with the DIYbio community, and have been an important stepping stone in discovering the needs of citizen scientists to access synthetic biology in a safe and responsible way.

iGEM High School
Earlier this year, we helped mentor the first UK iGEM HS team at UCL Academy, a new academy school for pupils of any background. Even though the school is much better equipped than most public schools, the essential equipment for participation in iGEM - a PCR machine, a gel electrophoresis device, etc - was missing and laboratory work had to be carried out in our university laboratories with the high school students.
This experience has not just taught us about the necessity for affordable equipment that can be used in the classroom, but also about the need for the tools to be user-friendly to the inexperienced.

Social Enterprise Grant
Going forwards, we want to test Darwin Toolbox in a large variety of contexts, not just inside the classroom. We have successfully applied for a social enterprise grant to work with different communities in London and explore the potential of citizen biotechnology to increase science"

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

iGEM Leiden Wiki : Public Engagement
Public Engagement
Events
Synthetic biology has the purpose to design useful organisms or biological systems. But how could something be useful when people do not know about it, or are even doubtful or scared of it? That’s why our team found it really important to spread the word about synthetic biology and engage with the public, other scientists, business and national institutions which not only a good break from working in the lab but also highly motivating to do. At these events we displayed a poster to summarize our project, which won the ""Best Poster"" prize at the International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation !
May 28th 2016 - Night at the Museum
Considering the extraordinary amount of culture and history in Leiden, the city is stacked                with museums. There is a museum of natural history, a museum with art from the Dutch                Golden Age and even a museum which is centered around the human body. Lots of                people come to visit these museums every year, and students are given free acces. But                there is on one special annual event which connects all of them; the Night at the                Museums. Every year, a group of students organises the Night at the Museums. Here,                the museums stay open until after midnight, and each museum is a host for countless                activities. We, iGEM Leiden, had the honour to entertain and enlighten visitors in the                city’s old orrery.
Our main act, was letting visitors create bio-art. Bio-art, being the beautiful patterns one                can form by letting colonies of coloured bacteria grow on petri-dishes. Aside from our                main act, we conducted surveys. These surveys gauged how people view synthetic                biology and its applications. Furthermore, we also exhibited the machine that simulates                zero gravity for our organisms. There was also a homemade laser projection-                microscope. This microscope allowed people to see microbes move around in a drop of                water. To top it all off, we told everybody about our fantastic project and how we hope to                help with the colonisation of Mars.

The subnetwork likely represents a core component to coordinate multiple biological processes in the transition from development to defense. Finally, we constructed modular network models for PTI and ETI to explain the quantitative differences from the global network architecture. Our results show defense modules appeared to be interdependently connected in PTI, but independently connected in ETI, providing an explanation for the robustness of ETI to genetic mutations and effector attacks. Taken together, the multiscale comparisons between PTI and ETI provide a systems biology point of view to understand plant immunity, and highlight the coordination among network modules to establish a robust immune response.

Title：Mind-altering microbes
Andrew Harrison University of Essex
Abstract：We are moving through a paradigm shift in how we view the relationship between Homo Sapiens and microbes - we may be best considered as a mammalian-microbe symbiotic ecosystem. This changing view will impact upon many fields, including psychology and mental health. It is increasingly clear that the Western lifestyle is leading to a dramatic change in our microbiota. This may have causal implications for the dramatic rises we are witnessing in obesity, autoimmune diseases and mental disorders such as autism. It will further impact upon how we care for an ageing population, overcome malnutrition, and deal with infectious diseases in the post-antibiotic era.

Abstract: Epigenetic marks, including histone modifications, DNA methylation and histone variants, play a key role in determining transcriptional outcomes. The availability of the high-throughput sequencing data allows us to characterize the genome-wide distribution patterns of epigenetic marks, which have improved our understanding of the relationship between chromatin modification/structure"

Our first interview, before we had come to a final decision about our project, was with Dr. Yimon Aye, a notable researcher in the area of redox targeting for medical application in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University. Professor Aye was excited about our use of the redox sensitive fluorescent protein. She affirmed the novelty of our idea to couple this fusion protein to graded response against ROS, and acknowledged that it would pave the way to creating more robust biological circuits in cells by being able to control damage caused by oxidative stress.  Professor Aye also commented on potential obstacles that we might encounter, and pushed us to think about the number of parts our plan would require. Her insight and support led us to understand how our ROS-regulating biocircuit could be used as a tool in further synthetic biology advances. Additionally, we identified a need for heightened protection against ROS, which was taken into consideration when designing and assembling the biobricks we decided upon.
JUNE 16, 2017
Dr. Greg Martin
To transition from the lab to the greenhouse, we talked to Dr. Greg Martin of Plant Pathology and Plant Microbe Biology to better understand ROS in plants. Professor Martin researches the effect of ROS and disease in plants. With respect to oxidative species, Martin stressed the importance of ROS in the first and secondary lines of immune defense in plants. We learned that we needed to carefully control how much native ROS we quench in the plant, as quenching too much could make them more susceptible to disease. This idea was integrated into the biological circuit we developed. Instead of only lowering ROS levels, by having antioxidant product coupled to a light sensitive promoter we could also turn expression off to maintain a minimum level of oxidative stress.
JUNE 20, 2017
Dr. Maria Harrison
As we learned more about ROS in plants, we also wanted to learn more about how microbes interacted with plants. We reached out to Dr. Maria Harrison, an adjunct professor in the School of Integrative Plant Science, conducting research on the mechanisms underlying symbiosis between plants and fungal symbionts. By understanding how fungi interacted with plants, we were hoping to understand how E. coli might interact with our plants. We learned that there would be a big hurdle to having our E. coli survive with the plants: E. coli were optimized for the gut, while fungi have co-evolved with plants. This fed into the design decision to have our E. coli contained within dialysis tubing and put close proximity to the plants rather than in direct contact with them.

To dry the silica membrane, centrifuge again for 2 min at 13,000 rpm.
Add 50 ml of sterile and deionized water on top of the silica membrane of the column incubate the column for 1 - 5 min at room temperature and elute the DNA by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
The plasmid DNA is highly pure and can be stored at –20°C.
Concentration and purity of DNA/RNA samples
Determination of DNA/RNA concentration
A reliable method for the quantification of DNA and RNA is essential for our work in the lab. The concentration of nucleic acids can be determined by fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The quantification of nucleic acids by fluorescence spectroscopy relies on binding to fluorescent dyes, e.g. ethidium bromide. This method is very sensitive (10 – 100 ng of DNA can be detected) but time-consuming. This is the reason that DNA is mainly quantified by absorption spectroscopy. DNA can be quantified by absorption spectroscopy because it absorbs ultra violet (UV) light with a maximum at the wavelength of 260 nm. However, RNA absorbs UV light also at 260 nm and aromatic amino acids at 280 nm what means that both can contaminate your measurements. Therefore, it is important to determine the purity of your samples.
The purity of the DNA preparation
The quantification of DNA makes only sense if the sample is pure. The purity of the sample can be evaluated by recording a spectrum of your DNA solution in the range between 220 and 320 nm. Proteins in the sample absorb light at 280 nm and cause a reduction of the A260 nm/A280 nm ratio. If the DNA sample is pure, this ratio is in the range of 1.8 – 2.0. A strong peak at 230 nm can indicate contamination with organic compounds or chaotropic salts.
The Material

The Procedure
Clean the measurement pedestal (it contains the receiving fibre) with deionized water and pipette 1 ml of water on top of it.
Close the lid (sampling arm). Now the upper measurement pedestal (it contains the second fibre optic cable) is brought into contact with the liquid sample causing the liquid to bridge the gap between the two fibre optic ends. The gap is controlled to both 1 and "

The generateVariations function is debugged and working, and documentation will be added to the README soon. It required an additional house-keeping data structure, a third ArrayList<String> in partDefinitions that keeps a list of names of all instances of each part. This made looking up the available pool of interchangeable parts more efficient.
To allow rule-checking to Spectacles, I added two new global data structures, ruleAssertViolations and ruleNoteViolations, that map device names to array lists of rule statements that are violated. Since Eugene currently throws an exception immediately when a rule is violated, ruleAssertViolations only holds one device and one statement right now.
This week, the majority of us went to the wet lab to get mentored by Sherine in the assembly process. We did Eco/Bam transfers, picked colonies, ran gels, and assembled composite parts. The iGEM experience would not have been complete without some wet lab work. After all, we are designing tools to aid in this process.

How does E.D. Frosti work?
The first illustration is a global overview of our project in which you can see how the plasmids (and the parts) function in our system. The next illustration shows the plasmids in more detail, with the favorite new parts and the characterized pre-existing parts.
Plasmid 1 contains the bricks necessary to induce expression of the red color (via the CrtEBI system) and  ice-nucleating protein (INP) in a lactose-dependent manner. For this plasmid, the INP has been cloned ( BBa_K584024 ) and tested for functionality by putting it behind the constitutive ( BBa_K584027 ) and lactose-inducible ( BBa_K584028 ) promoter.
Plasmid 2 contains the bricks that induce the expression of the black color (via the melA system) and  antifreeze protein (AFP) in a arabinose-dependent manner. For this plasmid, the AFP has been cloned ( BBa_K584020 ) and tested for functionality by putting it behind the constitutive promoter ( BBa_K584026 ).
Plasmid 3 contains the necessary bricks for our cell death mechanism. Briefly, lactose or arabinose will generate a ribolock-ceaB construct ( BBa_K584015 and BBa_K584016 ).The Ribokey can be activated by a cold shock( BBa_K584014 ). For this plasmid we cloned the lactose- and arabinose-inducible ceaB construct ( BBa_K584016 and BBa_K584015 resp.) and characterized the cold shock promoter using the Biobrick BBa_K584004 .
All our obtained results can also be found at our results section.

Proof of concept——Adhesion platform
Verification of Adhesion platform
We use ice-nuclei to display the monomer streptavidin (mSA) on the surface of E. coli outer membrane and Aga1p-Aga2p system to display the biotin on the yeast cell wall. The mSA on E. coli surface and the biotin on the yeast cell wall form a covalent linkage and bind with other firmly, establishing an adhesion platform.
After sub cloning our target gene onto the vectors successfully, we transformed the plasmids into either E. coli or S. cerevisiae to test the expression and function of corresponding protein, which means they should be integrated in the out membrane or cell wall. Therefore, we conduct Western Blot so that we can prove our result specifically. After that, we need to verify that the heterogeneous cells do adhere to each other through the combination of biotin and mSA. With rhodamine- polyethylene glycol-biotin and FITC-streptavidin, we conducted immunofluorescence staining on both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. By observing through a fluorescence microscope and measuring florescent signal form two kinds of cell, we had a visual validation of parts work. Meanwhile, we explored the optimal condition for their co-culture and drew a conclusion after preliminary experiment.
For more solid a proof of their adhesion, we used Immunofluorescent Localization to demonstrate their relative location and took photos with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for their microstructure. What’s more, we acquired some quantitative data such as the percentage of linkage and expression with FCM. As a result, maybe we can say that our adhesion platform was established successfully.
E.coli strain construction
We assume expressing monomer streptavidin on the outer membrane of E.coli will help us use biotin-avidin system to link E.coli and S.cerevisiae. In part registry, we find BBa_K523013 constructed by team 2011_Edinburgh(http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K523013) encoding INP-eYFP. We acquired INP"

Every program included has its specialty, from bacteria with fluorescence to E.coli that can detect spoiled meat, as well as a kind of automatic LegoTM robot. They were all impressed by the charming synthetic biology shows. iGEM-XMU, a good team with two gold medals in Asia division in the last two years was invited to MIT to compete with the top undergraduates all over the world and achieved a great success. We then introduced our development and our 2013 team, including our project.
We got to know that China had four teams entering the 2012 iGEM-HS competition and made a brilliant achievement. In order to get a better popularization of iGEM-HS in China, we show these high school students some interesting iGEM-HS programs to draw their attention to this competition. Our efforts paid off. Inspired by what they saw, these high school students hoped to popularize synthetic biology and iGEM to make contributions to the development of this interesting project. They believed they can organize a next Chinese iGEM-HS team as well with our help in lab and other aspects. They wished that we can keep a long interaction and cooperation.
During the lecture there was a really positive interaction between these high school students and our team. Every student participates in the knowledge competition, answering questions related to biological safety and some lucky dogs won our special rewards. In order to have a better and deeper communication, our team members exchanged E-mail address and telephone number with some high school students who were really interested what we mentioned in the lecture.
Campus Fair
We held a campus fair and related exhibition with the theme of synthetic biology and iGEM in the Gui Huashan Building, Xiamen University on July 17th afternoon.  The whole activity included three parts——synthetic biology exhibition, game and the Bio Bang cards presentation. To help the participants learn synthetic biology is a challenging but attractive process. These high school students could enjoy the interests in science and technology, know the knowledge about biology and think over ethics in life science through our activities.
We ushered the students to our conference theatre, having them participate in any activities they are interested in and giving them attracting presents. We also gave every participant our badge. The synthetic biology exhibition was composed by some display boards including knowledge of synthetic biology, program display on iGEM, biological safety and genetic engineering. Some information and pictures were from iGEM wiki. We made this exhibition following the lecture to improve our HP effects.

Collaborations
Introduction
The ability to collaborate is essential in a scientific field such cross-sectional as synthetic biology. Our team has collaborated with other iGEM teams in numerous ways as described below.
Helping a new team get on track
We sent our own interlab strain to the Lund iGEM team to help them complete their interlab study,as they experienced some issues with transforming cells with the interlab devices themselves. In doing so, we made sure to abide by all the regional regulations on transporting GMO between borders.
A global problem needs global outreach
In order for a Northern European team like us to do a project that focuses on a tropical disease like snake envenomings, it is not sufficient to merely get inputs from experts within our own region. In our efforts to reach out and engage with health professionals from around the world, we got a lot of  help by Amazonas Brazil and the AshesiGhana teams. They have all helped us to get into contact with professors and doctors from their region with experience in researching and treating snake envenomings. This has led us to get feedback on our project from all major areas of the world that are affected by snake envenomings.
Ethics
We have participated in an ethic discussion hosted by team Uppsala, with attendance from other iGEM teams from Bielefeld-CeBiTec, Grenoble-Alpes, Wageningen UR, and Technion-Israel.

Project Description
Objectives
Our world is obviously facing several urgent problems in which energy crisis is definitely a major one.   Nowadays, there are corresponding solutions to this problem. However, we find that the existing solutions are not satisfactory.   There are solar panels to convert light energy into electricity, but it usually requires a large infrastructure.   However, the efficiency of the conversion process is still not good enough.   In order to improve the situation, our project targets at producing electricity more cheaply, more effectively and in a more portable way.
How can we achieve this?
We employ a light-driven ion pump in our project.   By expressing the pump into our target bacterial strain, we can control the bacteria to pump in ions from the environment,   and eventually produce a salinity difference. Also, we are going to manufacture a pair of specific electrodes.   By making use of the electrodes, the salinity difference as well as our genetically engineered bacteria,   we can generate electricity from the salinity difference which is produced by our genetically engineered bacteria in the presence of light.   It is a brand new way to generate electricity.
What we show in our project is only the tip of thewhole iceberg. More possible applications of halorhodopin could benefit notonly synthetic biology but also the human society. Here we propose several moreadvanced applications of halorhodopsin.
Halorhodopsin could facilitate light detection andlight-coupled inter-cell signal transduction. Light signal could be convertedto intracellular chloride level signal, which thus induces Pgaddownstream genes. The target genes could be constructed to accelerate thesynthesis pathway of quorum sensing signals, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones(AHL)1. As a result,one clone of bacteria could be designed as light detector, amplifying andconverting light signal to quorum signal to cooperate with other clones ofbacteria.
Moreover, halorhodopsin is not the only channel thatcouples light to pump ions. There are other ion channels from retinylideneprotein family sharing similar sequences and structures but pumping other ionsusing light, such as bacteriorhodopsin pumping proton ions out of cells2 andchannelrhodopsin"

Integrated Practices
Our human practice efforts were incorporated throughout our design. Initially knowing little about the antibiotic field, we conducted several interviews with experts to gain a better understanding. Dr. Mendelson, London, and Levy all provided great insight into the complexity of antibiotic use in today's world
A common theme that was present in all expert interviews was antibiotic over-usage. The cost efficiency and availability of antibiotics makes it appealing for medical professionals to prescribe, especially if the diagnosis of the patient isn't yet clear. This is particularly prevalent in developing nations. Additionally, their is a large patient demand for antibiotics, putting additional pressure on medical professionals to supply.
Fortunately, we took Dr. Mendelson's work and integrated it into our project. Besides researching infectious diseases, Dr.Mendelson advocates for clear use surrounding antibiotic resistance (AR). He thinks that clear language such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is necessary to help the population understand the antibiotic epidemic. Hence, this website only uses terms such as ""antibiotic resistant"" or ""drug resistant"" infection; these terms, claims Dr.Mendelson, are what most of the population can understand. Below we outline the expert interviews we conducted and our main takeaways.
Health and public policy
Interview with Dr. Mendelson
Dr. Mendelson’s research revolves around Infectious diseases in countries with high rates of antibiotic resistance (AR). He focuses on models of antibiotic stewardship, antibiotic prescription and response, hospital collaborations and the use of antibiotics in surgical pathways. Most his work centers around international policy development for infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance strategy.
Dr. Mendelson highlights how there are many players in the antibiotic game, not just scientists or doctors. Finance, food production and the general public are often in tandem with the science behind antibiotic resistance (AR). He stressed the importance of education and awareness as well as individual and national responsibility to use antibiotics in a poised manner. Using language that is clear such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is also essential to the fight. Dr. Mendelson thinks that carefully planned use of antibiotics will be a lasting solution in addition to new therapies being created to fight bacteria.
Additionally, we asked for suggestions and things to consider when molding our project. Dr. Mendelson proposed"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

Collaborations
Through our project this year, we had many wonderful opportunities to work with other iGEM teams. These teams included UW Seattle, Oxford, East Chapel Hill High School, Gaston Day School, and many more. One of our major collaborations was with Gaston Day School where we helped give guidance to a high school team. In other collaborations, we made a YouTube Channel where other teams were guest speakers. While all of these were important we also wanted to make sure that we gave back the iGEM community at large; so we created a Reddit Page where all iGEMers can discuss ideas with each other and specifically talk about ideas that can be deemed controversial or taboo by the general public. Click on each of the links to learn more about each of our different Collaboration Projects!
Gaston Day School
For the second year in a row our iGEM team has worked with the Gaston Day School. This year, we continued our mentorship role that we began last year and attempted to help the high school team with troubleshooting protocols, providing fresh lines of cells, and thinking about how to test their project. Click the link above to see pictures and learn more about the specifics of this collaboration.
Mini Convention
In August, our team joined East Chapel Hill High School and Gaston Day School at the Southeastern Mini iGEM Convention ! There we worked on a collaboration project but we also got to know many of the members from each of the schools. One of our members also spoke at the Convention about synthetic biology ethics.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

Decarboxylation
Week 2 (May 7-11)
For the decarboxylation sub-project, the second week was entirely focused on literature research and the practice of basic laboratory techniques. Eight potential pathways were identified as potential candidates for naphthenic acid decarboxylation. The first of these would utilize only the University of Washington's ""PetroBrick"" (from iGEM 2011), consisting of the genes encoding the enzymes acyl-ACP reductase ( AAR ) and aldehyde decarbonylase ( ADC ). We have planned to verify the PetroBrick in the distribution plates and test its efficacy on naphthenic acids in the coming weeks. If this proves to be unsuccessful, we will begin investigating the alternative approaches, beginning with replacing AAR with carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) from Nocardia iowensis, a very unspecific reductase shown to work on structures resembling naphthenic acids. Failing this, the remaining pathways will be examined; however, the disadvantage in these pathways is their direct reliance on the success of the other steps,"

The Problem
Estrogens
Estrogens are classified as Endocrine Disruptor Chemicals (EDCs). They are exogenous compounds capable of interfering negatively with the functioning of the endocrine system, causing adverse effects on the growth, development and reproduction of living beings.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are more than 800 chemicals that can be classified as endocrine disruptors, such as natural and synthetic hormones, pharmaceuticals, plasticizers and pesticides. It is possible to classify estrogens into three categories:
• Natural and Synthetic estrogens: steroid hormones that can be separated into natural or synthetic origin. Naturals are those produced and secreted naturally by the body, while synthetics are developed for medical use in hormone replacement therapies and as contraceptive methods.
• Xenoestrogens: synthetic substances used in industrialized products that mimic the action of estrogens in the body. Among these substances are: polychlorinated biphenyls, flame retardants (mainly brominated diphenyl ethers), phthalates, surfactants, plasticizers and some pesticides.
• Phytoestrogens: compounds such as sitosterol and isoflavonoids, naturally produced by plants, being found in high concentrations in soybean, alfalfa and other vegetables.
Our Focus
Our project focused on seven estrogens: three naturals, one synthetic and three xenoestrogens. Here are some features of our target estrogens:
Natural and Synthetic estrogens:
Estrone (E1): is a steroid sex hormone found both in male and female. It is one of three major endogenous estrogens and it is synthesized from cholesterol and secreted mainly from the gonads, though they can also be formed from adrenal androgens in adipose. Estrone can be converted into estradiol and serves mainly as a precursor or metabolic intermediate of estradiol.
β-Estradiol (E2): is another steroid hormone and the major female sex hormone. It is involved in the regulation of the estrous and menstrual female reproductive cycles. Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics and it also has important effects"

Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a   bio trap against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it   was the most feasible. Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite. The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic.

As would be expected, in each design, terms are highly correlated with themselves (observed as a diagonal red line). Other terms are generally very lowly correlated with different terms. For the CCD-UP, BB, and CCD, the terms at the bottom right of the map have correlations above 0. For CCD-UP and BB, these correlations are still very low, but for CCD they are at about 0.5. Power analysis shows the likelihood of detecting an active effect for terms in the design (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). The CCD-O had a higher Power for all terms, with CCD-UP having the next highest. BB and CCD had lower Power for all terms, but some terms were higher in the BB design than the CC design, and some higher in CC design than the BB design.
Figure 4: CFPS Salt Supplement Surface Response Design Comparison : Comparison of four surface response designs generated by the JMP software using the compare designs feature. From top to bottom: design type, number of reactions required by the design, colour map on correlations, Power analysis of terms, efficiencies, and average prediction variance. For the colour map on correlations, red is highly correlated and blue is highly un-correlated.
D, G, and A efficiencies are a measure of each design to be D, G, and A optimised. A design is D optimal if confidence regions for the vector of regression coefficients are minimized, G optimal if maximum prediction variance over the design region is minimized, and A optimal if the sum of the regression coefficient variance is minimized (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2010). The CCD-UP design has the highest D efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The CCD design has the highest G efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The CCD-UP design has the highest A efficiency and the BB design has the lowest. The last two values analysed to determine which design would be used were the average variance of prediction, for which CCD-O had the lowest and BB had the highest, and the number of reactions required by each design, for which CCD-O had the highest and BB had the lowest. Taking all of the information into account, the CCD-Orthogonal design was chosen as it has no correlations between non-identical terms, high Power for all terms, relatively high efficiency scores, and low prediction variation. CFPS reactions with salt supplement amounts according to the Surface Response experimental design (Table 2) were performed (Figure 5). Five reactions (12-16"

However, treating with microbiotics may be associated with a rang of side effects, from                                 some mild including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea to severe like hearing loss, kidney                                 damage. Some speculation from scientists postulated that exposition of high                                 concentration utilization of antibiotics alter the host microbiota, especially the                                 family of the probiotics, and this has been associated with chronic diseases.
The production of antibiotics in pharmaceutical companies explosively expanded these                                 years. Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich the categories of antibiotics.
Antimicrobial Resistance and                                 Abuses
As the matter of fact, microbiotics, the great saver of our life, is now putting us in                                 potentially tremendous disaster both environmentally and physiologically.
Emergence of antimicrobial resistance is theoretically predictable by evolutionary                                 potential. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains physiologically                                 improved of their cell bodies or genetically enhanced capacity of mutagenesis and gene                                 horizontal transfer like conjugation.
Because of such horizontal genetic exchange, nowadays, efficacy loss may attribute to the                                 emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains. For instance, tuberculosis(TB) in                                 China becomes more difficult with administration with previous antibiotic substances                                 owing to elevating level of antimicrobrial resistance, which raised great challenge on                                 Chinese public health. Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase)                                 in Klebsiella pneumoniae from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in 2008 once                                 may contribute to severe disaster on that broad of beta-lactam antibiotics.
Though, antimicrobial resistance can be transferred through evolutionary theory, main                                 contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals' inappropriate                                 antibiotics treatment, overuse of antibiotics without prescription from professional                                 doctor, instead from self-prescription.
Demonstrably, attribution of antibiotic resistance not only from clinically, but from                                 agriculture and animal husbandry. In China, the overuse of antibiotics for animal is the                                 same serious as the clinical therapy. In farms or hospitals, solution containing                                 antibiotics directly emits to river, which potentially strongly influence the                                 ecological equilibrium of bactierial colonies and sidelong threaten public health.
Antibiotics                                 Production and                                 Contamination in China
Because individuals neglecting antibiotic emission, rivers in China now encounter                                 extremely antibiotic contamination.

Applications
As explained in the theory section , VHb can be used to increase the yield of proteins under oxygen-limited conditions. In this section, we present a review of some applications were the technology has proven itself useful. The practical benefits of VHb co-expression have been harnessed in order to increase the production of proteins [1][2] and growth of rice [3], maize [4] and the tobacco plant [5]. VHb can also be used in bioremediation of toxic compounds such as textile dyes [6] and aromatic compounds [7].
Enzymes
β-galactosidase is an enzyme commonly used for removal of lactose from milk, which is required to make it drinkable for more than half of the world’s population [8]. Wu et al. [1] managed to increase the production of this enzyme by 9.9% under non-limiting aeration, proving the benefit of VHb co-expression. The host organism Pichia pastoris demonstrated an improvement of 28.2% in oxygen uptake rate when grown in shake flasks. Another industrial enzyme, ɑ-amylase, was also co-expressed with VHb [2]. An 18% increase of the enzyme concentration was noted when cultivated in a bioreactor under non-limiting aeration. This strengthens the argument that VHb can emit similar benefits when scaling up the process.
Plants
Expression of VHb has also been studied in plants and shown to induce physiological changes. Wang et al. [9] managed to successfully integrate the VHb gene into Arabidopsis thaliana, which resulted in multiple positive effects: substantially taller plants, faster generation time and increased resistance to flooding compared to the wild-type.
Water-logging, where water saturates the roots of the plant, is a common issue in agriculture with about 6 to 10 million hectares of land affected in India alone [10]. In 2011, the average crop yield of rice, cereals and wheat in India was 2636 kg/hectare according to the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation [11]. To put this in perspective, 6 to 10 millions of hectares equals approximately 16 000 to 26 000 million kg of food affected by water-logging every"

What is a Riboswitch?
A riboswitch is a piece of mRNA that regulates gene expression. There are primarily two types of riboswitches: translational and transcriptional riboswitches. The fluoride riboswitch is a transcriptional riboswitch (Figure 2), which means that a terminator is formed when the riboswitch is transcribed that limits the processivity of the RNA polymerase transcribing downstream genes. When the aptamer (ligand-binding) region of the fluoride riboswitch interacts with fluoride, the terminator is not formed allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and transcribe the downstream gene.
Figure 2: Schematic of a transcriptional riboswitch
2015 Exeter iGEM Team, RNA Riboswitches
In our project, we will use the fluoride riboswitch. In Figure 3 you can see a crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch. How can a negatively charged piece of RNA bind to a negatively charged fluoride ion? The fluoride riboswitch encapsulated three Mg2+ ions that can bind to the fluoride ion (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Crystal structure of a fluoride riboswitch
Aiming Ren, Kanagalaghatta R. Rajashankar, Dinshaw J. Patel “Fluoride ion encapsulation by Mg2+ ions and phosphates in a fluoride riboswitch” 2012 Nature 486, 85–89
In nature the riboswitch regulates the expression of genes that help the organism deal with high levels of fluoride. These genes are often pumps that allow fluoride to be exported out of the cell (Figure 4). In E. coli the gene crcB encodes a fluoride efflux channel that removes excess fluoride from the cell so that it is no longer toxic. In E. coli when the crcB gene is genetically deleted (ΔcrcB), the phenotype is increased sensitivity to fluoride and concentrations above 500μM are lethal. In our experiments we needed to utilize the ΔcrcB E. coli strain so that fluoride could accumulate intracellularly.

Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," reduction. This one is related to the mer operon. The resistance of the operon is associated with the activity of regulated proteins and expressed by a group of genes called mer operon, which is present in the region of transposon plasmids and in some cases, on the chromosome. The mechanism of resistance is similar and the genes are conserved for any group of bacteria (Trevors, 1986; Pinto, 2004). In terms of organization and sequence, the plasmids containing the operon present themselves so well preserved homologous genes, and its basic structure known as merRTPAD, in some cases there is occurrence of merRTPA(B) and bacteria that behave megaplasmids with merRTP(C/F)A(B)D(E)(F) (Osborn et al, 1997;. Mergeay et al, 2003;. Nascimento and Chartone-Souza, 2003; Champier et al, 2004).
Figure 4. Working system from Mer operon.
This operon has great bioremediator capacity for presenting carrier function protein (merP and merT) displacing Hg from the periplasm to the cytoplasm: merT encoding a hydrophobic polypeptide of approximately 12.4 kDa comprising 116 amino acid residues. merP is a protein located in the periplasmic space and has size of about 9.4 kDa to about 91 amino acid residues (Belliveau & Trevorst, 1989; Miller, 1999, Brown et al. 2002). There catalytic function of proteins (Mera and Merb) that transform Hg2+ and CH3Hg on Hg0.
MerR is the gene encoding cytoplasmic protein that controls transcription of the structural genes merTP(C)A(B)D(E). Its product is a homodimer of about 15.9 kDa with 144 amino acid residues (Belliveau & Trevorst, 1989; Miller, 1999, Brown et al. 2002). According Shewchuk et al (1989) merR dimer binds to a single atom of Hg.
The regulation of expression of the mer operon is negative inducible, being performed by merR. In the absence of mercury, merR forms a promoter-operator complex, so the RNA polymerase cannot recognize the promoter and messenger RNA from other genes involved in resistance to mercury is not produced (repressor).

5-10 year old group
For this age group, we prepared and modified one of the national child game. In this game there is a circle of group of child, one is not included in that circle. He/she runs around the circle and labels two of the participants in the circle. When the labelled kids realized that, they leave the circle and new kids join the circle. The video below shows our modified game in which four kids that out of circle are our restriction enzymes wearing white caps. Moreover, we have three insert groups which wear red, green and yellow caps. The blue capped ones are our backbone.
During the game we explained kids what DNA, enzyme and insert are, and what we have done as a Synthetic Biology research group.
10-17 year old group
This group consists of high school aged children groups.Through out the workshop,  we have paired them in doubles. Firstly, we have explained  Synthetic Biolgy  and what Synthetic Biology is able to do. After these training, we explained them our project and taught them basic molecular biology procedures and what are the requirements of basic synthetic biology based experiments. We have done the experiments (cloning procedures) together and also they did individually. We also encouraged them to join iGEM High School division.
Official Announcement To All Universities For Introduction Of Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competetion
For the last human practice approach, we believed that we  should inform especially students from other universities about synthetic  biology as students in universities are the ones who can improve this field for  further generations. For that purpose, we published an official message from  our instructor, Prof. Dr. Mahinur Akkaya, with this message, students from  other universities –regardless of their department that they’re studying in-  will be aware of the field synthetic biology and may not only consider about  learning more but also consider about creating an iGEM team for coming years.  Here is the original official message and its brief translation for you to  read:

Sensing Overview
We designed, modeled and tested an mRNA sensor that interfaces with RNA-based strand displacement circuitry.
Sensing Design
We imposed the following criteria on our mRNA sensor design:
orthogonality
easy integration with strand displacement circuits
ability to amplify a signal
ease of sensor generation
The way we implemented this sensor is by considering the mRNA sequence and choosing within it two consecutive abstract domains: the toehold and the sensing domains. These domains mirror the toehold and recognition domains in strand displacement, so provide an interface to any strand displacement circuit. Specifically, the chosen toehold and sensing domain will then directly interface with an intermediate gate:output complex using toehold-mediated strand displacement, with signal amplification achieved using a fuel strand.
Illustration of an mRNA sensor. A toehold region in the mRNA can bind to the toehold on a gate:output complex. Branch migration can then occur, resulting in a free output signal. Using fuel, the mRNA can be released from the gate, enabling it to react with another gate:output complex.
However, this abstraction needs to take into account the secondary structure of mRNA: some regions are more accessible (less basepairing), while others are strongly basepaired and thus unavailable to be directly sensed by mechanisms that involve basepairing to the mRNA ( Kertesz et al. 2007 ).
Software rendered secondary structure of eBFP2 (BBa_K779300) showing various secondary structure elements (e.g. stems and loops)
Much work has been done to generate these secondary structures computationally (see nupack.org ), and to find accessible regions predicted to be miRNA binding sites within mRNAs (e.g. PITA ). We leveraged these algorithms to identify potential toehold and sensing domains within mRNAs by looking for regions with different levels of accessibility.
Once suitable domains have been chosen using modeling of the secondary structure, we can rank them by their orthogonality to other transcribed RNAs. These sequences"
