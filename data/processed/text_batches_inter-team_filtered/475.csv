Procedure to make competent cells started
One colony of TOP10 E. coli added to 50ml of LB broth. Incubated overnight in the shaking incubator
Planned and prepared for transformation
Media made up:
Two litres of 0.1 mM HEPES
One litre of LB broth (for making competent cells)
100ml of 10% glycerol
Ampicillin made up with water to make 8 x 1ml aliquots of 100mg/ml

Epigenetic Flip Flop
Background
Background
Cell differentiation and environmental adaptation depends on external and internal perturbations, as a response of cellular behavior for survival or linage trade-offs. This adaptation is attained by several robust cellular networks, which are based on expression or repression of the appropriate genes. ( Bühler & Gasser, 2009 ; Huang, 2003 ) In yeast there exist two main inhibitory mechanisms to regulate gene expression, activation/repression of specific promoters and gene silencing. Both mechanisms are based on similar molecular mechanisms, which involve binding of eukaryotic factors to the DNA, and the recruitment of enzymes and structural proteins that modify promoter activity that eventually result in the execution of a particular expression program. Compaction of chromatin and the consequent heterocromatin formation are usually mediated by silencing proteins and proteins-recruiting DNA sequences, that can interact over long distances. Silencing has an important role in yeast, for example, in mating type, lineage specification, centrosome silencing and compact telomeres structure. ( Ratna et al, 2009 ; Bühler & Gasser, 2009 ; Huang, 2003 )
Beyond the deciphering of the Human Genome, epigenetics has become one of the new challenges of the 21st century. However, because of the complexity of the epigenetic code, there is still a lot to discover before it could be completely understood. Even though little is know about the regulation of the heritability between generations, it is a fact that there exist huge and intriguing networks that coordinate the activation and inactivation of gene expression, and also the maintenance of cell identity. The stability and heritability of the states are thought to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. Nevertheless, some of the patterns that govern the switch"

However, the fluorescence output from their switch was inefficient. As a result, we started to look for potential problems and corresponding improvements that can be applied to the Brown design.
Potential Problem of the Brown's Design
After reviewing some literature, we found out that the potential problem of their design might be due to the use of BAD/AraCp. The major problem of BAD/AraCp is the dual function of AraC protein, which can both activate and repress BADp. In the absence of arabinose, the dimeric AraC protein molecule will contact I2 and O2 half-sites on the DNA, which generates a DNA loop, interfering the access of RNA polymerase to the 2 promoters , repressing BADp. When arabinose is present, AraC binds to I1 and I2 half-sites on the DNA, which allows the binding of RNA polymerase; thus, will stimulate the transcription of BADp. The dual function of AraC protein complicates the behavior of BAD/AraCp which pose potential threat to the stability of the Tristable Switch.
In contrast, both TetR and LacI, can only act as repressors to their corresponding promoters. In the presence of their corresponding inducers, aTc and IPTG, respectively, the affinity of the repressor binding to the operator sites of the promoter will be reduced and thus activate transcription.
Our Design
Our design aims to achieve three main characteristics:  stable and distinct signal output, and fast state-switching rate. In which stability is the major goal that we would like to achieve. As a results, strengths of the promoters need to be similar. The Tristable Switch was built in 3 modules, separated according to the promoter that drives its expression. For characterization of all smaller constructs, a medium-strength RBS (BBa_B0032) was used.
phlFp Profile
tetp Profile
lacp Profile
1. phlFp
The major difference between the two designs are that we substituted BAD/AraCp with phlFp. As PhlF is a member of the TetR family repressors, therefore, the repressor behave similar as TetR in which the binding of the inducer DAPG with the repressor will lower the it’s affinity to bind to the operator sites of the promoter, in turn activates promoter transcription."

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22
Modeling commenced with Mark Aronson, former iGEM president and current advisor who Skyped the team from New York. A working bioreactor model is top priority, with layers of complexity to be added as experimental data is collected. Phosphorus genes were again transformed into competent cells, and newly-received plasmids resuspended after transport.
THURSDAY, JUNE 23
Transformed phosphorus cells were inoculated, several colonies taken from LB agar plates and suspended in LB broth with ampicillin to incubate overnight. All phosphorus genes also underwent PCR amplification. An afternoon Skype call with the University of Exeter in England topped off the day as teams exchanged greetings, project synopses, and ideas for future collaboration.
FRIDAY, JUNE 24
A Shewanella oneidensis culture, generously donated by Argonne National Laboratory, arrived amidst great celebration on Friday morning. This Shewie will serve as a basis of comparison for E. coli expressing organic nanowires. The team was busy in the lab making and running gels for phosphorus and re-transforming phosphorus genes after Thursday’s inoculations proved less than satisfactory. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln Skyped in the afternoon, which was especially relevant as they are tackling a similar wastewater treatment dealing with nitrogen and nitrate remediation. A rewarding end to a productive week.
Week 6
JUNE 27 – JULY 1
This week, things are going to be shaken up a little bit. Here’s a quick summary of the goings-ons in short paragraph form:
The team visited Imagination Station in downtown Lafayette regarding the possibility of volunteering both this summer and continuing forward. Imagination Station is a museum with interactive exhibits; iGEM would assist by educating about synthetic biology. This would be a great opportunity for club community outreach, and we’re excited to launch this collaboration together.
Lab work continued with PCR amplification, gel electrophoresis, extractions, and transformations of phosphorus and nanowire genes.
Collaboration Skype calls with Exeter, the University of Chicago, and SVCE Chennai were successful. Exeter and UChicago are onboard to help with database entries and protein characterization, and SVCE will distribute a survey about wastewater management practices.

Recombination directionality factor’s (RDF or gp3) ability to reverse the integrase actuation direction allowing the inducible stress-promoter to acquire the active state was demonstrated in this experiment. Following the experimental design we proved the effectiveness of the RDF in the recombination system.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the expression of gp3 together with PhiC31 trigger luciferase expression obtaining expression levels similars to a weak promoter (Pnos promoter). Interestingly, the highest level of luciferase expression (expression levels similar to a weak promoter — pNOS) was obtained with a low RDF expression (infiltrated at OD 0.1). Whereas, when the RDF was relatively high (infiltrated at OD 0.1, that is 2-fold in comparison with the other experimental treatment), the activation was lower than a weak promoter (pNOS) expression levels.
Conclusion: The ability of the recombinase directionality factor (RDF) to reverse the integrase action direction was demonstrated. Thus, postulating as the best way to control the direction of the stress-inducible promoter to express a color inducing protein.
RDF CHARACTERIZATION
RDF:phiC31 ratios define re-inversion efficiency. Bearing that in mind, we resolved to demonstrate that the optimal ratio between RDF and PhiC31 is 20:1 using a weak promoter for the recombinase expression and a strong one for the RDF. However, several experiments were performanced in order to demonstrate this hypothesis.

Stanford-Brown,2015,Team:Stanford-Brown#PS_-_-_TEXT.html," Numerically simulating the model in MATLAB gave us curves that represented the species concentration as a function of time over a specified period.
FDC and PAL’s influence on the overall reaction flux was tested by varying each of their concentrations while keeping the other constant. It was found that changing the concentration of FDC significantly increase the rate of the reaction, while changing PAL concentration did little to the rate of reaction.
In conclusion, our in vitro testing and mathematical models helped us both verify our enzymes functionality and determine which enzymes were most significant to the rate of styrene production. See below for all of the specific protocols used in this section of our project.  See the modeling section for more information on our modeling approach.
In-vivo production and in-situ removal of Styrene
Step one:  Making combo plasmid
Styrene Synthesis Operon made using Gibson Assembly
Now that we had determined the importance of our enzymes to styrene production we planned on creating an operon of our three genes of interest, PAL, UbiX, and FDC for in vivo testing.  The genes closest to the beginning of the operon are transcribed more than those to the end [1].  Therefore, we would place our most influential enzymes toward the beginning and our less influential enzymes toward the end. The order of our operon is FDC, UbiX then PAL.  We assembled the operon in a plasmid using Gibson Assembly and used DNA sequencing to confirm the order of the genes.  We then transformed our combo plasmid into T7 expressing cells to extract our protein as before.  Again, we ran our proteins sample on an SDS PAGE and confirmed that not only were all of our proteins expressing correctly, but that we had the most FDC and least PAL, as expected.
Step two:  In-situ removal
Cell cultures with and without solvent
A major issue with producing styrene in vivo is that styrene is actually toxic to the cell at concentrations as low as 300 mg/L [4].  So in order to make styrene production practical in vivo we would have to either make our cells more resistant to styrene or find a way to remove the styrene as it was being produced.  Because there is little known about why styrene is toxic to the cell, we decided to focus on the latter.  We found a paper that used an immiscible solvent, n-dodecane, to remove styrene in situ from cell cultures that produced styrene.
The solvent did not impede cell growth and was able to more than double the total styrene"

Once the plasmid is cleaved, kanamycin resistance is not passed down to daughter cells, thereby leading to cell death and lower culture density. The Mutant GFP P1 group did not show any significant different decrease in colony count, but the Mutant GFP P2 showed a significant decrease. We expected mutants to show an increase in colony survival due to the procurement of mutations that do not match the sgRNA base pairing region over time. However, we only see a slight increase from GFP to Mutant GFP P2. The RFP control did not have any significant decrease in colony count, but there was wide variation in the system. We expected to see no decrease in colony count because RFP is not targeted by the GFP sgRNA. It is possible that the slight difference observed between the two groups could be due to the added stress of induction, but the difference was not significant for us to conclude that Cas9 activation itself lowers colony count.
The conclusions that can be drawn from this data are limited as the distinction between the non-mutant GFP group and the other groups are not definitive. This data suggests that our system is somewhat functional, but more trials will have to be conducted for more reliable results.
Sequencing Results
From the plating tests, we searched for colonies with interesting phenotypes indicative of a change in the chromophore region of GFP. We were hoping to see several different colors, or absence of color, but only ended up encountering green and white colonies. We would have preferred to run this test several times over, but were unable to complete all desired testing due to time constraints.
We selected 10 mutant GFP P1 induced colonies, 15 mutant GFP P2 induced colonies, 2 mutant GFP P1 non-induced colonies, 2 mutant GFP P2 non-induced colonies, 2 non-mutant GFP induced colonies, and 3 uninduced non-mutant GFP non-induced colonies for sequence analysis. These colonies were grown overnight in kanamycin and then miniprepped. It should be noted that only kanamycin was included in these overnight cultures in order to reduce the prevalence of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid, while retaining the GFP plasmid. Given enough time we would have preferred to cure these cells entirely of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid before miniprepping, but this was unfortunately not an option. These samples were then sequenced using primers specific to GFP.
Upon analyzing the sequencing data, we found that many of the colonies selected lacked mutations within the region of interest"

Part  1. Selection of acid tolerance component ( msmK )
    The key point of this part is selecting the gene related to anti-acid characteristic. Because the mechanism of acid resistance is complicated, and genes are connected to each other, it is hard to  confirm the most significant gene.      Gnomic mutagenesis and high throughout screening are carried out to obtain anti-acid mutant strains with significant higher survival rate under specific acid environment (pH 4.0 ,5h). Then analyze the diff-genes data between mutant strain and parent strain on pH 4.0 and pH 7.0 respectively. A dimensionality reduction model is established and five possible acid-resistant genes are obtained. Finally, with experiment verification and pathway analysis, msmK gene is shown to be the key anti-acid gene.

    Chemical mutagenesis
    The dose of DES for chemical mutagenesis was 0.5% (v·v-1), the treatment was 30 min, and the mortality rate was 85.3%. Under the condition of pH 5.0, two acid-resistant strains were screened from 20,000 strains, respectively. L. lactis WH101 and L. lactis WH102.
    UV mutagenesis
    The UV mutagenesis conditions were UV lamp power of 15 W, irradiation time of 50 s, irradiation distance of 30 cm, and lethality rate of 92.1%. Under the condition of pH 5.0, the acid-resistant strain L. lactis WH103 was screened from 15000 strains.
    High throughput screening
    With high throughput screening, we got 3 mutants that can survive at pH 5.0 for 4 hours, and we named them as L. lactis WH101、L. lactis WH102、L. lactis WH103.

We obtained a RMSD of 1.84Å for the streptavidin and of 1.37Å for the CipA. And the results showed that this protein was more efficient about the fixation on paper.
HBsAg with His-Tag de novo modeling
HBsAg, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, is one of the biomarkers we want to detect in our device. For the purification of this protein, we needed to put a His-Tag, either at the N- or C-termini of the protein sequence. We made a PSI-BLAST against the PDB and no structure was available for a homology modeling. So we realized a de novo modeling using the software Rosetta[9] to modelize the 3D structures of the protein with the His-Tag at both ends.
We had 20 models for each His-tag position and we wanted to choose the best models:
Best Z-score for the C-terminus = -3.44
Best Z-score for the N-terminus = -4.23
Figure 9: Comparison with non-redundant set of PDB structures of HBsAg C-terminus His-tagged models (red cross)
Figure 10: Comparison with non-redundant set of PDB structures of HBsAg N-terminus His-tagged models (red cross)
This low scores are due to the fact that this protein is on the cell membrane.
Then we compared the 2 positions of the His-tag:

Figure 12: 3D structure of HBsAg with a N-terminus His-Tag (green)
We can see that the C-terminus His-Tag is near an α-helix so it is not very accessible. The N-terminus His-Tag is more accessible so we decided to put it here for the purification of HBsAg.
Sadly, we didn’t succeed in cloning this part in a plasmid so we could not experiment the purification with the His-Tag at the N-terminus.

Background
In the development of biosynthesis, numerous logic pathways have been designed to fullfil certain functions. However, all these imaginative designs lack an important feature ---- once they are designed, no further alter can be done to the unit, which makes it difficult to be applied as fundamental units to large-scale complex systems.
Inspiration
Since many of us frequently deal with complex electric circuits, we get inspiration from an electronic component, PLD, to solve this problem. A PLD or programmable logic device is used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. Unlike a logic gate, which has a fixed function, a PLD has an undefined function at the time of manufacture. Before the PLD can be used in a circuit it must be programmed, that is, reconfigured. As is the fact, PLD serves as a milestone in the progress of digital technology and is now widespread in digital logic experiments. Thus we were motivated to apply it in cells and make  logic-flexible, in another word, programmable gene circuits.

The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter four
Summer slept a wink. She kept trying various methods to crack what this yellow powder was so that if there was a danger that she could find. Deep inside, she believed that the quieter, the more dangerous.
Experimental research was inconclusive, Summer had to get out of the lab to see if there was any changes. Once she was out of the lab, she found that the house view had totally changed, all the plants far less dynamic. They just looked like they were groaning. Summer felt pain at that moment, but more of a rage. ""Who did it! ""
Leaning against the glass, four little guys were clearly stunned, one reason was the sight outside of the house, the other reason was that after a whole night of fighting, their goddess didn’t advance any further to solve the problem, which had never happened before. You would never know what is in her little mind. The little prince also woke up. He stunned after he saw the view outside.
Summer struggled to run outside, taking a variety of grass, leaves, flowers, soil, and the air as samples to her lab for testing. Nothing can beat the Flame Angel. After many times of fighting, she finally found out the cause. Unintentionally, she touched a book while there were no results in her tests. That"
SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark#test_-_-_TEXT.html," protein expression of the RFP reporter.
The strong promoter, BBa_J23102 , exhibited a comparatively high expression of the reporter RFP and an increasing high level of noise throughout growth.
For further information about the experiments and a proposed cause for the increasing noise level, read here.
As the strong constitutive promoter exhibited the most uniform expression, this was chosen to regulate the expression of the photocontrol device genes. With the modelling results in mind, it was decided that the relB gene should be regulated by a tightly controllable uniform promoter, thereby ruling out the constitutive promoter family members as a possibility.
Expression Level of the Mnt- and Penl-Regulated Promoters
The PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device, as it mediated a stronger expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter.
The cloning of the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , and the photocontrol device, BBa_K519030 , emerged problematic. For further information about these difficulties, read here.
Consequently, the applicability of two different promoters was studied. These were the PenI-regulated, BBa_R0074 , and the Mnt-regulated promoters, BBa_R0073 , whose repressors are not found in E. coli, making the gene expression constitutive in this organism. The relative expression and noise levels were quantitatively assessed using fluorescence microscopy of a YFP reporter system expressed on pSB1C3 in MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5. For this purpose an Olympus IX83 with a photometrics prime camera was used with exposure time for YFP at 200 ms.
Figure 16. Fluorescence microscopy of YFP under the control of PenI-regulated and Mnt-regulated promoters on pSB1C3 in E. coli MG1655 at OD600=0.3-0.5.
From the data obtained, it was evident that the PenI-regulated promoter mediated a substantially higher level of YFP expression than the Mnt-regulated promoter, as seen in Figure 16. Furthermore, the PenI-regulated promoter displayed a notably lower level of noise. On the basis of these results, the PenI-regulated promoter was chosen to control the expression of the photocontrol device.
Leaky Expression by the OmpR-Regulated Promoter on Different Vectors
The leaky expression by the OmpR-regulated promoter is reduced when cloned into a low copy vector compared to a high copy vector.

NEU_China_A,2018,Team:NEU China A#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," often seen as a last resort, but as the understanding of the disease                         continues to deepen, it has been found that some patients with early-stage IBD have a better                         quality of life than patients who administrate biological agents [27]. This provides us with a                         new top down therapy that prioritizes the use of surgery. But for patients with complex IBD,                         surgical treatment can easily lead to disability and a significant decline in quality of life.
There are pros and cons to specific drug treatments. Non-specific anti-inflammatory drugs are                         inexpensive, and immunosuppressive agents are effective, which can reduce the need for surgery                         and hospitalization in patients with IBD, and reduce the risk of clinical recurrence and                         glucocorticoid dependence in patients with IBD [28]. However, non-specific anti-inflammatory                         drugs are prone to tolerance and fail. Biologics are currently the most effective drugs, but                         they are expensive and difficult for ordinary people to bear. For example, in the United                         States, 75 kg of IBD patients are treated with a standard dose of infliximab, which costs about                         $26,700 per year, while a year of azathioprine (a biologic immunosuppressive agents) costs only                         $750 per year [28]. Therefore, immunosuppressive agents are a reasonable and cost-effective                         treatment strategy for patients with IBD and still have value in use [28]. In addition,                         clinical studies have found that anti-TNF biologics combined with steroid immunosuppressive                         agents have better efficacy than monotherapy. At the same time, the risk of solid tumors and                         serious infections increases [29]. In short, IBD patients need tailored personalized treatment                         options.
The recent emergence of Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) provides a new option for the                         treatment for IBD. FMT is referred as transplanting the flora of healthy human feces into the                         intestine of a patient, rebuilding the normal intestinal flora, and achieving the purpose of                         treating diseases inside and outside the intestine. However, FMT itself has a difficult choice                         of donors, long-term safety is not clear, patients with low acceptance and poor efficacy, thus,                         the efficacy of FMT for IBD is limited [30].
6. Our solution
This year, our team NEU_China_A try to use engineered bacteria to                         explore an inexpensive, safe and efficient way to deal with the dilemma in the intestinal tract                         of patients with IBD. See project design for details.

EPF-Lausanne,2008,Team:EPF-Lausanne# Microfluidics_-_-_TEXT.html," was removed on the Chr etching bench and the masks were finally cleaned in a hot bath of 1165 remover.
The masks were used to expose the corresponding wafers. Wafers were then baked slowly up to 100°C and developed with PGMEA and 2-propanol. For the positive resist (AZ9260), an additional bake was performed for 20 min at 160°C in order to round the edges of the flow channels.
PDMS chip fabrication
Once the wafers are ready, they are used as molds for PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)). The designed chip has two layers: flow level, where the cells will ultimately grow and control layer, used to close and open certain valves by putting under pressure the thin membrane between the control and the flow layers.
As both layers serve different purposes, their fabrication also differs.
The production of the PDMS chip is performed as follows:  The PDMS mix for control (C) and flow (F) layers is prepared separately. C-layer PDMS is a 5:1 mix of silicone and silicone curing agent. F-layer is a 20:1 mixture. Once the correct proportions have been measured, the mix is placed in a mixing defoaming machine that mixes the silicone and the curing agent in a homogeneous substance.
The liquid C-layer PDMS is casted directly on the wafer and set in a vacuum pump to eliminate any bubbles. The F-layer PDMS needs to form a very thin film over the wafer, so a spin coat machine is used.
Once both wafers are cast with PDMS, they are placed at 80°C for exactly 30 min. After the baking time, the PDMS from C-layer is solid and can be cut out from the wafer.
We now have two distinct layers that need to be aligned with each other. This process is done manually under a microscope.
Once the chips are aligned, they are baked again at 80°C for 90 minutes. After this final bake, the C and F layers are tightly bound together. They can be easily detached from the wafer and put on a glass film for use in experiment. Again, if needed, additional wholes are punched. In the end the result is impressive!
Setup of the Experiment
The product of the previous fabrication process can now be used in the experiment. The setup is the following:
The connections with the chip are done using thin tubing and syringes. When the chip is ready to use the connections look like this:

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a better chance of controlling the exact response we want. This may be done in a number of ways, from utilisation of an off-switch regulator, CpxP, to additonal pathways used to create a bio-logic gate or even by optimisation of buffer solution.
A brief explanation of the Cpx Pathway
The Cpx pathway responds to various membrane stresses; it is a two component signal transduction pathway. The first component is CpxA, an inner membrane protein which, when bound to CpxP (an inhibitor molecule), is inactive. When CpxP is unbound from CpxA, CpxA undergoes autophosphorylation. A kinase enzyme then phosphorylates CpxR, the second component in the pathway, which then binds to the pCpxR promoter and activates transcription.
There is still a lot of debate regarding the detailed mechanisms of the pathway, with many different theories proposed, but it is thought that membrane stress causes the misfolding of proteins (pili being the main contributor), which in turn causes misfolded subunits to accumulate in the periplasm, which in turn titrates the CpxP inhibitor molecule into the unbound state, thereby activating the pathway. We have started development of a rules-based model to help discern the processes involved with the pathway.

The best way ever to preserve lithic relics
an innovative biochemical method to resolve erosion.
View Our Works
The inscriptions on Precipice are one of the most common and fundamental forms of traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and raindrops, which is often the case for most of them,the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently, there are quite a few methods to resolve this phenomenon but some of them are not used properly which occasionally cause the damage for the Inscriptions. Our research project aims at using microorganism method, which is to put a plasmid with the ability to convert bio-oriented oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid into the cell of E.coil, inducing the cell and the product will react with one component of the Inscriptions-- calcium carbonate-- to generate nearly insoluble calcium oxalate monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ablility to secrete lipase has also been constructed; we aim to add this cell when we are cleansing the Inscriptions to resolve the oil substances on the surface of them. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics either from human errors as cleaning and protecting or from natural damnification.

       The area near Qiantang River has a profound history of wealth. Hangzhou, in the heart of this area, situated many astonishing lithic cultural relics. Most of them were made during The Ten Kingdoms (A.D. 891-A.D. 979) and Song Dynasty (A.D. 960- A.D. 1279). Not only do those lithic relics represent the cutting edge of stone carving technology in contemporary time, but"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," DNaseAlert to detect Cas12a, as the last of the three modules we designed, we needed to prove that DNaseAlert was indeed cut and would emit fluorescence to our expectations, so that it could be used to transfer our signals.
Here, we chose DNase I to verify directly. In the presence or absence of DNase I, we measured fluorescence intensity in the DNase alert tube. Considering the experiences we got previously that long-term measurement in the microplate reader would lead to reduction in fluorescence intensity, resulting in experimental error, we chose fluorescence spectrometer instead.
We set up the experimental group (with DNase I) and the control group (without DNase I), with the time gradient of 3, 15, 30 minutes. All groups started at the same time. We didn't operate continuous measurement, to avoid excitation that may cause partial fluorescence quenching. After incubation, 3 mL TE buffer was added, and then detect the fluorescence intensity. Get more information of our experiment, click here.
Figure 6. Fluorescence intensity curve in 3rd minutes, with or without DNase I.
Figure 7. Fluorescence intensity curve in 15th minutes, with or without DNase I.
Figure 8. Fluorescence intensity curve in 30th minutes, with or without DNase I.
From the Figure 6-8, we could find that cutting efficiency of DNase I was very high, almost all of the DNaseAlert substrate has been cut in 3 minutes, fluorescence intensity in 15 and 30 minutes and 3 minutes almost kept the same level. As we expected, DNaseAlert could indeed be cleaved and then re-released as a fluorescent group. In other words, DNaseAlert could transfer the molecular signal to the fluorescent signal actually.
Integrated experiment
After making each part work effectively, we accomplished the integrated experiment finally, transferring the protein signal to fluorescent one.
Similarly, following procedures mentioned in the ""competition method"" part, we successfully hatched the streptavidin beads, biotin-modified aptamers and fluorescent complementary strands to form the complexes, then fixed the beads with magnets and discarded the supernatant, which would still contain fluorescent complementary strands that did not form complexes. After that, we incubated the complex with EpCAM to achieve the process of competition. After competition, we fixed the magnetic beads with magnet, adding the supernatant extracted into Cas12a-crRNA complex incubated previously to activate Cas12a protein. Finally, we added it into DNaseAlert, supplementing "

They are the most puncture resistant, often referred to as “medical grade”. They have a high level of sensitivity, mold to the hand, good for an extended amount of time, work well for high-risk situations involving infectious material, resist many chemicals, have a long shelf life and are colored to help identify if the glove has been punctured. Vinyl gloves are less durable, less expensive, looser, good for short-term, low-risk tasks, have anti-static properties, are best used for non-hazardous materials and are lightly powdered.

The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.
Demand
As we have demonstrated, excessive ammonia in the fish pond is one of the main problems that limited the development of fresh water aquaculture. Excessive ammonia will lead to the deterioration of water quality and effect the taste of the fish. It will also lead to the outbreak of fish diseases and cause fish death, heavily decreasing the yield of the fish pond. If we cannot solve the problem of excessive ammonia, it will be problematic to increase the breeding density and to improve the fish quality, thus effecting the income of fish farmers.
So essential as the problem of excessive ammonia is, there are certain solutions fish farmers will apply empirically. During the high-risk period, fish farmers will frequently visit their ponds and observe the water quality and fish conditions. Once there is any manifestation indicting excessive ammonia or fish diseases, they will take emergency measures such as disinfecting the pond and changing pond water.
Given the fact that fish farmers are judging by virtue of experience, there will always be deviation. When any manifestation occurs, excessive ammonia has actually erupted already. Although there are some products of ammonia detection on the market, they are either too expensive for fish farmers to afford or inconvenient to use (See more details on products comparison in entrepreneurship ). In addition, they measures they usually take to deal with excessive ammonia are either too expensive or too troublesome. According to our research (See more details on Integrated HP), big aquaculture companies usually choose running water to breed fish, which, in places lack of surface water, will cost up to 200 thousand yuan per month and waste thousands tons of underground water. Self-employed fish pond tend to choose chemical agents to remove ammonia, but this method is not efficient enough and is not eco-friendly.
Therefore, an effective, convenient and cheap way to detect and degrade ammonia is in strong demand of fish farmers.
Design
Based on the principle of efficiency, convenience and economy, we designed a device to detect the ammonia concentration in the fish pond with the application of our engineered bacteria and introduced another strain of engineered E. coli to covert ammonia in the pond water to nitrogen or uric acid precipitation.
By introducing bacteria into the sensing system can reduce the cost of detection components. Our engineered bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP."

After the big peak of the epidemiology, diagnostics are still applicable but only risk groups relevant for the disease will be diagnosed. This requires characterization of the disease.
From dr. Marianne van der Sande we learned that it is hard to predict where an epidemic might reoccur. This is due to the fact that pathogens can have a diverse effect on each segregation of the human population, by the different genetic makeup of each different person and due to corresponding resistances.
When prevention of an outbreak is the goal of the diagnostic, the difficulty lies in funding. Preventing recurrence comes down to screening in the field with diagnostics which requires expertise and material over a long period. We learned from dr. Erwan Piriou that although plenty of funds become available for diagnosis and eventual medication when the epidemic is still relevant, it seems these funds are not available anymore once the danger has passed. This sadly results in recurring epidemics, which could have been prevented by more effective screening.
By building Mantis in a local community on low costs, and facilitating big data gathering, we hope to facilitate monitoring and make it more available for the public.

The average number of colonies with the negative control is 121. In contrast, a cell layer was observed for the NAG plates with every concentration, indicating that a large number of cells have been inoculated in the plates.
Thus, we assumed that WT B. subtilis was more attracted by NAG than by fuchsin. In addition we could neglect the bacterial growth because the test only lasted one hour. We also neglected diffusion and osmolality phenomena for the reasons explained above.
Unfortunately for us we forgot one major effect… Can you believe that fuchsin solution contains about 15% of ethanol?!!! This concentration can lead to the death of some cells and thus make the fuschin dye an appropriate negative control.
This incredible and dramatic discovery destroyed all of our hopes about the God of chemotaxis! :-(
However, our team did not give up on synthetic biology! :-) Indeed, after days of disappointment and no time left for lab work, we raised from ashes and tried to find another negative control.
Hopefully, we managed to find a negative control: galactose (25 mM). The article ""Chemotaxis towards sugars by B. subtilis"" (Ordal et al., 1979) proved that it was a poor attractant.
We made our tests again with this new molecule and glucose (25 mM) as positive control.
Figure 15: Final results (dilution : 1/10,000)
The miracle arrived! We managed to prove that our WT B. subtilis was indeed naturally attracted to NAG.
NB: It was our last experiment. Unfortunately we were running out of time and we could not do much more test. We would like to do the experiment with a lower dilution and repeat it several times.
Our results are not statistically significant however this result has been described in the litterature.

Binding module
1. Preliminary experiments
For the first experiment we wanted to check if the buffer of the binding assay was compatible with B. subtilis survival. To do that, we tested four bacterial concentrations (from OD 0.1 to OD 0.01). These B. subtilis suspensions were incubated 1 hour at 4°C with 500 µL of either Chitin Binding Buffer (CBB) or water. 100 µL of cell suspension were plated on LB medium in order to count surviving cells. Cells do not seem affected by the presence of CBB or water with estimated ODs of 0.05 or 0.025"
NorthernBC,2016,Team:NorthernBC#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Copper is essential in the human body for optimal function. It is a cofactor for many enzymes, as well as a key component of cross-linkages in melanin and collagen. In Canada, the majority of us don’t have a problem with excess copper in our water, therefore it is not at the forefront of most people’s minds on a daily basis. So why do we care about copper? According to the UN, 783 million people worldwide live without access to clean water for everyday uses such as drinking, cooking, and cleaning. The water they have access to comes from contaminated reservoirs containing dangerously high concentrations of copper and copper ions. That’s the global scale, now lets look at an example a little closer to home. The Mount Polley tailings pond breach on August 4, 2014, spilt 4.5 million cubic metres of slurry into Polley Lake, which later flowed into Quesnel lake (Government of BC, 2014). This disaster compromised the water quality for thousands of people downstream who rely on the Quesnel River, as the river brought many of the heavy metals with it. This is a very important example to demonstrate that high levels of copper in water are a problem for the entire world, not just underdeveloped nations. This global reality has prompted the development of new, large-scale, cost-effective water treatments for high levels of copper that are efficient and effective. We believe that using the tools of synthetic biology, we can work towards a solution of the oft-overlooked problem of copper in water, both on the local and global scale.

TCFSH_Taiwan,2017,Team:TCFSH Taiwan#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," was too late for us. So we designed this biobrick:
Then, we needed to find a way to measure the temperature, which is using the temperature regulated RBS (BBa_K115001). This RBS only allows ribosomes to bind to it at the temperature of 37 degree Celsius or above. Originally, we decided to put GFP after it, and the GFP would be activated if it reaches the target temperature. But we then noticed that GFP would produce green light, and the green light would cause the protein UirS to reverse back into an inactive state. So we then chose BFP (K592009) instead and designed this biobrick:
Nevertheless, we were afraid that the length of exposure time to 37 degrees Celsius or above is too short for the bacteria to produce enough amounts of BFP. So we decided to use an irreversible inhibitor, and then we came across the Rhl promoter. When the product of RhlI (K1541017) C4-HSR and protein RhlR (C0171) bind together, Prhl will continuously work without consuming the proteins and thus will have enough time to produce BFP. Late after, we found that the team iGEM14_ETH_Zurich had improved this gene to prevent the “leakiness”. But unfortunately, it’s again too late for us to change. Eventually, we designed this biobrick:
For fear that our products might be damaged, causing the bacteria inside to die, we designed a mechanism to guarantee that our product will remain effective. We knew that if we put an LVA tag behind the chromoprotein, it will degrade much faster. So our concept is to make the bacteria produce chromoprotein constantly, and it will be colorful when it is working. Nonetheless, when the bacteria aren’t alive anymore, the color will degrade fast and eventually become colorless. In the end, we designed this biobrick:
Also, to avoid the color mixture and the overconsuming of the amino acid, we designed a negative control promoter. We use LacI at the end since it is the most popular one.
Lastly, since it would be difficult to transform more than three plasmids into the bacteria, we combined two of them with one in the reverse direction (we are afraid that the gene behind will express poorly), and try to make the sequence as short as possible. So the final biobrick is:

Paper reading
I indulged in learning about the “Interplay of two quorum sensing regulation systems of Vibrio fischeri” in a 2007 paper. It is a long paper for which most of the space is occupied by a derivation as they are looking at modelling the lux and ain pathways with an ODE system, where they consider stationary states, dynamical behaviour and a possible biological meaning. I think that I’m supposed to be looking up phosphorylation and other rate constants, but I’m realising (conveniently after Carol has left for work) that we haven’t really sorted out what we need to be finding out and compiled it into a convenient table for filling in. I’ll make sure that gets done tomorrow. I also went through “A stochastic model of Escherichia coli AI-2 quorum signal circuit reveals alternative synthesis pathways”, which focussed on how cell physiology can be linked with systems-based stochastic models that can be assembled from scratch with some (not complete) knowledge of biochemical pathways. Sadly, LuxS is the only protein in that series that comes up in their differential modelling approach. However, they do describe how they used the MatLab optimisation toolbox to optimise their ODE equation parameters, so I made a note of that.
Circuit characterisation
I took another look at the registry, where they describe how they characterised the AHL signalling pathway. I’m currently looking for the experimental procedures that were adopted in quantifying these values and will keep the team posted on my success on that front. Some of them are going to be challenging – response time, for example, is based on a sudden impulse of the signal in question being introduced to the system. We’ll discuss this soon, but I think there would be great great great great great … great value in having a good supply of AI-2 isolated so that we can try to resolve a step (constant infusion of AI-2 at a certain level) or impulse (sudden, very high infusion of AI-2  liken to dumping a huge amount of AI-2 into a tube with bacteria containing the AI-2 signalling pathway) response.

We held a lecture aiming at letting more people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. With great honor, we invited Dr. Pei hao, who is currently working in the school of engineering and applied sciences in Harvard University and engaging in the application of microfluidics in biomedical field, to give students in AHUT this lecture. It has successfully attracted interests of hundreds of students, but due to the limited seats in the meeting room, we had to invited only more than 60 students to attend this speech. In order to enable more people to watch the lecture, we took advantage of the webcast platform, making more than 1,000 people enjoy this meeting online. Dr. Pei not only presented us the research progress of microfluidics but also shared teachers and students with the current research results.

Physcomitrella - A new chassis for iGEM
General description
The moss Physcomitrella patens belongs to the land plant division Bryophyta, which are one of the earliest representatives of the land plants (Embryophyta) having evolved from green algae about 470 million years ago during the early Paleozoic. Hence mosses have a much simpler anatomy than higher land plants such as trees and flowering plants, which in particular means that they have not yet developed a vascular system, i.e an internal transport system for water and nutrients. Since they also lack a complex waterproofing system to prevent absorbed water from evaporating they need a moist environment to grow. Their main habitats are therefore shady and damp places such as woods and edges of streams but they are also found to be resistant to periods of drought and therefore can be found widely spread around the world, from the tropics to tundra regions, from coastal sand dunes up to high mountains.
The general organization of plant tissue into roots, stem and leaves is found in a much more basic version in mosses. They show a differentiated stem with simple leaves, usually only a single layer of cells thick and lacking veins, that are used to absorb water and nutrients. Instead of roots they have similar threadlike rhizoids [ Reski, 1998 ]. These have a primary function as mechanical attachment rather than extraction of soil nutrients. Due to not having a vascular system bryophytes are doomed to stay small throughout their life-cycle typically stretching about 1-10 cm.
However different mosses and vascular plants are because of the early diverge of the evolutionary lineages, they share fundamental genetic and physiological processes. Hence a good approach to studying the complexity of higher land"

On the 23rd of September our team invited family and friends to come and visit our lab, and to explain to them what we had been working on the past few months. We still had to contribute quite a lot for our trip to Boston, so a fundraiser could help us on the financial side. Everybody who was interested could come, get a drink and listen to some relaxing music from the band Frankly no Helix. We started off with a short presentation, after which people were given the opportunity to ‘take a tour’ through our lab. A great way to show them the work that we have been doing!  After the lab-tours were finished (a lot of people wanted to do this!) we started an auction. The things that went up for auction (lab-slaves, arm candy, boatrides) appeared surprisingly appealing to many of the audience. At the end of the day we had collected 850 euro, but more importantly, we made our project visible to the people around us. This could be repeated in the upcoming years!

Antibody research:
-Single-domain antibodies such as the nurse shark derived IgNAR and the camelid derived VHH have been used for many purposes and have recently started to gain popularity among the scientific community.
-Contain CD3 loop that gives these Ig's an advantage when looking for cryptic viral epitopes. However, contain ten epitope copies and might still infect. Solved by increasing their mass.
-Both of these Ig's are stable enough to be administered orally.
-Orally administered transformed lactobacilli were used to administer anti-TNF Ig.
-Small dimensions of VHHs allow it to be easily tagged.
-Lactobacilli have been engineered that produces VHH's at a rate fast enough to prevent infection  by p2 bacteriophage. Possibly use lactobacillus for screening and E. coli for secretion?
-VHH's and IgNAR's have been effective in detecting poliovirus and inhibiting its replication in vitro, as well as preventing the assembly and secretion of hepatitis B. Possible to use VHH's as intrabodies vs. HIV-1?
-N-glycosylation increases stability.
-Studies demonstrated that pre-immune libraries can be used for rapid generation of Ig's against a large number of harmful antigens. Troublesome low sensitivity overcome by using phage-displayed instead of purified antibodies.[1]

We inoculated 8ul of Invitrogen TOP10 containing  into 4ml of LB + Amp and incubated overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm. We did the same for TOP10 with  and  inside.
Next morning we put 50ul from each of the three falcon into 5ml of LB NaCl 250 mM pH 6.6 and incubated again for five hours and at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We measured the final O.D. with TECAN F200 and diluted each genetic circuit into four falcons with LB NaCl 250mM at different pH (5.5 - 6.6 - 7.5 - 8.5) in order to obtain a same O.D. equal to 0,02 (12 falcons overall).
Then we performed an experiment of 21 hours duration with measures of absorbance and fluorescence every 5 minutes with TECAN F200. Each value is the mean of three measurements and cultures were shaked for 15 seconds every five minutes.

Comments
We didn't expect this. Again  didn't produce any GFP as well as negative control (): after the transient due to noise their GFP production rate goes to zero while positive control () has a significantly higher one.  After looking better for a motivation in some articles ([Rachel Karpel et al.]) we think this could be because of the E. coli strain: we use TOP10 while a special strain (delta-nhaA) without some membrane proteins that regulate E. coli homeostasis is used in other experiments.
Final considerations
In our opinion this sensor (primarily sodium sensor and secondarily pH sensor) needs very particular conditions to work (first of all a specific bacterial strain) we couldn’t reproduce, so we consider it almost unusable.

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#test#human practices#emoji report_-_-_TEXT.html," lyrics to convey their feelings and emotions towards phage therapy. Examples of this include, “ What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” in reference to Kelly Clarkson’s hit song, reflecting positive opinions towards phage therapy, expressed through positive song lyrics.
😡 Pouting Face
This emoji is defined as the pouting face, showing displeasure with a person or situation. It often indicated madness or anger.11 In this context, it highlights serious concern with phage therapy. This is highlighted in comments such as, “When they [phage] develop ways to attack human cells, we get an even worse enemy” and, “Couldn’t the phage evolve to be more effective against humans for better survival rates”. This reflects that particularly when focussing on phage evolution and the human health, there are serious concerns towards the long-term safety of phage therapy.
Data analysis
After we defined, evidenced and explained all the key emoji emotion themes and debates, we then analysed the data to see which emojis were the most used. We recorded this data and produced a graph (figure 1.0).

This shows that modified   wording affects feelings towards a topic, and suggests that people may be more supportive of something like GMOs provided   specific examples.
We also included a small series of questions to judge potential public perception of our project. These questions were those   that involved the filtration of water by bacteria. Overall, a majority of people had positive feelings towards this: they felt   that the benefits outweighed the risks; they would drink water that was filtered by bacteria; and they would have positive   reactions if they were to learn that it were currently occuring. We also asked about concerns regarding bacterial filtration.   These responses provide us with valuable insight as to which potential problems with which we should be most concerned   about addressing.

Artificial River Media Growth Assays
Determining Food Tank Parameters
With the intention to make a biosensor capable of working self sufficiently for a long period of time, maintaining the biological elements of the system is crucial. Therefore, assays were performed to determine the parameters of the food tank. Using only sodium lactate as a carbon source for Shewanella, the minimum concentration of nutrients that the bacteria needed to survive would be determined. Considering the device was created with six liters of space for nutrients to be added, what would be the maximum concentration and miniumum flow rate that could be used by the device, to maintain successful results? The first step in this is to simulate river conditions and add different ""flow rates"" of sodium lactate. Then this determined concentration should be tested for biosensing ability in a later reactor test.
Developing Synthetic River Media
The first step is to determine the contents of a river of interest. The Athabasca river was selected, as it is of particular importance in the Oil Sands region of Alberta. The information on various concentrations of ions, water hardness, pH, etc. came from the Oil Sands Information Portal . Based on this information, as well as available salts to use, a recipe for Synthetic River Media was created to match the biologically significant parameters of the river's contents to the solution which would be used for later growth tests.
Growth Assays
Various engineered strains were tested with different amounts of sodium lactate in 20 hour or greater growth trials, in synthetic river media. After a few weeks of editing the protocol, a final procedure was developed for the Sh"

Eucaryotic receptor constructs
This is a page that is required for the evaluation of the best measurement category. Here we present the measurements of our membrane protein toolbox that allows surface-display of functional protein domains on prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells. If you want to read the whole story including the design of our modular receptors, please go to our Receptor page .
Subcellular protein localization using fluorescence microscopy
For better traceabilty we supplied all of our receptor constructs with reporter genes like mRuby and/or Nanoluciferase. mRuby is located on the C-terminus respectively the cytosolic end of our transmembrane receptors right before the Strep-tag. Cells that express and fold the protein properly should give a signal of 605 nm (red) when exited at around 558 nm (rfp channel). [1] We tested our contructs three diffrent cell types: HEK293T adherent cells that were stably transfected, HEK293E suspension cells that were semi-stably transfected and N2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, that we transiently transfected.
As you can see on the images the signal developed over time. In the beginning, before selection, the protein was visible in little dots and therefor seemed to be localized more in subcellular oragnelles than in the membrane.  During selection on hygromycin B resistency most of the cells died, leaving some resistant cells behind, which over time grew to bigger foci consisting of stably transfected cells only (See Fig. B). For the BAP-receptor there was hardly to no fluorescence detectable neither in semi-stable nor in the stable transfection approach. But in latter case the cells still grew on hygromycin B and formed foci, which leads us to the conclusion that chromosomal intergration was susccesful (as"

The best fit is in a-posterior sense where the logarithm of the a-posteriori was optimized using the Matlab script lsqnonlin. The script uses a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find a minimum.
All fitted parameters are within realistic bounds.
The half life time of eGFP is a bit lower than expected. The literature states GFP should have a half-life time (inverse of the degradation rate) of over 20 hours. But there are several possible explanations for this:
Certain GFP mutants are destabilizedm and thus have a significantly lower half-life time.
The cells were not stored in the dark, hence photobleaching might lower the effectively measured half-life time as we only measure the non-bleached proteins.
The simulations show that the parameter set k2, γ2 and μ is not precisely identifiable. This means that the best fit values are not necessarily significant.
Data
Figure 1. Experimental data versus simulation
The methods utilized rely on a value for standard deviation, but only one experimental measurement was performed. Hence a value was infered during the optimization process. Thus the error bars in the plot do not reflect values from actual measurements but merely show how well the data can be approximated by the model.
It is clearly visible that the simulated time course stays within the standard deviation and we can thus conclude, that the model is definitely able to reproduce the data.
Profile Likelihood
Figure 2. Profile Likelihood without priors
For the profile likelihood analysis, the scripts provided by the Systems Biology group from TU Eindhoven[ Vanlier and van Riel, 2012 ] were used and modified to our needs.
All profiles in figure 2 have a convex shape, which means that we have no structural non-identifiabilities[ Vanlier et al., 2012 ] and all parameters are identifiable. Still all profiles except the one for γ1 have a rather large, flat section in the middle. This means"
TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," metal in the bomb. A larger bomb has more influence on the magnetic field, but depth, position and shape also matter.” When a signal is picked up, the metal object has to be dug up. The signal often does not match with what is found: “Sometimes you expect a hand grenade, and you find a 250 pound bomb!” However most of the times a suspicious signal just comes from an iron bar or something like that.
Yet, the use of a magnetometer pose several difficulties. Altough, they can detect signals up to a depth of approximately 5 meters., much of the bombs lay at depths of around 10-15 meters and therefore cannot be found in this way.  Lenz: “Although I’m not really convinced of the number, it is said that 30% of the bombs is missed by magnetometer searches.” “Current methods are not that satisfying that I can go to sleep well. Words like ‘maybe’ and ‘possibly’ are not in use by EOD specialists, because it is a matter of life and death.”
When a bomb is located, it has to be dug up. This is not without danger: “Some time ago, in our area of operation, more precisely in Ludwigshafen, a 500 pound bomb was hit with a drill, leading to the deflagration of the charge, which lifted the 80 t drilling device about 50 cm into the air. The machine operator was injured by glass shards. In Euskirchen (which is in Nordrhein-Westfalen, so another part of Germany and not in the area of operation), an excavator operator was killed by the deflagration of a 4000 pound bomb. In both cases, no employees of the Kmrd were involved.” When a bomb is excavated, in most cases the fuse is removed on site. Only in very special cases the bomb has to be detonated. The defused bombs are brought to a company where they are sawn open and where the explosive compounds are burned.
But why is bomb disposal necessary? “When bombs are in a forest or a field, they don’t pose a threat. But at a building site, in a city, they are a real danger when if they are hit.” Another danger is posed by spontaneously exploding bombs. “Under the influence of humidity and time, chemicals of the detonation mechanism can react with the metal of the bomb casing, which can cause spontaneous detonation.” A special type of bomb is particularly susceptible to spontaneous detonation. These are bombs designed to not explode on impact, but up to 144 hours afterwards"

Sensynova Framework Testing (IPTG Sensor): The Results
BioBricks used: BBa_K2205009(New) , BBa_K2205012(New) , BBa_K2205015(New) , BBa_K2205016(New) and BBa_K2205018(New) .
Rationale and Aim
Biosensors, synthetic systems designed to detect and respond to a target analyte, are a common application of synthetic biology. However, the production and screening of multiple biosensor system variants is hindered by the inefficiency and specificity of the gene assembly techniques used. The production of circuit variants is important in biosensor production, as sensitivity to target molecules must be tuned.
Aim: To develop a multicellular biosensor development platform which utilises cell-mixing, as opposed to genetic re-engineering, to construct biosensor variants.
Background Information
Human Practices Quotes:
""Modularity would be a really useful aspect"" - Dr Karen Polizzi, Imperial college - London “Each generation of scientists keep reinventing the wheel” - Dr Martin Peacock, biosensors developer
Biosensor Development. When developing biosensors, it would be useful to test multiple variants of a circuit. This is especially important in the fine-tuning of biosensor behaviour as this requires the screening of many variants to find appropriate activation thresholds for a system. Apart from the initial detection unit, many constructs used in synthetic biology based biosensors are reusable between different biosensor systems, such as fluorescent protein coding sequences or devices which amplify signals. However, these parts rarely get reused. For example, the Cambridge iGEM team (2009) developed a library of sensitivity tuners which were able to convert polymerase per second inputs to a desired polymerase per second output, allowing a biosensor developer control over the sensitivity of their systems to various target analyte concentrations. This project was impressive enough to win the competition. However, despite the parts' clear usefulness, there is no documentation that the parts have ever been successfully reused within the iGEM competition. We suggest that this is due to the difficulties in assembling biosensors systems – the screening of a library of sensitivity tuners would require the ability to easily generate multiple sensor circuits. Although only one part would be changing in each circuit variant, current genetic engineering techniques mean that parts are tightly coupled together, preventing the simple swapping of parts. Therefore, we propose a modular, multicellular system for biosensor development,"

High School Students
Tuesday, October 14th
On Oct 14 2014 Stefanie and Nadine visited a high school in Bern as a part of our human practice project. The girls had the chance to teach students at the age of 16-17 years. Through these lectures, we attempted to impart the basic principles of synthetic biology and encouraged the students to participate in a discussion of the concepts presented. In these discussions we tried to focus on risks to humans, health, the environment and the public. The structure of the lessons was really open for personal inputs from the side of the students. The topics discussed ranged from whether you should or should not express GFP in other organisms (the question of freewill came up), animal trials in research, GMO's in general to the production of artificial meat in bioreactors.
Furthermore former iGEM projects were quickly outlined and their possibilities and potential discussed. Thus, we increased the level of awareness of synthetic biology and simultaneously teach the students how to approach complex problems. Another aspect of our visit was to promote the studies of science in general. The students were encouraged to ask all questions that came to their minds.  This school visit belongs to the outreach aspect of our human practice project as it aims to share knowledge with the public.

Now we will use a specific example to demonstrate functions of BioBless.
You can input a truth table where ""1""represents the existence of the substance and ""0"" represents the opposite.
Our software will provide several possible gene circuits for your truth table. You can drag one of these gene circuits on our canvas.
Now you can either drag some other Boolean gates to the canvas or choose some specific Biobricks to substitute the abstract Biobricks in the designed gene circuit. For example, you can drag several OR0 and OR1 to connect them together.
Click the ""Gene Network"" button and input parameters you want to change. For example, you can set the reaction parameter of transcription (trans1), translation (trans2), decay1 and decay2 rates as 0.00005, 0.025, 0.1 and 0.05 respectively. Click the icons on our canvas and you will go into a dialog box to choose Biobricks.
Click the ""Simulation"" button and you will see the concentration-time figure of every substance in designed gene circuit. Click on ""all"" and all figures will be shown on our canvas. Click ""OUT""and you will see the concentration-time figure of this substance individual.
Click the ""Analysis"" button, then input the parameter you want to change and the range of change, such as 5% or 15%. Then you will see the results of stability and robustness.
The ""DNA Sequence"" button will provide information of the DNA sequence and you will see the sequences of designed gene circuit.
Future Work
Noting that the number of prototype substances for inputs of our gene circuit have been limited, hence the functionality of designed gene circuits are strongly weakened. One of our future work is to design novel gene circuit where the inputs and outputs are arbitrary given. Theoretically, if we build up the bridge between an arbitrary input (denoted by A) and several certain functional protein (denoted by B), for example, biologist can design a specific gene circuit like a combination of A-targeted promoter with gene sequence of B in advance to achieve that the concentration of A will be commensurate with that of B, thus designing"
Sydney_Australia,2017,Team:Sydney Australia#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," for individuals in developing nations.
It is difficult to estimate the spillover effect of the USA’s bloated pharmaceutical industry on the global price of insulin. Certainly, it is the same three companies supplying the majority of the world. They will naturally attempt to spread the incidence of their costs in America, despite the significantly lower purchasing power of these international customers. Coupled with a lack of institutional insurance or pharmaceutical benefits schemes, these secondary markets struggle to meet their national demand for insulin analogues.
Potentially as a consequence of this demand deficiency, Regular Human Insulin is routinely undersupplied in the global market. One would typically expect generic manufacturers to meet this lack, however sufficient supply has not manifested itself in most countries.[14]
Figure 3.Pharmaceutical companies find themselves in a prisoner’s dilemma, common in oligopoly markets. Opting to increase advertising expense prompts competitors to do the same, resulting in little change in market share. However failing to respond to competitors’ can lead to a significant loss in market share. Generally the only way to rectify this without industry collusion is through government intervention with legislation that caps advertising expenditure.[15]
Figure 4.It is fair to say that corporations should be able to recuperate R&D costs through an exclusionary patent that provides the holder with a temporary monopoly. Unfortunately, the convoluted American medical system can increase this cost by an order of magnitude or more. It is incorrect to blame the pharmaceutical companies for this situation - as they are merely individual agents attempting to maximise their profits in a limited market. The only solution is market reform.[16]
Canada - Developed nation with poorly targeted Diabetes Budget
Canada is a developed nation, however like the USA it’s citizens struggle to get affordable access to insulin. However unlike the USA, Canada has a public health care system. Despite this, 57% of Canadians do not follow their doctor prescribed therapy because they cannot afford medications, devices and supplies. There is a high variability in out-of-pocket expenses across the nation, with different jurisdictions offering different subsidies based upon income level. The highest burden of Diabetes rests on the lowest income Canadians, which the study recommends reforming; “People with type 2 diabetes with incomes of $30,000 pay more as a percentage of both their annual and family income than those who earn $43,000 and $75,000.” [27]
Figure 10.The Canadian government’s report recommends rapid reform of the Diabetes rebates - and unlike it’s developing counterparts, has the public finance to carry this out.  However, throwing more money at the problem without tackling upstream inefficiencies in manufacturing/distribution will not"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is re"

We tried to utilize mCherry from biobricks distribution to genetically label neuron AWA in C. elegans’ (Caenorhabditis elegans) head. We found a mCherry part C. elegans, BBa_K2005050 submitted by iGEM16_Vanderbilt. However, their mCherry was not designed for C. elegans. Lacking of any intron in a gene will diminish its expression in C elegans In addition, the codon is not optimized for C elegans. We obtained its sequence, and improved the codon with C.elegans codon adaptor [1] , and insert three introns based the previous reserch [2] （fig1）.
Figure 1:Alignment between BBa_K2005050 and BBa_K2492002(optimized mCherry) .
The mCherry part we use is optimized for C.elegans. We added the characterization onto the part page since the original part has no visual characterization neither on part page nor on their wiki. However, our mCherry is expressed in C.elegans，so plate reader and flow cytometer are not available for fluorescence measurement.  To locate the position of neuron AWA in C.elegans head. We observe C.elegans with a confocal microscope(Figure 2). The entire neuron with dendrite can be observed distinctly. The branch of dendrite near the mouse can be observed as described in wormatlas .

今まで、移動系、色素系、分裂系がありましたが、今現在システム全体が書き出せるものは
「物質合成→積算＆コミュニケーション→output」
の色素系であります。移動系のアイデアには、積算値が戻らないという利点があります。
しかしその位置情報を大腸菌に認識させるという、積算の次のステップのシステムが現在出されていません。
分裂系も、２のn乗で増えていくので色素系と比較すると問題点が多いです。
テスト前まで色素系を進めていこうかという話をしました。もちろん分裂系、移動系は棚上げで。

She hopes that in the future that science will take her around the world.  iGEM was brought to her attention since it would be a great opportunity to explore an aspect of science in great detail, while having fun.
Muriel Aldunate:
Muriel is in her 2nd year of studying biotechnology at RMIT University and has dedicated her life to science since she was five; when her parents bought her a microscope and she went around collecting helpless insects to inspect. In her spare time she aims to inspire future generations by assisting by teaching year 7 science & being a rolemodel that can turn ""geek into chic"". She plans never to stop travelling the world, marvelling at its wonders and trying to understand everything in it.
Candice Raeburn:
Candi is a 2nd year biotechnology student who enjoys making surprised facial expressions at beer in conical flasks (see picture right) and genetics. When she grows up she hopes to be taller and intends to save the world (to fulfil the young optimistic scientist stereotype). Candi enjoys: bioacoustics, behavioural genetics, entomology, biological chemistry, virology, biomimicry, nanotechnology and a nice pair of slacks. She has studied in Australia and the USA, and hopes to complete her degree in the UK next year.

wider angle merged images (A~C) are presented (A: [S+G+R], B: [S+R], C: [S]) and in (A’) only yellow color, which represents the E. coli cells, is deleted from (A).
   From now on we shall refer to ""[SPI-2+T3signal-GPP+RFP]0.4% arabinose(+)"" as [S+G+R],  ""[SPI-2+T3signal-GPP+RFP] arabinose(-)"" as [S+R], and ""[SPI-2 only]"" as [S]. We observed the cells by Cofocal Laser Scannning Microscope(OLYMPUS FV-1000D) under blue(473 nm) and green(559 nm) excitation light 7.5 hrs after the first exposure (Fig.7). [S+G+R] E. coli express both GFP and RFP, so in [A-4] E. coli cells appear to be yellow and GFP outside of E. coli appear to be green. Comparing [A-1] and[A-4] you can recognize that GFP is located in the cytosol of RK13. In contrast in [B-4] and [C-4] you cannot see GFP in the cytosol (Fig.8). In (A’) you can find that GFP is located in the shape of the cytosol more clearly. In fact GFP began to diffuse in the cytosol 4 hrs after the exposure (data not shown). However, GFP didn’t localize into the nucleus against our expectation even 7.5 hrs after exposure.
Discussion
   According to the results it can be suggested that SPI-2 encoded T3SS can inject a heterologous protein(GFP) from outside of the target cell even if it is cloned onto the heterologous host E. coli (K-12) and that injected GFP was functional in the target cell. In the process of our project, even if the E. coli is prepared under acidic pH condition, GFP was not injected into RK13 when the exposure step is performed under neutral pH condition (data not shown), suggesting that acidic pH is required for exposure step to use this system. By the way GFP didn’t localize into the nucleus against our expectation. So, NLS domain might not be able to function correctly in the GFP fusion protein constructed this time.

Hiroyuki Takahashi, from a science company, Leave A Nest corp.
Q1. What do you do?
I do work as researcher and mediation between scientists and firms. In addition, I sometimes help scientists with                 establishing new project together and sometimes look for scientists instead of huge firms. I do many things for else. Most of my jobs are for   scientists and firms. My work is like a bridge. I connect people to people, projects to people, data to people and  government subvention to scientists. We, our   company doesn't just throw our work. We always stand by our customers.
Q2. How do your company give education about IP on scientist?
Education of IP isn’t a must in every company. Member of Research and Development department might give some lectures, however, IP strategy requires   real experiment in projects.                From the reason, new comers rarely be placed there. In our company, we set a trainee to a scientist who needs that kind of knowledge.
Q3. We heard that most scientists do not have enough knowledge of patent when they are newly hired. How is it?
Those knowledge were not needed except for specific projects. So that story is true. I don’t know how other firms are but I guess they are nearly same.
Q4. Do you think putting knowledge on IP is needed for undergraduates or graduates? And why?
Having knowledge can’t be in vain. However, Intellectual Property is difficult to learn from only on the paper, so opportunity of operational experience   is desirable. I recommend those who want to have the skill, to apply for internship. Reading book could support them too. It would help students to do favorable study   along with IP when they want it. In other way, you can use website of Japan Patent Office. Just browsing IP documents on skills you were interested in, would do you   good too.
Q5.Message to Students?
IP has both good and bad sides. It might widen your possibility but also narrows it too. Thinking how to face IP, and what merit you can gain do your   business plan good in the future              because it strongly relates to what do you want to do. Putting your iGEM project into consideration with it helps you to learn more on IP. Good Luck.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," agents in the future is a questionable proposition.
The total production cost of a fishPHARM has been estimated to be roughly $2.00 per 20-pound fish. This translates to about $.14 per dollar of fish. While this may seem like a nontrivial amount, fishPHARM guarantees users a peace of mind that Terramycin simply cannot match. fishPHARM’S EcnB peptide is biodegradable as well as, and thus does not pose the same environmental and health risks that antibiotics do.
It is clear that the negative consequences of Flavobacterium psychrophilum infection are acute. As reported by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, an epizootic of BCWD once infected 25% of lake trout raised in New York State hatchery raceways [4]. Given the inedibility of infected salmonids, the organism has the potential to reduce the financial yield of a salmon population from $7/lb to $4.90/lb in this scenario. Since roughly 2.4 million tons of salmon are produced by aquaculturists each year, even a small incidence of BCWD would have dire economic ramifications.
Environmental Impact
Given the relatively benign nature of Entericidin B and its Escherichia coli chassis, the environmental consequences of fishPHARM are negligible compared to that of current mainstream BCWD treatment methods - namely antibiotics. While there is a slight risk of the Entercidin B disrupting the ecological microbiome present at its point of dissemination, the specificity of the toxin makes this unlikely.
EcnB is naturally found in the human gut genome and thus not a hazard to human health. The benign nature of the treatment protocol we have devised provides distinct advantages over oxytetracycline, an antibiotic used to treat BCWD, because abuse of such chemotherapeutic agents fosters resistance among targeted pathogens [5]. In fact, a study conducted between 1994 and 1998 among Danish trout farms recorded an oxytetracycline resistance rate of between 60 and 75 percent of Flavobacterium colonies sampled [6]. Bacterial resistance to agents such as amoxicillin, florfenicol and sulfonamides has also been reported, largely due to the organism’s ability to form extremely hardy biofilms [6]. FishPHARM thus constitutes an effective circumvention of the issue of environmental antibiotic resistance: by eschewing the use of any chemical agents, we prevent the formation of more dangerous pathogens.
Furthermore, FishPHARM has the potential to be a more reliable, enduring solution, as it would be more difficult for"

Do you think that production of yeast extract enriched with MAA would be a valuable combination?
Yes, the project is very interesting.         The possibility of developing a biotechnological method for obtaining MAAs is promising         as an alternative to other natural sources (macroalgae) due to the limitations in the extraction yields,          tedious purification protocols, and the inherent variability of the biological material.
What can be the possible difficulties in producing MAA in yeast? What do you think how we can overcome them?
Although genetics is beyond my expertise, I suspect that one main difficulty can be found in the yield of the biosynthesis and the cost of UV light sources, if needed to induce de production of the natural sunscreens.       Nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of MAAs, thus limitations in this element should be avoided       when considering the nutrition conditions of the cultures.
Whether the additional exposure to sunlight have the same effect in yeast as in Cyanobacteria in terms of increasing concentration of MAA? In your opinion, what can be done to increase the yield of MAAs in yeast?
Probably combinations of UV (UVA and /or UVB) and visible light work better"

We also want to be able to regulate the flow that is generated with a light sensor, that integrates into the chemotaxis pathway, giving us very fast response times. Finally for the photosensor to function properly we will need to introduce retinal biosynthesis to the system. In this way we can avoid altering the buffer solution flowing through the system, this though result in trace amounts of waste products from the cells metabolism.
Figure 2:An overview of our system components. Part K274210 was produced and charactarized by the Cambridge 2009 team.
Hyperflagellation
To achieve hyperflagellation we have decided to focus mainly on increasing the expression of the flhD and flhC transcriptional regulators, also known as the master regulon of flagella synthesis [ 7 ]. In normal E. coli the flhDC operon is tightly regulated by numerous factors [ 7 ], resulting in average expression of 4 flagella per cell [ 8 ]. In some hyperflagellated strains, mutations have been found upstream of the regulon that increase expression [ 9 ], making the cells hypermotile. We have decided to take a down-and-dirty approach to increase flagella expression, overriding the regulation alltogether by putting the two genes on a constitutive promotor. We hereby hope to increase the pumping power of our system.
Phototaxis
Regulation of the pump will be introduced through a synthetic photo-sensing protein that has recently been shown to integrate with the E. coli chemotaxis system [ 10 ]. Since the chemotaxis system regulates flagellar behaviour, we hope to introduce control of the amount of flow generated with very fast response times since chemotaxis is controlled by phosphorylation cascades rather than transcriptional regulation. Although the cells will be held in place in our system, the part will in effect introduce a phototactic ability to free-moving E. coli.
Retinal biosynthesis
For the photoreceptor to work, we will need to supply it with enzymes for retinal biosynthesis. Retinal is formed by cleaving beta-carotene, a reaction that is catalyzed by beta-carotene-oxygenases [ 11 ]. We will be supplying a new BioBrick that contains the gene ninaB from Drosophila melanogaster and expresses 15,15' beta-carotene monooxygenase which cleaves beta-carotene to two molecules of retinal. Beta-carotene biosynthesis will be supplied by a part made by"
Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," contain 100 ng of each protein, 20 mM DTT, 200 mM MgCl2, and the protein’s VLP assembly buffer to fill up to 20 μl. Once the DTT and MgCl2 were added, the assembly reactions were incubated in a water bath at 30 C for 3 hours. Once complete, 2 μl of 100% glycerol were added. 6 μl of each sample were taken for observation under the EM at the University of Hawaii and Manoa.
Results and Discussion: The VLP assay tested for the effectiveness of VLP assembly under these conditions: (1) The effect of acidity and (2) the effect the presence of a His-tag has on VLP assembly. First, we were able to confirm that our gag protein variant, construct 3a (CA2) could form VLP’s. The EM images of the CA2 VLPs revealed larger VLP formation under acidic conditions and little to no formation under basic conditions (Figure 1 and 3). Under basic conditions, the EM images showed mainly VLP intermediates of the capsid proteins. This suggests that the gag VLP formation may be hindered but not completely prohibited under basic conditions. Both tagged and untagged VLPs formed under acidic conditions and neutral conditions (Figure 1 and 2). This suggests that tagged capsid proteins do not entirely prohibit VLP assembly. The average diameter size for the tagged capsid proteins assembled in acidic conditions was 42.31 nm while the average diameter size for the untagged capsid proteins was 36.11 nm (Table 1). However, the sample size was too small to perform a true statistical analysis, so these are mainly observations.
Table 1. Average VLP diameter for all samples. Each sample size (n) is different. Acidic-tagged n = 10, acidic-untagged n = 8, neutral untagged n = 3, and basic-tagged n = 5.

It is not pathogenic and doesn’t produce toxins or any substance known to risk the health or the environment. Furthermore, we do not expect our biobrick to improve or facilitate the bacteria’s survival.
But if for any reason our bacteria is released into environment, we could also build a self-destruction mechanism of the bacteria, this is interesting because could avoid the genetic exchange with other bacteria found in the environment. This mechanism could be built in a very similar to that developed by the UNICAMP team from 2009 called “The kamikaze system”. This mechanism consist in the production of a huge amount of lysozyme by the killing cell, this lysozyme in high concentrations will be able to attack the cell wall of E. coli passing trough the inner cell membrane. This will destroy the E. coli releasing lisozyme in the medium.

Cambridge-JIC,2016,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," final energy consideration proposed by the Salis lab is that which results from the supercoiling which is induced by Cas9’s binding to other, nearby sites. When Cas9 binds to a site, the uncoiling (negative supercoiling) of the genome which is necessary to form an R-loop is likely to further coil (positive supercoiling) all adjacent sites within a certain distance, as DNA’s linking number is conserved. This carries a positive energy penalty, making the nearby sites harder to uncoil. Discrepancies in the degree of supercoiling across the genome will result in a similar effect. However, due to the fact that most Cas9 binding will occur at a single site (the on-target site) in the regime we are considering, we were able to neglect the first effect. We also neglected the second, as there is only evidence of small variations in supercoiling across the C. reinhardtii genome [4].
The probability of the Cas9:gRNA complex binding to a potential DNA site is governed by a Boltzmann function, taking into account all of the potential Gibbs free energy
Eqn 4
Where:
Ntarget[i] is the ith potential DNA binding site
ΔGtarget[i] is the free energy change associated with Cas9 binding to the ith potential site
kB is the Boltzmann constant
T is the temperature (taken here as 25°C)
N is the length of the genome
It follows that the rate of Cas9 binding to a given site is give as the rate of contact with the site (rRW) multiplied by the probability of binding. Once Cas9 has bound, it may cause a double stranded break in the site, usually around 3 base pairs from the PAM. However, there is still a chance that it will dissociate from the site before it has the chance to cleave, leading to the equation
Eqn 5
Where kc is the cleavage rate constant, and kd the dissociation rate constant.
3. Homologous recombination
Once a site has been cleaved by Cas9, the site will either be repaired by homologous recombination, or its lack of stability will degrade this copy of the chloroplast genome until it is unable to be repaired. In the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, there is no evidence of non-homologous end joining, and thus repair seems to happen exclusively through homologous recombination [5]. Homology-directed repair requires another, un-cleaved copy of the broken site, to act as a template for repair of the"

Any other notes that may assist in reproducibility the structure folding
Reproducibility is the main concern with many science based innovations and our hope is that with the DNA Origami library, we are able to cut down on time and resources spent troubleshooting with DNA origami construction, so that innovators can dedicate their energy innovating with DNA origami rather than making DNA origami. Our hope is that from this open source frame work, innovations with DNA origami can come about similar to how dNANO is an innovation in nano circuitry stemming off of DNA origami. However, with many innovations come the issue of ownership and intellectual property.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property is described as any product, invention that has come about from the creative process and has the ability to be protected by a patent, copyright, trademark or any other form of legislative protection. With our novel innovation in DNA origami, dNANO, we wanted to know more about the legislation that is out there to ensure that any innovations from our open source initiative can be made ours. We consulted TEC Edmonton, a startup incubator for more information in regards to IP rights in determining what is protected under Canadian patent law. A patent is a method of protecting inventions in which the inventor discloses the details of the creation to the level of detail where another individual can replicate the device in place for exclusive rights to that invention for set amount of time. In Canada and the United States that time is 20 years. According to TEC, in order for an invention to be patentable it must demonstrate 3 attributes:
Novelty- Is this invention/application the first of its kind?
Usefulness- Does this invention show some sort of utility?
Non obviousness- The invention must improve on existing technology that is not obvious. For example, one cannot patent a series of lightbulbs since it does not deviate enough from the base invention being the lightbulb.
Things that can be patented are concepts, inventions and applications of other products. In every patent is a state of claims made by the inventor, so long as there is enough evidence to demonstrate what is claimed in the patent then it has the potential to be patented. By doing so the patentee is claiming their creation is reasonably enabled. The team broke down the DNA origami aspect into three individual components: the template strand, the staple strands and the final structure which all can be patented.
As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting."

This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.

Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter and create an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Killer gene is replaced by RFP under control of in-promoter.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Fig.4 Arabinose induced expression cassette of three kinds of inhibitors.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
Fig.5 In-promoter controlled expression cassette of RFP. RFP is used to replace killer gene.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
Fig.6 Assembly of inhibitor and ""in-promoter"". They can be used to test the minimum arabinose concentration which can totally repress the expression of RFP.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased and it contradicted with the expected results. Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
The circuits are shown in the Fig.7.
So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
Fig.7 Optimized circuits after changing the direction of promoter PBAD adding another terminator B0015.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in Table.3. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the circuits mentioned above with no arabinose added.
Table.3 The concentrations of arabinose added in the experiment.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the cI-Pr circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram describing the relationship between the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
Fig.8 RFP intensity measured under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％"

Discussion
Discussion The measurement of the zone of inhibition in the agar-diffusion assay in E.coli with clorobiocin is challenging because E.coli export aminocoumarins via the outer membrane protein TolC. Furthermore clorobiocin has a low solubility in the water-based LB-agar. The first problem is circumvented by using a TolC knockout variant, the second has to be kept in mind while interpreting the data.  Tetracycline has a low solubility in water too and led to small z.o.i. even with the resistant XL1 blue, possibly because of its accumulation and therefore high concentration around the wafer.  Very small radii of the z.o.i. (<2mm) as seen in the clorobiocin samples and the discrimination between e.g. 4 and 4.5 mm  are hard to measure using a conventional ruler. Sometimes the border of the z.o.i. is diffuse or there is  more than one z.o.i. (concentric rings). An automated image analysis system might be better or the determination of “mean inhibitory concentrations” in liquid culture.  After all the test-system is working. We were able to make E.coli more resilient against clorobiocin by expressing GyrBR. If we had more time an increasing amount of GyrA and GyrBR from Staphylococcus aureus would have been expressed and validated.  The SHV-1 confers resistance to carbenicillin in an inducer concentration dependent manner.  The next step would be to design a polycistronic gene structure with a constitutive promoter in order to only need one plasmid without the necessity for external induction.

Our motivation is to solve large area soil contamination using plant-endophyte synergism. We combine phytoremediation           and our engineered endophyte together to clean dioxin in soil. Two of our genes are derived from the transcriptomic           data of Burkholderia cenocepacia 869T2 under dioxin-containing condition.
Genes
TonB
TonB-dependent receptors are membrane bound proteins of Gram-negative bacteria that can actively transport the ferric ion carrier, siderophore, which is similar in structure with dioxin[3].
Researches have shown that, some macromolecule such as carbonhydrate, heme or vitamin B12 can permeate TonB-dependent receptor[1,6].
Our TonB protein is derived from transcriptomic data under dioxin-stressed condition of Burkholderia cenocepacia 869T2. It is up-regulated during early growth period (pre-log phase)[2,13]. It can be also found in famous dioxin degradable bacteria, Sphingomonas wittichii RW1[9].
The docking results have shown that the protein structure can allow the passage of TCDD and some other dioxin compound.

Mood enhancement Collection
Through our art and design we aimed to analyse and explore the future implications of delivering genetically modified bacteria to possibly enhance our bodies and minds. Furthermore, we wanted to bring our project to the general public, by creating a collection of pictures with potential products that could be manufactured to deliver our genetically enhanced bacteria. The very background image on this page reflects this.
We collaborated with Anna Dumitriu  a renowned visual artist with a strong interest in microbiology, synthetic biology and ethics whose work blurs the boundaries between art and science. Working with Heather Macklyne in Bristol, this collaborative project gave rise to a range of new products for Anna’s Hypersymbiont Enhancement Salon (http://annadumitriu.tumblr.com/HypersymbiontSalon). Together, we reinvented the purpose of our Mind the Gut synthetic psychobiotics, bearing the TPH1 gene crucial for serotonin biosynthesis.
Live probiotic bacteria were integrated into tabs and jellies, whereas freeze-dried colonies were turned into dust with an added sparkle. This brings us to the proposal that these bacteria which can make us ‘better’ - in this case, happier -can be incorporated into a range of products - toothpaste, lipstick and food. Having experienced an incredibly satisfying journey to the production of this collaborative bioart, we can only quote Anna back and thank her for allowing us to enter a new landscape for the exploration of our project. “My conversations with the UCL team and Heather have been fascinating and I'm learning a lot and also changing some of my prejudices about synthetic biology.” - Anna Dumitriu
Ethics
This year, UCL iGEM team has decided to take a lead in debating the implications of our project and engaging with the public to address the ethical concerns raised by synthetic biology. Our team has therefore been looking deeply into the ethics of synthetic biology, particularly when it is applied to human health, as nowadays multiple social and ethical challenges are arising as a result of the development and expansion of this promising field.
General public survey
We wanted to know the general public perception on the possibility of manufacturing probiotics containing engineered bacterial strains, and what their view on the ethics of this procedure and synthetic biology in general was. Furthermore, we asked them what they thought the future implications and concerns of synthetic biology could be and whether they believed that it would be beneficial for society or not. In order to do so we prepared a short survey for people to fill in through social media, and then we analysed the results and built the statistics.
Our survey was translated into 5"
