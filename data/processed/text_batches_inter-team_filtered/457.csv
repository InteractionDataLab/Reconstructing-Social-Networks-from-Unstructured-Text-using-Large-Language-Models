The restriction was left overnight, the temperature schedule was as follows:
The first 3 hours at 37°C;
20 minutes at 65°C;
The rest of the night at 4°C.
16/07/2015
The restricted IDT genes of 15/07/2015 were ligated according a ratio 3:1 for insert:vector. The first 3h the samples were placed at 16°C and the other 20 minutes it was placed at 4°C. After the ligation, 2µl of each sample was transformed into 50µl TOP10 cells. After 1h at 37°C, 35µl of the sample was plated. For the concentrated sample, we centrifuged the samples for 3 minutes at 4000 rpm. Discarded the supernatant partly and resuspended pellet. Plate also 35µl of concentrated cells.
20/07/2015
Column purification was done on CsgAΔCsgB to remove the small restricted pieces. This was done following protocol of the Wizard column purification.
Colonies from plate #2-13 were grown in triplicate in LB - CAM. In total 36 tubes were used, because triplicates were performed due to possibility of self ligation of the backbones pSB1C3 and pSB4K5. Plate #1 was placed in stove again to grow overnight, for larger colonies, at 37°C.
21/07/2015
CsgEFG was placed in a pSB4K5 plasmid which contains an Kanamycin (KAN) resistance gene. This plasmid was attempted to be grown in Chloramphenicol (CAM), but no growth was obtained. The transformation will be repeated in LB-KAN, with the same colonies used first.
Plasmid isolation was done for cultures #1.1-12.3 (36 total). Analytical restriction was performed to confirm insert size for all samples with EcoRI-HF & PstI-HF (See lab journal, page 38 for pipetted volumes). Only 24 out of 36 had the insert, which will be continued with. The correct plasmids are marked green in Table 1

For these specific parts, we grew them in 50 mL centrifuge tubes with the caps slightly loosened in 30 mL of LB.  The reasoning for this is that we are going to attempt a massive miniprep of these cultures to accrue a lot of DNA, thus ensuring that we will not have to do another miniprep for these parts.  These larger tubes were also affixed at a slant in the shaking incubator as we usually do for the 16 mL culture tubes in order to increase the amount of aeration.  Shaking at 210 rpm.
Important note:  We observed that there were (two) colonies on a YPD plate that we had left on the table at room temperature and also (three) colonies on a YPD plate that we had streaked with YPD media and left in the 30 degree C incubator as a negative control when we had streaked out the yeast strains from glycerol stocks.  Both plates were made on 6/20.  This is bad.  It means that our YPD agar mix was probably contaminated or that our plates were subject to contamination when we made them.  It may also implicate our YPD media as contaminated.  Indeed, a check right now confirmed that there were small pieces of cloudy substance within the YPD media, indicating its contamination.  Our yeast plates are thus no good and we should make more of them tomorrow.  We should also make some more YPD media.  Then we will need to restreak our yeast strains from glycerol stocks.  One will also note at this point that the MHY501 glycerol stock may be contaminated from before.  Thus, one should primarily focus with using MHY500 or MHY606.  It would be idea if we could simply acquire fresh strains of all three seeing as their purity is somewhat questionable.
For future reference:
1M Tris, pH 8.0 (1 L):
Mix 121.1 g of Tris base with 800 mL dH2O. Add 42 mL cHCl. pH is temperature dependent: ~0.03 pH units per 1oC increase. Make sure it is at RT before making final pH adjustments. Add dH2O to 1 L (Autoclave)

Oli has decided to use the split primers for pSJ150 to PCR the pSJ150 backbone for the Mg riboswitch construct as well- the ""product"" from last Friday's PCR was rather ambiguous and it doesn't seem to have worked in the Gibson. Primers for Charlie's biosensor constructs have also arrived, so parts of the construct are PCR-ed. Unfortunately, none of these PCRs yielded any products- possibly due to a problem with the PCR master mix. We should try these again later.
Saturday
Unfortunately there are no visible colonies on our ampicillin plates, which means there might be some problems with the Gibson-ing of the fluorescent construct, or the transformation of E. coli. We will observe for another day.
Jolyon also started culturing some cells for electroporation so we could start the protocol on Monday.
Sunday
Still no colonies for the fluorescent construct plates. Meanwhile we redo Oli and Charlie's PCR: half of Oli's vector has came out, as well as Charlie's RFP. We suspect the reasoning for our failure to PCR the Mg promoter might be due to sequence inconsistency of the biobrick from the registry. Oli will attempt the failed PCRs again tomorrow.

Experiment: 3A of genes w. camV Terminator
The colony PCR products was examined by gel elecroforesis and the following amilCP assemblies was identified as successful:
G3 (or G4 & G7), C3, C5
Furthermore, we chose H2 and H4 to be an overnight culture. We chose G8 as a control.

The colonies were cultivated further in a liquid overnight cultre for miniprepping tomorrow. Lastly, we redid the gel for the hph selection marker. From this, it seems like H2 is the most viable selection marker.
GelDoc 2018-08-27 16hr 13min H1 - H2 - H3 - H4 - Neg
Based on these gels, we isolated specific cultures.
It seems like the backup digestion and ligation does not work. We will therefore redo that experiment, this time with linear inserts.  We think that if the inserts excist as plasmids, there is a posibility that they can aquire only the terminator and not the combined ligation. Therefore, only linear fragments will be used. This ensures that a colony"

In a few words, we proceeded by selecting the corn syrup fraction which was insoluble in 90% ethanol, but also soluble in 70% ethanol. This fraction was obtained by following a sequence of 5 operations, repeated 4 times:
Dissolving corn syrup in water
Adding ethanol to reach the desired concentration (three times 90% and once 70%)
Stirring
Decantation
Retrieving the liquid or solid phase, depending on the stage of the protocol using a centrifuge.
After the final retrieving, we had to dry our product. To proceed, we needed a freeze-dryer, device which is not in possession of the BBGM lab. We asked Professor Benjamin Elias, who runs another lab of the university, if we could use their own, under supervision, what he accepted. Thanks to this support, we could dry our “homemade pentamaltose” as we called it and continue our experiments.
Before using this maltopentaose in our experiments, we first had to test each of the produced batches to be sure only our positive control, with the leaky porin phenotype, ˝pIV*˝ could grow in its presence. To do so, we developed a very simple test: we prepared seven petri dishes with our M63 medium. The plan of the test was as follows:
1 dish received nothing (control dish)
1 dish received homemade maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV phenotype
1 dish received industrial maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV phenotype
1 dish received homemade maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV* phenotype
1 dish received industrial maltodextrin and was inoculated with pIV* phenotype
1 dish just received industrial  maltodextrin
1 dish just received homemade maltodextrin
After an overnight incubation at 37°C, the seven dishes were checked and the batch was accepted if only the 2 dishes with incoulated pIV* expressing bacteria showed colonies and only them. The 5 others had to stay blank.
Even though this quick test was regarded as enough to pursue our experiments, we wanted to know the exact composition of our homemade product. So we sent samples to our Cargill contact who made chromatography analysis of them. The results are shown in the chromatograms at figures 2, 3 and 4:

For this project the suggested final product is a modified yeast strain that has higher resistance for irradiation. The product is meant to be used in chemostats in the industry (e.g. brewing or biofuel production) or in academic research.
We have asked our selves: What consequences will our product have if it got out on the market? Since the product may be used in industries and later on in products for public use we wanted to know what the public thinks about GMO products. This is the reason why we made a survey about what the public in Gothenburg and the scientists at Chalmers thinks about GMO and the areas of use for it. The survey has also been made by the Czech Republic team for the public in Prague.
GMO is an area that wakes a lot of feelings, and almost everyone has an opinion about it. There is an ongoing discussion about GMO in food, where the public in general often thinks that GMOs are not ok to use, but the scientists mostlyhave the opposite opinion and say that GMOs have been used in one way or another for decades and not harmful for humans (Solli, Bach, & Åkerman, 2014). Even if scientists says that the products are safe, 67% of the European citizens think that we should not develop genetically modified food (Solli, Bach, & Åkerman, 2014).
In the EU, there are strict rules for food that is genetically engineered. For example, all food that has in some way been modified has to be labeled. This is partly because of the risk of non-modified food potentially being “contaminated” with modified food (Ahmed, 2002) and partly because of the big concern of the public (Nicolia, Manzo, Veronesi, & Rosellini, 2013). It has been shown that genetically engineered crops are safe to use and aren’t harmful to human, and lower the amount of chemicals that are used on the fields. Even so there are only three crops with genetically modifications that are allowed in the EU (Nicol"

Promoter mutation
Background
The regulation of gene expression is always the key point for most scientists to study. Traditionally, the functional gene is recognized to be controlled by the transcriptional promoter. And the promoter DNA interacting with RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription has been extensively researched over recent decades.  Among the defined findings, the binding affinity and the open rate of complex formation are two key factors governing the promoter strength.
There are two regions predicting to play essential roles in prokaryotic transcription initiation, which are located at -10 and -35 regions. According to the specific effects of these two conserved sequence, plenty of mutations were built to investigate. It is important to make the mutational analysis to establish library with varying strengths promoters and to make the basic biological research easier.
Mechanism
As the first step of gene expression in prokaryote, the promoter is the DNA sequence affecting the frequency and location of transcription initiation through interaction with RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Two conserved regions about the -35 region and the -10 region were regarded as carriers containing those properties.
－35 Region:
During the transcriptional initiation, RNA polymerase and its associated Sigma factor will recognize this element. The RNA polymerase attaches itself to the template DNA strand and proceeds to slide the entire strand from 3’ to 5’ direction. Defined by sequence data, the overall strength of a promoter is important while various mutational analysis showed this region is involved in the initial binding affinity of holoenzyme. For a mutational analysis, kinds of strength revealed promoters have been constructed by replace each base. Higher-strength the natural promoter is, the wider range of efficient hybrid promoter will be get. Considered there is 6 bases of a group comprised in -35 region, 4096 mutations are the upper limit.
Base substitutions at position —31 gave only a little effect; base substitution sat position -32 caused significant reduction independent of which base replaced cytosine; base substitutions at position —35 also led to reduction, although the effects were somewhat smaller than those of -32 base substitutions; the effects of base substitutions at position -33, -34 and -36 were variable depending on the actual base introduced. The rate of open complex formation (parameter II) was slower for most variant promoters than for the wild"

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

This year, we focus on an important chemical organic synthesis raw material – acrylic acid. We hope to                         build an cell factory to achieve ""all green"" production of acrylic acid efficiently, so                         we choose glycerol as the raw material for microbial cell factories to produce bulk chemical products.                         Glycerol has the advantage of being cheap and environmentally-friendly, and allaying the pressure on                         the by-product waste in the production of biodiesel. In addition, compared to glucose, xylose and                         other carbohydrate substrates, glycerol metabolism can produce higher reducing power.
Complex synthetic pathway, vague synthetic mechanism and low efficiency of the synthesis, are the                         current shortcomings of acrylic biosynthesis method.How to come up with a short and efficient acrylic biosynthetic pathway to build a highly efficient acrylic acid biosynthetic factory is the key to success!  This is also                         the entry point for our project this year.
Overview of existing and hypothetical metabolic pathways for biosynthesis of acrylate from sugars.
In the previous experiments, we had further demonstrated the new function of ceaS2 enzyme, which can catalyze the production of acrylic acid with DHAP (dihydroxy acetone phosphate) or G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) as substrate. Because acrylic acid is not the main product of ceaS2 enzyme, the catalytic                         effect of wild-type ceaS2 enzyme is very weak and the yield of acrylic acid is only 1mg / L. So we                         carried out engineering modification of this enzyme to improve the catalytic effect of the core part.                         We used the AEMD (Auto Enzyme Mutation Design) platform to identify mutational sites and screened                         for high catalytic efficiency by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) and HTS (High throughput screening) of the ceaS2 mutant.
In the selection of the chassis organisms, we chose E. coli which is a kind of classic chassis organism                         in prokaryote and Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is the most easily manipulated chassis organism                         in eukaryotes.

SDU-CHINA,2018,Team:SDU-CHINA#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and practicable. Let’s turn our sight onto this new system itself. Since our goal is to introduce a new and convenient inducer—light into fermentation industry, the core of our project is that how to put the new system into practice. Since the system is promising in its marketing value with both the new inducer and environmental-friendly product, we cannot be satisfied with completing building this system and testing it in our lab, what we need to do is applying this system into practical use, our system finally should be tested in the real factory. However, there are great differences between fermentation in labs and industrial fermentation, before putting this new system into practice, we should figure out the distinctions between fermentation in labs and factories, in this way we can find some guidance in improving our system to break these obstacles.
What we did
    To figure out the differences, we had an unforgettable tour this summer to an industrial fermentation factory to visit and learn something about fermentation. We visited a biotechnology company called Weifang KDN Biotech, in Weifang, Shandong Province. We mainly visited several workshops there.
    Different workshops with different usage were located in the industrial park, the largest one, equipped with huge, spheroid fermenter, was the main place where fermentation took place. Raw materials, as well as engineered bacteria, were stored in the fermenters. While fermentation, special device would check and regulate temperature and pH inside the fermenters to ensure the environment was suitable for bacterial growth and production. Once fermentation was ended, the bacteria liquid would flow to another workshop through many pipes. Next, the product should be separated from bacteria and other liquid, the theory base of product purification is kind of like chromatography. Finally, the waste would be poured into treatment tank and experienced special treatment.
    We also consulted their skilled workers about the process of fermentation and the usage of equipment, and we posed our idea and light-induced control of metabolic flux system. Our questions were answered in detail and the workers also gave some advice on our light- induced system.
What we found
    According to the human practice we did and the theoretical knowledge we collected, we found that there are still some defaults existing in our project, we must figure out the problems and break those obstacles. Now, we are going to list the obstacles we need to overcome.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," live biotherapeutic bacteria”
From these meetings we were able to determine our strategy for the policy we were aiming to create. The first part of the policy is an introduction to all current regulations regarding GMOs, live biotherapeutic product (LBP) and drug delivery systems as a first step to understanding how all these parts are perceived to-date. Further on, all the background information was analysed and a solution is proposed that assures the safety in the usage of LBP’s. The developed solution proposes an evaluation of Human Safety, Environmental Safety and risk assessment before any product with these characteristics can be approved for human use. Additionally, several final considerations on how clinical studies should be performed are also explained.
Together with the advices from Katarina, Åsa and Erik, we also incorporated the society's views on GMOs into our policy. For this reason, we thought it would be a good idea to host a GMO debate, where we would bring experts with different knowledge and opinions about the use of GMOs and initiate a discussion where the public could actively be engaged and build on an opinion on the subject. This event was held in collaboration with Uppsala University's iGEM team. The result of the panel discussion exceeded our expectations and was implemented into our policy.
However, we wanted to take the next step in the successful implementation of the policy we had been working on. Because of this, we handed the policy over to the Medical Products Agency, since they are the head governmental agency handling, regulating and in the end accepting new medicinal drugs in Sweden. Our goal is that in the future they use the policy we developed for the evaluation of future applications.
Read our policy here.
Product design
From the beginning of our project, we had the goal of always keeping the final customer in the center of the development of our idea. Because of this, we decided to conduct patient surveys, in order to understand their worries and needs, and how they experience life with these diseases. From these surveys we received significant information that helped us shape different parts of our project. Additionally, we interviewed six healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists about the need of a new medication and how it would be designed.
From the patient surveys we obtained that the preferred way of administrating our treatment would be to inhale it into the lungs. From the doctor interviews and research on the field, we were able to narrow it down to a nebulizer for the inhalation of the product over a longer period of time. Therefore we draw the conclusion that a type of inhalation device, such a nebulizer, would be the"

The slices were weighted and accordingly Buffer QG added to the gel (for 1 slice 600 μl; for 2 slices 900 μl). The tubes with the mixture were incubated at 55°C until the gel slices had completely dissolved. In between samples were vortexed, if fragement sizes were not too large. Since the color of the solution never changed, no pH adjustments had to be done. In the next step isopropanol was added (for 1 slice 200 μl; for 2 slices 300 μl) to the sample and mixed. For each sample a QIAquick spin column was placed into the vacuum manifold and the sample decanted to it to bind DNA. Vacuum was applied until the whole sample has been drawn through the column. For further purification samples were washed with 500 μl buffer QG and vacuum was applied. Afterwards 750 μl Buffer PE were added to the samples, let stand for 2-5 minutes and vacuum applied. To remove residual wash buffer, the columns were placed into collection tubes and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). Finally, the columns were put into clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and 20-30 μl water (55°C) were added to the center of the column. After letting the column stand for 1 minute it was centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the elute.
For larger DNA fragments, the QIAEX II® Gel Extraction Kit was used (suitable for 40 bp to 50 kbp). Solutions were prepared as advised in the instruction protocol. DNA bands were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel and transfered to a microcentrifuge tube. After weighing the slices, buffer QX1 was added according to the DNA fragment size (6 volumes for <100 bp; 3 volumes for 100 bp – 4 kb; 3 volumes with 2 volumes of water for >4 kb). QIAEX II was vortexed for 30 seconds to resuspend the agent and added to the samples (10 μl QIAEXII for ≤2 μg DNA; 30 μl for 2–10 μg DNA; and an additional 30 μl for each additional 10 μg DNA). Subsequently the solution was mixed and incubated at 50°C for 10 min to solubilize the agarose and bind the DNA. Since we mainly used this kit for"

Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," E. coli DH5𝛼 with endogenous FimE.  Lane 1 is a 100bp Ladder (NEB), lane 2 is K880001 showing a mixed state indicated by the presence the uninverted K880001 yielding the 357bp band, and the inverted K880001 resulting in a 255 and 238bp band.
Negative Modified Fluorescent Reporter (BBa_K880002) Data:
To additionally test our hypothesis we made a fluorescent reporter with the IRR and IRL orientation, analogous to K880001. Unexpectedly, we did not observe fluorescence possibly attributable to partially flipped states observed in the K880001 co-transformation assays (Fig 7 and 8 above)
Observation of HbiF induced fimbriation in DH5α
We were hoping to test HbiF on the FimE-flipped reporters however due to only obtaining partially flipped states we were unable to isolate a flipped plasmid to test this.  Upon transformation of E. coli DH5α with strong, constitutively expressed HbiF (K880005-K880000), we noticed cell aggregates in liquid cultures that were difficult to resuspend upon pelleting. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the culture showed that HbiF expressing cells were fimbriated (Fig 9, A and B), suggesting that HbiF is expressed and actively working on the natural fimS region flipping from “OFF” to “ON” (Xie et al., 2006).
TEM micrographs of E. coli DH5𝛼 cells transformed with HbiF in pSB1A2 (A, B) versus untransformed E. coli DH5𝛼 cells (C, D).  Fimbriae are clearly visible in the cells expressing HbiF (A, B), while absent in the control cells (C, D). Bar length indicates 500 nm.
Conclusion
We have designed a protein expression system utilizing unidirectional recombinases HbiF and FimE, and have tested for the activities of both recombinases by creating two asymmetric digest assays. The effect of recombinase activity on the reporter was observed more consistently than what was shown by the FimE reporter (K137058) as submitted by Caltech 2008, which we did not observe to have an inversion. We created two asymmetrical digest reporters in order to obtain semi-quantitative data on recombinase activity at the DNA level.  Using the digestible reporters, we determined that FimE has a low inversion"

OD 405 absorbance of these samples was measured using a Synergy H1 plate reader every 15 seconds for 10 minutes. Below are our results:
Induced PETase-sfGFP fusion is catalytically active.
PETase fused to GFP is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate over time. Lysate induced to produce PETase was incubated with PNPB substrate (pink) or lysis buffer (green) and 405nm absorbance measured over time. The sfGFP tag produces some absorbance reading which is why the green trend line is not closer to zero. Upon the addition of PNPB substrate, absorbance increases (pink trend) suggesting that PETase is catalytically active on the PNPB substrate. Plus and minus 1 standard deviation is shown in the shaded region. Without inducer, otherwise identical cell lysate has low absorbance as it is not expressing PETase or the GFP tag (brown). Likewise, the substrate by itself has low absorbance (blue).
Our results indicate that PETase-sfGFP has background absorbance without the pNPB substrate, but that with the pNPB substrate absorbance increases, showing that PETase-sfGFP is able to catalyze pNPB into 4-nitrophenol which will absorb at this wavelength. The background is absorbance is likely due to the sfGFP fusion, which typically emits most strongly at a different wavelength but would also absorb some at 405nm. Further, this is evidence that the induction system we designed has strong control over PETase-sfGFP expression because we see almost no absorbance when the cultures were uninduced, and strong absorbance otherwise.
In conclusion, this validates that PETase is catalytically active with our sfGFP fusion. Plastiback can be easy to use with a fluorescent “systems check” and also break down PET.
Optimizing media for PETase and E. Coli
Now that we have the PETase enzyme working, we want to optimize the pH to have the most enzyme activity and fastest growth rate of E. coli. The problem is that PETase is most enzymatically active at pH 9 while E.coli growth is fastest at pH 7. For this reason, we ran E. coli growth curves to see how fast E. coli grows at different pHs in order to try to find a compromise or happy medium.

Our visit to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where the Girls Inc. event was held, was both stimulating for the girls and for our team. We started our visit by observing a panel of executives from companies and corporations, such as National Grid, providing insight and advice on how to succeed. Next, we presented about iGEM, our project, synthetic biology, and even gave a “crash course” on basic biology terminology. The girls were captivated and asked us questions about our research experience and advice on what classes they should take. To further captivate the girls, five team members created a game to crystallize the concepts of genes and promoters, a major aspect of synthetic biology. In order to solve a real-world problem, the girls were asked to create theoretical gene circuits with promoters, genes and restriction enzymes. The girls were creative in producing their gene circuits. For example, one girl came up with a sensor that would detect high acidity and would show bioluminescence in the presence of pollution and other girls tried to tackle diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Then, they were given two different colored string to represent the DNA that they twisted and tied together to create plasmid DNA. Our approach to educating a higher educational level of students was a success as we were invited back to present to BNL. We, as a team, believe that we learned to question more real-life situations stemming from the curiosity of the girls.

After spending hours perfecting our interactive presentation, we were successful in introducing synthetic biology to students between the grades of 7 and 9. We began our visit by explaining iGEM, our project, and the many applications and misconceptions of synthetic biology. Afterward, we gave a quick “crash course” on specific terms and concepts in synthetic biology such as restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, proteins, and how recombinant DNA is formed. Ultimately leading to our interactive activity in which the students were able to insert their creative genes into plasmids. Many of these middle schoolers had fascinating questions, and the iGEM team members were able to answer them diligently. After the activity, the students walked away with a complimentary iGEM pen, a plasmid made up of twisted string, a syringe that represented the tools that biologists used, and the basic knowledge of synthetic biology. The pictures we took can not even express how rewarding the students felt with their experience in this interactive event. We approached this event by preparing an"

First, after we giving light, the worm would change their direction in about 2 seconds in average. Their reactions are always step back. Secondly if we focus on the movement of their heads, we can find the turning angles change a lot during this time. It means the blue light can stimulate the muscle of their heads and as a result the worm will change the direction. But their behavior will turn to normal at the moment we turn off the light instantaneously. The speed of worm doesn’t have some apparent changes.

METHODOLOGY
We decite to ask to our team members:
Why do you consider (in your opinion), that iGEM competition addres  ""Human Practices"" issues?
(including under the special prizes awards).
II. TEAM'S ANSWERS
Dukakis: ""Genetic manipulation has always been a controversial issue, an example is the clonation of the first mammal, Dolly the sheep, which further exacerbated the controversies. Years earlier, was the genetic manipulation of foods to make them resistant to pests and get better features, which began the debate on the necessity and the consequences of this practice. Recently there has appeared a new discipline, Synthetic Biology, and taking into account this background it is important in order to avoid prejudice and misconceptions,deeply assess the impact and implications of this discipline. Moreover, creating awareness in society about the benefits, risks, utilization and impact of Synbio for society in general as well as for science and technology. So I think it has been necessary to include within iGEM ""Human Practices"" to address the above.""
Fotis: ""My personal opinion is that the human practice is a vital part of IGEM because it provides essential information to public, answering their common questions about what is synbio. Responding questions to common people is very important for the reason that synbio revolution cannot be compared with another type of revolution because we make use of living parts.""
Kesia: ""The Human Practices project is necessary in this kind of competition because it's what keep us joined to our humanity. Before to be whatever we are, we are human beings and it's a must to have it in mind in order to do real science: Integral Science.""

PE-Texas Red is a covalently linked fluorochrome used as the detector.  The FACS machine measure the emission of this fluorochrome because Nile Red is not a common fluorochrome that a FACS machine would have detector specific to Nile red.
The left graph shows the distribution of cells entering the FACS.  A gate is made to only focus on those which are relatively round and average size (the enclosed red shape).  The right graph is the fluorescence of those selected cells.  A gate (labeled P2) is made and 1/10,000 of the cells are within this gate.  Ideally we would want the machine to select only those with fluorescence above the control cells (and thus no control cells in the P2 gate) but we believe this one cells is an outlier due to its abnormally high levels of fluorescence.
This is the experimental sample.  The same gate is applied to attempt to sort the desired cells (those with higher levels of Nile red fluorescence) compared to the control.  These 7/10,000 cells were sorted and a culture was made in a matter of minutes.
Next we tested these FACS sorted cells on the plate reader to see if we could detect a difference from the FACS sorted and non-FACS sorted cells
This graph demonstrates that our FACS bioassay method was successful in selecting for cells that exhibit higher levels of PLA-induced fluorescence.

BioBrick Part Design
As does every sophisticated SynBio project, we designed a plethora of BioBrick constructs and devices in the course of our project. Most prominent among these are the modular transmembrane proteins we conceptualized, since they are integral to the functionality of our bioprinting system. Basing our workflow on the standard RFC[10] and RFC[25] assembly standards, we assembled the same intracellular and transmembrane domains, namely mRuby3 and the EGFR transmembrane domain, with different extracellular domains, among them single-chain avidin, monomeric avidin, and NanoLuc fused with an N-terminal Avi-tag for in vivo biotinylation by the co-expressed biotin ligase BirA. We coupled these constructs with a trafficking signal for membrane integration. Including further elements to stabilize these receptors offers advantages over previously assembled BioBricks, and planning our constructs with multiple options for detection provided us ample opportunity to extensively characterize the outcome. Apart from these eukaryotic designs, we drafted an autotransporter construct for bacterial surface display.
Production, purification & conjugation of recombinant proteins
As the second constituent of our two-component polymerization system next to the membrane proteins, we required large amounts of protein, either biotin-binding or bearing chemically introduced biotin depending on the receptor in question. For biotin-binding proteins, we produced and purified the avidin variants wt streptavidin; traptavidin,a variant with higher affinity toward biotin and enhanced thermal stability; streptactin, a variant that binds an oligopeptide sequence termed strep-tag; and enhanced monomeric avidin, which does not assemble into tetramers and is thus monovalent. wt Streptavidin was produced both in the dimensions of shaker flasks and a fermenter"

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#SPL_-_-_TEXT.html," C, G and T, while S stands for 50% each of C and G, and W stands for 50% A and T.
The point of randomizing both areas is to obtain a promoter library that is not biased towards being strong. This is achieved by giving two bases within each of the consensus regions a 50% chance of being their original bases, ensuring that only 1/16 of all promoters will be strong. This is without taking into consideration the fraction of strong promoters obtainable from the randomized spacer sequences.
As previous studies indicate, consensus regions outside of the -35 and -10 regions seem to contribute very little in terms of altering promoter strengths. Mutating a single nucleotide will not change the promoter strength substantially, however mutating many nucleotides in the spacer sequences surrounding the -35 and -10 regions seem to result in the most significant alterations in promoter strengths. This might be due to the three-dimensional structure that forms from the sequences that are arranged from the randomized spacer sequences (Jensen and Hammer 1998).
When wanting to characterize and/or fine tune BioBrick parts and devices, using promoters that are constrained to already set strengths, has the disadvantage that the promoter might induce gene expression that is either too high or too low for the cell to be viable. This problem is nonexistent when using SPL since the SPL will necessarily give you the allowed upper and lower bounds of gene expression for cell viability. Cells with too strong or too weak promoters will simply never grow colonies.
The DTU Synthetic Promoter Library Standard
We utilized the SPL technology to create a new BioBrick Standard in the form of a BioBrick Foundation Request For Comments (BBF RFC). The DTU Synthetic Promoter Library Standard was submitted as BBF RFC 63.
Strategy for Integrating SPL into the BioBrick Assembly Standard
There are many different ways to integrate an SPL into the BioBrick Standard, and a lot of ideas were considered when creating this RFC. However, in the end a method was chosen based on the fact that it would be least time consuming for teams looking to use SPL, and at the same time, be easy to do. Instead of relying on ligations to successfully insert the SPL onto the BioBrick plasmid backbone, a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method was designed to not only amplify the backbone but also add the SPL onto the linear BioBrick plasmid backbone at a specific chosen site (see Figure 2). Since most teams will probably have to amplify their backbones during the course of a project, this method will only require a small amount of extra work"

For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37 kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.

Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, one was induced with 1 mM IPTG and one was left uninduced as a control. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted.

However, it was quite apparent that we did not use enough cells in each well.  Our reasoning for this is that the graphs for plain media as compared to are almost identical.  To correct this problem, we propose adding more cells to the   We also discovered that the YPD we use in our lab has a significant amount of fluorescence in approximately the same range as EYFP.  Of course, we do not plan to use this media from now on, but it is quite good to know this.
Another important point concerning media is that the dropout media we have been using apparently contains glucose as its carbon source.  This presents a problem for all constructs that are under the control of the pGAL1 promoter (including all of our activators) because glucose very strongly represses the activity of this promoter.  It may also explain some of the results we saw today, seeing as all of the reporters specific to repressors are actually under control of the pGAL1 promoter.  We had originally been under the impression that all reporters were under control of the mCYC promoter.  However, while this would explain why we do not see any difference between the YFP of wells with transformed yeast and the YFP of wells with just media, it does not explain the same observation for mCherry.  Thus, we still maintain that we did not use enough yeast cells per well.

As two teams from one school, Our team and SEU_A are connected tightly. Though working for different projects, we discussed about the idea together at the beginning, ran experiments in the same laboratory, shared all kind of reagent and a lot of valuable memories. During this process, the two teams helped each other a lot.
What we have done:
Xuelong Fan did most administrative work for both teams, such as fund raising and team registry.
In the discussion stage, Muyuan Chen is actually the first to come up with the idea of ""Poisonous Apple"", trying to kill other bacteria by inserting a plasmid with both ""Sweet Gene"" and ""Death Gene"" into the gene pool, which is later developed and partly realized by team SEU_A.
At the beginning of experiment, Shen Gao did a lot of work to introduce basic experiment operations to the junior members of SEU_A.
We held a lecture on synthetic biology as human practice together, in which Xiaodan Xu gave an impressive speech.
For confirmation, see their Attribution Page .
What they have done
SEU_A held a lecture on synthetic biology as human practice and invited our team and NJU to share ideas together. In which most of the organizational work is done by the member of SEU_A.
In the final stage of experiment, SEU_A helped us in providing bacteria caring pSB1C3 and the expression vector for verification experiment.
In the lab, SEU_A is responsible for most of the cleaning and disinfection work.

Rub L - Bgal brick
Description: Includes the lacZ gene ( BBa_I732005 ), which encodes for the β-galactosidase attached with a linker ( BBa_K105012 ) to the large subunit of the RuBisCO ( BBa_K1113701 ) under the regulation of the pBad/araC promoter ( BBa_I0500 ), and includes a RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The construct was made to prove the delivery of the β-galactosidase to the inside of the BMC and to test reactions in vitro within the carboxysome.
The large subunit of the RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley).
This part was constructed with a mutation on the prefix (from “cggccgc” to “atacctg”), which erases the NotI restriction site. This modification allows the correct design of primers for Gibson Assembly. This part was constructed on the pSB4K5 standard vector.
RubL-GFP-ssrA
Description: This part consist on the superfolder GFP ( BBa_I746916 ) attached to two targeting sequences: The large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase enzyme, RuBisCO, ( BBa_K1113701 ), which targets into the inside of Carboxysome, and the ssrA degradation tag ( BBa_M0052 ), which is a targeting sequence for degradation by the protease ClpXP. This construct was used as a reporter for the correct assembly of the Carboxysome. It works with the competition of the two targeting sequence., In case of a correct assembly of the Carboxysome, the microcompartment will keep the fluorescent protein protected inside it, in any other case this will be degraded by the protease.
The large subunit of RuBisCO was obtained from the pHnCBS1D plasmid (plasmid provided by David Savage, Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley). All the others are bricks available on the Registry.

Encapsulin protein cage nanocarrier - Toward high throughput production of personalized cancer vaccines
In order to assess the feasibility of our vaccine production scheme, we performed different experiments. First, we will demonstrate that it is possible to express encapsulin in a home-made cell-free system. Next, we will modify Encapsulin for the purpose of increasing its heat stability following the research done by Moon et al., 2014. Then, we will demonstrate a rapid and efficient purification method of the expressed protein nanocompartments. In order to allow for the generation of neoantigen-presenting encapsulin, we will generate plasmid constructs for the rapid genetic integration of neoantigen sequences. This platform will be tested by the production of the model encapsulin-OT-1 protein nanoparticle, which will be extensively characterized by common techniques and ultimately by its action on dendritic cells.
Cell-free expression of proteins
Assessing the efficiency of our TX-TL (Sun et al., 2013) cell-free system is key before expressing our protein of interest. To do so, we made use of the fluorescence of sfGFP to assess the efficiency of expression. We therefore expressed                     sfGFP in our cell-free system and measured fluorescence with a microplate reader over time, following the 2017 EPFL iGEM protocol . We used this kind of experiments as an internal                     reference to assess in a relative way the quality of our lysates and energy solutions.

Similarly, sicA proteins must form a dimmer when binding with invF to form the sicA-invF complex. So according to mass balance, we minus double px2 in the equations for proteins[sicA] but just minus single px2 in the equations for proteins[invF]. Therefore when the last inducer, aTc, is added, we can give all the equations for layered AND gates as follows:
Then we use time parameter to combine the three equations (I), (II), (III). We give initial value for all three inducers but make other materials’ initial concentration zero. The simulation result shows as figure2.1 and figure 2.2.
MIN System Model
We established two kinds of model to describe the principles of MIN system, one in single cell, and the other one for population.
We constructed the first MIN system model which simulate the system in single cell. Also a series of differential equations were written to construct the model. The construction strategy is still dynamic simulation method. We assume that the initial concentration in every single cell is the same. And we ignore the diffusion of AHL because the consumption of AHL will be very quick due to high E.coli population. With AHL gradually decreases, the transcription rate of MinC increases. We use kM(1-I[AHL]/I0[AHL]) to simulate the process. So four equations are used to describe the dynamic change of some important materials:
We give an initial value for AHL, and the simulation result shows as figure 3.1
We also designed a model for E.colis’ population.
At the beginning, we use a classical model, density-dependent growth model, for our population growing simulation. An equation, dN/dt=k1N(1-N/(Nm-M)), were used to describe the change of cell density. But we find it just cannot describe the function of our system. Because if we use this model, however we adjust the parameters or change the initial value of AHL, the cell density will finally come to the maximum Nm. The Nm is set according to normal condition. But in our MIN system, MinC and MinD can bind with each other to form a MinCD division inhibitor. The inhibitor can prevent cell division process.

Communication makes the best!
iGEM is not only a competition about experiments in labs, is about communication as well. For more communication in iGEM community, this year, we got out of lab and attended several meet-ups held by iGEM teams. We have built great relationship with some iGEM teams, which provided a solid foundation for us to collaborate.
NKU_CHINA: 10 Teams United!
In July 6th to 7th, we went to Tianjin and took part in the meet-up with ten different iGEM teams from nine universities in NKU. We firstly introduced our projects and iGEMers brought up some questions while providing suggestions. On the second day, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to the students in NKU, helping to promote science among the campus.
Based on this meet-up, we built friendship with TUST_China, Fudan_CHINA, NPU-CHINA and etc, which helps us to co-work in the next several months!
USTC: Seize the Chance!
From July 22nd to July 24th, a conference for Honors Program Students in China was held in USTC. Thanks to this opportunity, some team members of the Jilin_China met the iGEMers from XJTU-China, BNU-China and USTC at the college of Life Sciences.
After a short visit of iGEM lab in USTC, we introduced the project in 2018 followed by a heat discussion. We talked a lot about our experiments, Human Practices, Model and possible collaboration. Receiving some suggestions, we have gained a lot from those energic young scientists!

Saved & Safe
A wide range of parties are involved with tackling TB in the UK. Important to our project was to really engage with those at the forefront of TB eradication. Central to this is a company called Saved & Safe and their director Michael Ross. Michael lives in New Zealand and was highly involved with the strategy that saw a decrease in TB incidence rate across New Zealand of 96% in just 10 years. Following this success Michael has approached the UK with a strategy that brings together all affected parties. With their 31 UK and international partners, Saved & Safe are taking a new and innovative approach in the fight against TB, something our test could offer great potential to.

Micheal Ross - Director of Saved & Safe
A company at the forefront of bTB eradication in the United Kingdom
Michael was extremely excited by our project. Having been heavily involved with New Zealand's Animal Health Board's highly successful strategy to eradicate bTB from New Zealand, his unique approach gave us many ideas as a team. Saved & Safe are at the forefront of TB eradication in the UK with 31 UK and international partners involved on a handful of 'demonstration farms' across the UK. A number of University research groups are also involved in this project. Michael explained some of the key principles behind the work that is occurring at these demonstration farms and told us how our project, if successful, would fit into the work they are doing.
Common Goals
Michael made it clear Bovine TB affects a wide range of people from a wide range of backgrounds. For each individual party associated with the fight against bTB comes a different set of priorities. In order for the UK to develop an effective strategy to manage and eradicate bTB it is important that common ground is established between groups. For example, the NFU represents the farming community of the UK. For them, a bTB breakdown has an immediate negative impact on their livelihood, an impact that they have limited control over. For vets, bTB testing is a continuous cycle that has to be highly organised and can be highly time consuming. For academics, bTB is not only a highly challenging disease, it is a disease where advancements have been slow to non existent.

We used these events to gauge the level of awareness, and knowledge, the public currently has about Zika."
Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," find out their opinions on synthetic biology, what we could do to improve its profile, and how they wanted synthetic biology to help them. The responses we got to our surveys were truly diverse and, at times, reflected the public's lack of understanding about what synthetic biology can and cannot do. Duke received a response suggesting that we use synthetic biology to stop racism. While we're confident in synthetic biology's huge potential, we weren't sure whether it extended quite this far. There were also numerous suggestions that we ""create"" more energy, showing to us that perhaps more effort is needed to educate the public on the first law of thermodynamics.
Despite these scientifically unsound suggestions, we gathered that the public would love to see synthetic biology being put to use in the areas of environment and medicine, particularly in relation to global warming and antibiotic resistance. We each presented on an idea based on our surveys and voted on the top 6 topics. These were SPACE as proudly presented by Sam, using the human microbiome (which later evolved into our actual project) by Raffy, metal extraction by Leon, desalination by Duke, biological readouts in contact lenses and plants by Will and Lychee respectively.
Given Sam's great enthusiasm for space, we started exploring it in greater detail as a team. We tried combining some of the other ideas with space exploration and discussed different ways that synthetic biology could help with the long journey to the next planet/system/galaxy. This is where we also started exploring Fred's idea of using Shewanella oneidensis (""Shewy"") as a long term food or energy source in space. It was interesting during these early stages of the project, for the biochemists as least to puzzle over some unfamiliar aspects of biochemistry and see how we could incorporate them into our project. However, at times we were too bio heavy, perhaps lacking a focus on the engineering aspects of what we're trying to achieve. Instead of approaching things from an engineer's perspective, targeted on making a design that works with as few original ideas as possible (to loosely quote Freeman Dyson), we fully went down the biochemist's route of 1) a wacky idea, 2) lots of wacky idea discussion and finally 3) does this actually work?
Outcome: half a term spent on Shewy...

During this amplification step, mutations are introduced into the oligonucleotides, yielding a new library. This library may again be incubated with the target molecule. Typically, these steps are repeated 8-15 times. In the last round of SELEX the oligonucleotides still present in the mixture are identified by sequencing.
This procedure enabled researchers to discover oligonucleotides with high affinities and a perfect fit for arbitrary proteins, cells, small molecules and even viruses. After this perfect fit, these synthetic oligonucleotides were called ‘aptamers’ – stemming from the Latin aptus which can be translated into ‘fit’.
The Rise of Aptamers
25 Years after the discovery of Tuerk’s and Gold’s invention of SELEX, aptamers have become available for hundreds of ligands, including proteins, viruses, other small molecules and even whole cells.
Aptamer sequences have been published for over 500 ligands. These ligands include small molecules, viruses, proteins and whole cells. Among these are some very notable ligands, such as HIV, cancerous cells and ricin, the extremely toxic compound which plays a prominent role in the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad series. These figures were obtained through Aptamer Base, a collaboratively created knowledge base about aptamers and the experiments that produced them, curated and maintained by a team of aptamer researchers.

As such, aptamers have become a viable alternative for biology’s traditional recognition elements, antibodies. Aptamers also provide numerous advantages over antibodies. As mentioned, aptamers are oligonucleotides whereas antibodies are proteins. As such, aptamers have a remarkable stability in a wide range of pH and temperatures, have higher shelf lifes, are non-toxic and lack immunogenicity [4] [5] . Other advantages stem from the fact that aptamers are generated in vitro, whereas antibodies are generated through in vivo enrichment followed by purification through monoclonal cell lines [6] . As a result, generation of aptamers is less laborious, production costs are lower and reproducibility is higher. Finally, in contrast to antibodies, aptamers can be generated against virtually any molecule, including toxins and poor immunogenic targets [7] . This places aptamers amongst the most powerful tools in biotechnology [8] .
A major limitation of aptamers in comparison with antibodies is their stability in vivo, where nucleic acids are rapidly degraded. Aptam"

Imperial_College_London,2009,Team:Imperial College London#M1_-_-_TEXT.html," challenges involved in enyzme production is the need for resistance to the proteases found within the small intestine. Although The E.ncapsulator is capable of delivering the enyzmes safely through the harsh environment in the stomach, upon release into the small intestine, the cells would be susceptible to breakdown by the proteases naturally found in the gut enviroment. For this reason, we have used protease resistant forms of the enyzmes to be produced.
We have chosen two enzymes to showcase The E.ncapsulator's protein production module. These are:
Cellulase - an enzyme that breaks down the tough fibrous molecule cellulose into cellobiose. In delivering cellulase to the gut we aim to increase the nutritional value of food consumed.
  About cellulase and our proposed solution
Phenylalanine Hydroxylase - an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. In delivering this enzyme to the gut we aim to provide a treatment to those suffering from the metabolic condition, phenylketonuria.
  About the genetic condition phenylketonuria, PAH and how we modified it
Peptide Production
The delivery and production of short chain peptides is a different challenge altogether. All peptides when synthesised always start with the amino acid methionine. If synthesised directly, this can mean that the peptide no longer has the same bioactivity. The body naturally has a mechanism by which larger polypeptides are degraded into smaller functional peptides.
Using this mechanism, we have designed a universal adapter for short chain peptide production and delivery, by which any peptide can be produced and delivered to the gut.
  About our unique strategy for universal manufacture of peptides
To demonstrate this, we have chosen to showcase a short chain peptide, opiorphin:
Opiorphin - is a small pentapeptide (5 amino acids) that is naturally produced by the body, and plays a role in pain relief and as an anti-depressant. By delivering this small peptide into the gut, we hope to offer a natural alternative to addictive drugs.

What makes a heart settled is not garnish words but a sincere affection. We are accustomed to make our inference according what we know about a person, but that can only change the person’s surface but not inner, just as he and his Rose. He loved her, she loved him too. To be with each other is the biggest happiness. Just as his friends, who thought about him. He missed them too. They would be satisfied just because every get-together is delightful. Little Prince waved to his friends through the glass window with another hand leading Rose. Such farewell is filled with tears but affections also.
“Thank you! Bye~”
Firefly II was launched slowly, but before long it flew to the sea of stars and became one of them, unable to be distinguished. It was then that the five fellows turned back and returned to their glass house. There was little time left for Summer to sorrow for Little Prince’s departure. Her mind was sinking in the recent yellow powder wind both occurred in B612 and Ecoli. How about the other stars in the universe? Summer’s mission was too far away from end, and it’s never the time to relax her vigilance!

Kill switch
We have considered a kill switch which in the absence of key nutrient would activate and help stop the spread of our bacteria.
Ideas
A kill switch could be designed to take advantage of the subtilin lantibiotic we are using for cell-cell communication by switching off the immunity genes.
pH (and other differences in conditions) could be factored into the control of our kill switch, for example due to a pH sensitive promoter.
Holin-Lysozyme lysis
UC Berkeley developed a Holin-Lysozyme lysis device in 2008 .
mazEF
We have designed the a kill switch which uses the mazEF Toxin-Antitoxin system:
mazEF is found in strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Consists of two two adjacent genes, mazE and mazF, located downstream from the relA gene. mazF encodes a stable toxin, mazF.
mazE encodes a labile antitoxin, mazE, degraded in vivo by the ATP-dependent ClpPA serine protease.
mazE and mazF are coexpressed and mazEF is negatively auto-regulated at the level of transcription by the combined action of both mazE and mazF proteins on the mazEF promoter P2.
This system is activated by several stressful conditions that prevent the expression of mazEF, and thereby mazE synthesis, and thus trigger cell death. These conditions include:
extreme amino acid starvation leading to the production of the starvation-signaling molecule ppGpp
inhibition of transcription and/or translation by antibiotics including rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin
Doc protein, a general inhibitor of translation which is the toxic product of the ‘‘addiction module’’ phd-doc of the plasmid prophage P1.

Secondly, although there are enough information about parts exists on     parts registry database, the information which is provided for parts     need to be ordered urgently. Furthermore, there should be new experimental     standards which must be introduced to groups in the part submission     process for the subtitle “working condition”. These experimental standards     will be important because the experimental details about parts are not     satisfying the needs of wet-lab biologists for the design and the construction     of new Biobricks.

Algorithm
In this section, the step by step functioning of our application,     along with the encapsulation of the algorithmic concepts of ‘standardization’     of functional iGEM devices are depicted in pictorial forms called flowcharts.     Rectangular boxes represent the encapsulation of implementations of     the computer programs to perform the particular tasks stated in that     box on the flowcharts. These boxes are sometimes called subprograms,     objects or packages in Object Oriented software Engineering context.     The diamonds represent decision branching and they are found between     two rectangular boxes. The arrows show the direction in which subprograms     work and communicate. The subprogram at the head of the arrow starts     executing after the termination of the subprogram at the tail of the     arrow. Following flowcharts are the high level representations of our     algorithms developed for the BioGuide software.

Diagram 1. Flowchart of collection, formatting and storage     of devices data algorithm
Information about the iGEM parts had to be collected in a standardized     format for our application to function properly. Following data collection     custom subprograms is needed to parse and forward the data the application’s     database. In order to achieve this we have designed and implemented     the algorithm shown in diagram 1. In this algorithm, the first stage     was to find the list of part IDs of devices which were supplied by iGEM     in Spring 2010 distribution. This information has been collected from     two sources 1) plate files in excel format which was available online     2) device data provided in xml format, both provided by iGEM. The last     step in the algorithm was to send the collected partID data to the application’s     database.

EZ-10 Spin Column PCR Products Purification Kit (Purification)
Introduction
EZ-10 spin column purification kits use a silica-gel membrane that selectively absorbs up to 10μg of DNA fragments in the presence of specialized binding buffers. Nucleotides, oligos (< 40-mer), enzymes, mineral oil, and other impurities do not bind to the membrane and are washed away. The DNA fragments can then be eluted off the column in small volume and used in downstream applications without further processing.
Note: If the PCR reaction mixture contains seriously non-specific amplified DNA fragments, use of the DNA Gel Extraction Kit is recommended.
This kit can not remove the template and primers with chain length longer than 40-mer.
Safety Precautions

Devices and Material
Here is a list of devices we used and how to use them safely:
Chemical Storage We got separated and dedicated racks for every kind of chemical product we use. As you can see on these pictures, those boxes are key-closed.
Ethidium bromide A dark room is dedicated for using EtBr and UV. This room is key-closed. Everyone entering the room must wear gloves, glasses and lab coat. Two special boxes are available to discard spoiled EtBr (one for used agarose gels, a second for gloves).
Biological safety cabinet To avoid external contamination by unwanted microorganisms on agar plates we used a Biological safety cabinet (FASTER – Ultrasafe). The cabinet is cleaned-up every morning when we arrive and every evening when we leave.
Electric burner For all sterile manipulations, we used electric burners. They are as efficient as Bunsen burners (even more), but much safer than them (limiting greatly the risks of fire hazards).
Chemical Hood To protect the user from volatile chemical compounds while dangerous manipulations, we used of two chemical hoods.
Water-bathes Use of water-bathes can be dangerous, with exposition of boiling or hot water. We used special gloves for protecting us from projections and steam. The use of water-bathes implies of course wearing glasses and lab coat. Special care was taken to switch them off every evening before leaving!
P2 Laboratory Special care have been taken to manipulate the Chromobacterium violaceum strain which is classified as a class 2 microorganism. All manipulations with this bacteria were performed in a a dedicated P2 laboratory, fully equipped for microbiology. Biological waste from C. violaceum were treated with special procedures according to the Safety Regulation Rules for Class II microorganisms.

Figure 2. Intracellular Model without Dox and Inactive CRISPR system from minute zero-th to 1400th
(a) Cas9 is transcript with a rapid logarithmic growth of total free mRNA molecules of Cas9        (blue line, mRNA-Cas9) then quickly declines into logarithmic death phase. Cas9 Protein (green line,        pro-cas9) total count is keep at zero as no mRNA is available for translation.
(b) gRNA (blue line) total count grows logarithmically and reaches a plateau due to natural        degradation. The size of gRNA is 7 times smaller than Cas9, thus it is transcript much faster than       Cas9. Thus the CRISPR complex (green line, Cas9-gRNA) is much lower in comparison with the blue line.        No formation of Cas9 Protein implies no binding of Cas9 and gRNA, implies no formation of CRISPR complex.
(c) No Dox (red line, Dox) is added in this simulation. Thus TetR protein (green line, pr-tetR) is        not binded with dox to form Dox-TetR Complex (cyan line, Dox-tetR), therefore Dox-TetR Complex is always       zero. TetR protein and mRNA of TetR total count grow logarithmically and reach the plateau phase due to        natural degradation.

SCRaMbLE: Improve Resistance to Heavy Metal Ions
OVERVIEW
After doing relevant literature reading, we found that yeast’s tolerance level of ambient copper and cadmium ions has a threshold concentration, approximately 3mM and 0.5mM in SC culture media respectively.
In order to increase yeast strains’ inherent tolerance of copper or/and cadmium ions in their growing environment, we used this cutting-edge biological technology—SCRaMbLE, which stands for Synthetic Chromosome Rearrangement and Modification by Loxpsym-mediated Evolution, to obtain yeast strain with better tolerance to heavy metal ions[1].
We constructed three yeast strains namely 079, 160, and 085. They all have a plasmid containing the CRE-EBD sequence and different nutritional labels[2]. 079 and 160 strains have a URA3 label, 085 strain has a HIS label. After proper induction and screening, we successfully obtained mutated 079, 085 and 160 strains that have a manifest growing advantage over control groups when cultured in SC solid media which contain 0.14 mM cadmium ions or 4.8 mM copper ions. We named those mutated strains with increased tolerance capacity of cadmium ions S1, S2, S3, and S4, and as for copper, S5, S6, S7, and S8.
In order to characterize their increased tolerance of copper"

Science is an international community, that knows no borders, politics or race. When one embarks on a scientific journey, fellow scientists from around the world are there to offer assistance, guidance and a different point of view, all in the name of scientific innovation. iGEM is no exception, placing great emphasis on the collaborative aspect of every team’s project.
Our first interaction was with the Peshawar team from Pakistan. We were especially excited about speaking to them, due to our respective countries not being in diplomatic relations with one another. We exchanged emails for a while, until we finally scheduled a skype session
In the course of the session we discussed our respective projects and needs for the competition. Our new friends helped us gain a new perspective regarding our Wiki design, and offered wisdom about how to tackle this facet of our project.
Next, we reached out to team Bristol . They graciously offered us a tool they had developed for writing Wiki code, which proved to be immensely helpful. Up to that point we encountered setbacks with our wiki design and this collaboration came at an auspicious time. Thanks to this act of professional courtesy, we were able to make significant process on our wiki page.
Unfortunately, we hit a roadblock early on with our wiki design and decided to outsource the process to an external web design company.
Furthermore, we learned from the Lahore team that, from the first days of the project, they had allocated each area of responsibility to a student from the appropriate study field. Following this, we decided that next year’s team should have a computer science student onboard for the purpose of Wiki design.
The jewel in our crown is our collaboration with the Technion team , on the esteemed topic of ethics. We sought to profoundly investigate the ethical side of our project, seeing as how it deals with sensitive subjects spanning genetic engineering and the human food industry. One of our main objectives was to create a product that promotes ecological and sustainable food production, the basis for which is clearly ethics.  The Technion team compiled an ethics handbook, a succinct manifest spanning the world of ethics, covering subjects from the history of ethics to modern day implications. We read this text with guidance from Dr. Meshi"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Ethics_-_-_TEXT.html," But what is the therapeutic goal legislates she use? Synthetic biology thus challenges our life conception. Where is the boundary between natural and artificial? Can we afford to create everything from the living? Evolution can be ""diverged""?
50% people tend to reject this possibility of free manipulation with therapy pretext, however, 31% would consider it and 19% of persons are wondering. As for a drift of evolution, 50% of persons are quite convinced that evolution cannot be compromised by synthetic biology, however, 31% people disagreed.
As part of a therapeutic application, can we afford to create everything from the living?
Do we risk diverging the evolution?
Researchers must ask themselves these questions and be aware of unethical uses that could  be made of such technologies, even for the purpose of curing diseases; this fear of a student speaks to the questions raised by the living instrumentalization facing synthetic biology.
Indeed, each advanced biological research contains a lot of questions on the health implications, environmental, social and ethical implications of possible applications of these discoveries. Are we able to control the living? Are we able to control the spread of systems that we built? While they are a majority think that researchers are capable of manipulating life, we remain skeptical with control its spread.
Can we control the living?
Do you think we should be able to control the spread of systems that we built?
Faced with theses questions, how the company will position itself and how it will respect the ethics rules. Because of the life control, the public is faced with a control by research area while having the feeling of being dispossessed of research results. How the company is going to express their wishes on these issues?
In the context of synthetic biology, is global governance feasible?
Given the stakes, the debate should be pluralist and collective, we have to know  who will control and how? Do we need  new regulations, while those for existing GMOs are already far from perfection and  unaccepted? Can we aspire to global governance? 46% of persons believe that such governance is possible, while 31% think otherwise. However, how can we adapt these regulations?
Conclusion of the survey
The survey draws the attention of politicians, researchers and lawyers, reminding them that the innovation and therapeutic goal arguments are often wrongly used by supporters of a world where everything is protected and patented. A public debate is necessary to decide together how to maximize the positive applications of these technologies while minimizing the abusive risks.

Week 7
I repeated the SDS-PAGE from Week 6, because the bands from 46 and 47 were unclear and I could not observe Cry1Aa from Bt HD350. The SDS-PAGE failed as the machine was interrupted by leaking buffer. Additionally, I started working on cloning Cry1 and Cry2 from the E. coli strains. This did not work out in the end.
Week 8
I performed another SDS-PAGE to observe Cry1Aa production. Additionally, we received Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis (also referred to as Bt tenebrionis) from DSMZ, a strain which produces Cry3Aa.

Jamboré
Our team participated in the first event that promoted the meeting of the Brazilian teams, which was hosted by the USP team(University of São Paulo). This historic event (and very funny one) was called Jamboré. All the teams members were able to test the card game created as a human practices by the USP team, know themselves and the projects better, join a discussion about the difficulties of the competition and the solutions that each team has found (with the sponsorship, for example) and collaborate with suggestions.
Purdue´s standard protocol
We collaborated with the survey done by the Purdue´s team about the development of a standard protocol. They are developing a list of protocols and assays that need to be completed in order to submit the part to the registry. For us it seems like a great idea and we hope that our collaboration has helped this project.

-Adi miniprepped and nanodropped two tubes of K157006 as well as a tube of K157005 and pETDuet-1 for me. Bob and Adi then ran digestion of cCFP and pETDuet-1 at 1500ng with EcoRI/PstI in NEB Buffer 3 with BSA for 4 hours. I ran a gel of the digestions and extracted the proper bands. Ran gel purification and then let the ligation run overnight with 5:1, 3:1, and No Insert reactions stored in the 4oC.

Week 9 notes
7/23/12
-Alkanes arrived from Sigma-Aldrich. Isiah plated K12-Petrobrick cells on a CM plate (from glycerol stock) to grow more colonies. Divya made 4 innoculations of K12 cells (one of them accidentally has more than the required cells in it).
-Bob did PCR of 3 reactions of cCFP and Uros continued with PCR cleanup once it was done. Uros also amplified the two parts for PUF(WT)-cCFP tethering through PCR. After PCR was done Uros performed PCR cleanup. Made a plan for Bob to take over Split-CFP cloning which includes bypassing gel purification due to low concentrations of vector/insert.
-Transformed ligation reactions from 7/19/12 to 65 ul DH5a. Unfortunately electroporation of the 1:3 reaction arced. Transformed using heat shock for both 1:3 and 1:6 ligation reaction. Plated transformations. Started two new reactions using the same volumes as the 7/19 ligations (a 1:3 in 15 ul and a 1:6 in 20 ul)
7/24/12
-The K12 innoculations did not grow because Divya accidentally grew them with CM. Isiah took out the K12-Petrobrick plated cells; they grew successfully. TB media was made, and the filter solution was prepared as well (needs to be autoclaved, however). Divya re-did innoculations of K12, and prepared innoculations of K12"

Prof. Heinz Neumann greatly supported us with working out our project, all kinds of scientific advice for lab work or texts, or when we were desperate to find a lab space and already saw everything falling apart. We are very grateful for all of his support!!!
On this page, we would additionally like to thank people who are not actually members of our team, but kindly assisted us during different phases of our project.
All other laboratory work, Wiki content, and BioBrick annotation was provided by the student members of our team.
People we want to thank!
Dr. Michael Hoppert
Dr. Hoppert is a work group leader in the department of General and Applied Microbiology. He supported our team  by examining our E. coli strains with the electron microscope. He also offered to lend us a helping hand for making some fluorescence microscopy images to visualize our enhanced strains in case we succeed in Amsterdam! Due to these pictures we would be able to investigate whether our alterations indeed cause the expected effects. Even though we did not achieve the results we hoped in electron microscopy some of us still were able to learn more about this interesting technique and observe an expert on this field doing his job. Now one of his pictures of the strain MG1655 decorates our header and all of us are very thankful for his help!

The E. coli strains were kindly provided by Shuangyu Bi from the lab of V. Sourjik at the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg.
Next, the sensitivity of E. coli for aspartate can be measured. This can be achieved by addition of a range of aspartate concentrations and subsequent luminescence measurements by using the self-designed BRET-pair. Our model can be verified and corrected based on these measurements. BRET measurements can be validated using a FRET-pair received from Marburg.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"

Doing so allowed us to engage with a younger audience in a way that was more specific to our project. We had generated a great response during outreach events using other store-bought, general fluffy microbes, so we knew that making our own relevant ones would be a great tool.

This means that projects still have the plasticity to adjust following discussions, even if that means a complete change of project, as was the case for us. It is important to maintain lines of communication with stakeholders. The easiest way of determining if you have correctly addressed a concern is to ask the person who posed it in the first place. However, many teams fail to do this. We contacted many of the people we had originally engaged at the beginning of the project again at the end to discuss the final framework. Not only did we get some great positive feedback, we also were able to discuss areas for future improvement, which would enable further iterations of the design-build-test cycle. Finally, do not be afraid to ask the difficult questions. As new inductees to the field of synthetic biology, iGEM team members are perhaps some of the best suited for identification of bigger issue problems in the field of synthetic biology. For us, this was the inability to be able to point to an example of a synthetic biology produced biosensor in use in everyday life. Closer inspection of other applications of synthetic biology are likely to pose their own unique challenges. Therefore, we encourage other teams to follow our example: iGEM teams have been hugely successful in identifying problems in many areas  - we propose that turning this insight on our own field of synthetic biology is equally important."

Team Accomplishments
Project:
The prototype of our project was raised by Shiyang WANG in our brainstorm session in Feb. 2017. This idea was then modified and improved by Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG. Our investigators Prof. Xien-en ZHANG, Prof. Chunbo LOU and Prof. Jiangyun WANG helped in our project design. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI also offered help in project design.
Experiments:
Our experiments started in July 2017. As our team's leaders, Ruiling CAI and Jianyi HUANG, separately responsible for the sensor part and degradation part, designed and monitored our experiments. They also did the primary work of data analysis. Our advisors Fankang MENG, Xudong LUO and Sun ZHI gave their suggestion on project design. Our experiments were accomplished with the joint effort of the following 9 teammates: Ruiling CAI, Jianyi HUANG, Shubo YUAN, Jiang WU, Jingnan YE, Yi WU, Yunfan LI, Yuze WU, Yuqing LEI.

As you may have noticed, we provide three different plasmids, which are used separately in each designed experiment. After the experiments have been performed, disciples should have experienced the whole way from transformation, over cultivating cells, inducing the production of proteins. In the end they should also have observed the conversion of a substrate by the produced enzyme.
Experiment Number 1: Bacteria in Red
Figure 2: Results of Experiment Number 1
The aim of the first experiment is to transform the ""RFP-Generator""-Plasmid into Escherichia coli, which contains genes, coding for Chloramphenicol resistance, plus a red fluorophor. Then they should be plated on Chloramphenicol-Agarplates. The Agarplates, provided with the antibiotica Chloramphenicol, trigger a selection process, whose aim is to kill all bacteria which have not incorporated the ""RFP-Generator""-Plasmid. The expression rate of the red fluorophor is controlled by a constitutive promoter, so the Red Fluorescent Protein is expressed continuously. After just about one day of incubation time, the students can notice a change in color of the bacteria from ocher to red with the naked eye.

We also designed pYD1-FliC (eGFP) (BBa_K2220003) as our positive control. The maps of the parts are presented below. (See Figure 10 & Figure 11)

Secretory module-parts design
In the secretory module, we choose GAL1-controlled expression vector, which contains an alpha-factor signal peptide to facilitate the secretion of our exogenous protein. (see Figure 6) Considering the structure of the yeast surface display module mentioned above, we redesign the gene and tag locations on the vector pYES2/CT/α-Factor to ensure the further reassembly of recombinant FliC and enzyme fusion proteins.
Here we change the location of AGA2, His-tag, which are inserted into the central region of FliC. In this way, the structure of recombinant Enzyme-FliC fusion proteins fit the flagellin polymerization process.
We designed the following parts: pYCα-FliC (XynA) (BBa_K2220011) , pYCα-FliC (PETase) (BBa_K2220012) , pYCα-FliC (BG) (BBa_K2220014) , pYCα-FliC (EG) (BBa_K2220013) , pYCα-FliC (CBH) (BBa_K2220015)

Polymerization
The monomeric flagellin can nucleate in high concentrations of sulfate solution. And it can elongate in the elongation solution, after these two steps, we can obtain flagellar filaments of different lengths.

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," the patient is able to consent they must provide this consent. The second issue is surrounding that of the use of a GMO on a person. Many people are against GMOs or have religious perspectives stating that they should not use GMOs. The same as above applies when applying the first do no harm principle. If in a high stress situation it is up to the doctor to do what they think is best for their patient. But if the patient is conscious they must understand that it is a GMO and consent. The third consideration factors into the very basic ethical approval of the project. If a number of professionals both within the medical practical field and synthetic biology field feel as though this project or any other part of its testing, construction etc have negatives which outweigh the positives it is not ethical or in accordance with the ‘do no harm' perspective and so the project or that part of the project must be abandoned by the team.
Catholic Ethics
From the Catholic perception man is created in the image and likeness of God, and with this must include a profound amount of respect for creation and its miracle. Synthetic biology can be a valuable resource to human progress, when used properly. Catholicism has established that within the church our central moral and unethical complication is the manipulation of life. (2) As a result, science and technology should never alone be the meaning of existence and human progress; we still must find a balance of what ‘manipulation of life’ really is. (1)  Gene manipulation is a growing domain within biology which has drawn vital questions and concerns. The current rapid development within synthetic biology ensures we must be quick to follow and respect the standards within the field.
Before deciding the ethical accountability of a project you must first develop a perspective on what is and what is not the manipulation of life. There are many views and opinions describing the sinfulness of tinkering with human life, such as stem cell and embryo alterations which has been clearly outlined as unethical by the catechism. (2) The Vatican says that “applied biology and medicine work together for the integral good of human life when they come to the aid of a person stricken by illness and infirmity and when they respect his or her dignity as a creature of God.” (1) There are many views and opinions describing the sinfulness of tinkering with human life, such as stem cell and embryo alterations which has been clearly outlined as unethical by the catechism. (2) Alternatively, is putting a plasmid into a bacterium the same concept, or is it separate in classification?  To answer this, we must look at the fact that bacteria"
