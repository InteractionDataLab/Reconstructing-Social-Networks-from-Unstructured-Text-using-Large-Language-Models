Aberdeen_Scotland,2009,Team:Aberdeen Scotland#chemotaxis_-_-_TEXT.html," collisions simply result in a change of direction and there is no conservation of momentum or kinetic energy, or modelling of the physics of the collision. The tendency of bacteria to congregate into small groups by quorum sensing is also ignored.
Modelling Behaviour
How the tumbling frequency varies as the bacteria move up and down a chemical gradient is hard to define and model exactly. One paper suggests that the frequency of tumbling is roughly one Hertz, and decreases to almost zero when moving up a chemotactic gradient. To attempt to model this we have greatly simplified the behaviour.  Our simplifications however, are not as extensive as some models which simply have a probability of 0% of tumbling when moving up a chemotactic gradient.
Firstly, as an introduction to how the model works, we must understand how the bacteria decide to tumble when moving away from a source of chemoattractant. At every second, which is every third iteration, the bacteria compare the current concentration at that point to the concentration at the previous point, and if it has decreased then the bacteria tumbles:
In the previous described motion the bacteria will seek out the source of chemoattractant very well. However bacteria do still tumble when moving up a concentration gradient, and so this must be accounted for. The most simple way of describing this is giving the bacteria a probability of X% (with X < 100) of not tumbling when moving up a gradient and 100% when moving down a gradient described by the statement:
However, it is known that the behaviour varies depending on the difference in concentration between the current and the previous locations. If the ratio of these concentrations is greater than one, then the probability of not tumbling is roughly between 60% and 80%, expressed by either the following possible statements:
In order to experiment and to look at how various functions cause varying behaviour, we used many different functions like above for the probability of not tumbling. To illustrate these different behaviours the embedded video below shows bacteria that are given one hundred seconds to travel 8000 micrometers towards a source of chemoattractant - although the speed with which each bacterium moves is multiplied by six for the sake of making it easier to see them move:
In the above video, the colours correspond to the probability of not tumbling as follows (where p(t) = c(t)/c(t-1) and a probability of 1 = 100% and 0 = 0%): Green = 0.6, Cyan = (0.6+(p(t)/10)), Red = 0."

The result shows that a large portion of                                     interviewees had sleeping problems, some of which suffered from severe symptoms;                                     however, few figured out a way to tackle with the issues. Meanwhile, when it comes                                     to the medicine, basic acknowledgement of traditional benzodiazepines medicines was                                     observed, but seldom do people know about the medicine of melatonin.
      To conclude, according to the survey, we regard                                     it                                     very meaningful and prospective                                     to employ the synthetic biology approaches to present new solutions to the issues                                     considering sleeping. With this knowledge as assurance, we began our design on the                                     project tackling sleeping problems.
      While we find the project on melatonin more                                     interesting and promising, the iSWU                                         conference led us to our final                                     decision. iSWU is the organization consisting of all the iGEM team in the southwest                                     of China, providing us the platform to share with each other our projects and                                     thoughts on synthetic biology. At the conference, all of the teams introduced their                                     project prototype and made comments on others’ designs. At the meeting, a professor                                     from TMMU with rich experience in immunology suggested that if we do the project                                     about the rabies vaccine, unpreventable immunology experiments would cost a lot of                                     time and the results would be highly unpredictable as well – in a word, it would be                                     very difficult to complete all the experiments within three months’ time. The new                                     information tilts the balance one step more.
      After carefully evaluating the advice from other                                     team and comparing the two                                     projects, we chose “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli” because it was more                                     practical with more predictable result
02.  Improvement
      After determining the project, we found that                                         there                                         were many problems remained to solve. Therefore, we consulted teachers and                                         experts from Sleep Medical Center, West                                         China Hospital and China                                         Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) .                                         What’s more, we also                                         communicated with other iGEM teams via Skype.
      During the interview with the Sleep Medical                                         Center faculties, the professors                                         described the mechanism of melatonin in detail as well as melatonin’s advantages                                         over other drugs, which gave us a whole new view on melatonin. They also                                         emphasized what to focus during the research, such as the safety issues emerged                                         when we tried to"

Procedure:
InterLab – Transformation of plasmids to competent cells
There has been a mistake of numbering the plates with plasmids provided by iGEM HQ. Therefore, we did not get any cell colonies from the previous two transformations…
The plasmids (1.5 μL) from the right wells were transformed to competent cells by following the transformation protocol from day – 02. July. 2018, after resuspension of the plasmids in the wells.
Cell density:
The cell cultures with pgRNA(2) (probably with anti-luxS), inoculated from day 10 – 04. July. 2018, were diluted 10 times by following the same dilution procedure from day 6 – 27. June. 2018. The cells were incubated with shaker for 1h before measuring at OD 600.
Plasmid isolation:
The plasmids from the two cell cultures were isolated after the same mini-prep protocol from day 3 – 22. June. 2018. The concentration and the purity of the isolated plasmids were measured by Nanodrop.
Restriction digest and gel elecrophoresis:
Insertion of anti-luxS gene was verified after the protocol of restriction digest and gel electrophoresis (see the protocols from day 3 – 22. June. 2018). The restriction enzyme PstI was chosen, and the expected length of the plasmid fragments are 490 bp and 2094 bp.
Note! PstI has a cut site at the anti-luxS gene in the plasmid.

We are talking about a home check and I think it necessary to have a simpler method for measuring. As for today, it is not easy to measure fluorescence, together with this, in my opinion your genes that included enzyme activity could have a better chance to operate a home process in a more simple and successful way.
Dekel: “Do you know of any transmembrane protein that knows how to identify another protein?”
Dr. Maayan: “There are plenty of such proteins, for example, protein pd1 where the antibody of melanoma disease identifies it, and it detects another protein called pdl1. The idea of using proteins of this type as indicators is very unique idea and original, job well done.”
Dekel: “Are you familiar with a kit or methods based on the same idea?”
Dr. Maayan: I think that the idea of using transmembrane proteins is amazing. I fear that are quite a few obstacles that may appear on the way just like any scientific process. There is a large variety of fluorescence measurements which are based on the closeness of the two fluorescent substances where one triggers the other; it is called ""FRET"", and then a physical closeness is formed between two molecules, and then it is possible to measure the emission of light. The idea to split the reporter into two is special and can do a good job provided there is careful planning.
I would like to add that there are quite a few kits or processes performed on the basis of enzyme activity and they work relatively well and simpler than fluorescence. However, also in this way there will be expected problems you will have to deal with. In my opinion the genes you used in the enzymes have a better chance to succeed than fluorescence.”
Dekel: “what are the disadvantages with the kit in your opinion?”
Dr. Maayan: The way it is measured, that it will be easier for the end user. I have a few friends whose children are celiac patients and I find it difficult to see them measuring it. I think that fluorescent measuring devices are not yet developed enough for home users who understand nothing about it, someone at home needs to press the switch and get an answer yes or no. it is possible that there are kits I don’t know about and then there is no disadvantage, but I personally am not familiar developed enough for home use, if it would work on electrical conductivity or ph. It’s possible that your idea is ahead of time and in a few years when the measuring"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  PCR will be repeated again to amplify our construct.  A longer extension time will be used, as well as running only the primers with no template for a control.
Procedures:
PCR reaction: The reaction master mix was prepared from the following: 5x reaction buffer, 15uL 2uM dNTP, 7.5uL 10uM PCquad primer prefix, 3.8uL 10uM PCquad primer suffix #1, 3.8uL Q5 polymerase 0.75uL ddH2O, 44uL
Mixed using a p20.
To three separate PCR tubes, 24uL of mastermix was added.  The tubes were labeled 1, 2, and 3, for 0.25uL of 1ng/uL template (0.25ng), 0.125 uL of template + 0.125uL TE buffer, and 0.25uL of TE buffer, respectively.   The reaction was ran at 66C with the following settings:
Initial denaturation:  98C, 30sec 25 cycles:  98C, 10 sec; 66C, 10sec; 72C, 25sec Final extension:  72C, 5min Hold: 4C
Running the gel:
The pre-made agarose gel from 7-16 was used.  To each reaction tube, 5uL of 6x SDS loading dye was added and mixed.  28uL of the sample was loaded to the gel.  The gel was ran at 100V for 25 minutes.
Observations:   After running the gel, the two bands with template DNA appear to be the same intensity, with the desired size more intense than previous runs.  The lane with primers only did not yield any band, which suggests the non-specific band is"

A different wiki
Our way of showing the world what we accomplished - intuitively and thoroughly
Team members working hard to polish the wiki before the European Jamboree wiki-freeze. Most of our team members have never tried creating a wiki, so when Heidi’s boyfriend Kenneth offered to help us out a bit, we were quick to accept. As a professional software developer, Kenneth had a unique perspective, which shone throughout our preliminary meetings. We set out to present the best, most intuitive wiki possible; to improve the standard wiki experience. This very wiki is the result, and below are the keys to the wiki.
Better overview: A metro-map of all pages
A general issue observed on many wikis is that the user struggles to navigate. We designed a metro-style navigation bar at the top of each page, giving the user knowledge of his exact location. While allowing a custom experience and viewing order, the navigation bar ensures that the user is never lost.
Smarter tour: Usable by both casual and thorough readers
A lot of wiki-tours do a great job at introducing the reader to the project. However, users who want details are left to fend for themselves in a jungle of pages. Our fix: Allowing our readers the freedom to choose between a quick and a detailed tour by including all pages in our tour. The result is an interactive wiki tour, which sets up a choice between digging deeper to detailed pages or fast-forward to the next major chapter. The two buttons (on the bottom of the screen) even have a small text explaining what you can expect to read on the coming pages. Also, take the time to click on our photos; this brings forward a detailed figure description.
Quicker navigation: Tour buttons and menu always visible
Additional ease of navigation was created by ensuring that tour-buttons and menu are always available - even when scrolling through the text! While searching for a topic of interest, a traditional menu as a means of a shortcut may be desirable. Such a menu allows users to access a specific page that they might wish to revisit. Perhaps a certain page sprung to mind after completing the tour, perhaps a user accesses our wiki looking for a particular subject. The menu makes such personalized experiences easier and more user-friendly.
Tooltips: Simplifying the text
To reach broader audiences, we wanted our wiki articles to be easily understandable without compromising the scientific aspect. To solve this, we added tooltips Tooltips"

Bioethics Overview
The University of Illinois Champaign Urbana 2010 iGEM team divided the bioethics project into two parts. First, we created and distributed a survey on the public’s knowledge and perception of synthetic biology. We then took the survey results and used them to customize our interactions with the public in order to better inform the community about synthetic biology.
Survey
We created a survey to provide us with feedback on the general public’s perception of synthetic biology. As of August 11th 2010, we received 73 responses from a population consisting mostly of students. The bulk of our survey distribution was through Facebook, while we also acquired responses from public events such as the Engineering Open House and Biology Open House held on the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana campus. As a result, the majority of our sample population consisted of students and academics.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

With the aim of fostering the students’ passion in science and highlighting how science can be applied in our everyday lives, students learned about various science concepts through interesting hands-on experiments with materials that can be found in the kitchen. For instance, they learned about melting point depression through “Making Ice Cream” experiment, the characteristic of fat through “Color-changing Milk”, neutralization through “Building a Volcano”, vibration through “Singing Glasses”, and more. They also learned about the scientific method and applied it to their final project: the students came up with questions they were curious about from their everyday lives and the demonstrations they have done in class. The students then followed the scientific method to discover the answers to the questions, and created a little booklet to share their findings with the general public.

Brief Description:
On Thursday August 23rd, during the weekly meeting that the Beirut 1 scouts group in the Lebanese Scouts Association holds on the International College campus in Ain El Mraysseh (Beirut, Lebanon), an NYUAD iGEM representative presented the topic of going into the STEM field to students aged from 5 to 20 years old. A discussion was then held with the leaders and it was agreed that the group to focus on was Rovers due to their age range, 15-20 years old, at a time when they’re choosing what study and work fields to go into.
The following Saturday, August 25th, a meeting was held with the Rovers, about 15 students, in an eco-cafe in the town of Chebanieh. There, many of the students spoke about what their understanding of the STEM field is, including future job opportunities. A presentation was then given from the iGEM member about the array of possible STEM majors and universities to pursue, putting attention on NYUAD as a good example that not  many of the students knew about. The topic followed with what opportunities are available in the STEM field both after graduation and during university.The focus then shifted to iGEM where the presenter spoke about their team’s project and experience, as well as what i"

Generating the simulation environment
Besides the discretizations of the proteins used in the lattice model, several other aspects were simplified. In the model, we wanted to observe the interaction of a single Cas13a protein with TDPs at a certain concentration. To realize this, we fixed Cas13a at a specific point in the simulation environment and employed periodic boundary conditions, emulating a larger volume occupied by Cas13a and TDPs.
To generate the simulation environment, the concentration of Cas13a was set to 0.5 g/L, the concentration of Cas13a isolated with our protein purification protocol . For the planned Cas13a drying assays, 4 µL Cas13a would be dried in a final volume of 100 µL with a given concentration of TDP. From a given TDP concentration and its molar mass, we could then calculate the number of TDPs that needed to be generated to obtain the right ratio of TDPs to Cas13a.
Subsequently, we calculated an average volume occupied by one amino acid of 128,50 Å^3 from the volumes of individual amino acid residues ( Counterman and Clemmer 1999 ) and multiplied this by the number of amino acids in one unit cell to determine its volume. This volume was then used to calculate the lattice dimensions for the model. Since we were investigating a drying process, we opted to study phase separation behaviour at volume fractions of the initial reaction volume. With preliminary runs we determined that a volume fraction of 0.1 was still large enough to reasonably assume that no protein degradation had occurred, but also small enough to allow for efficient simulation.
Interaction Energies
Finally, to be able to model the protein-protein interactions, we also needed to assign energies to different protein conformations. As we were studying both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, we wanted to calculate energy values based on both types. While a variety of hydrophobicity scales exist, they usually only describe relative hydrophobicity between amino acids ( Wimley and White 1996, Wolfenden et al. 1981, Rose et al. 1985 ). While actual free energy values were estimated for hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues ( Miyazawa and Jernigan 1985 ), they are based on the distance between amino acid residues observed in protein x-ray structures. This means that they are not applicable for the units in our models, which contain five amino acid residues each.
For this reason we decided to use the hydrophobic compatibility index"

How to Create a Microbial Fuel Cell with Terephthalic Acid as a Carbon Source:
In order to create an MFC that utilizes terephthalic acid, we needed to address two main issues:
Find a bacteria that metabolizes terephthalic acid as a carbon source
Find an exogenous mediator that works with our bacteria to shuttle electrons to an anode
*Details of how we designed our system (and other considerations for MFC assembly) can be found here .
On our results page , we show that we are able to produce an electrical signal from the biproduct of PET degredation (TPA) in a microbial fuel cell. The graph on this page shows voltage produced when we use Delftia tsuruhatensis to metabolize TPA, using methylene blue as an exogenous mediator.
Conclusion
By integrating biological plastic degradation with generating an electrical signal in the microbial fuel cell, we can achieve Plastiback’s vision of both degrading and detecting PET. We show the PETase enzyme expressed in E. coli is catalytically active and easy to visualize. In the presence of PET, PETase could catalyze the breakdown of PET into TPA and other byproducts. Starting with the byproduct TPA, we show that the bacteria in our microbial fuel cell can utilize TPA as a carbon source and produce an electrical signal indicating the presence of TPA. Thus, we complete the process of translating PET plastic into a signal for ocean researchers to map microplastic pollution in the ocean. And, we sustainably break down the plastic while doing it!

Wet-lab summary:
We knew from the start that engineering a whole consortium was an ambitious challenge.  Thus, we are especially proud of what we have accomplished during this summer (see Results ).
E. coli was successfully modified and synthetic communication was established between it and Vibrio harveyi.
We managed to modify V. harveyi using triparental conjugation. To the best of our knowledge, this allowed RFP expression for the first time in this organism. This also open the way to Vibrio utilization as a new chassis for iGEM.
We successfully modified both E. coli to produce diacetyl, and Pichia pastoris to detect and respond to this messenger molecule
Last but not least, we have produced a new functional antimicrobial peptide for the iGEM registry, and this is the first biobrick from crocodile !
Perspectives:
We are not done yet. We unlocked all the technological constraint for the project, but we needed more time to achieve the whole system, especially to implement our constructions in the V. harveyi background prior to whole system assays.
Nonetheless, we pursued our tests toward technical verifications necessary to the full device functioning, on the base of questions raised by our Model (i.e, co-cultures of the synthetic consortium members, freeze-dried of our microorganisms, permeability test…).
Given all the positive results we got, the future is now toward the development of our solution in partnership with the Sunwaterlife company.
Dry-lab summary:
Everything was not about enzymes and tubes this summer, far from it. Choosing such a complex strategy against cholera required to carefully think about where we were heading to.

It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that our technique is also suited to characterising this type of behaviour.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to perform any such characterisation ourselves, though we do have the proof of concept.

iGEM Chalmers Gothenburg
We helped the Chalmers Gothenburg team with their initial steps of model building. The description below illustrates the model that was built by the Manchester iGEM team, which got the Chalmers team started. Any edits and changes beyond this were solely the work of the Chalmers Gothenburg team, such as finding of parameters for the equations. We also discussed our method of obtaining accurate descriptions of plausible parameter values for ensemble modelling, but this aspect was not incorporated in the final model, due to time constraints.
The final model used by Chalmers Gothenburg can be seen here
The model consists of two organisms in co-culture, each dependant on one another for an essential substrate, i.e. without one the other would be unable to survive. The model predicts the growth of the two organisms as well as the concentration acetate which is the main product of the system.
The system was modelled using the following differential equations:
Substrate-limited specific cell growth (Monod equation) : $$r_g =  x_v \mu_{max} \frac{S}{K_s + S}$$
Cell death. First order with respect to viable cell concentration: $$r_d = k_d x_v$$
Product formation (Luedeking–Piret equation). Product produced  in cell growth and in cell maintenance: $$r_p = \alpha r_g +\beta x_v $$  $$x_v = \int r_x dt \qquad , \text{ where } r_x = r_g - r_v$$
The substrate uptake:  $$r_s = r_{s_x} + r_{s_p} + r_{s_m}$$  that is, the sum of rate of substrate utilisation in cell synthesis, maintenance and product formation
A MATLAB script was produced to solve the system of equations.

ONT MinION sequencing with adapters integrated by fusion protein
We took our fusion protein one step further and attempted to use the integration product (figure 23) for ONT MinION sequencing. For this assay, we took an initial solution with equimolar concentrations of Tn5 DNA and EPO plasmid DNA and performed our integration assay, after which we continued with Rapid Sequencing Kit pipeline (without transposase fragmentation reaction). As a control, an equimolar concentration of dxCas9 DNA was prepared by ONT library preparation protocol (including transposase fragmentation).
After the sequencing run, we followed the workflow defined in Sequencing alignment protocol . The alignment results showed that most of the reads (>99 %) aligned to dxCas9 DNA used as positive control. Analysis of aligned reads to sample treated with our fusion protein showed zero sequences aligned to Tn5 DNA reference (non-target of our fusion) and 89 reads aligned to the target EPO plasmid DNA. These reads indicated that the integration of sequencing adapters preferred the linearized EPO plasmid DNA rather than Tn5 DNA for sequencing. Closer look at the aligned sequences rendered one sequence read presented in figure 23, where we have a clear example of targeted adapter integration next to the gRNA flanking site (figure 23).
Figure 23. A) Alignment of DNA sequence read with target EPO cds in plasmid DNA. (B) Zoom into the sequence alignment to determine sgRNA target. Fusion protein depicted with arrows representing binding of dxCas9 position (red) and the addition of sequencing adapters (blue).
These preliminary results show the function of adapter integration directed by our fusion protein to the sgRNA complementary site. The efficiency of integration was not high and some of the aligned reads showed extended regions summing up to long reads of 2 - 11 kbp. More experimentation should be done to obtain conclusive data on these rare events, but most importantly to define better conditions for the integration assay. The low efficiency of this integration could be explained by different factors explained below:
During the purification of the fusion protein, there could be contamination by DNA attached to some domain of the protein (as they are DNA binding proteins). This contamination could come from the cells used to produce the protein.
Purification of the fusion protein was done with heparin column, and other DNA interacting domain-like proteins could be present in the protein mixture.
Conditions of the integration assay could be suboptimal to favour reaction kinetics of the fusion protein.

Other genera, including some E. coli strains, secrete cellulose as a component of their biofilm. Even though cellulose biosynthesis is intrinsic to E. coli, the quantity of the production is incomparable to cellulose biosynthesis in G. xylinus. Indigenously, E. coli is not capable of degrading cellulose into a metabolisable energy source Gao D, Luan Y, Wang Q, Liang Q, Qi Q.

Approach
To link the two bacterial compartments of the PowerLeaf, an efficient way to store the harvested energy was required. Through research, we found that storing the chemical energy in cellulose would be a suitable approach, since this is a polysaccharide that bacteria normally are unable to degrade Gao D, Luan Y, Wang Q, Liang Q, Qi Q.

After looking into earlier iGEM projects it was found that the 2014 project Aqualose from Imperial College London , had worked with optimisation of cellulose biosynthesis in E. coli.

NPU-China,2017,Team:NPU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," noted that the Kcat values of glpK and GlyDH enzymes are                                 unknown (we do not have a large deviation in the absence of a sample expressed in E.coil).
The Kcat value of the reaction of propanal is the Kcat value of the reaction of Gly and                                 GlyDH. It is also assumed that the K63 ratio of the two enzymes is 2: 1.
We often use Kcat / Km to describe the catalytic efficiency of different enzymes for the                                 same substrate, and as a result of our experiments, GlyDH exhibited higher catalytic efficiency                                 than glpK. Thus we assume that the GlyDH enzyme and the glpK enzyme satisfy the following                                 relationship:
GlyDH enzyme activity and the Km value for gly and the Km value of the glpk enzyme to gly                                 have been known in previous studies. Next we adjust the alpha coefficient to study the effect                                 of different ratios on the overall metabolic flow.
KATA Sensitivity Test before Modification
KATA Sensitivity Test after Modification
We show the highest ratio (1000) and the lowest ratio (0.001) in yellow and blue lines respectively.                                 The pre-transformation pathway is most sensitive to the change of Kcat in glpK enzyme, and                                 the metabolic pathway of the target substrate is transformed with the change of α Rate is                                 always higher than the pre-transformation pathway, even when the glpK Kcat / Km value is                                 100 times the GlyDH, the reason may be DAK enzyme catalytic efficiency’s higher than glpD.
As we can see, the previous reaction is dependent on ATP, and in the previous hypothesis,                                 we make ATP stable in the constant .In order to analyze the ATP concentration changes on                                 the impact of glycerol conversion, we add a Standard deviation of 0.05, mean of the normal                                 distribution of variables to disturb the timing of the concentration of ATP in ODE.
For the sake of us to observe the significant results, we assume that the initial concentration                                 of ATP is 0 and is always greater than zero.
And the change curve of the concentration in 60min is shown below:
Before transformation
After trransformation
We found that the random change of ATP concentration had a significant effect on the pathway                                 after transformation, and the rate of DHAP synthesis was lower than that before transformation.
But when we adjust the standard deviation of the normal distribution random variable to                                 0.05, the result is shown below.
Thus, we found that even if ATP had a greater perturbation, the overall"

To create our constructs when we have the genes and their sequences
Several strategies for creating and joining two independent DNAs without the use of restriction endonucleases have been developed. One such strategy uses overlap extension employing two PCR steps (7–10). Two intermediate PCR fragments with overlapping end sequences are first amplified, then re-annealed across the overlapping sequences, extended and subsequently amplified with a flanking primer set (7). Though the idea is attractive, the success of overlap PCR depends on efficient cross- annealing of intermediate PCR products and effective removal of unused internal primers to direct the second amplification of the full-length product. - USER TM friendly DNA engineering and cloning method by uracil excision

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#HP-content_-_-_TEXT.html," portrayed as superior to non-vegetarian diets one should also consider that at the same time a vegetarian diet might have a lower nutritional value [7].
Theoretical constructs like the NDCI index may be helpful when considering whether or not to keep eating meat or drinking milk. They do not, however, stop greenhouse gases like methane from being emitted and harming the Earth's climate. Yet, it seems necessary to maintain production standards for the time being because, although ethical concerns play an important role in the consumers' minds [4], it will still take many years until thoroughly sustainable animal production systems can be established. The process of rethinking when it comes to animal products cannot be done from one day to the other. There is no use in forcing people to believe in something of which they are not (yet) convinced, not to mention the economical consequences that would follow from a rapid, forced decrease of livestock production.
Hence, until society and economy are ready to significantly reduce livestock farming and thus greenhouse gas emissions, approaches are needed by which the emissions can be reduced while in other respects maintaining the status quo for the time being. In the development of such approaches science must play a pivotal role. The key characteristics of science, however – being rational and objective and value-free – also make some kind of control necessary for the consideration of ethical concerns [7]. This necessity stems from the fact that there is a large degree of reservation in the public towards the involvement of scientists in the food chain, which is likely due to several cases of unethical behavior on the scientists’ part. There is a need for scientists to broaden their thinking. Highly specialized scientists are necessary, but they must be open to society and not forget about possible bad consequences that might result from their research [4].
This implies that although production intensity, as aforementioned, might have to be maintained for the time being, this does not relieve anyone from the duty of keeping the animals’ welfare in mind. Although farm animals are often simply seen as resources, they are still sentient beings towards whose well-being humans have a moral responsibility. This responsibility should be grounded on the humans’ respect for the intrinsic value of life [5,8]. In this context, the British Farm Animal Welfare Council has devised the so-called Five Freedoms providing a guideline as to how farm animals should be treated. These Five Freedoms, in the most current form, are 1) the freedom from hunger and thirst, 2) the freedom from discomfort, 3) the freedom from pain, injury and disease, 4) the freedom to express normal behaviour, and 5) the freedom from fear and distress ["

However, Cyanothece 51142, a non-heterocyst, fixes nitrogen in the same cell as photosynthesis by relying on a circadian metabolic process, when there is less oxygen byproduct from photosynthesis. This process is both fascinating and necessary since the key enzyme in nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase, is poisoned by oxygen. Our goal this summer is to engineer the regulation of the proteins necessary for nitrogen fixation so that they are highly repressed when activated by broad spectrum light (such as the sun), and are highly active when there is no light around, mimicking the cycle where photosynthesis occurs during the day and nitrogen fixation occurs at night.
How does our project work?
Our team worked this summer on two projects towards a common purpose.
Richard and Caroline worked in the Pakrasi lab under Dr. Pakrasi, with Andrew Ng, Bert Berla, and Deng Liu as advisors on the getting nitrogen fixation working in E. coli.
Benjamin and Jeffrey worked in the Moon lab under Dr. Moon, with Cheryl Immethun as an advisor, and created a repressor system to turn off transcription of a reporter protein in the light.
For more information, please visit our project tab.
What did we accomplish?
There are two key components of our project: 
Richard and Caroline have been working in the Pakrasi lab, and have been using genes from cyanobacteria to get nitrogen fixation working in E. coli . They are testing nitrogen fixation by running acetylene reduction assays and designing experiments to test the optimal criteria (ie. E. coli strains, temperature, pH, nitrogen source) to get maximum results. For more info, visit the nitrogenase tab.
Ben and Jeffrey have been working in the Moon lab, and have been busy cloning plasmids to create a system that represses and expresses a fluorescent protein with the presence and absence of light and running experiments to test the induction levels compared to various positive and negative controls. For more info, visit the light regulation tab.

Our project is the first step of a much larger, much more complex endeavor. Nitrogen overabundance and nitrogen depletion are simultaneously big stumbling blocks in modern agriculture. The solution to both of these problems would be to endow plants themselves with the ability to fix nitrogen so that they could autonomously supply their own nitrogen for proteins, DNA, etc. We are taking the first step towards this ambitious goal by studying how the genes for nitrogen fixation from cyanob"

We exchanged the Triple SpyTag-SUP monomer for Triple SpyTag-LBP or Triple SpyTag-CBP, and tried using the same strategy to adsorb lead and cadmium. The results were remarkable, clearly demonstrating that the Uranium Reaper strategy has much potential to be expanded to other heavy metals. (Learn more)
 
 
Even though the efficiency of the Uranium Reaper system may be somewhat lower than current methods, it could certainly be optimized through further development work. Importantly, Uranium Reaper is much better in other aspects. In the future, we plan to optimize the entire Uranium Reaper strategy in order to enhance the adsorption efficiency.

We submitted 53 high-quality and well-characterized Standard BioBricks, including a set of derivatives of Triple SpyTag and Triple SpyCatcher, such as the Triple SpyTag-SUP and Triple SpyTag-mSA. (Learn more)
2.
We developed a special software which could be used to calculate the molecular weight distribution of protein polymers using Flory’s theory. The results of testing have demonstrated that the software is accurate and useful. (Learn more)
3.
We visited experts from the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and School of Physics of Peking University, respectively, to learn about the current situation surrounding uranium pollution in the real world and how people could control the situation. After finishing the main work, we presented them with the achievements of the project and got their feedback. (Learn more)
4.
We did an interview with the Hunan Nuclear Geology 311 Brigade and gained thorough insights into the treatment of uranyl pollution used by the people on the firing line. This way we could compare the methods they were using with the Uranium Reaper strategy. (Learn more)
5.
We helped and collaborated with other iGEM teams by guiding a new team (BHU_China), as well as discussing about project design and technical skills and sharing DNA materials (OUC-China, BIT-China, Tianjin, UCAS, Jinlin_China and BNU-China). (Learn more)

Kevin Setzer
Throughout the summer, Kevin was extremely busy working full time while also helping out our iGEM team. Though most of his contribution was done outside of NAIT, we could not have grown into the team we are today without Kevin Setzer.
Kevin mostly worked with Joy in the coding and designing of Team NAIT's Wiki sites. He was the very necessary second pair of eyes involved in editing all the HTML, CSS and dreaded Java that coded our wiki. When he could, Kevin also came to the lab to help prepare reagents necessary for processes and experiments later in the day.
Although busy, Kevin tried his best to find time and help out our iGEM team. Thank you, Kevin! Together, we've gone to infinity... and beyond!

Chromoproteins
As an example output plugin we transformed into Marchantia a selection of the chromoproteins brought to iGEM by Uppsala 2011. This was to test whether a simple change in colour would work as an easily visible reporter.
Five chromoproteins were selected for expression: eforred (BBa_K592012), tspurple (BBa_K1033906),  aspink (BBa_K1033927), aeblue (BBa_K1033929) and amilCP(BBa_K1033930, a deep blue colour). The N7 nuclear localisation tag (INSERT BIOBRICK NUMBER HERE) was added to tspurple, aspink and amilCP. Each was put into pGreen
The transformation procedure yielded a large number of transformants, approximately 100 per construct, which were confirmed via PCR using homogenised plants as a template and chromoprotein-specific primers for each tDNA added.
Left: A PCR of the transformed plants showing successful transformation. Right: A plate of transformants growing happily on hygromycin
For each chromoprotein construct, the transformation yielded approximately 100 transformed sporelings (7-days old plants). The petri dish to the right contains hygromycin as a selective marker. The gel confirms the transformation in three plants each from two other plates.  The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR anneal to 35S and N7 respectively, and the template was homogenised plant material.
After approximately four weeks of growth, sparsely distributed bright red cells became apparent under the microscope in the plants transformed with the tsPurple gene. Although similar cells were not found in wild type plants, diffuse red regions were found and are probably due to release of anthocyanins by stressed or aging cells.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," competition, the categorical group of the Environment Track and on the level of the team itself, this discourse of using synthetic biology as a technological instrument for reform becomes rather explicit. This is especially salient as many environmental and energy-related projects are always potential real-life industrial solutions for pressing ecological issues. In many ways, ecological modernisation is primarily instrumental as a discourse for policy-making purposes. However, at its core, the competition itself is in first instance about creating an incentive for future pioneers of science and technology to create clean technologies by using novel methods and approaches in biotechnology (Murphy and Gouldson 2009), or in this case, synthetic biology to enable a green chemistry for industrial dyeing processes.
The industrial innovation that is aimed for in the Goodbye AzoDye Project is in fact purposefully limited to an end-of-pipe solution in the process of textile dyeing in order to prevent the breakdown of azo dyes in leaching waste water into the environment. The proposed solution is therefore characteristic of an eco-modernist solution that is very much typical of environmental policy discourse in the 1970s and 1980s (Mol 1996). This is in contrast with the development of clean technologies and their application in industry so that processes of production are required to be restructured. This, however, implies an expensive investment with a higher degree of complexity to make the change actually happen. Therefore, technologies that are able to control a potentially polluting process without significant structural change, are preferred over others. The choice of the team to meet this cost-benefit analysis made by the textile dye industry can hence be interpreted as a pragmatic choice, demonstrating their affinity with market demands. Furthermore, from a scientific point of view, synthetic biology clearly has the capacity to invent a new dye altogether with the same product-related qualities but without its harmful effects (Murphy and Gouldson 2009). However, delivering such a clean technology lies beyond the given timeframe of the team as it means that a higher level of genetic engineering skills and material would be needed to accomplish it, as indicated by team member Georgia:
""If you build something entirely new, it usually takes years opposed to months to actually get a characterization of, understand a problem enough to actually do something about it. So it's kind of impossible to start from the very very beginning""
The members of the team have been aware of the limits of the product they want to present. While discussing the topic, they also addressed the presumption that, from the environmentalist perspective, one could argue that their own strategy, indeed, does not dispose of the use of the chemical substance that"

Three heads are better than one. Fortunatly, we conducted in-depth communications with SCUT-China_A on our detailed experiments. When we were facing the difficulties of extracting the genome DNA of Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC 23767, SCUT-China_A helped us to improve our method and finally we succeeded. On the other hand, we also measured the yeast growth variations and activity for SCUT-China_A. The help and contributions from and to other iGEM teams are extremely helpful for us to realize the importance of communication and collaboration.
NEU_China_B(2018)
Our team conducted an exchange discussion with NEU_China_B in August 2018. This meeting is mainly to share the two team's projects main content and two teams each encountered in the experiment problem. The Q&A are as following.
NEU_China_B: How do you ensure that the integrative vector in transformants will not lose?
SCAU-China: The integrative vector we used is pFQ20 provided by the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The homology arms in integrative vector for homologous recombination allows the target genes to be stably transferred into the genome of Microcoleus vaginatus. It has been verified through our experiment results.
SCAU-China: How to match the concentration of AI-2 expressed by the first plasmid pCFDuet-1 with the GFP concentration expressed by pet28a.
NEU_China_B: Our experiment was to release the AI-2 signal molecule after the PCFDUET-1 expression plasmid induction of lactic acid concentration, and AI-2 signal molecule can inhibit the lldr sequence on the second plasmid pet28a.
The LLDR sequence is capable of producing GFP-deterring proteins. In the experiment, we verified that two plasmid copies were more similar, and that the O1o2 sequence could be started normally when the lactic acid concentration was lower (less than 1m mol), and then the GFP gene could be produced fluorescent signal.
Therefore, the expression of two plasmids is more matched, and the experimental results are not affected in this project.
What’s more, we provided the yogurt produced by Guangdong SCAU Assets Management Co.Ltd. to NEU_China_B as their experiment materials for the LED project. They finally obtained positive results by using the"

Design considerations
A promoter of the Anderson constitutive promoter family was placed in front of the riboswitch. It is the consensus constitutive promoter family of iGEM, it is well documented and the amount of expression differs 2500 fold between different promoters. It can also be easily swapped for another promoter of the same family if a different amount of expression is needed 7 . This is convenient since the optimal expression level of the toxin gene is not known yet.
02 - 12 May
First attempt in constructing the inverter part out of biobricks Bba_P0140 and Bba_I13521. This has been done via the standard digestion, ligation and transformation protocol. The transformation resulted in one red colony. This colony has been checked by placing the constitutive promoter J23119 in front of it via another 3A assembly.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Human Practice#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html,"FC) at the beginning, where we figured out that the most difficult part of the MFC is the transfer of the electrons through the cell membrane and the oxidation of the mediator at the anode as well and the toxicity of some mediators. After this short introduction we asked him specific questions about our project:
Skype-Interview
How do you assess the chances of expressing a conductive pilus in E. coli? What are the difficulties?
In the short time you have to work at your project it is very difficult to express a conductive pilus in E. coli. Especially, since the structural proteins have not yet been clearly analyzed which genes are responsible for the pilus and his conductivity, so it isn’t easy to work with it. If you reach your goal it would be a great scientific success. It is very interesting to express this pilus of G. sulfurreducens in E. coli because it has got the highest electron-transfer-constant so it would be very effective.
Do you think that cloning of the pilus from Geobacter sulfurreducens into E. coli causes safety issues?
It is commonly known that pili of E. coli cause human disease. The strain which you are working with is a safety strain without these dangerous pili. In my opinion there doesn’t exist the problem because of the fact that the genes of the pilus would come from G. sulfurreducens, which isn’t associated with disease, but with transferring electrons.
We want to use the mtrCAB cluster from Shewanella oneidensis to increase the electron transfer through the bacteria membrane to the anode. What do you think about this idea?
Generally it is a good one. The advantage of the mtrCAB cluster from S. oneidensis is better related to E. coli then the cluster from Geobacter sulfurreducens, but the negative aspect of this idea is that the mtrCAB cluster only has a low electron transfer constant. This means that in comparison to the transfer via mediators or direct transfer via pili the electrons need more time to get through this tunnel-like protein. It could be problematic to get the proteins into the membrane in correct orientation. This problem can be solved by anaerobic coexpression of the ccm-cluster. The idea is challenging but practicable.
Another aspect of our project is to express porines through which our mediators can get through. What do you think about this?
This is also an interesting approach. I am very interested in wether this will work, because it could be a great challenge to improve the reduction of the"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Haut de page
L’intérêt de la pharmacologie génétique [1,2]
Le défi de la thérapie génique est de parvenir à corriger, à l'intérieur des cellules d'un organisme humain (via des modifications sur le génome), les anomalies qui engendrent une maladie. Contrairement à la thérapie protéique, la thérapie génique ne se contente pas d’atténuer les symptômes mais va bien plus loin : son objectif est leur suppression.
Même lorsqu’une protéine exogène peut être utilisée, la thérapie génique présente des avantages majeurs :
- La protéine produite à partir du transgène est soumise aux processus de modifications post-transcriptionnels de l’hôte. Le profil de glycosylation est donc strictement celui du patient, ce qui assure ainsi une meilleure biocompatibilité.
- Elle permet de contourner le problème de l’administration de protéines complexes à l’intérieur de la cellule, étant donné que le transgène est exprimé directement à travers la machinerie cellulaire.
- Elle permet une expression localisée du transgène, évitant tout risque lié à la présence systémique de la protéine.
La thérapie génique a l’avantage de présenter une meilleure pharmacocinétique en évitant les administrations répétées du traitement et la toxicité qui leur est liée. Elle permet également une expression prolongée du gène-médicament puisque l’activité biologique des protéines transgéniques semble être supérieure à celle des protéines recombinantes. De plus, la suppression des pics d’injection permet d’éviter une désensibilisation des récepteurs.
Pour finir, un dernier point, qui peut paraitre moins crucial, mais qui a néanmoins son importance : le confort du malade. L’administration unique (ou répétée à très faible fréquence) est beaucoup mieux tolérée par le malade qu’une administration quotidienne, voir pluriquotidienne, comme c’est le cas actuellement"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," creation of the perfect human. With a case like this, are we bypassing this objective or enabling it?
Would human characteristics converge or rather diverge, making sports either totally uniform or extremely scattered over niches?
Before this time, how would athlete behavior be in comparison with more conventional doping?
How do and would athletes deal with undesired side effects?
What do these findings imply for possible current measures?
Outcomes and Implications
During the discussion we identified a list of points that differ for gene doping compared to other kinds of doping. This list is given in figure 5. The overall conclusion is that more attention should be paid to educating athletes on the risks above just regulating. Many athletes are not educated well about gene doping in particular and would therefore easily trust coaches etc. at the sports facility to take something of which they themselves are not able to oversee the consequences.
Figure 5. List of the differing factors between gene doping and more conventional doping.
Another topic addressed during the discussion was that we cannot easily say that gene doping could become ‘safe’ at some point. It is possible that it becomes apparent that we have been messing around with certain feedback loops which has broader health implications on longer terms after some years. We cannot know with some initial studies. It is this what makes that we should be keep prohibiting gene doping according to the majority of experts present at the discussion. On top of this, differences in accessibility, which you also already see in training facilities and equipment, were used as arguments against gene doping.
Great presentation and especially loved the debate and various perspectives on the question of gene doping.
— April Henning (@aprildhenning) August 30, 2018
Furthermore, it was brought up that there will always be differences between athletes, due to inherently different responses to gene therapies. Therefore, if everyone would be using gene doping, it is just like taking a step to somewhat higher performance, which will then level out again in time. So what would we achieve with doing it?
Thanks for the event, Delft team and Paul. A wonderfully complex tangle of ethical and pragmatic issues at stake. The debate showed a great meeting of science, systematic method and applied philosophy.
— Steve Chinn (@SteveChinnups) August 30, 2018
As became apparent in the discussion, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) is not very open about gene doping to athletes and scientists. However, according to the experts at the conference, openness and involvement of the community could help a lot with the development of detection methods. This reinforces the community strength approach we take with for example the"

From the whole sequence guide tree diagram, we found that sequences in category 1 are mixed with sequences in category 2. Thus, the classification by the sequences secondary structure may not restrict in the phylogenetic analysis perspective. The sequence 27 which is different from the other sequences in diagram 3 shows evolutionary change in the whole sequences diagram.

Secondary structure and free energy
The previous work by Gallivan has shown that the aptamers usually have two conformations with different free energy and the presence of the theophylline would change the equilibrium state which the aptamers secondary structures would shift from ‘’off’’ state to ‘’on’’ state (Figure 4). The possible switching mechanism in which extensive paring in the region near the ribosome binding site prevents translation of downstream genes have been demonstrated by de Smit and van Duin.
Therefore we reconsider our previous work and the result suggests that only relative long aptamer sequence would fold to different conformation. Besides, the longer the sequences are the lower free energy the aptamer would have. And the most aptamer sequences we have collected are only the target sense section which can bind the target molecule but cannot fold into different conformations. That is, we should design the action section to accomplish the aptamer’s function.
Combing to the sequence alignment, we find that the consensus sequences locates in the region which would interact with the target molecule. As we expected, the results suggests the ligand-binding conform to the structure –function relationship.

A High-Throughput Screen for Synthetic Riboswitches Reveals Mechanistic Insights into Their Function DOI 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.12.008
The covariance experiment by Gallivan indicates that base-pairing between the aptamer and a region near the ribosome binding would decrease the upstream gene expression which would be used to improve the aptamers’ performance (Figure 5). Notably, we use the mfold to predict the secondary structure of the aptamer which has been reported by Gallivan but cannot get the expected two varied conformation.

Heli was actively involved in our brainstorming and idea development processes with our other advisors, giving us feedback on the idea and providing us with aspects that we should take into consideration. She also instructed us where to find all the equipment and reagents we needed in the student laboratory, and she helped us with ordering reagents that we needed for our project specifically. Additionally, Heli advised us with whom to contact when we needed to find some experimental materials (e.g. bacterial strains) or special equipment outside the student laboratory.  Sesilja helped us significantly with our experimental design and laboratory work. She provided us with some of the important experimental materials we needed for our project, and helped us to design our own DNA fragments and primers etc. Sesilja also advised us on using the equipment we were not familiar with beforehand. She was always there for us if we had problems with our experiments and she supported us in troubleshooting the experiments and analyzing our results.

Exeter,2013,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," 2 colours that the light sensor does not respond to. However, when grown in the presence of light that the sensor is responsive to we would expect to see inhibited expression of the specific pigment.
As mentioned in the Theory section of our wiki; the mechanism of our red light sensor involves the phosphorylation of OmpR by EnvZ, however, E.coli naturally expresses both OmpR and EnvZ. A direct result of this is false positives. An experimental method for overcoming these false positives would be to transform the plasmid containing the red light module into a strain of E.coli that is EnvZ deficient. The iGEM team from the University of Dundee very kindly sent us a sample of an EnvZ- strain of E.coli, thus giving us the resources to perform this experiment.
Blue Light Module
Our Blue Light Module, which is being built by DNA2.0, will unfortunately not arrive in the labs until after the Wiki-freeze. However, we will be bringing plenty of pictures of it working (hopefully!) to the Jamboree. Considering it has been constructed in a very similar manner to the Green Light Module, which is functioning in the lab, we are reasonably hopefully that we can have the Blue Light Module functioning in the lab soon after its arrival.

Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," preparation of the lecture started 3 weeks prior to the lecture. Posters (See below) were elaborately designed and posted up around the campus. We also bulletined the news through E-mail and SNS, to ensure every potential audience might be interested in it.
Haoqian ZHANG from Center for Theoretical Biology, Peking University was invited as our important guest and major speaker. Haoqian, who is very familiar with synthetic and system biology, has participated iGEM competition for three times, and led Peking team up to Runner-up in Final list last year. Furthermore, as the advisor this year, he has huge ambition to perform their project much better and more elegant.
On the evening of Friday, Sept.23rd, we were flattered the moment walking into meeting place, for the room was almost filled up. Never had we thought that the lecture would attract such many audiences. The audiences, most of which were sophomore and freshmen, responded warmly to the splendid lectures given by the three speakers. Haoqian ZHANG first gave an overall introduction of the history of synthetic biology. And then he went on with several detailed programs and potential applications on theory of synthetic biology, such as logical circuits and dual switches. The audiences were shocked by the marvelous and multiple work done by the engineered bacteria in a popular and easy-to-understand language. The talks took ninety minutes in all, while the question and answer session lasted for another half an hour. His wonderful speech in his unique humorous style won him warm applause from the audiences in the end.
Tsinghua iGEM Seminar & Lab Tour
In order to appeal young minds in high school to life science and students from all departments in Tsinghua university to know more about IGEM, we held a Tsinghua IGEM seminar followed by a lab tour on 8th October.
In the beginning, two members of our team, Guanqiao LI and Chen CHEN, held a presentation to introduce IGEM and presented our previous projects, like “E.Immunology”, “Gene Sniper” and the project “E.colimousine” this year. We would like to lay emphasis on the enormous and impressive functions and applications of life science, especially of synthetic biology. After introducing our project, students showed great interests in our projects and raised many questions about them.
To develop a perceptual knowledge of the interesting task, students were invited to look around our labs in school of Life Science. Almost everyone was grateful for this opportunity to get close to synthetic biology. The whole activity ended successfully and our effort really pays off!

The one that was partial did not work—we could try re-replica plating it but the PIF3 full was  the only one that  worked. There were 2 more PIF3 subclones that did not work.  • Ones that are turning really blue may have more copies of the plasmids, which risks that they might lose copies over time.

How to use it
<partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo> can be:
propagated in E. coli
engineered to change the passenger and/or the integration guide
integrated into the desired locus of the host genome
used to perform the desired number of serial integrations in the same genome
How to propagate it before performing genome integration
The default version of this vector contains the <partinfo>BBa_I52002</partinfo> insert, so it *must* be propagated in a ccdB-tolerant strain such as DB3.1 (<partinfo>BBa_V1005</partinfo>).
After the insertion of the desired BioBrick part in the cloning site, this vector does not contain a standard replication origin anymore, so it *must* be propagated in a pir+ or pir-116 strain such as BW25141 (<partinfo>BBa_K300984</partinfo>) or BW23474 (<partinfo>BBa_K300985</partinfo>) that can replicate the R6K conditional origin (<partinfo>BBa_J61001</partinfo>).
How to engineer it
The DNA guide can be changed as follows:
Figure 12: How to engineer the integrative base vector to assemble the desired DNA guide.
Be sure to have the desired guide in the RFC10 standard or a compatible one (Fig.12-a).
Digest the guide with XbaI-SpeI (Fig.12-b).
Digest the integrative base vector <partinfo>BBa_K300000</partinfo> with NheI (Fig.12-c) and dephosphorylate the linearized vector to prevent re-ligation.
Ligate the digestion products (Fig.12-d). XbaI, SpeI and NheI all have compatible protruding ends. Note that the ligation is not directional, but the guide can work in both directions.
Transform the ligation in a ccdB-tolerant strain and screen the clone.
The DNA passenger can be changed as follows:
Figure 13: How to engineer the integrative base vector to assemble the desired DNA passenger.
Be sure to have the desired passenger in the RFC10 standard or a compatible one (Fig.13-a).
Digest the passenger with EcoRI-PstI (Fig.13-b).

At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually. Details of modeling is available here .

Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4 and one aTc molecule binds with one tetR dimer to form complex aTc:TetR2.

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," query sequence to a database sequence, the better the alignment score will be.
However, it is not intuitively obvious what degree of genetic recoding is required to evade detection by BLAST. To test this, we developed a software tool within the CODONxCHANGE suite, written in Python 2.7 to test the integrity of the BLAST platform against sequences that have been partially encrypted via a set number of recoding events. This tool can also be used to prepare genes for implementation in an orthogonal cell-free system for biocontainment purposes.
SeCReT (Sequential Codon Reassignment Tool)
The tool is designed to take a nucleic acid coding sequence or protein sequence as an input, and return an ‘encrypted’ version of the sequence based upon translation via a novel genetic code. It achieves this by translating a DNA sequence into a protein sequence, and then sequentially assigning a random codon to each unique amino acid required within the protein. The resultant sequence is returned in a newly encrypted state.
Check out SeCReT on the CODONxCHANGE GitHub repository!
How Robust is BLAST?
The sequence of an alpha conotoxin was randomly encrypted 29 times for each of the possible 17 recoding events. The sequences were then analyzed via BLAST using a locally curated database containing only the original sequence. The percent identity was averaged with non-hits counting as a 0 value. The percent identity of each sequence and the number of matches returned per group was then plotted as a function of the number of recoding events. The orange trace represents the percent identity of the query to the subject sequence, and the blue trace represents the proprotion of recoded events that BLAST found a match for.
The results of this analysis suggest that the most effective number of switches to BEAT Blast is 4. This level of recording is generally sufficient to bring the similarity of a protein to below 80%, which is the consesus value reported in the HHS guidelines and adhered to by the majority of gene synthesis companies.
After 9 recoding events, a number of sequences become able to evade BLAST entirely.
This suggests that rational recoding to disrupt the generation of high scoring words in BLAST may improve the cryptographic ability of genetic recoding even further. Furthermore, having more than 12 recoding events significantly improves the chances that the encrypted sequence is not detected by BLAST at all. Again, the raw data generated from the experiments are available for public analysis and more results can be found on the GitHub page.

Draw my Biosafety
Seven iGEM teams attended the Bordeaux Meetup. We seized this opportunity to spark reflections concerning every iGEM projects. Therefore we encouraged present teams to think about a safety mechanism suitable for their project. We then helped them to optimize it in order to prevent dissemination of their genetically engineered organism. To make it a funny and traceable experience we asked each team to draw the mechanism developed.
Biosafety Guide
To generalize concern of biosafety among iGEM projects and make it accessible we developed a guide .This document aims to simplify the process in order to conceptualize a biosafety point of view. Moreover this guide rises major questions that a team should consider when starting a biosafety consideration about a project.
Help to create an iGEM team
Members of our team answered the questions and advised some of the founder members of iGEM Paris Pasteur on how to run an iGEM team. iGEM Pasteur is participating for the first time this year to iGEM competition.
iGEM Rhizi
Our team enriched the graphic database , initiated by iGEM Paris-Bettencourt , by sharing key information of our SafetE.coli project. Thus completing the platform with keywords relating to our project make us visible by other iGEM teams. It is a fast and interactive way to find out subjects on which are working other teams. Besides the fact that the platform was available lately in 2015 Competition, Rhizi is promising for future teams. This could certainly become a fast way to find possible collaborations among the iGEM community.

The results of our project demonstrate that mutations can be inserted into protein cages in order to modify them into potential targeted drug delivery vehicles. Future plans include loading these protein cages with various small molecules and assaying for exposure to the external environment upon cleavage and disassembly.
Cloning
All PCQuad and O3-33 wildtype and mutant protein cages were successfully cloned into psb1c3 vector as biobricks, sequence verified and submitted to the parts registry. As shown in Figure 1, the biobricks contain a T7 promoter, Ribosome Binding Site, sequence for an individual subunit of the specific cage, a 6x Histadine tag and a stop codon.

2. Preparation of linear DNA
In order to transfrom the moss, the DNA including our BioBricks with the nptII selection casette had to be linearized. We used EcoRI for the preparative digestion of our midipreps and simultaneously ran an analytical digest as quality control. Our preparations continued by purifying our digested DNA through salt, isopropanol and ethanol precipitation, solubilising in a small amount of water, measuring the concentration at the NanoDrop and suspending it in different volumes of sterile filtered Ca(NO3)2 buffer for the intended concentration of 0.25 µg/µl .

Q1.2: Are those Parts stored in the database of S-Din safe enough?
A: iGEM safety community has already accessed a series of Parts with Biosafety danger, and the ‘Red Flag’ tag was set in Registry.
There are numerous Parts in S-Din database. By manually screening all Parts in database, we found that there were only few that are tagged with ‘Red Flag’ (Fig. 2). Since we are dedicated to providing an open platform for synthetic biology, the user won’t be limited if they search for ‘Red Flag’ parts; However, users will be warned and advised not to do so once they attempt to design new circuits with ‘Red Flag’ parts.
Figure 2: Red Flag part distribution in S-Din's database.
Wrap up: Most of the Parts in S-Din are biosafety (without official ‘Red Flag’ tag), users are limited in using ‘Red Flag’ in our design platform.
Q2: By using design platform of S-Din, will there be any potential dangerous operation?
A: Even a proficient and professional Synthetic Biologist can’t avoid a dangerous operation. (For example, he pick out the right part out of thousands of Parts, but he become too excited so somehow ignore the dangerous side-product, who knows?) To avoid coincident accidence, we provide a General Biosafety Assessment Criterion and embed real-time Safe surveillance system to detect the safe problem in real time, the user will also be alerted.
Q2.1: Details of Biosafety Assessment of Parts in S-Din?
A: Every part is recorded with ‘Risk Group’ and three safety level are set (1 star: low risk, 2 stars: moderate risk, 3 stars: high risk) which is judged by two criteria:
Whether the part is tagged with “Red Flag”
Which risk group the Parts’ Chassis belongs to
1-star standard: no “Red Flag” tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 1.
2-stars standard: no “Red Flag” tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 2.
3-stars standard: with “Red Flag” tag, or belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 3 or 4.
When the user starts deeigning circuits, they are allowed to add undefined new parts to S-Din database. Users are requested to fill in information Risk Group, meanwhile tagging the Chassis of parts.

General Safety Issues
In this part, we will illustrate organisms, reagents and equipments we use that may cause safety problems, and introduce our operation standard, management and trains protecting the team members, public and environment.
As above, all the organisms and DNA hosts are not of high individual or community risk. Until now, the only used organism is E. coli K.12 (and some of its varieties, for example, DH5α, a RecA mutated strain). Our current lab of basic-biosafety level 1 is safe enough to manipulate this strain. Only the genome (a generous present from University of Dundee iGEM team), but not the living Salmonella enterica was manipulated in the lab, and the genes from it are homogeneous of E. coli K.12, not associated with pathogenesis. We will not implement our future experimental plan with microorganisms of risk group 2 or vertebrates in our current lab, for too low is the biosafety level and no animal facilities.
To manipulate microorganisms, an ultra clean cabinet is used and strict aseptic technique is followed. All experimenters have been trained on foundation microbiology technique and biosafety. All microorganism contacting vessels are sterilized before and after experiments in appropriate protocols. Also, all microorganism materials will be sterilized before discarded. In this way, we believe that no public or environmental harm will be caused by the experimental organisms. In addition, no one in our team will be hurt by the experimental organisms.
The genetic modifications we make will change metabolism of bacteria. However, there is no evidence both theoretically and experimentally that these modifications will improve the pathogenicity of the bacteria or cause damage to environment even taking the risk of horizontal gene transfer into consideration. The effects of expressing gene adrA regarding infectivity and pathogenicity on E. coli is not clear now, but it still can be easily controlled in the lab environment without human ingestion. Also, we will insert a death device into the bacteria cell when we construct the whole system (still far from now) to avoid the proliferation out of control. For more information about gene safety, please read the next section and documents of our relevant parts on registry.
We have considered the potential harmful chemicals and equipments, as listed below:
Basic molecular experiments: NaOH, HCl, SDS, acrylamide, TEMED, ethanol, IPTG, liquid nitrogen, β-mercaptoethanol, xylene cyanol FF.

The data shows that all expression systems we created (B-E) show higher values for fluorescence than the controls. This indicates that GFP is expressed.
After the successful detection of a fluorescence signal, we wanted to determine the position of the Tar receptor by studying the localizaion of the GFP protein. Under the fluorescence microscope we compared one negative control of untransformed E. coli BL21 cells and the samples with the strongest fluorescence measured in the Tecan Plate Reader. The difference between these samples was also visible with this device. Moreover, the fluorescence could be localized in the poles of the E. coli cells in some cases via the microscope. That means that our expression system worked and the proteins are functional. But there were also many colonies that did not have the fluorescence signal at the poles, which could be either caused by a misfolded Tar receptor or just due to statistical variation.

Temperature Tests
To further understand the growth properties of the mycelium and predict its growth patterns in different environments (namely the Martian surface), temperature tests were conducted. Based on already existing literature on mycelium, it has been suggested that optimal temperature conditions range from 23°C to 30°C. With this in mind, the growth rate of mycelium at the following temperatures were measured: 4°C, 23°C, 30°C, and 37°C. The surface area of each plate of mycelium in each temperature condition measured each day over the course of 20 days. Three plates of mycelium growing on PDYA were all plated on the same day and put at each temperature condition (totaling to 12 plates of mycelium growing simultaneously at different temperature conditions).
Growing Mycelia in Molds
We grew our mycelium products using a procedure we developed and standardized through running of a variety of different experiments and conducting preliminary research with DIY (Do-It-Yourself) mycelium growth kits that are sold by Ecovative on their site[4]. The kits we purchased were aspen, hemp, and kenaf.
Our procedure began with the preparation of the substrates for inoculation with mycelium. To begin, we ground the substrate into a loose particles (if it did not come in that form). We then sterilized the substrate and any containers we planned to use with the autoclave.
After the autoclave process was complete we moved the substrate, the containers, sterilized scalpels, Whirlpack bags which are supplied sterile and sealed,, and petri dishes of mycelium under the laminar flow hood. We then divided the substrate among the Whirlpack bags. We then sealed the bags and removed them out from under the hood. After removal we weighed the mass of the bags and recorded it on the front of the bag. After re-sterilizing with ethanol, the bags were placed back under the laminar flow hood. We then calculated and added a specific amount of PDY (Potato-dextrose-yeast) to the each of the bags containing the substrates (this was done to provide the mycelium with an easy substrate to break down--in the case of Ecovative they used regular flour). We experimented with different ratios between weight and PDY to find the best amount to add--while we were unable to generate a specific ratio by the"
