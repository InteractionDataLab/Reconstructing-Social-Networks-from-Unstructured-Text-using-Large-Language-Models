Process:
    In the live broadcast, each sub-venue of the mobile phone will be shooting live process, and the projector is used to play PPT or watch another live broadcast of the venue.
    Live is divided into the following sections:
    First of all, introduced synthetic biology and iGEM to the audience inside and outside briefly (15minutes).During this time, the two sides on the screen played PPT, using cell phone shooting so that the audience can watch the live broadcast;
Figue2,Moderator Zhuo was introducing the event while another teammate was shooting.
    Then, the two sides will introduce their own team project (10 minutes each), during this time each team played their PPT in the team's projector, and another venue was playing each other's live images. So that we can make both sides of the audience inside and outside the audience see the live process;
    Finally, the audience from both inside and outside raised questions for the two teams about the project. During this time, the two sides played each other's live broadcast on the screen to achieve an effect that on-site and off-site, NWPU and LanZhou information transmission among four groups. (15 minutes)
Figue3, The  webcast of LanZhou on the big screen, so that we can watch their live, and transmit it to more people.
Achievement:
    First of all, we do not need such an additional cost. Mobile phones and standard multimedia classrooms are now common in universities in China.
    Secondly, the live can achieve large-scale dissemination of information in a short time. The total number of students in the two venues during the live broadcast was almost 50, but in the event of an hour or so, the event received 1,100+ hits which is the 22 times of the number on the scene.
    In addition, it can have timely interaction with the audience inside and outside the venue, which is very different from the traditional simple introduction.
    We believe that such practical activities are successful and meaningful!
Figue3, After the event, we posed for pictures together.
Inspiration:
    In the era of the rapid development             of modern network communications, the media has become a new vitality of the             information dissemination. In other words, everyone can become the source of             information dissemination. At the same time, each person is also a site for             information reception. We can use this information dissemination to achieve             timely communication among the teams, and send the information"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"zo1 cells with DOX added in culture medium were stimulated by 108kHz ultrasound from 10s to 30s. Four regions were selected. Two R-GECO+Piezo1 cell region were chosen one from the right side of the video and another from left side. Two backgrounds were chosen the same way.
Fig. 15 Equivalent Schematics of the Transducer
The equivalent circuit of ultrasonic transducer was used to calculate the ultrasonic radiant power of an ultrasonic transducer. We assume the ultrasonic energy was evenly distributed on the transducer interface [3] , that is:
I\left( x,y,z = 0 \right) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} I_{0},x^{2} + y^{2} \leq R^{2} \\ 0,x^{2} + y^{2} \lt R^{2} \end{matrix} \right.\
Where I0 is the absolute ultrasound intensity, R is the radio of transducer interface
According to power intensity and pressure relation:
I_{0} = \frac{{P_{0}}^{2}}{2c\rho}
In which P_0 , c, \rho
are respectively absolute pressure, acoustic velocity and water density. We managed to calculate the pressure on the transducer-culture medium interface.
Then, we implemented FEM to do a series of simulations to find the absolute pressure filed distribution in different conditions. 108kHz and 1.1MHz transducer device were modeled as is shown in Fig. 16

The influence of distance error on pressure distribution pattern was also studied, which indicated that the 108kHz transducer was very robust to distance error, while the 1.1MHz acted as a chaos when little distance error occurs.
In all, the 108kHz ultrasonic transducer was recommended as ultrasonic stimulator for quantitative measure cell response based on modeling and experimental results.

III - SQR (Sulfide Quinone Reductase)-
The SQR gene codes for sulfide quinone reductase, an enzyme catalysing the conversion of H2S to elemental Sulfur(S). The initial plan was to clone this gene downstream of the CysI gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which codes for sulfite reductase, catalysing the conversion of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
Sulfur dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles.
About 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources. The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Some mineral ores also contain sulfur, and sulfur dioxide is released when they are processed. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.
Sulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as"

Design Process
We approached our project through a typical design process, working from our initial project aim and objectives, through market research, investigations, to our implementation and solution. This page contains a more detailed account of our project throughout the summer.
Aim
Every good design process must have a clear aim. Ours was to take a step towards realising the full potential of a group of well characterised parts, the biosensors available within the registry, by developing a prototype kit which could be used effectively and practically in real-world applications. In  other words, we aimed to engineer an easy to use product, centred around biobricks, and aimed at the end user. Our team has realised this potential and have developed a kit which has real world uses now, as well as potential applications in the future.
Market Research
Having decided that the primary aim of our project was the design of a practical useful product, the first thing we needed was to find its potential use as well as a possible market. The ideal market would fulfill at least three requirements:
Face a real problem which could be solved by our product.
Have the financial capacity to obtain/create our product.
Be currently in the state where access to similar equipment is limited, and therefore the impact of our solution would be maximised
We aimed to tackle issues concerning the welfare and standard of living of people, in particular those who might lack the resources to tackle them themselves.
To help inform the overall shape of our project, as well as the specifics of our design, we talked to Konrad Siegfried , a scientist who has already had the chance to test a bioreporter construct in the field.

Determination of β-galactosidase activity
The “ß-Gal” assay is a very common method to determine the activity of a promoter in vivo (Miller, 1972). To monitor the promoter activity, the promoter of interest has to be fused to the lacZ gene by a simple cloning step. In the next step, the so-called promoter- reporter gene fusion has to be introduced into the chromosome of the B. subtilis strain of interest. Transcription from an active promoter results in the synthesis of the β-galactosidase that hydrolyses lactose or chromogenic substrates such as o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). Hydrolysis of ONPG results in the formation of o-nitrophenol, which absorps light with a wavelength of 420 nm. The amount of o-nitrophenol that is formed within a certain time is directly proportional to the activity of a promoter. Each condition should be independently measured at least two times.

Our results
Unfortunately, due to unsuccessful cloning, no measurements were obtained. Despite the several protocols tested, no cloning have been confirmed.
We do not know why the cloning did not work.
With the AQUA cloning, we frequently obtained red colonies, which is a strong indication that pSB1C3                         with the RFP was integrated in E. coli. The issue here is that we used the linear plasmid provided                         by iGEM. The latter did PCR on pSB1C3 with RPF to provide us the linear plasmid. Some template should                         have stay in the linear plasmid that they sent us. To counter this phenomenon we used Dpn1 to digest                         the circular plasmid following the right protocol but it still remains some template.
AQUA cloning and enzymatic cloning were equally concerned about problem on analysis. As soon as colonies                         were present, we performed colony PCR which gave nothing and then when we did enzymatic digestions                         the results were inexplicable. It was no contamination because the negative control was always empty,                         meaning that the issue was not with the water, the primers or the buffers. The stripes were never                         the right length and yet we tried numerous enzymes and enzymes blends. It could be non specific hybridization                         but we verified with the ApE software and did not find any hybridation area. Even when a single enzyme                         was used and should have given us the length of the plasmid with the insert, sometimes several stripes                         were present. It was like there was a contamination or that two empty plasmid bound. We do not understand                         how it could be something else than our plasmid because it should have possessed the chloramphenicol                         resistance.
In a nutshell, the profiles did not correspond to the expected clones and the analysis by sequencing                         did not help to understand what was going on with these clonings.
Regarding the chemistry part of the project, it is a real shame that so many problems with the HPLC occured                         because it does not allow any conclusion. The issue with the acid hydrolysis is that initially it                         is used to produce sugars and that H"

Biosynthetic Pathway
Three genes are needed to produce PHB from acetyl-CoA in E. coli. These genes are phaA, phaB, and phaC. The pathway for PHB production is shown in the figure below, where 2 acetyl-CoAs are converted to acetoacetyl-CoA then 3-Hydoxybutyryl-CoA is made via phaB enzyme. Finally 3-Hydoxybutyryl-CoA is polymerized to make PHB (Agnew and Pfleger 2013). The PhaC synthase remains covalently attached to PHB after polymerization (Rehm 2009).
Figure 1. Figure shows the biosynthesis of PHB from acetyl-CoA adapted from Rehm 2009.
Granule Formation
As mentioned earlier, the PhaC synthase remains covalently bound to the PHB polymer and during granule formation (Tomizawa, Hyakutake et al. 2011). Other proteins, such as phasin, can also bind to the PHB granule and help granule structure and control granule size (York, Junker et al. 2001; York, Stubbe et al. 2001).
Purification and Quantification
Traditional Purification
There are a variety of PHB purification strategies ranging from mechanical, chemical, and biological treatments to liberate PHB from cells. The different strategies are outlines in Jacquel et al. 2008. The most common method of PHB purification is to use a chloroform/bleach extraction. The purpose of bleach is to lyse the cells and chloroform helps agglomerate the PHB together. The chloroform/bleach method has been reported to give extremely high purities with minimal cell contamination (Jacquel et al. 2008). There are, however, several aqueous"

12.1µl luciferin stock
10µl DMSO
177.9µl PBS 1x
X33-38 Luciferin substrate solution: 0.4mM in PBS
Luciferin, sodium salt, molar mass = 302g/mol
Stock at 2mg/µl = 0.002g/ml
0.002g/302g/mol = 6.62x10^-6 mol/ml or 6.62x10^-3 Molar solution (6.62mM)
We want 0.4mM so 6.62/0.4 = 16.5x dilution

A member of Team Groningen kindly performed spot-on-lawn assays with B. subtilis W168 wild type and the subtilin-producer B. subtilis ATCC6633 on different S. aureus species. The tested strains were CAL, NWZ (both MRSA, obtained at the UMCG hospital) and CECT240 (Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Rosenbach 1884). Strains were plated out in soft agar and spots from overnight cultures of Bacillus subtilis grown in either complex medium (LB) or defined medium (SMM) were added on top.
Fig. 4. Spot-on-lawn assay with the subtilin producer and on three different S. aureus lawns
After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, halos could be detected for all spots of the subtilin producer. The exact results are shown in the chart below. However, the spots of the B. subtilis W168 culture did not inhibit the growth of any S. aureus strains (no pictures provided).
Fig. 5 Bar chart of the S. aureus spot-on-lawn assay.
Heterologous expression
The aim of this approach was to transfer the complete subtilin gene cluster into our working horse Bacillus subtilis W168 by maintaining the native regulation mainly mediated by the spaRK two-component system. So far, the 12 kb-locus is assumed to be transferred into our Bacillus wild type but only half of the locus is sequenced. Unfortunately, no subtilin production could be ascertained. This could be due to an incorrect sequence or the fact that the native regulation of B. subtilis ATCC6633 does not work in our wild type. Our next steps are the full sequencing of the putative spa-gene cluster and an attempt to transfer it into B.subtilis W168 ΔabrB, a mutant that lacks the repressing transition state regulator.
The BioBrick approach
This approach aims to ""BioBrick"" and by this standardize the subtilin gene cluster according to its transcriptional entities. In contrast to the heterologous expression, the BioBricks will be under quorum sensing dependent regulation.

Mr Holmes
Representing iGEM and Synthetic Biology at the MakerFaire Hannover
On July 4th-7th, Florian , René and Michael joined Ansgar on a trip to the MakerFaire Hannover 2014 .
The MakerFaire is an exhibition with things that people built on their own using readily available tools. Dozens of 3D printers and microcontrollers can be examined, and there are a lot of devices visitors can interact with. Among the fire-spitting dragon, our OD and fluorescence measurement devices attracted a lot of attention. We spoke with hundreds of visitors and had a lot of interesting conversations.
Saturday evening, Carsten Ludwig from the iGEM Team Braunschweig visited us. We showed him the most fascinating stands and afterwards went to the city to walk the Red Thread of Hannover , a track going past 36 very central tourist attractions as e.g. the roofless church.
On this quick sightseeing trip we took a nice panorama of the Aegidienkirche .
When the #NEDCRC soccer game started, we settled for some hamburgers, fermentation broth and exchanged funny stories about our lab experience.
On Saturday, the run on our stand had been so enormous that we had to improvise and print new flyers at our hostel for Sunday, the second and last day of the fair. Just like the day before, a lot of people showed interest in our stand, and especially René passionately demonstrated our devices and informed about synthetic biology as well as our project Cellock Holmes.
At about midday, Manuel, advisor of Team Bielefeld , visited us and got to experience our measurement device, too.
When we left Hannover Monday morning, we decided to stop by in Bielefeld to"

BioBrick construction
As required, we submit our PIV-leaky-Marciano cloned in pSB1C3 plasmid. This high copy number plasmid backbone is carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene and can easily be sequenced by the iGEM labs.
We received it in the iGEM kit, linearized. As we tried to amplify it in E. coli TOP 10 culture we had the pleasure to visualize the expression of the monomeric Red Fluorescence Protein 1 which is replaceable by our Part.
Once our part in inserted between the two restriction sites, colonies recover a “normal” colour.
The figure below represents both maps of the pSB1C3 plasmid without and with our Part, the pIV-leaky-Marciano:
Here is the simplified protocol that we used before sending our Part:
Amplifying pSB1C3
Electroporation of pSB1C3 in E.coli TOP10
Isolation of the pSB1C3 plasmid
Restriction
Electrophoresis gel
Cloning the PIV-Leaky-Marciano Part in pSB1C3
Restriction of the pSB1C3 plasmid
PCR of the PIV leaky sequence
Digestion of the PCR product
Purifying and restriction of the PCR product and the pSB1C3
Insertion/Ligation
How is the part is expected to work ?
This BioBrick is expected to work under a variety of promoters such as pPro 30. This Part will provide you a way of secreting aspecific small peptides from the periplasm to the extracellular media.
This has been done before by UCL labs using cyclic peptides. To get more information about what you could do with this part, please check the following article.

Biology - From the unknown depths of the ocean to a chassis in iGEM
A specific chassis for specific environments: Seas & Oceans
==
A duo from the sea
==
As seen in the
overview
our biosensors should work optimally in native marine conditions (approximately 24-30 g/L NaCl). Moreover it has to attach to sponges and stick with them without disturbing the microbiome for as long as possible. Therefore it is necessary to use a bacterium naturally present on sponges, may it be an epibiont or a symbiont.
Unfortunately it is a condition for which no current chassis in iGEM is ready for. It is still worth noticing that an interesting first effort toward a marine chassis was initiated by UCL 2012.
To be up to the task the bacterium should:
be massively present on the sponge surface / avoiding being in an unfavourable position for food competition.
be found mainly in sponges / avoid spreading to species in contact with sponges.
be the phenotypically closest possible  to a known bacterium / avoid cell cultures difficulties.
To be up to the task the sponge should:
be numerously present in the ocean / avoiding putting species in danger.
be a natural host of the bacterium / avoid adapting its microbiome to the new epibiont.
be easily grown in a laboratory / avoid sponge culture difficulties.
The closest combination sponge/bacterium that could fit these requirements is

Figure 14: Best representations of the imaging of the 96-well plate for each condition. A2: 0 ng/mL commercial NGF, B3: 50 ng/mL commercial NGF, C4: 250 ng/mL commercial NGF, D4: 500 ng/mL commercial NGF, E4: 750 ng/mL commercial NGF, F4: 900 ng/mL commercial NGF.
Images were analyzed on ImageJ, and following results are shown in Figure 15.
Figure 15: (A) Percentage area of β-III Tubulin in each well and (B) number of stained nuclei in each well with no NGF, 50 ng/mL, 250 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 750 ng/mL and 900 ng/mL of commercial NGF added in our medium Neurobasal, B27, GlutaMAX. Each condition was compared to the control group without NGF. (ns: non-significant, *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, ***: p<0.001, ****: p<0.0001).
As we can see in Figure 15 (A), it was possible to observe a difference in the percentage of area taken by the β-III Tubulin. Indeed, it is possible to observe a significant increase in this percentage when commercial NGF is put at a concentration of 250 ng/mL or higher. The concentration of NGF seems to influence the growth of axons. It was possible to observe the same significant increase of cell number at a concentration of 250 ng/mL or higher (Figure 15 B). We can also see that at a concentration of 900 ng/mL, it seems that both the percentage of area taken by the β-III Tubulin and the number of cells decrease, even though it is not significant, we can hypothesize that at a high concentration of NGF, the receptor p75NTR is getting internalized, resulting in a decreasing number of available receptors.
It seems that commercial NGF has a dose-response effect on both the growth of neuronal axons and / or the survival of the cells. To determine in which category the NGF was affecting, we standardize the percentage area of β-III Tubulin compared to the number of cells.

23rd April 2009
Dear diary, today we had a brainstorm session, where we invited various people, including professors and experts in different fields of biology, chemistry and engineering. Sadly, only 3 people outside our team have come to our aid, yet we got some good ideas and feedback from them. We ended with 21 ideas, some of them being highly general and highly important (e.g. salt-water purification), some started as a joke (e.g. flashing dog poo brought an idea of fast degradation of dog excrements) and some were simply cool (e.g. flashing bacteria colony). In the end, we did not decide which project we shall do, but we decided to look at all the projects ideas and look at the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of each idea.
Yours in unity, TUD iGEM '09
17th April 2009
Dear diary, today we continued with looking over past projects. We also discussed the possible sponsors we might be able to recruit, including the town of Delft (by advertising them on the Jamboree as a town worth visiting) and various beer companies (specifically in case we would make a project involving beer). We also discussed the Teacher workshop in London (30th-31st of May), and since only one student can accompany the instructors, we decided to hold a fight among all students who would like to go, and last one standing would go (if this would not work, we'll just make a lottery). We also agreed to have a brainstorm regarding the project we will choose on the 23rd of April, where we will invite people to come and give remarks on our ideas after Daniel would give a short introduction of iGEM and our project ideas. Hopefully, enough people will come to make it worthwhile.
Yours in unity, TUD iGEM '09
7th April 2009
Dear diary, today we gave some presentations about iGEM projects of previous years. Some of them were pretty good (the Slovenian team of 2006 came up with the idea of making a sepsis-free cells, and the 2007 Slovenian team came up with ubiqiotinating methods against HIV infected cells) and some were just highly extensive with little concrete results (the 2008 Cambridge team attempt at making an artificial neuronal network for E.coli was not quite a success...) We also saw some 'cool' experiments (gladiator bacteria and generation marking in bacteria),"

Product Description
The Perfect Body Active Bacteria Lotion is the supplement needed to prepare your body for a new 'Perfect Body' body part. Simply apply the Active Bacteria Lotion to the part of your body you wish to exchange. Within 30 seconds the outer layer of your body's skin disintegrates. Afterwards you simply attach the new 'Perfect Body' body part by gently pressing it in place. The new body part adheres perfectly in just 60 seconds.
Technical Description
The Perfect Body Active Bacteria Lotion works with the help of a two-phase active component. In the first phase the extracellular cell array is disbanded by the local production of enzymes. This is followed by phase two in which the integrated hydrogel becomes active. The hydrogel is 100% bio-compatible with other cells and becomes part of the matrix that is integral to the tissue.

Could we model how much protein is required to kill rice blast?
Could we have a timer system as a killswitch?
Is there a heat change associated with fungal disease?
Could we use this heat change to turn on PAF production?
Could we engineer a bug to manufacture particles of different magnetic properties?
Can we change the structure of flagella on E. coli to change their swimming patterns/motions?
What is our end point/scenario? How can we work back from there?

Log entry
Today we had a meeting with Dr Nick Harmer who suggested we look at secretion systems in regards to the PAF idea. This would allow PAF to pass through the outer membrane of E.coli. He also put forward the idea of using a gram positive bacteria to get around the problem of the double membrane of the gram-negative E. coli.
There was a new idea created involving a novel method of spreading a killswitch throughout a population of fungi: a virus would act as a vector for a killswitch which would pass throughout a population of fungi via its natural sexual reproduction.. The virus could have the genes that codes for the production of PAF so when the viral genetic information is inserted into the fungus PAF would be expressed, killing the fungus. However our main concern thus far is how the public would perceive an idea like this.

Yuhan Wu
I am Yunhan Wu, a member of team NKU_China. Being an iGEMer has opened to me a brand new world of life science‒to design a life purposely, to test the possibility. The process of parts construction was just like treasure hunting‒searching for possible solutions out of weird errors and abnormal results.
Qinge Liang
Hi, I’m Qinge LIANG from Nankai University. As a student majoring in Biological technology, I deeply love synthetic biology as well as graphic design and want to explore them through lifetime. That is why I join the iGEM team. Being a member of team NKU_China is one of the most essential chapters during my college life. It is exciting to fight for the challenging work with partners varying in different backgrounds. Also, meeting all of you in the Giant Jamboree is the happiest thing for me.

Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ial growth, because the way that tumors grow is remarkably similar to mycelial proliferation: both incorporate substrate adjacent to their borders into their bodies, initially growing incredibly quickly but becoming “crowded out” by their own bodily projections as they grow ever larger.
We had to code a model into Python from the ground up. The first successful model that we devised was for unconstrained, 2-dimensional growth of mycelium. While this was an exciting development, we doubted this model’s utility for our purposes, because in our lab we’d been growing mycelium within molds (which are both constrained and 3-dimensional). So—could we tweak the 2-D model to more accurately reflect the lab’s objectives?
Luckily, the “3-tiered” growth pattern that we’d incorporated into our 2-D model provided the solution. The 3 tiers of the model were “grown”—sites that have grown mycelium—; “growthsites”—sites that will grow mycelium—; and “target”—sites that might grow mycelium. On each day of growth, each “grown” site has the opportunity to stake its claim on a “growthsite”/”target”. It becomes increasingly less likely that a new target site will be found by a grown site as the grown site finds itself more crowded by other grown sites (this accounts for the competition between hyphae in mycelial growth).
We’d found in the lab that 3-D growth generally does not occur in a mold until the mycelium has filled the base of the mold. Therefore, we inserted a provision that “target” sites could be neither “growthsites” nor “grown” sites until the area encompassed by the “grown” sites was equivalent to the base area of the mold. Only then could the mycelium grow upward. How could upward growth be modeled? Once the base of the mold had been filled, the model would change the parameters of the “target” sites: “target” sites could only be “grown” sites. This ensured that the mycelium could only grow on top of itself, and only upward. The competition provision—that a “grown” site could not secure a “target” site if that site had already been claimed as a “growthsite” by another “grown” site—was still intact during this new, upward period of growth. This was the most involved period of coding, and involved five separate attempts before a suitable sixth model was developed.
Results
The model has utility for anyone trying to grow mycelium within a mold. The user will input the size of"
HNU_China,2014,Team:HNU China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," In mordant mining industry, the application of biomining is rapidly increased, since it has the advantage of energy conservation and emission reduction. In biomining, microorganisms are mainly used as iron-oxidizer or sulfur-oxidizer to solubilize either target metals or the unwanted minerals that occlude target metals. Microorganisms has also been applied to recover metal from the abandoned ore or slags, and remediate Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). Fungi are the natural residents of AMD. With the ability of ferric iron oxidation and absorption, they can also take part into the biomining process and the following metal reduction operation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the fungi species that has been identified in the AMD, yet its utility in biomining has largely been ignored. Here, we genetically engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enhance its capacity of ferric iron oxidation and absorption. Meanwhile, we also introduce an inducible apoptosis system into the yeast so that unwanted or escape transgenic yeasts can be easily distroyed. Traditional method used to optimize microbial consortium for biomining is to inculate indigenous microflora into the reactor and screen for the better recombination. Compared with this so call “top down” method, our approach takes advantage of the powerful yeast genetic engineering to logically and systemically improve the desired traits.
We name our designed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ‘microbial miner’. This microbial miner  consists of two parallel systems, iron sensitive absorbing system and optogenetic apoptosis system.
II.Iron sensitive aborbing system
1.FET3 protein
High affinity iron uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires FET3 protein. Localized on the external cell surface, FET3 protein is proposed to facilitate iron uptake by catalyzing the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by O2, shown as below:
4Fe(II) + O2 + 4H+ → 4Fe(III) + 2H2O
The posttranslational insertion of four copper ions into FET3 protein is essential for its activity, thus linking copper and iron homeostasis together[fig.1]. In this model, Fe(III) is the substrate for the iron permease, encoded by FTR1 protein[fig2].
Fig.1 Ribbon diagram of FET3 protein. The T1, T2, and T3 copper atoms are shown in blue, green, and yellow, respectively. The three plastocyanin-like domains are shown as blue, green, and gold."

We added 1 microliter of template; Dr. Grose likes to add 2 microliters.
We did not use a master mix to combine our reagents with our template DNA. We added each reagent individually to each tube. Because we are pipetting such small volumes, there is a lot of room for error this way.
The Phusion program we used was set to an annealing temperature that was 1 degree too low for Phusion.
We did the PCR reaction one more time with Dr. Grose. Tomorrow we expect to see an enormous, fat, band!

The Ethics in Bacto-Aid
In our project’s components there are different ethical concerns. The bacteriocins in the hybrid silk raises questions about health and security: if one is to apply  genetically modified organisms (GMO’s) to a natural environment there will be insecurities. The problem is that we can never, with full certainty, know all possible consequences - but we can derive an estimated account of what will happen. The Precautionary Principle helps resolve this, but the interpretation of the Precautionary Principle differentiates according to one’s preferences and intuitions when it comes to emerging technologies and therapeutics. It basically states that it’s sometimes better to not apply a technology or therapeutics, when the foresight is uncertain. In the opposite situation, the argument is that it is sometimes better to take action, even when one does not have complete certainty on the possible consequences. The Precautionary Principle works as a tool for making decisions that can be rationally justified when uncertainty are present. Sometimes it functions as a rhetorical or epistemological tool, but in the field of bioethics it is mostly a tool for decisions KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik.  In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
Since bacteriocins have no effect on the humane cells, that we know of, we have decided to work with them Cotter, Paul D, R Paul Ross og Colin Hill (2013). “Bacteriocins - a viable alternative to antibiotics?” eng.

The different trials that a new form of therapeutics must withstand are still necessary for determining if it’s safe enough to apply in a natural environment.

Lecture 3: Sucrose2PHB - Optimization of Biobased Polymer production by Dr. Aljoscha Wahl & Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez
The third lecture was presented by two professors: Dr. Aljoscha Wahl and Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez. They talked about the biochemical engineering process of Sucrose2PHB for the optimization of bio-based polymer production.
Dr. Aljoscha Wahl holds an MSc degree in biochemical engineering from TU Dresden (Germany) and a PhD degree (biotechnology) from Forschungszentrum Jülich and Siegen University in Germany. Since 2008 he is assistant professor TU Delft in ‘Metabolic Systems Engineering’. His research group focuses on systems biology, i.e. identification of metabolic network interactions (kinetics and regulation) in different model organisms. Dr. Wahl collaborates with several leading European universities as well as international companies. In his teaching Dr. Wahl trains students in systems analysis – he teaches master (and post-master) courses for network analysis as well as systems biology. In the bachelor courses include programming and application of linear algebra to biotechnology.
Dr. Karel Olavarria Gamez studied Biology at the University of Havana before achieving his PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Neurosciences at the University of Chile, in 2012. The focus of his research is Bacterial metabolism, studying Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli. He has been working in different academic institutions in Cuba, Chile, Brazil and The Netherlands. At the moment, he combines metabolic modelling with genetic modifications in E. coli to understand and manipulate the catabolism of sugars under (an)aerobic conditions. The immediate applied outcome of his research could be the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates from sucrose in collaboration with Brazilian partners.

Week 6: Project planning, Gibson assemblies planning, First Matlab simulations
Wednesday, July 2nd
We have a clear organization of the different experiments we would like to perform.
We want to optimize quorum sensing to have non-leaky non-cross-talking constructs. We want to prevent cross-talk between integrases and check their dynamics with different quorum sensing promoters. Then we will test the XOR gate without production of LuxI, to check how it works without the loop, and we will finally test our final construct with the loop, hoping that the delay between GFP production and the possible second switching due to AHL production is long enough to have enough fluorescence.
The red line is our critical timeline. Numbers of days are very optimistic,therefore we multiply the whole timeline by 2. The stars stand for modeling inputs.
Tasks organization with critical timeline in red.
We have also clear plans for the Gibson assemblies to perform. As an example, here is the plan for regulator plasmids :

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .

By comparing the relative fluorescent intensity in Group 2 with that of Con2(Part:BBa_K2717016), we found the TGATG causes a 13.2% reduction to pink fluorescent intensity. That is to say, using TGATG can succeed in reducing the expression of following gene.

Integrated Plasmid.
A) Plasmid where GFP is directly linked to gdh by “tgatg” or haripin.
Previous experimental results show that gdh can bring growth advantages to the strains and implement screening simultaneously. TGATG can make the two genes combined by it express in a certain proportion. In addition, we found that the hairpin structure can bring a better coupling expression effect than TGATG by consulting the literature. Therefore, we constructed the pathway as follow: We combined the TGATG with gdh and we also couple up hairpin and gdh, in order to obtain high-yield strains that can automatically screen out highly expression, which initially confirms the design of the final project.

Experiment1 Stop-Start Codon Overlap: lac promotor +RBS B0034+gfp+TGATG+gdh+terminator. If the expression ability of the strain is strong enough, gdh will be expressed, whereby the strain gains a growth advantage. At the same time, due to the TGATG, the expression level of GFPhas been very high. Gdh promotes the metabolism of strains, which means it will express mor gdh to gain growth advantage, resulting in more GFP being expressed. Experiment2 HIRPIN: lac promotor +RBS B0034+gfp+hairpin structure+gdh+terminator.
We constructed 4 plasmids on the backbone named pUC-yder(Ampr). “Control-1” only expresses GFP, which can be used to verify the screening effect caused by gdh and the high yield features by TGATG. “Control 2” makes the GFP and gdh express respectively. This will confirm that the introduction"

Problem
It has been more than 50 years since Robert Guthrie suggested the first newborn screening program for phenylketonuria (PKU). To this day, avoiding foods containing high levels of phenylalanine remains the most important treatment factor for people with PKU. Almost every variety of food rich in protein must be avoided, this includes dairy products, meat, fish or chocolate. Despite the fact that strict diet is an effective way to prevent clinical presentation of PKU, it is still very difficult for the patients to implement it into everyday life. Only about half of the patients with PKU in Lithuania report to be following the required strict diet. Even those reporting to be following the treatment regime have an IQ that is about one half a standard deviation lower than their unaffected siblings or the population average. Moreover, people with PKU cannot get enough nutrients using conventional food sources and about 70-80 % protein intake must be comprised of low-phenylalanine supplements. There are situations in which getting the required mixture is problematic. For example, after Lithuania declared its independence in 1990, its supply of protein supplements was cut off due to an economic blockade. As a result, people born that year have clinical manifestations of PKU because proper treatment was not available. Finally, protein supplements are costly: in Lithuania a child under 18 years old is compensated for about 12 000 euros (13 160 US dollars) annualy.
Lithuania has some of the most experienced specialists in the region working both with newborn screening and the treatment of PKU. In 1975, Lithuania became the first country in the former Soviet Union to have started a newborn screening program for PKU. It has been a substantial achievement for that time period, as not even Moscow had a newborn screening program of its own. For comparison, our closest neighbours, Latvia and Estonia, started their screening program for PKU in the early 90s. Lithuania’s active involvement in the new treatment options for PKU and other genetic diseases was one of the reasons we chose it as our topic.

    There is a very famous book on war in China called Thirty-Six Strategies. One of the most important strategies mentioned in this book is called “Destroy the core figures and the gang will collapse”. This strategy is widely used in wars as we know that if you catch the general from your enemy side, you control the war.
VII Block the Escape Route
    In this case, the amount of warrior A and warrior B are the same. Warrior B is surrounded by warrior A so warrior B has no place to flee. Warrior A wins the game.
Discovery
Catch the thief by blocking his escape route
    We can see that warrior B is surrounded by warrior A at first. Although their amounts are equal, as warrior B has no where to escape, all of them eventually get killed by warrior A.
    There is a very famous proverb in China saying that “Catch the thief by blocking his escape route”, which is also from the book Thirty-Six Strategies mentioned above. There are countless wars in China as well as in the rest of war that contain this idea.
    The main method for historians to study historical events is by gathering materials and summarizing the strategies and theories from them. However, it is hard to test whether these strategies are true or not and under what conditions we can use them.
    Here, we use our game based on the simplified bacterial system and test many strategies our ancestors summarize. We find that most of the strategies are true but a few are not. Besides, we also get some novel conclusions that are seemingly counter-intuitive and some key points that are seemingly insignificant.
    Our system makes it possible to test the previous strategies and wisdom as well as discover new ideas.Therefore, we think that our game also provide a new angle for people to study history as they can use our system to mimic the events happened in history.
    Moreover, these discoveries are heuristic in helping us considering spatial effects on results of population interactions.
    My deer wiki viewer, you are intelligent and wise. If you pay attention, you will definitely find and create more strategies to win. When we provided this game to the kids during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum, they came up with many new ideas and some of the strategies we mentioned above are even ideas from them! We believe that there are many more values for us to discover, so come and play the game! (link to Solid game)

Decarboxylation
For the decarboxylation sub-project, the second week was entirely focused on literature research and the practice of basic laboratory techniques. 8 potential pathways were identified as potential candidates for naphthenic acid decarboxylation. The first of these would utilize only the University of Washington's ""PetroBrick"" (from iGEM 2011), consisting of the genes encoding the enzymes acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde decarbonylase (ADC). We have planned to verify the PetroBrick in the distribution plates and test its efficacy on naphthenic acids in the coming weeks. If this proves to be unsuccessful, we will begin investigating the alternative approaches, beginning with replacing AAR with carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) from Nocardia iowensis, a very unspecific reductase shown to work on structures resembling naphthenic acids. Failing this, the remaining pathways will be examined; however, the disadvantage in these pathways is their direct reliance on the success of the other steps, as the naphthenic acids must be degraded to the point of resembling branched-chain fatty acids (since all remaining pathways are related to fatty acid metabolism).
Denitrification
In the first two weeks of iGEM our group has focused on reviewing literature regarding the bioremediation of nitrogen groups attached to naphthenic acids. The most prevalent N heterocycle is carbazole, representing 75% of total nitrogen by mass. The upper pathway of carbazole biodegradation is catalyzed by the enzymes coded for by the car operon, CarA (CarAaAbAd), CarB (CarBaBb), and CarC. These enzymes convert carbazole to anthralinic acid. The lower pathway is catalyzed by the enzymes of the ant operon, antA, B, and C, yielding cathecol while releasing CO2 and NH3. The car and ant operons are both regulated by the Pant regulator which is induced by the protein, antR. CarAa also has its own promoter which is not induced by antR. We have also investigated an alternative pathway using CarA combined with an amidase (amdA) that selectively cleaves NH2 from an intermediate of the car pathway.

Externalization: Since we aim at providing synthetic biologists a user-friendly and helpful tool to design gene circuit, concrete biology entities should not be omitted. Abstract inputs and outputs will be substituted by specified substances chosen scrupulously in case cross talk or other mutual reactions undermine the functionality of designed gates. Although the choice of appropriate promoters, RBS, transcription factors can be intractable, a library of prototype substance for inputs and outputs together with experiment-based sequence design will enable us to build more complex gene circuits. Unrealizable complexity is far from the pursuit of synthetic biologists, based on wet-lab experiments, reasonable rules will be introduced into our software to preclude those gates heavily taxing engineering bacteria.
Library Enrichment: More effective and functional logic elements and sequences, even some Boolean gates with memory are expected to be added into our library. The trend of synthetic biologists designing more biobricks with logic functions and submitting them to Standard Biobrick Registry requires more sophisticated and elaborated parameters to measure the usability of designed gene circuits and biobricks. A user administration system or community may be helpful to setting standards for biobrick measurement and evaluation.
Accuracy: Improving the accuracy and predictability of our simulation is another critical work undergoing. Although stochastic simulation can shed great insight on the performance of designed gene circuits, more work can be done in the future. To analyze designed circuits more comprehensively and thoroughly, several different simulation methods will accompany stochastic simulation in our software.
Platform: Our software is developed to help biologists to construct functional gene circuits in lab. The complex nature of a biological system calls for collaboration between different tools. Although many software teams before have developed many computer-aided design tools, a platform for different tools to work together has not been well developed. In order to best design functional gene circuit, our software hopes to provide a platform where function-related tools can be integrated to work together.
Validation
General thesis
A convincing validation of BioBLESS includes two aspects. One is whether our simulation results correspond to the inputted truth table and the other one is whether the simulation results of designed gene circuits satisfy the experimental results which have been realized in lab. Furthermore, there are two factors that matter a lot in analysis part of BioBLESS, ACCURACY and APPLICABILITY. Accuracy describes how well our algorithms can simulate the realistic experimental results and applicability determines whether designed gene circuits from truth table can be applied in real experiments"

Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.

The goal was to let people       experience that bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms are not as       scary as they are sometimes portrayed to be. It did not take long       until word spread about the free massage, and soon people were       lining up! This gave us a chance to talk to people about our own       project and answer any questions they had!
Netherlands Biotechnology Conference
In April we had the chance to present the first outline of our       project at the Netherlands Biotechnology Conference in Wageningen.       Enthusiastically, we designed our first poster, t-shirt and       business cards. We met some members of current iGEM teams and even       had the chance to listen to the presentation of the Delft 2015 team       who won last year’s Grand Prize. During this day we made a lot of       contacts, tried to find sponsors and got valuable feedback about       our ideas. This feedback influenced our project immensely.
Utrecht Campus Party
At the end of May we have been invited to give a presentation       about CryptoGErM during the 4th edition of the European Campus       Party. We had the chance to explain our idea to people with very       different backgrounds and ages which at the end enthusiastically       participated in different workshops given by Luis, Marco and       Matthia.
By doing so we have been able to collect lots of feedback from       different research domains that helped the growing of the project.       Moreover, we also had the opportunity to listen to several other       interesting talks that helped us to improve our presentation       skills.
Radio
Jan van de Meide invited us to their radio studio to talk about       our project. Kathinka and Bente went to the studio for their first       live-radio performance. The radio show is aimed at a very general       public, so we got the challenging task of explaining the project in       an understandable manner. A major hurdle here was that we could not       use visual support, so we tried to make sure to be as clear as       possible. You can hear the result here (in Dutch).
Auction and BBQ
In September we organized an auction to raise money for our       project. After giving a presentation of the project itself, the       auction started. Every iGEM team member offered some service: lab       worker for a day, cake baking, babysitting, lawn mowing, a tour       through our lab etc. Researchers of the University of Groningen and       friends of our iGEM team members were very eagerly bidding for the       offers"

Given that the animation we tries to build are already complicated for us to handle (protein folding and interactions), we doubt that the computer can solve on its own. For now we will do our ways until the meeting with Merry, the expert on Maya, has taken place.
Week 16: August 12 - August 16
The computer Justin was using for his animation work complained the depletion of RAM. As a result he couldn't work effectively in the lab, so we agreed to let him work at home for he has a much powerful desktop. This means that except Monday he was not here with the rest of the lab, but he will show up on the group meeting next Monday to report upon his progress.
Our meeting with Cesar on Monday resulted in division of labour between Justin and me. From that time I will be working on the quantitative modelling (on what problem is yet determined) while Justin will be responsible for the animation (that is, the entire story telling). This supports the decision of letting him work at home, for now there is no need of cooperation between the two of us. For now I studied nDynamics per request of Cesar in case the quantitative modelling will be focused on spatial problems, and then moved on for the modelling of beta-lactamase, a request from Rai with newly found papers on its kinetics.
I also took some time doing readings on Fogler's book Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering. This is because my prior study of enzyme kinetics was still confusing, mostly because Cornish-Brown's book was not presented in the way consistent with my chemical engineering background. Fogler's book, especially Chapter 7, bridged the gap.
Week 17: August 19 - August 23
Meeting with Cesar resulted in the topic of the quantitative modelling being set to the interaction & interaction of TALE and DNA. During the meeting Justin reported his progress on his last movie, which he completed using key-frame. To this Cesar pushed us try harder with nDynamics and Justin responded by that he needs at least a week to study the techniques properly. On the same team our team leader Iain asked us to start writing our progress report and filling the wiki.
While Justin practised at home, I was working on the quantitative model. I adopted the approach of Markov chain by modelling 2D TALE-DNA binding on the strip, with discrete time and space. Since TALE is immobilized to the strip, with each time increment the DNA moves according to the movement rule specified by"

Light-Dependent Dormancy System
Dormancy Optimises the Efficiency of the Bacterial Solar Battery
Photosynthetic bacteria draw energy from sunlight to drive the fixation of carbon, implying that the bacteria are not able to carry out carbon fixation in absence of light. However, the bacteria constantly metabolise and the carbon fixed during time of exposure to light, will be used as an energy source for the cells. To circumvent this, a photocontrol system created by the UT Austin iGEM 2004 team was used in combination with the RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system native to E. coli. In this way, a light-dependent dormancy system was"

Team Activity Tests:
Today we had to deliver some data for Team Modeling. To calculate enzyme kinetics of our laccases the initial reaction speed has to be determined. With our usual approach using 0.1 U TVEL0 Laccase we couldn't accurately measure the first minute of reaction with ABTS because everything went to fast. So we cut down the volume of TVEL0 laccase from 140 µL to 35 µL (0.025 U) and measured the oxidizing potential of TVEL0 with different ABTS concentrations. The results are shown in Fig. 5.

Therefore, we constructed constitutively expressed merP, merT, merC (Fig 4). This design was expected to expand the capacity of our bioabsorbent and the baseline of Hg (II) concentration that our biokit can be applied to.
Figure 4: The overall structure of the facilitation module. The expression of MerT, MerP and MerC are amplified by T7 polymerase activated T7 promoter, which maximizes the bacterial Hg absorption capacity via actively transportation of mercury ions into cytosol. (To Read More…)
    Following function test showed that our whole-cell bioabsorbents can absorb more than 50% of 10-6 M Hg (II) in 120 minutes. Therefore, cells expressing certain metal binding peptide engineered via our method may act as whole-cell bioabsorbents that can decontaminate corresponding metal ion from aquatic environment. This design was successfully applied to another homolog of MerR family – PbrR, the lead responsive regulator (Fig 5). Our bacteria achieved an equivalent lead accumulation capacity as the mercury MBP, which proved validness of our engineering strategy.
Figure 5 Our method was applied to PbrR. (A) Sequence alignment of MerR and PbrR. MerR family TFs share a highly conserved homology at their metal binding domains (Brown et al., 2003; Hobman, 2007), which implies that our strategies of bioabsorbent engineering might be applicable to other cases of heavy metals.

    However, there is still a problem remained in the application of our bioabsorbent. It is not convenient to simply remove our bacteria from water or gather up them for recycling process after enough Hg (II) has been absorbed. Therefore, a time-delayed autoaggregation design was introduced. We chose Antigen43 (Ag43), which mediates visible autoaggregation conferred on the bacteria population in static liquid [11], as our autoaggregation effector. We designed a time-delayed device in which the expression of Ag43 was in response to the presence of mercury with a time delay (Fig 6). Besides time-delayed function, this design also acts an amplifier that can promote the expression level"

Transcription
Transcription rate can be affected by a variety of factors. However, it is well established that initiation of transcription is the major factor in determining overall rate of mRNA production. Transcription initiation is a process influenced by a number of key steps including: promoter escape (Kugel & Goodrich, 1998), binding of the RNA Polymerase onto the promoter, isomerization, and formation of the closed RNA Pol complex from the open complex (Hakkinen et al. 2013). In this model, we will assume that binding of the RNA polymerase is the rate determining step in transcription initiation, and thus the rate determining step of transcription as a whole.
Thus, our key assumptions for transcription are:
  1. Overall transcription rate is determined primarily by the amount of substrate (Etr1) bound to the DNA and the strength of the promoter. Maximum transcription rate occurs when all binding sites are filled.
  2. Promoter strength (in Polymerases per second) is a constant, and represents the rate of transcription at maximal expression.
  3. Thus, overall transcription rate is a function of a) maximum transcription rate, and b) the fraction of signalling molecules bound to their binding sites.
  4. For the constitutively expressed genes (Etr 1 and Etr2), we can assume that they are at maximal transcription for all t.
Finding parameters for EtnR1 (Constitutive Transcription)
In our final construct, Etr1 is placed under the control of promoter J23100, and Etr2 is placed under the control of a T7 promoter.
J23100, originally submitted by Berkeley iGEM2006 team, has been characterized on the Standard Registry .  This promoter has been characterized in terms of relative units. For example, looking at the database entry we can see that J23101 is 1791 times stronger than promoter J23112, which has a value of 1. Similarly, J23100 (our promoter), is 2547/1791 times stronger than J"

Plating Tests - Counting Colonies to Confirm Chloramphenicol Resistance
Over time, all cultures appeared to maintain antibiotic resistance, except for the negative control, which experienced no pressure during its growth. The following figures demonstrate the presence of resistant colonies over many hundreds of bacterial generations. Most importantly, the Hok-Sok culture grown without antibiotic was shown to maintain chloramphenicol resistance. This sets up one of our major conclusions: the Hok-Sok cassette is capable of maintaining a recombinant plasmid for an extended period of time.
Negative Control (No Pressure)

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html,"ata brought out a large vacuum desiccator and said, ""This contains dried Cypridina."" He explained to me that Cypridina, a small crustacean common in shallow coastal waters of Japan, emits light with an organic compound called luciferin and an enzyme, luciferase. He told me that luciferin is extremely unstable and rapidly decomposes in the presence of oxygen, and also that Professor Newton Harvey of Princeton University had been trying to purify luciferin for the past 20 years but had been unsuccessful. Professor Hirata asked, ""Could you purify and crystallize Cypridina luciferin for the purpose of structure determination?"" At the time, crystallization was the only practical way to prove the purity of a substance. Professor Hirata also told me that he could not give this project to a student pursuing a degree, because the outcome was so uncertain. I clearly understood the difficulty of the work. Since I was there for study, not for a degree, I replied, ""I would like to do my best.""
This did, indeed, turn out to be a very difficult crystallization. It took me ten months of extremely hard work to extract, purify, and crystallize the luciferin. When I finally succeeded, I was so happy I couldn't sleep for three days. Since the end of the war, my life had been dark, but this gave me hope for my future. Probably the greatest reward I gained was self-confidence; I learned that any difficult problem can be solved by great effort. With the crystallization accomplished, my stay in Nagoya was extended one year to study the structure of Cypridina luciferin (Fig. 3). Our first paper on Cypridina luciferin was published in 1957, although the chromophore structure of luciferin remained to be elucidated.

To America
In the spring of 1959, I received a letter from Dr. Frank Johnson (Fig. 2, right) of Princeton University inviting me to work at his laboratory. When Professor Hirata heard about my plan to go to Princeton, he awarded me a doctoral degree for my Cypridina work, even though I wasn't enrolled as a doctoral student. Prof. Hirata knew having a doctorate would double my salary at Princeton. I was completely surprised, and I accepted his"

As our project involves the use of dcas9 and sgrna, safety considerations needed to be made while designing our project.
Safety Report
Abstract
Endonucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, though known for their potential in synthetic biology to result in double-stranded breaks in the DNA, allowing for efficient insertions of target mutations, harbour the danger of creating a gene drive which can affect and propagate in the wild-type strain species. We, uOttawa iGEM team, will demonstrate that despite using dCas9, our project does not consist of a gene drive.
Project description:
The goal of this project is to overcome the lack of transcription factors when designing genetic networks in yeast. We use dCas9 machinery (including gRNA) to assess the possibility of designing a NOR gate.
Guarantee of no release:
All project parts remain strictly in the laboratory. No substances are produced by our network. The successful construction of our network is be assessed by measuring fluorescence due to GFP using a flow cytometer. Undesired yeast strains are sterilized.
Safety of project:
The project is safe. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is modified through basic transformations.
Unlike Cas9, dCas9, which is used in this project, has deficient endonuclease activity, because the protein domain conferring endonuclease activity is deleted from the full Cas9 protein. Thus, dCas9, cannot break double-stranded DNA, an otherwise essential step in the synthesis of a gene drive. In this experiment, dCas9 is used in combination with guide RNA to bind to a promoter site to regulate the expression of gene via steric hindrance.
Below are proofs from literature:
""We have shown recently in bacterial and human cells that the endonuclease domains of the Cas9 protein can be mutated to create a programmable RNA-dependent DNA binding protein (Qi et al., 2013). Targeting of catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) to the coding region of a gene can sterically block RNA polymerase binding or elongation, leading to dramatic suppression of transcription in bacteria.""
“Here, we show that dCas9 can be used as a modular RNA-guided platform to recruit different protein effectors to DNA in a highly specific manner in human cells and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both repressive and activating effectors can"

Discourse
Approaching the public
From the offset we wanted to tackle a problem raised to us by the public. We sent out an initial questionnaire to the public to ask what big problems they wanted solving and to hear about what they thought about synthetic biology. We took the questionnaire to schools, to the streets and to our friends. Examples of their suggestions for the applications of synthetic biology included bacteria which:
Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Target and kill cancerous cells
Help treat Alzheimer's disease
Produce energy
Sew up holes in clothes
Produce teeth glue
Indicate how long someone has been dead
Combat antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance
Of the responses to our initial survey, 40 of the 86 were related to Medicine and Health. Inspired by a talk given by Professor Dame Sally Davies: “A ticking time bomb: the infectious threat of antibiotic resistance” and the public responses, antibiotic resistance stood out to us as an issue we could tackle with synthetic biology. To confirm that we were on the right track, we approached the public again with the question: To what extent do you feel that antibiotic resistance is a problem that needs addressing in society today? This graph clearly shows that, according to the general public, antibiotic resistance is an important problem that needs solving.
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
It was our team member George Driscoll’s work at the Hornsey UTI clinic in London which helped us to select UTIs as a specific cause to focus on. Due to the unaesthetic nature of the infection, it often receives less attention with regard to research. Having worked in the clinic, George knew first-hand that UTIs are a problem for a significant proportion of the population, and that resistance to the antibiotics used to treat UTIs is growing. In fact the clinic’s primary treatment method is long, high-dose courses of multiple antibiotics to overcome long-lasting infections despite the clinic’s awareness that their treatment choice may lead to further resistance.
UTIs are the most common healthcare-acquired infection. Among UTIs acquired in the hospital, approximately 75% are associated with a urinary catheter . 2
Interaction with nurses
To learn more about catheter associated UTIs (CAUTIs), we visited the Churchill Hospital in Oxford. Our first visit to the hospital was to the outpatient clinic during which we spoke with Jan Harris, one of the nurses on the ward. Jan explained to us the current treatment of UTIs. The protocol for treatment is to first take a urine"

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!

Miguel Pitarch Mocholí
Hi everybody!!! I’m Miguel, I was in the 2009 Valencia iGEM Team. The experience was so good that I’m really happy to repeat it again. Currently I’m studying a master degree in Mechanical Engineering. I like iGEM because to bring out a project with limited resources you have to let your creativity flows and work as a handyman.  If you want know more about me don’t be shy and ask me in the European meeting or maybe in the MIT.

Hello, my name is Maria and I am a student of marine science in UCV from Valencia (Spain). I wanted to participate in the IGEM because I had much attention and great enthusiasm to create new tools that can help us in future to improve our circumstances. I also seemed very interesting to work with students from other scientific branches.
David Hervás Marín
Hello, I'm a biologist specialized in genetics. Currently I'm studying a master degree in Biostatistics. I like developing new ideas and thinking of original ways to solve problems, so when my friend David Fuente told me about iGEM it was a no-brainer to join the team. See you in Amsterdam!
David Fuente Herraiz
Hi, I'm a chemical engineer with some experience in industrial processes and separation operations. I'm now studying a master course in Biostatistics. I like interdisciplinar projects, so iGEM is a unique opportunity to lock together different degree students in a room to see what comes out from it! I have learned a lot and if possible I would like to repeat the experience next year. Enjoy"

Finally, the protein was expressed successfully.
We added 5μl of the bacterial restored into the LB containing 5μl of ampicillin to the final concentration of 1mM. And then, we incubated them in the shaker at the temperature of 37 centigrade, working for 14-16 hours.
Experimental conditions as follow：
1. Incubate at 37 centigrade, until OD ranges from 0.6-0.8(4-5h).
2. Incubate at 4 centigrade, 220rpm, for 30mins.
3. Add 1mL IPTG to the final concentration of 1mM.
4. Incubate at 16 centigrade for 12-16h.
The purification of protein:
We used eppendorf to make bacterial deposited, working at 4000rpm for 20min. Use 15mL MCAC0 to suspend bacterial.
After resuspending, we used high pressure to break the cells.
In order to get the recombinant protein with the higher purity, the recombinant protein was purified through Ni-chelating affinity chromatography.
The results are as follow:

Andy and Alan worked in the Physics labs today, measuring the intensity of our light box, and calculating the W/cm^2 that the plates placed inside the light box will be receiving. We need to know this so we can look at how intensity impacts upon the rate at which Killer Red and Killer Orange kill cells.
Today’s lab team - Eloise, Emily, Hannah and Dan - started using a new method of cloning called Modular Cloning, which we intend to use codon optimised Killer Red and Killer Orange to submit to the registry. They also used an adjusted digestion and ligation method to cut RFP from template backbones, ran on a gel, then transformed for overnight incubation.

The ligated Killer Red parts from yesterday were mini prepped, and the successful Cas9 colony was put in overnight incubation. We re-transformed the unsuccessful transformations from yesterday, as only the plasmids with chloramphenicol and tetracycline backbones were successful.
The successful Killer Red ligations were sent off for sequencing today to check that we made the part in the correct order sequence.

Today marked a few additions to the modelling team due to the shift in project aims: Joel is continuing working on the KillerRed model, Andy will begin working on a hen egg Lysozyme model and Leanne will begin working on a bovine DNAse1 model. The current program of choice is SimBiology, an extension app on MATLAB, but that may change over the coming weeks depending on how compatible it is with our model aims.
We also released a new ‘Desert Island… Science?’ interview today, featuring Dr John Love. Dr Love is an associate professor of Synthetic Biology at the University of Exeter, and is our primary supervisor for iGEM.

Integrated Practices
Our human practice efforts were incorporated throughout our design. Initially knowing little about the antibiotic field, we conducted several interviews with experts to gain a better understanding. Dr. Mendelson, London, and Levy all provided great insight into the complexity of antibiotic use in today's world
A common theme that was present in all expert interviews was antibiotic over-usage. The cost efficiency and availability of antibiotics makes it appealing for medical professionals to prescribe, especially if the diagnosis of the patient isn't yet clear. This is particularly prevalent in developing nations. Additionally, their is a large patient demand for antibiotics, putting additional pressure on medical professionals to supply.
Fortunately, we took Dr. Mendelson's work and integrated it into our project. Besides researching infectious diseases, Dr.Mendelson advocates for clear use surrounding antibiotic resistance (AR). He thinks that clear language such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is necessary to help the population understand the antibiotic epidemic. Hence, this website only uses terms such as ""antibiotic resistant"" or ""drug resistant"" infection; these terms, claims Dr.Mendelson, are what most of the population can understand. Below we outline the expert interviews we conducted and our main takeaways.
Health and public policy
Interview with Dr. Mendelson
Dr. Mendelson’s research revolves around Infectious diseases in countries with high rates of antibiotic resistance (AR). He focuses on models of antibiotic stewardship, antibiotic prescription and response, hospital collaborations and the use of antibiotics in surgical pathways. Most his work centers around international policy development for infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance strategy.
Dr. Mendelson highlights how there are many players in the antibiotic game, not just scientists or doctors. Finance, food production and the general public are often in tandem with the science behind antibiotic resistance (AR). He stressed the importance of education and awareness as well as individual and national responsibility to use antibiotics in a poised manner. Using language that is clear such as ""antibiotic resistance"" vs ""antimicrobial resistance"" is also essential to the fight. Dr. Mendelson thinks that carefully planned use of antibiotics will be a lasting solution in addition to new therapies being created to fight bacteria.
Additionally, we asked for suggestions and things to consider when molding our project. Dr. Mendelson proposed that we"

Subsequently, we characterized three clones of each strain by qRT-PCR and by monitoring the RFP fluorescence in different growth stages. In addition to this, we did fluorescence microscopy of exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1).
For qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2), E. coli cells were harvested at an OD600nm of ca. 0.6 (exponential growth phase) and after 5 – 6 h when the OD600nm had reached approximately 2 (stationary phase). The cells were incubated over night and a third sample taken the next morning ( > 20 h incubation, OD600nm was ca. 2 – 3). The relative mRNA levels of rfp were normalized to the rpoA levels. Then, the fold change (∆∆CT) of the promoters compared to promoter 1 (the weakest) was calculated for each phase. The fold enrichments obtained for different growth phases could not be compared since the CT values determined for rpoA suggested a generally altered transcription during the different growth stages.
Plate reader measurements served to determine the RFP fluorescence. The wells of a titer plate were inoculated with the clones and the RFP fluorescence and the OD600nm measured over the time. (Fig 3).
Results
To characterize the promoters, we transformed E. coli DH5α with the promoter parts present in the plasmid backbone BBa_J61002 . As an empty vector control lacking a promoter and RFP, we used E. coli cells transformed with BBa_B0034 (an RBS) in plasmid Backbone pSB1A2. Subsequently, we characterized different clones (Clone 1 – 3) of these strains by qRT-PCR and by monitoring the RFP fluorescence in different growth stages. In addition to this, we did fluorescence microscopy of exponentially growing cells of clone 2 of each strain (Fig. 1). We noticed that the cells of the control strain did not fluoresce, while all strains transformed with a promoter plasmid exhibited a red fluorescence. The cells with promoter 1 and promoter 2 seemed to fluoresce less than those of promoter 3 and promoter 4.

Maybe if the algorithm goes wrong, or performs weird compared to our knowledge on synthetic biology or even common sense, users can go to Q/A Community to seek detailed discussion about their interested biobricks and report bugs of our application. So Q/A Community can be the reinforcement of our evaluation system. We evaluate both automatically and manually.
BASE could evaluate a biobrick at part and device level. In ordered to evaluate at higher level, we also improved its core function. We collected more data about biobricks at system level, and merged them into our MySQL database. However, the warning is that the evaluating process may lack accuracy because the additional data about biobricks at system level is too little. The core scoring algorithm is similar but we re-coded it in JavaScript (Node.js) instead of Perl, which can work better if our site has larger visitor volume and combine better with the frontend code (using framework like React.js and Vue.js).

TEC-Costa_Rica,2016,Team:TEC-Costa Rica#Project#System#Response_-_-_TEXT.html," the TEV activity by a conditional protein splicing, as mediated by inteins, is a powerful tool due to its high specific activity and artificial regulation within the cell. We consider protein splicing by inteins the proper strategy to regulate the reconstitution of the split TEV in a post-translational reaction, specified in Figure 1.
Figure 1. TEV activation.

The intein mechanism provide the reconstitution of the TEV mediated by a post translational reaction, where the two split inteins must find each other to start the reaction. Protein trans-splicing consist in the reaction of two split inteins fragments expressed separately; however when they find each other they make a four-step reaction to fuse the exteins components and reconstituted the intein at the same time (Topilina & Mills, 2014; Stevens et al., 2015). We decided to use this approach due to the fact that the reaction of the inteins will we limited by the release of one intein fragment associated to a split TEV from the dCas9 chassis, nonetheless the intein will ensure the reaction upon release.
Upon releasing the split TEV from the dCas9, we needed a fast reaction leading to a reduction on the signal detection time. Sonntag and Nootz (2011) argue that the intein mechanisms required for the split TEV reconstitution is a trans-splicing intein; the natural existing split DnaE is highly specific and has a spontaneous activity leading this split intein into a powerful tool for inner cell regulation. Using this strategy, we wanted to make a two-component system with the lower time between detection and the cleavage of the TEV linker site fussing the GFP with the quencher.
2. Quenched-GFP
Our response system is based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which is a mechanism that describes energy transfer between two chromophores; a donor chromophore is able to transfer its excitation energy to a second chromophore or acceptor (Lemke & Deniz, 2016). This system highly depends on the distance between the donor and the acceptor molecule and an ideal FRET couple should have a large spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorption (Ganesan et.al, 2006).
We use a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as the donor chromophore of our system, which generates high fluorescence yields and low autofluorescence because of its absorption and emission characteristics. Since Genevan et.al (2006) modified an Enhanced Yellow Flu"

A Brief Talk on Safety and Ethics of Synthetic Biology
For the numerous movie fans, scientists use high-tech methods to create creatures and even clone humans, as well as terrorists manufacture bio-weapons to spread, are not fresh stories. However, artificial life forms have become true in reality. In 2010, according to the genome sequence information, Craig Venter , an American scientist , designed , synthesized and assembled Mycoplasma mycoides genome , and then he transplanted the genome into a mycoide cell of a goat. Eventually he obtained a fully artificially synthesized microorganism called Synthia ,in other words he created the first artificial unicellular organism of the whole world. Barack Obama, the president of the USA , instructed President's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to assess potential benefits and risks of synthetic biology on medical ,environment and biological defence . Why does the USA government react so intensely on this problem? And what is synthetic biology?
Synthetic biology ,which was originally put forward in 1911 on some famous science journals, for example, Science and The Lancet [1], was unable to be defined uniformly because its wide range of related fields. But one thing is for sure, that the synthetic biology is a subject that uses physical and chemical methods, follow biological thoughts and utilize engineering means to solve energy, material, health and environment problems by artificially design and build unnatural biological systems. From the view of genetics, synthetic biology is a series of combinations of genetic methods ,including both top-to-bottom methods and bottom-to-top methods. An important concept of synthetic biology is using modular elements in engineering. As we can see in the picture 1 ,standard elements assemble a device ,devices assemble a system ,like that bricks assemble an architecture.
（Pic 1. The Diagrammatic Sketch of Standardization of biobricks）
Fascinatingly fast developments in genomics, material science and computer science promote considerable progress in synthetic biology. Keasling, a professor of chemical engineering department in UCB, used genes from bacteria, yeast and plant (Artemisia Annua) to conduct assembly ofmultiple genes and metabolic pathways, as well as precise regulations on multiple genes. The strains reconstructed have much higher synthesis capacity of Artemisinic acid, which is excepted to lower the cost of antimalarial drugs. In 2002, Wimmer, an expert of virology in NYU, announced"

Construction
The TEF promoter, the Cup1 gene, and the Ura3 terminator are ligated together, integrated into vox-ura3-vox system by homologous recombination. 5-FOA plate helps us to screen the correct cell. Similarly, the LIMT gene and the Ura3 nutritional label are integrated into the synthetic chromosome V, too.
PCR is used to check if we successfully completed the molecular biology construction.

Fig.5-1 the results of PCR. We use 2k plus Ⅱ as the marker. On four parallel lanes of the gel (number 1,2,3,4), run were four set of DNA molecules of known size (319bp for number 1, the LIMT; 186bp for number 2 and 3, the Cup1; 3114bp for number 4,the whole sequence contained Cup1). From the DNA band of number 1, we could analyze that vika has been expressed to delete the Cup1 and its terminor, so we can get the LIMT. From the DNA band of number 2, 3 and 4, we could delightedly prove that the fragments (TEF promoter, Cup1 and ura3 terminator) have successfully transformed to synthetic chromosome V.
