Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#HP#Legal_-_-_TEXT.html,"rM is the shipping of Bacillus subtilis spores containing sensitive information across borders.
European legislations
Firstly, we were interested in the European legislations regarding the shipping of GMOs; it was found out that several European Countries, including the Netherlands, follow the regulations and guidelines suggested by the Cartagena Protocol for the transboundary shipment of Genetically Modified Organisms.
But what is it the Cartagena Protocol?
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international agreement on biosafety as a supplement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, whose principal aim is “to ensure the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms resulting from modern technology that may have adverse effects on biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health” [2]
This protocol entered into force during September 2003, and it currently has 170 parties (167 United Nations member states, the State of Palestine and the European Union) [3] . However, other countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Argentina have not signed this agreement.
This protocol states in its Article 18 [4] (Handling, Transport, Packaging and Identification) the suggested documentation associated with the shipping of transboundary shipping of GMOs in order to avoid adverse effects. Such documentation includes:
Identify them clearly as Genetically Modified Organisms
Specify any extra requirements for the safe shipping
Include the contact information to whom the GMOs are consigned
Transatlantic regulations
Secondly, we started to look for the current international legislations and guidelines for the transatlantic shipment of GMOs.
We found out that such shipment is not regulated by just one International Institution, since countries around the world follow different legislations and guidelines between each other; for example, most European Countries, as mentioned above, follow the guidelines suggested by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, however, some countries such as the United States, Argentina, Canada, posses their own legislations for the shipment of GMOs.
Despite the fact that the legislations and guidelines between countries may be different between each other, e.g. Parties and No-Parties of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the World Health Organization, an international and neutral Institution, launched in 2015 the Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances 2015-2016 [5] to “provide practical guidance to facilitate compliance with applicable international regulations for the transport of infectious substances and patient specimens by all modes of transport, both nationally and internationally”
CryptoGErM must take into account, those three different guidelines"

Description
From information theory to our project
As we can learn from Wikipedia, information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information which was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948. The theory has developed amazingly and has found applications in many areas. It’s not exaggerated to say that we can see the power of information theory all the time.
Based on this, we would like to explore something originally in biological pathway using information theory.
Our project has a close connection with two terms in information theory, mutual Information and channel capacity. And what are they?
In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the ""amount of information"" (in units such as bits) obtained about one random variable, through the other random variable. The concept of mutual information is intricately linked to that of entropy of a random variable, a fundamental notion in information theory, that defines the ""amount of information"" held in a random variable. You can understand it trough from the figure below.
Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables X and Y can be defined as:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = \sum\limits_{y \in Y} {\sum\limits_{x \in X} {p\left( {x,y} \right)\log \left( {\frac{{p\left( {x,y} \right)}}{{p\left( x \right)p\left( y \right)}}} \right)} } \]
And the formula can also be proofed:\[I\left( {X;Y} \right) = H\left( X \right) - H\left( {X\left| Y \right.} \right) = H\left( Y \right) - H\left( {Y\left| X \right.} \right)\]
From the formula you can easily think that mutual information is the reduction of uncertainty in $X$ when you know $Y$.
And when you understand the mutual information, you can easily understand what the channel capacity is.
In electrical engineering, computer science and information theory, channel capacity is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a"

OPEN-ENDED ACTIVITY
At the 85th anniversary of Beijing Institute of Technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we played some interesting biology games and we told students what synthetic biology is. Then we introduced our former projects to audiences and they can had a good understanding about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we improved our project through the suggestions given by students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our better inducers.
TEAM UP WITH YAN’AN UNIVERSITY
This year，we invited four students from Yan'an University to be our team members to design and implement our project together. In this process, they not only expanded their knowledge of synthetic biology and improved their experimental skills, but also learned how to build an iGEM team.  All those will help them to establish an iGEM team next year on their own. More importantly, we were getting closer to the idea of iGEM and spread synthetic biology to more people.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phases of our project, we organized University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big conference about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the increase of popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accept one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard sweetener, after that running the test would be more reasonable.
EXPERIENCE SHARING IN ITCCC

Furthermore, as a result of the irregular expression levels controlled by the constitutive promoters, it was decided to place the relB gene under control of a tightly regulated uniform promoter, as the modelling had established the necessity of this.

Expression by the Mnt- and Penl-Regulated Promoters
To verify the correct assembly of the strong constitutive promoter, BBa_J23102 , the part was sequenced using the iGEM primer VF2 and a self designed reverse primer , located in the ho1 gene of the photocontrol device. Through this, it was discovered that a plasmid fragment coinciding with the length of the promoter and the BioBrick prefix, had been removed from the plasmid, as illustrated on Figure 1.
Figure 1. A fragment containing the strong constitutive promoter and the BioBrick prefix with the EcoRI (E) and XbaI (X) restriction sites had been removed from the plasmid containing the photocontrol device.
The original sequencing data can be found here In the light of this finding, it was investigated whether the Mnt-regulated or PenI-regulated promoter was suitable to control the expression of the photocontrol device.

Transposon Hotspot
During the cloning of GFP, BBa_I13504 under control of the LacI-regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter, BBa_R0011 , it was observed that the part yielded three bands when digested with EcoRI and PstI, see Figure 1. One band was observed at 2000 bp, corresponding to the pSB1C3 backbone, one band at around 950 bp, correlating with the expected length for the part, and a third band with a length around 1200 bp.
Figure 1. Agarose gel showing the digestion of the composite part by EcoRI and PstI. Three bands where observed. The bands at 2000 bp and 950 bp corresponded to the backbone and inserted part respectively. The third band at 1200 bp was unexpected.
To ascertain the reason for the band with the unaccountable length, the part was sequenced using the iGEM primers VF2 and VR. The sequencing revealed a repeated sequence inserted between the LacI-regulated, lambda pL hybrid promoter and the GFP reporter, encoding a transposable element. The cloning was repeated, with a similar result. Given that a similar part , differing only in the RBS sequence, had"

UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#HP rapport_-_-_TEXT.html,". In the later years, the reasons for colonizing and expanding were largely due to political manifestation of power. There are several different modern views on imperialism, one of them were defined by psychologist Alfred Adlers. He explained imperialism as ""der Wille zur Macht"" meaning that the main driving force of human actions is the will for power. This view was first suggested by well-renowned philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and has later been supported by philosophers and political scientists among others (Miyasaki, 2004). While there are many potential reasons for landing space missions on Mars, it may simply be that it is an inevitable consequence of an essential human need to expand its power and to explore its abilities as suggested by Adlers' theory.
Part 2
What are the main arguments for and against colonization?
In this chapter we will explore colonization of Mars in a democratic perspective. As concluded in the previous chapter, the opinion of and the support from the democratic citizen is a crucial motivator and a determining factor for whether or not humanity decides to colonize Mars.
Therefore we will in this chapter zoom into the typically used arguments for and against colonization and take the perspective of the global citizen as a decisionmaker in the democratic society. We do that because we consider colonising Mars or not is a political decision that should be made by citizens, at least if it is funded by their tax-money, but also in terms of the making of international space laws regarding colonization, bioethics and biosafety.
In order to explore the arguments for and against colonization, we will use the well known British philosopher Stephen Toulmin's argumentation model to analyse some of the most common publicly used arguments for and against colonization of Mars. We will therefore start by explaining Toulmin's basic model of argumentation and after that we will introduce selected arguments and analyse them.
Toulmin's argumentation model
Stephen Toulmin is an academic figure overlapping classical philosophical and rhetorical disciplines. His argumentation model is focusing on practical argumentation, which makes it a hybrid between rhetorical argumentation, focused on convincing an audience and formal logic, concerned with logical validity (not to confuse with truth).
Toulmin argues that Aristotle's model of argumentation is insufficient and that the elements within the model needs to be structured, renamed and more factors need to be taken into consideration (Toulmin, 1958, s. 96). He proposes a model with three basic elements that can be considered the skeleton or basic structure of any argument. The three element will always be present in an argument (while not always being explicitly presented) (Toulmin, 1958"
NKU_China,2016,Team:NKU China#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," forward primer of insertion 2, and also can be partially added to both of them. Taking the addition homologous sequence to the reverse primer of insertion 1 as an example, design the primer according to Figure 2.
Figure 2: Design of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and the forward primer of insertion 2
Notice: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the Tm of primers, the homologous sequence of vector end should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.
Lastly, design the reverse primer of insertion 2 and the forward primer of insertion 3. Design principles are similar to that of the reverse primer of insertion 1 and forward primer of insertion 2 respectively (see Figure 2).
3. PCR amplification of insertions
Insertions can be amplified by any polymerase (Taq DNA polymerase or other high-fidelity polymerases). It will not interfere with the recombination efficiency whether there is A-tail in the PCR products or not, which will be removed during recombination and missing in the final construct.
Take a small amount of products and run agrose electrophoresis after PCR to confirm the yields and specificity of amplification. Exnase MultiS is compatible with most PCR reactions. As a result, PCR products can be directly applied to recombination reaction without further purification if the PCR templates are not circular plasmids which share the same antibiotic resistance with the cloning vector.

The recommended amount of DNA for recombination reaction is 0.03 pmol per DNA fragment (including the cloning vector and insertions). Their corresponding mass can be roughly calculated according the following formula:
The mass of each fragment required = [0.02×number of base pair] ng (0.03 pmol)
For example, when cloning three insertions of 0.5 kb, 1 kb and 2 kb to a 5 kb vector, their corresponding DNA mass needed is as follows:
Linearized cloning vector: 0.02×5000 = 100 ng
0.5 kb insertion: 0.02×500"

I looked back at her, I laughed too. I was really surprised by the size difference between France and the United States. I realized that at McDonald's, the smallest size in the United States corresponds to the largest size in France. This was unbelievable!

Safety in iGEM
Safety and unnecessary exposure to hazardous reagents was the core interest and drive of our project. As artists that are navigating the laboratory space and learning about chemical hygiene protocols, we were surprised to discover that many soil testing kits require the use of toxic materials with little guidance on how to handle and dispose of the materials. After learning how to properly work with these reagents, we began brainstorming alternative means of reducing exposure.
The main risk in our project was exposure to hazardous reagents in the La Motte kit, which were used following chemical hygiene protocol under supervision. Students worked in designated areas with access to eyewash stations, fire blankets, first aid and spill kits. Safety gear such as gloves, surgical masks and goggles were required when needed. A plan was made for handling and waste management before reagents were utilized and team members were trained on interpretation of MSDS and chemical label information.
About our lab: The Bio Art Lab was founded in 2011 and is directed by Suzanne Anker, Chair of the BFA Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts.  We employ the tools and techniques of science to create works of art. Our laboratory is bio level 1 and is equipped with laminar flow hoods, chemical fume hoods, as well as open bench spaces. Our lab technicians follow OSHA and EPA standards. In our state (NY) the NIH guidelines have been recognized as law.

Potential Impact
“With great power comes great responsibility.” - Uncle Ben (and Voltaire)
On the basis of this quote we thought about other possible applications of E. cowli. Not only could the isolation and successful production of the sMMO have a great impact on the greenhouse effect, but it could also facilitate addressing problems of safety, pollution and energy.
If the sMMO is immobilized and introduced into the cow’s rumen the worldwide methane emissions could be reduced by 164 million tons, based on a total number of 1.5 billion cows on Earth. In effect, this equals 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide! More pictorially, our application can compensate the impact 2.8 million cars, assuming that one car releases approximately 1,800 t of carbon dioxide annually. See our example calculation .
In addition to the effect on the world's climate, the application in cows has another positive impact: safety. Earlier this year, for instance, high amounts of methane accumulated in a cow barn in Germany and a single spark caused the building to blow up [1]. By reducing the methane emissions of cows incidents like this could be prevented.
As the sMMO is able to degrade a broad variety of substrates such as one of the major water pollutants, the industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), our project can serve as a foundation for a new approach of biological water treatment or environmental care in general [2].
One could also exploit the ability of the sMMO to convert methane to methanol: Methane can serve as a source of energy, but due to its gaseous state it is very difficult to transport compared to liquid methanol. So far, methane is chemically converted to methanol for transportation and later on further to components of diesel fuel and gasoline or to propylene and ethylene, important precursors of important chemical substances. Using the sMMO to oxidize methane is a much more economical and eco-friendly approach for utilizing methane as a resource for energy production [3]. Hence, our project has a huge significance not only for climate but also for a wide-ranging spectrum of other problems and opportunities. Therefore, the isolation and successful expression of the sMMO has a huge impact on various areas and provides multiple possibilities for application.

Figure 2. Proportions of colonies of each colour following transformation with the mutated amilCP sequences.
Results: Common Mutants
Mutants of each colour were selected for sequencing. It was found that all coloured mutants (blue, purple, pink and green) only had single nucleotide substitutions (SNPs), whereas mutants that were white, and had thus lost amilCP function, tended to have deletions resulting in frameshift mutations. Several different SNPs were found to cause the same colour, with some common ones that result in purple, pink or green phenotypes summarised in Figure 3.
Some colonies appeared to have the same colour as the wild type, however upon sequencing, it was discovered that there were several mutations that changed the nucleotide sequence, but did not seem to alter the function of amilCP. Most of these were later found to have no effect on the amino acid sequence.
Figure 3. Common mutations of amilCP resulting in a change of colour.  The wild type amilCP amino acid sequence is shown, with the mutated residues in bold. The 3 mutants that were submitted as parts (BBa_K1996003-005) are indicated by asterisks.
We were unable to find an objectively darker blue mutant, however, we have submitted pink, purple and green mutants (Figure 4) (BBa_K1996003-005 respectively). The colour in the purple mutant, like the wild type, can be observed after incubation overnight, whereas the pink and green mutants take up to 2-3 days to express the colour.
It was observed that wild type amilCP tends to decrease in vibrancy following multiple restreaks or after storage at 4˚C, something that was also observed in the pink and green mutants. However, the purple mutant retained its colour both on plates, and when inoculated into liquid media.
Figure 4. Purple, pink and green mutants compared to the wild type.
Protein was extracted from 50mL of culture and resuspended in 0.5mL TE buffer.
Results: Spectrums
Protein was extracted and a spectrum scan from 300-750nm was performed. Maximum absorbance for wild type amilCP was at 589nm, whereas the absorbance maximum for the purple mutant was at 579nm (Figure 5), indicating that it had been shifted slightly to the left. The absorbance"

In a word, users can manage their works in the Project System, communicate with others in the Communication System, create or edit biological maps or networks in the Pano Unit, do functional works in the Plugin Unit. All these are based on our users-friendly UI Framework.
Generally, our front-end is based on Google Chrome Explorer, using Material Design Standard as the framework of display, and, jQuery and D3 as the framework of visualization. Our basis and frameworks provide a clear view, and if more, rich environment for responsiveness. These features provide a great experience for users and meet the demand of functional usages properly.
UI Framework
We build our UI following the Standard of Material Design by Google, in order to make our website tidy to look and convenient to operate. Our framework makes users feel free in visualization, allowing smooth actions to perform while the interfaces keep clear. Aiming at demonstrating information properly and provide good experience for users, we tried our best to show richer content in fewer frames.
Project System
Project is the smallest unit to work in BioHub, in which information as below is saved:
Nodes and links are edited in Pano Unit and shown as thumbnails in the project page, allowing users to view their projects clearly.
Project information is determined when a new empty project starts, showing basic properties about projects.
Functional work information is what users do in Plugin Unit.
All projects are edited and saved on the cloud, allowing other users to comment on your work.
Communication System
We designed a communication system in order to make users worldwide able to view and make comments on your projects. The system is like a forum, where sharing ideas is never more convenient. The ability to comment on others’ work make our BioHub more like a laboratory, not a single software.
Pano Units
Pano is a module to display the biological network, and it is the most important part of this software, so it receives the most concern. A svg is used for storing and showing edges and nodes of the pano. Besides, several Javascript libraries, such as d3.js and jQuery is used for processing and transfering the data.
d3.behavior is used for zooming and dragging by using the mousel and your finger, and we use ajax by jQuery to fetch node information"
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," capsid is an icosahedron with proteins Gp23, 24, and 31 contributing to its assembly. The highly antigenic and small outer capsid proteins serve as accessory proteins on the outer shell. Capsid proteins from this bacteriophage will be used as a proof of concept for further usage in the finalized construct.
Figure 2: Proteins and their respective functions in capsid assembly as well as the HOC/SOC accessory proteins used for fusion with the construct.
PHAGE SELECTION
In future design application, we have looked at phages that have a host range corresponding to our potential hosts: E. coli as the proof of concept and the methanotrophic bacteria as the real-life bacteria application.
Through the utilization of phage display technology, we will attempt to express ELPs fused to metal binding proteins on the surfaces of the T4 phage capsid for E. coli and in later experimentation, the M4 phage for the methanotrophic bacteria.
The T4 bacteriophage belongs to the phage family Myoviridae and interacts with E. coli[1]. The capsid of this phage has been successfully modified to display peptides and protein domains on the surface[1]. In past experiments, biologically active, full-length foreign proteins were displayed by fusion to SOC (small outer capsid protein) and HOC (highly antigenic outer capsid protein) accessory protein genes found on the T4 capsid surface. In fact, a bipartite T4 SOC–HOC protein display system allowed two different proteins to be displayed on one T4 particle simultaneously[2]. The high abundance of these proteins (960 SOC and 160 HOC molecules per phage capsid) increases the efficiency with which potential metal-binding proteins may function, once attached to this phage[2].
The M4 bacteriophage will be used in the real-life application of our system in the mining and oil tailing ponds as it is a natural occurring phage that can survive in the environment of the tailings pond.
As a proof of principle, we will be using the capsid protein taken from the T4 phage: gp23, 24 and 31. The proteins gp23 and gp24 are coat proteins making up the phage capsid, and gp31 acts as a chaperone in the gp23 folding process[3]. These proteins will produce an empty viral capsid to test the parts individually with the bacteria. This will allow for further experimentation with the full bacteriophage construct including the other parts.

The Raspberry Pi makes OpenScope entirely digital, letting the user control and program it using specifically designed software. New software can easily be added to the arsenal of features already available, and the existing software can be modified and improved according to the Copyleft license it’s under.
ImageJ is a widely-used microscopy software that already has features such as cell-counting algorithms and annotation. To make OpenScope easy to integrate into standard scientific experiments, a plug-in for ImageJ has been developed that enables the user to implement programs to process images captured directly from OpenScope. In short, the transition between OpenScope and this standard laboratory software is seamless.

Environmental Impact
A full life cycle analysis was carried out on OpenScope using using the Eco Audit tool on the CES Selector Program [10]. The program allows for the energy (MJ) and carbon emissions (kg) to be calculated for the product over its lifetime. The Eco Audit tool calculates these by taking into consideration the materials and material processing used, the use of the product, the power consumption (calculations for power consumption are given here ) and any transportation involved.
Assumptions
Materials and Processing: For each part of the microscope only the main materials, making up the majority of the part, were considered. Materials and manufacturing processes were collated from online and are accurate to the best of our knowledge. There is not an option on the tool for 3D printing as a materials process and so the chassis was instead described as being made using polymer moulding, the most similar process.
Transportation: All parts for the microscope are being sourced locally, many parts can be bought in bulk and it assumes the only transportation would be by light goods vehicles, travelling across England.
Use: We assumed the average person would use our microscope 4 days a week and use it for 2 hours each of these days. It was also assumed that the microscope would have a lifetime of 1 year.
Disposal: It was assumed that all materials that could be recycled were recycled, the rest were disposed of in landfill.

Most energy is consumed from the materials used to make the microscope, at approximately 10 times that of the 'use' energy consumption. It is likely that with a commercial microscope the use and material energy would be closer matched due to the commercial microscope having a much longer lifetime. Although it may seem that a lot of material is used on OpenScope for its short lifetime, much of the material used can be recycled or reused directly. The thermoplastic PLA used to make the majority of the microscope chassis can be recycled to"

The second major accident is recorded in Iraq (1972), where epidemic proportions of mercury contamination were observed after wheat seeds were treated with alkyl mercury and were inappropriately consumed as food. It is not known how long it takes to develop symptoms of mercury poisoning or not, Because it is directly dependent on the form, concentration and time of exposure to the metal. After these accidents occurred, conventions and legislation in countries were determined individually, in addition, this type of action demonstrates the awareness and concern by government part.
The use of mercury has diversified into areas such as industrial, metallurgy, chemical industry, medical equipment, dentistry, among others. Particularly, the use of mercury has become high in the Amazon, this metal is used in prospecting for gold extraction. The misuse in the region generates not only human intoxication, but serious environmental problems.
Bacteria are able to live in different environments, including the contaminated growing under the pressure of these pollutants many groups become resistant to these contaminants developing systems of homeostasis to protect against damage and maintenance of survival (Biondo, 2008).  Considering the metal mercury (Hg) as a main contaminant toxic non-degradable, remaining indefinitely in the environment, the ability of the bacteria is related to the processing mechanism of this substance. It is known that some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have this mechanism, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp, Cupriavidus metallidurans, and Enterobacter (Giovanella et al. 2010).
Figure 3. Genes responsible for mercury metabolism identified.
The mechanism is structured to change from a toxic oxidative state to a less toxic to the bacterium by methylation, chelating agents, efflux pumps and enzymatic reduction. This one is related to the mer operon. The resistance of the operon is associated with the activity of regulated proteins and expressed by a"

Sex ratio determination :
   For each team,  the official team profile was checked to count the number of student members, advisors and instructors.  Then to determine the sex of particpants, wiki were used when names were not obvious, using pictures when they existed. When no pictures were available and names were not obviously referring to one sex, a google image search was done on the name (first and last name) and the sex was chosen as the most represented sex in the pictures (if 10 images of men come up and 30 of women, the participant was considered as a woman).
Database :
   Information for the first year of iGEM were difficult to find because of the non existence of available wiki pages and it was therefore decided not to take into account this year.  Teams who withdrew during the competition were not taken into account since it was most of the time impossible to know the number of participants due to the absence of wiki.  In the end our data set is composed of 662 teams over 5 years. For each team were reported :   Year  ;   region ; name of the team ; number of student members ; number of women student members ; number of advisors ; number of women advisors ; number of instructors ; number of women instructors ; participation to MIT championship ; medal ; regional prices ; championship prices ;tracks.
Attrition by Career Stage
   With the introduction of High School iGEM competition, We have quantitative data about gender balance through career progression.  By observing trends between the High School Division, Undergraduate and Overgraduate Divisions, Advisors and finally Judges; we can identify potential glass ceilings and find out why women are being lost through various career stages.
iGEM : a mirror of main gender problems
Teams sex ratio, a very robust value
  
The first thing that was examined was the evolution of sex ratio of teams in iGEM across continents and throughout the years.
The striking conclusion of this comparison is that the sex ratio is iGEM teams remains constant through the years and across continents  (ANOVA's p-value for the different conditions > 0,5). This shows that women are underrepresented in iGEM teams.

This approach is, in eukaryotes, flawed for three reasons: First, promoters in eukaryotic cells are very complexly regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, and thus, pathways [1] . One is the concept of ""genetic switches"" (see [2] for a recent review)

Once all five constructs were ordered, we ligated the linear DNA constructs to the PSB1C3 iGEM backbone using Gibson Assembly Mastermix 2x, transformed NEB T7 competent E.coli with our new plasmids, and plated the colonies on chloramphenicol selective LB plates. The colonies were incubated at 37 ℃ overnight or until there were distinct, visible colonies and never longer than 72 hours. The existence of our DNA constructs in the colonies were confirmed using verification primers in a colony PCR. We then performed his-tag purification on crude cell extracts from our colonies using Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns. Following protein purification with the Thermo Scientific HisPur Ni-NTA spin columns, we confirmed the presence of our protein in the final elution using Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Lumio Tag Protein Detection Kit. We then performed a standard BCA Assay to determine our total protein concentration in each elution.
To test quantitatively  the strength of each purified glue candidate we performed a lap-shear test using the Instron 5565 in the Stanford Soft & Hybrid Materials Facility. To do this, we grew G. lucidum mycelium on sawdust into the specified dimensions of the ASTM D3163 rectangle, which is used as a standard for lap-shear adhesive tests [9]. We also cut cardboard into these dimensions to use as a rough control that would help us assess whether or not our glue candidates were truly specific to mycelium material. Before applying our various glue candidates to the mycelium and cardboard specimens, we incubated the purified protein solutions at their isoelectric points at 4 ℃ for 2 days, spun them down, and discarded the supernatant. This was done to allow aggregate forming proteins (csgA, csga-CBD) to form amyloid fibers and for all the proteins (CBD4x, fp151) to reach their optimum functional pH [6].

Tartu_TUIT
We were happy to collaborate with the first in history Estonian iGEM team - Tartu_TUIT from Tartu University. The team - consisting of science and technology students for the most part - asked us to help with creating and updating the Wiki. We soon organised a Skype call with the team, and exchanged possible collaboration ideas from our side: for example the chance to get access to a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory for testing the antimicrobial activity of our peptide with Propionibacterium acnes. Further discussions brought two students and their two instructors to Helsinki, to meet us, get help with the wiki and discuss our projects!
The team arrived in Helsinki in the late morning, and so for starters we had lunch in the city center. It was interesting to learn about how the first team in Estonia had been brought together and how their practices differed from ours. We proceeded to the Helsinki University library, where we had a room booked. We started with a wiki presentation. Meo explained how websites are built, what are some of the tools used and what .html and .css syntaxes look like. He provided the team with a handout, some useful links and a Python script made by Aalto-Helsinki iGEM 2016, with which all wiki content can be uploaded on the iGEM servers with one command.
Tartu_TUIT presents us their project.
After the wiki session, we presented the Tartu team our project and they presented theirs to us. We got very valuable feedback to our laboratory work from both the students and instructors of the team. As a special mention, they suggested using liposomes for testing the antimicrobial properties of our constructs, as we had not managed to acquire access to a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. After the discussion, there was still some time to walk around the sunny Helsinki and discuss our universities, educational programs and iGEM in general. We are thankful for having the Tartu team visit us and exchange knowledge and ideas.
Most great advances have been a collaboration.
That is the joy of science for me.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#LOV_-_-_TEXT.html," intein halves together to initiate splicing. Although most certainly a useful tool, these principle can only work for inteins with low affinity to each other and therefore with rather low reaction rates. When using faster inteins, the corresponding halves bind to each other with significantly higher affinity and thereby start the splicing reaction independently from the binding state of their coupled protein domains.
We therefore came up with a new method to inhibit an intein's function light-dependently using LOV2 domain photocaging.
The As LOV2 domain
Figure 1) Crystal structure of the As LOV2 domain in its light-induced state.
The J-alpha helix is clearly identifiable in the front bottom. The part suitable for photocaging (that is the part downstream of the I539 is colorised in red. The flavin mononucleotide chromophore is shown in green.
As LOV2 is the second Light-Oxygen-Voltage domain from the Avena sativa phototropin 1 (Figure 1). In its host organism, the common oat, phototropin 1 is a blue-light receptor involved in the response of growth to environmental light conditions and may be responsible for the opening of stomata and the movement of chloroplasts [5] . LOV2 mainly consists of a flavin mononucleotide (FNM) -binding core containing a FNM as chromophore, as well as a helical structure on the C-terminus, the J-alpha helix. Upon excitation with light, a cysteine within the core covalently binds the activated FMN, which induces a conformational change resulting in the protrusion of the formerly concealed J-alpha helix [6] .
This light dependent change in conformation can be used to control cellular processes via light induction, a method for which two strategies exist: It has been shown, that proteins or protein domains which are fused C-terminally to the LOV2 are not able to bind to possible interaction partner due to sterical hindrance. Only after the conformational change initiated by illumination the J alpha helix is exposed, and so is the attached protein domain and its catalytic core. [7] . Instead of being fused to the very end, small amino acid sequences can be introduced and therefore hidden within the J alpha helix. Usually, this offers a better light-state to dark-state (signal to noise) ratio. This approach, also termed photocaging, has already been used to control degradation or nuclear accumulation of proteins [8] [9] .

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html,"At the beginning of this century, biocomputer is still a crazy dream far more than a possible blueprint. But now scientists have had the technology to make this ""impossible mission"" comes true. In recent months, scientists from Stanford constructed a new ""bio-crystal valve"" by DNA and RNA, which can do the logical operations in the living cells[6].
Two months later, scientists from MIT used less than 3 gene devices to do the digital operation in division, logarithmic and square root. Thus, constructing gene circuits as electronic devices have become possible. From their research, their cellular calculator which uses analog computation has more advantages in computing efficiency in part count, speed and energy consumption compared with digital computation[7].
Figure 1: Different kinds of log-domain analog computation.
Due to the fact that our circuits can generate a steady oscillation, it is possible that using our circuits as a sinusoidal signal generator.
Signal generators, such as function generator (including sinusoidal signal generator), are electronic devices that generate repeating or non-repeating electronic signals. As an important part of basic circuit studies, they are generally used in designing, testing, troubleshooting, and repairing electronic or electroacoustic devices.
What's more, Li Guang-bi from TUST reported that they have constructed two kinds of electronic circuits which well simulated the gene oscillator. This indicates that our circuit can develop to a new kind of gene sinusoidal signal generator[8].
Figure 2.This picture shows a kind of electronic circuit generating the oscillation wave.
Figure 3.This graph shows the generated oscillation wave.
Future Version Trilogy
We blueprint our next step developing oscillatory gene circuits in following steps:
Step One
Complete our project by cleaning every obstacle on our way to oscillation.
Confirm that every part is functioning as expected;
Amplify the effect of different copy numbers;
Complete the comparison of different strains' effect on oscillation;
Complete the comparison of different EGFP & sfGFP effect on oscillation;
Confirm most suitable microfluidic parameters for oscillation;
Optimize our model
Step Two
We will make our oscillation a controllable one by integrating the catalase gene into the circuit.
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen. It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since our lab is studying Shewanella oneidensis, and its catalase protein has showed outstanding performance in catalyzing H2O2. So we thought we could integrate the catal"

As EPO concentration in the blood increases, the marrow transit time will decrease, shifting the boundary between marrow reticulocytes and circulating red blood cells to the left. A decrease in EPO concentration increases the marrow transit time and shifts the boundary to the right. The oscillations in the marrow transit time are due to the oscillations in the EPO concentration caused by gene doping.
Reticulocytes will stay in the bone marrow until age 18.75 to 21 days after which they leave the bone marrow and circulate in the blood, where they mature into red blood cells.
Red Blood Cells and Blood Reticulocytes
There is a fixed rate of random daily breakdown of red blood cells due to random daily breakdown or, internal or external bleeding. This is represented by a constant apoptosis rate independent of EPO concentration.
$$ RBCs_n = RBCs_{n-1}\times e^{-\alpha_{RBCs}(EPO(t), \, \mu_{RBCs}) \times \Delta t} \tag{33}$$
$$ RBCs_{n+1} = RBCs_{n}\times e^{-\alpha_{RBCs}(EPO(t),\, \mu_{RBCs}) \times \Delta t} \tag{34}$$
Between the ages of of 35 to 42 days, young red blood cells will undergo neocytolysis if the concentration of EPO in the blood drops below 9.8 mU/ml. The neocytolysis rate will increase as EPO levels drop until the level of EPO reach 3.3 mU/ml, when it maximum.
$$\alpha_{RBCs}(EPO(t), \mu_{RBCs}) = \alpha_{RBCs, \, r} + min\Big(\frac{c_E}{EPO(t)^{k_E}}, \, b_E \Big),$$                                 $$\, for \, EPO(t) < \tau_E, \, 35 \, days \leq \mu_{RBCs} \leq 42 \, days \tag{35}$$

M.A.X. and RestrictionDB
The Mutation Analysis Xplorer is basically a search on a for this case create database of restriction enzymes. To improve the runtime, reduce the necessary computing capacity, and to simplify the software itself, we wrote the python script “RestrictionDB”. Actually, RestrictionDB takes a text file from REBASE containing information about restriction enzymes and their recognition sequence. This parsing system, which knows how to read the REBASE data and translate them into object it can work with, is written in an abstract way. So, adapting the parser to files from other providers is relatively effortless, which allows the script to become with a few updates a universal parser. After parsing the data, restriction enzymes with very similar recognition sequences are grouped together. From the barely more than 400 used restriction enzymes are created more than 230.000 enzyme groups. Each group has an extended sequence. These sequences are determined by looking at the recognition sequences of the restriction enzymes and combining these, so all recognition sequences in a group are subsequences of the extended sequence in this group. Further, all recognition sequences and the extended sequence itself have on the same position a ‘#’ instead of the original base. The replacement of the ‘#’ by an A, C, G, or T could lead to one of the recognition sequences of the enzymes in this group and would lead to a cuttable DNA double strand in the lab. An example of an enzyme group is seen in Figure 6.
RestrictionDB creates just the database and does not look on preferences of the user, since its aim is to create a universal database of restriction enzymes grouped by similarity of their recognition sequence. The next step is to load this database into M.A.X. Obviously the huge output of more than 230.000 groups of enzymes takes some long calculation times. However, this job must be done only once everytime you want to use new sources for your database. To skip this step, we already provide a database ready to use. When starting M.A.X. you must give the path of the desired database. Then you see the graphical user interface of M.A.X. (Figure 7). By entering text into the text field “Search on database” and pressing enter you can start the search on the preferred data of the database. The output is a list of enzyme groups, which can"

The processing of the information drawn from all the distributed sources can be accomplished using workflows. To manage the complex and heterogenous nature of such a distributed environment, scientist have turned to computerised workflows.
Methods:
The Synthetic Biology Development Lifecycle
Unlike the waterfall model, there is currently no need for the maintenance phase in synthetic biology.
We propose the model in Figure 1 to fit Synthetic Biology. It is important to note the iterative nature of the software development life cycle which was also inherited by our proposed Synthetic Biology life cycle.
Figure 1: A proposed development life cycle for Synthetic Biology.
Using CellML
The modelling language of choice for virtual parts is CellML. One of the main reasons for choosing CellML over SBML (or any of the other modelling language available) is its modular nature and its proven track record in representing intracellular processes in systems biology (Cooling et al., 2010). Identifying motifs
To identify motifs and the parts they were composed of, the CellML model of the subtilin receiver was converted to a graphical representation (Figure 2).
Figure 2: A graphic respresentation of the Subtilin Receiver model.
The virtual parts for these parts were extracted from the CellML Subtilin receiver model and assembled again in a new file.
The model in the file was checked using COR because it was quick to reload changed files and to return informative errors Database
A MySQL relational database was designed and created to hold both physical and non-physical virtual parts, required to build a simulatable model of a BioBrick. Both types of parts are saved in the same table but are distinguished by a boolean flag.
The database was populated to hold at least one generic part for each type of part that we used. A naming convention was adopted allows for the retrieval of parts based on the part name.
The structure of the database is shown in the E-R diagram in Figure 3.

Web Service
A web service, which we called BioBrickIt, was developed in Java and served with the Apache Tomcat web server. The web service provides the functionality to populate the database with virtual parts and other information required to create simulatable CellML models. It further provides the functionality to simulate models retrieved.
A choice had to be made between offering a SOAP or a RESTful web service. Time constraints and simplicity of implementation favoured a RESTful service. Resources are"

Funding
From the very beginning we knew that the participation at the iGEM HS competition would be very  expensive. There were a lot of costs increasing during our work. Lab supplies like chemicals, enzymes  and oligonucleotides cost a lot of money. There were also team registration fees for the competition  and the Giant Jamboree as well as travel and accommodation costs in Boston.
For all this, it was neccessary to gather a lot of funds. For us high school students it was not an easy task.  We had to find a lot of sponsors and donators. We tried to collect as much money as we could,  gradually. First we focused on sponsor contracts. We made a list of the most successful companies in  Slovenia and then the contracts were sent to them. We focused also on municipalities from Slovenia.  We were also logged on a national tender for financing research and scientific work.
On the other hand, we were searching also alternative ways of financing our project. In this respect, we  have made a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. We can conclude that this campaign was successful.
On this occasion, we would like to thank again all our sponsors and donators for their kind support. Big  thank is also going to our mentors at the National Institute of Chemistry (NIC), Slovenia, and at the Chair  of Biochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology (FCCT), University of Ljubljana.  The two graphs below show the structure of financing our project.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," allowing for the development of subdivisions. With an increase in roadways, more native flowers should be planted to show the diversity of Alberta plant life. An increase in flowers would also help the declining bee population in Alberta. The proposed cost of the seed mix would be $28 for 400 seeds per bag. Bees would not only pollinate the new flowers, but also the existing vegetation and the local crops in the surrounding area.
Introduction
The City of Lethbridge is known as one of the sunniest cities in Canada. This sunlight allows for native plant life to thrive despite the fact that Lethbridge does not receive much rain. Lethbridge has been steadily growing for the past few years allowing for many subdivisions to develop. As more roadways are created, native flowers should be planted to show how diverse the plant life in Alberta is. In addition to making our city more aesthetically pleasing, this would help to increase the bee population within our city. Currently, Alberta's bee population is in decline due to a number of factors including overwintering, poor health, and colony collapse disorder. To prevent any further harm to the bee population, trying to increase the bee population within our city would be a small way to try and help this species that we cannot live without.
Meadow Mix
The types of seeds that were included in the mix were chosen based on the following factors: cost, drought-tolerance, how high the plant would grow, how much sunlight the plant would need, how much the plant would spread, if it attract bees, if it is native to Alberta, and its ability to grow in the open. A total of eight types of seeds are to be included in this mix. Eventually, we decided on the following: Tufted Fleabane, Golden Aster, Blue Flax, Wild Bergamot, Yellow Penstemon, Slender Penstemon, Lance-Leaved Stonecrop, and Blue-Eyed Grass. The proposed cost of this mix would be approximately $28 for about 400 seeds per bag.
Project Goals
Our main goal for this project is to see more flowers be planted in the City of Lethbridge along designated roadways. If this happens, there might be an increase in the bee population within the municipality. This would increase pollination not only for the flowers being planted, but also for existing plants. This could also have a positive effect on the local agricultural industry as an increase in pollination could help some of their crops thrive.
Conclusion
If this proposal was successfully implemented Lethbridge would not only look more vibrant, but this proposal would also help a"

Purification of these hydrocarbons would contribute an added economic and industrial benefit.  We aimed to house this system by designing a bioreactor for our bacteria as well as optimize product output through a flux-variability based model.   Finally, in order to create higher quality hydrocarbons we explored desulfurization and denitrogenation pathways to upgrade our fuel.  To do this in a safe and environmentally sound manner, we built into our design structural containment, as well as genetic control mechanisms through novel inducible ribo-killswitches and an auxotropic marker.
Characterization of new parts submitted to the Registry
( BBa_K902000 ) and ( BBa_K902004 ): two novel hydrolase enzymes were submitted to the registry for the hydrolysis of two different sugar-conjugated electroactive compounds: PNPG and PDPG.  Used in conjunction with the existing lacZ part in the registry ( BBa_I732005 ) which hydrolyzes CPRG, this allows for the electrochemical detection of three compounds with a single electrode.  A uidA inducible generator ( BBa_K902002 ) was submitted and characterized electrochemically.  This data can be found on our Electroreporting page.
( BBa_K902008 ),( BBa_K902023 ) and ( BBa_K902074 ): three novel riboswitches sensitive to magnesium, molybdenum cofactor, and manganese were submitted along with two associated promoters ( BBa_K902009 and BBa_K902073 ) in addition to a rhamnose inducible, glucose repressible (Prha) promoter ( BBa_K902065 ).
The magnesium riboswitch ( BBa_K902008 ) was tested with GFP and a constitutive promoter using this construct, ( BBa_K902021 ), with its promoter and GFP using this construct ( BBa_K902017 ) and with its promoter and the S7 kill gene using this construct ( BBa_K902018 ).  This data can be found on our killswitch Regulation page.
The Prha promoter was characterized via fluorescence output using a GFP composite part ( BBa_K902066 ).  This promoter was additionally characterized with our S7 kill gene as a composite part ( BBa_K902084 ).  This data can be found on our killswitch Regulation page.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#essay_-_-_TEXT.html," on the importance of analyzing complexity and the emergence of patterns. We were very happy to get such a positive feedback and motivated to continue our studies.
Going further
In this part, we analyze the methods we used to answer our human practice question. We hope that this analysis will provide iGEMers material to think about their policy and practice project.
Survey
The internet as a media allowed us to reach more than 800 persons willing to participate in our survey. We thank each participant for its support! We are also grateful for all the people that provided us with additional comments; no matter whether these were suggestions for publications to read, complaints about the complexity of the survey or encouraging words.
We called for other iGEM team's solidarity for the survey. The idea of winning a badge for the wiki was appealing to many of them. The teams were motivated to participate as often as time allowed, since we introduced a two badge system (a colorful badge for 20 answers and a golden badge for 50 answers). In fact, two teams, namely the iGEM team Hannover and the iGEM team SDU Denmark , handed in more than 50 filled in surveys. We are impressed and grateful!
We did not define a target population, as we were too ambitious and wanted to cover all subgroups of society. However, the data set we collected is strongly biased towards students. It could be interesting to particularly design a survey concerning this part of the population.
Our goal was to learn more about the people's understanding of complexity and emergence. Even though our survey included spaces for own answers, most people chose one of the preformed answers. It would be interesting to encourage people to express themselves, so as to receive more individual answers. One option could be to ask people on the streets to answer one question, e.g.: ""what is complexity for you?"". Audio or video records of the interviews could be used to supplement the survey study. It would be strongly dependent on the country of investigation but it could give some unexpected insights on the topic. Moreover, it would give an occasion to increase awareness of the public on synthetic biology.
Interviews
First, we would like to thank every person that accepted to answer our questions.
As one of our goals was to investigate how complexity is taken into account in different fields, interviews seemed to be the best way to get a broad overview of different fields. We achieved to get seven personal and professional points of view about complexity. It was highly interesting to explore in details different conceptions of complexity in scientific and non-scientific fields.
An interesting interview is not self-evident."

HUMAN PRACTICES
Timeline
Here we are going to describe each of the human practices made by our team,  the impact that they had in our project. Each has description has an insight (what we thought before the activity), changes (impact that it had in our project), resume (brief summary of activity)
Initial contact with a professional research
Insights: Disinformation. We wanted to break paradigms and establish a concrete mentality about the disease we wanted to attack with our project, understanding the patient.
Changes: Disinformation. We wanted to break paradigms and establish a concrete mentality about the disease we wanted to attack with our project, understanding the patient.
Resume
The first activity of human practices we did as a team, was to request the support of a professional, this with the goal of commenting our ideas and asking him or her,  to guide us in the process of being able to help people from all social sectors with our project. This is how the team visited psychologist Carmina Gudiño´s office, who provided us with reliable information about depression and anxiety disorders. She answered all the questions we had, as well as reviewed and approved all the material and information prepared for the human practices activities. She also gave us information about some established myths about depression and anxiety, and how these symptoms are sometimes normalized by society.
Because of this, we decided to give a lecture about basic information, and the most common symptoms of depression and anxiety in an Institution named Galilea 2000 A.C.
Galilea 2000 A.C
Insights: Lack of comprehension. We should see the disease from the true eyes of a person with the disease.
Changes: We develop a truthful motivation for helping people.
Resume
This association, gives shelter and provide assistance to relatives of patients who are treated in a hospital near by the area of the institution. We considered this group as one with a higher possibility of suffering depression and anxiety, due to the environment they have to be, at the time their relatives suffer a specific type of illness.
Because of this, we gave a lecture. Our objective was to generate awareness that both, depression and anxiety are diseases that need to be treated as such, otherwise they can have severe consequences of different type including suicide.
On the lecture we gave basic information of the disease, as well as information of public and private institutions able to provide help and support.
At the beginning of the lecture we asked the persons to fill some questions, the questions were written on a cardboard and we gave them stickers, so the registry"

However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.
How to come up with an idea or to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.

iGEM community
A fundamental idea in the iGEM society is to increase knowledge within the field of synthetic biology as well as sharing this knowledge with other students and scientists internationally. The participants of iGEM will in the future end up as scientist or in the industry, and hopefully retain the sportsmanship that exist within the iGEM community and spread it even further. By focusing on iGEM community in our Human Practices, we hope to raise awareness of the importance of sharing one's knowledge, both for solidarity reasons as well as making the research more accessible. One example of how we reached out to the iGEM community is our ongoing collaboration with team Czech Republic. We also participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, and shared thoughts and ideas with other nordic iGEM teams.
Our friends in Team Czech Republic
During the course of the summer we have been in contact with first time iGEM participants, team Czech Republic. They initially contacted us because they were interested in our previous project (iGEM 2014 Team Gothenburg), which brought to our attention the fact that their project was similar to the detection part we had designed. Due to those similarities we believed that it would be beneficial for everyone if we could help each other out through the duration of the summer. Our contact has mainly been through e-mail and Skype and the collaboration encompassed different parts of our projects. We helped them out by giving some general advice concerning the competition for instance where to find the free parts we get from the competition and also providing them with our survey so they received something for their Human Practices. In return, they have been helping us with some simulations of the detection system and the modeling people from both teams have been talking to each other during the summer as well. We are very pleased that we got this opportunity to get in contact with another team! It has been really nice and we are all looking forward to meet the Czech"
USTC,2017,Team:USTC-Software#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," is one of the plugins integrated in Biohub to design amino acid sequence from a given protein. The algorithm requires an extremely large database (about 10 GiB), and will consume lots of computation resources during executing. The characteristics increase the risk of breaking down the whole server, and make the software unfriendly to those who want to test it locally.
In consideration of the issues mentioned above, we redesigned the execution model of ABACUS. Now ABACUS can be executed either locally or remotely. If the database and the binary files are configured correctly, ABACUS will be executed locally, otherwise it will forward the request to other servers who have the ability to run ABACUS locally.
Such mechanism perfectly solves the problems. On the one hand, ABACUS need not to be run in parallel with the master process of server, so the risk of breaking down doesn't exist any more. On the other hand, ABACUS can be executed without databases and binary files downloaded, therefore it is convenient for users and programmers.
Notice
This year we use websocket in our notification system. Now notifications can be sent to related users immediately whenever they were created as long as the connections between users and server remain. Users can be informed of what they interest in while they are using our software."
BIT,2017,Team:BIT#Model#Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html,", which follows the law of mass action. So the reaction rate V can be expressed as following.
k1 refers to the rate constant, [AFP] and [Aptamer] refer to the concentration of themselves.
[AFP]0 is the initial concentration of AFP and is also the target of our detection. We assume that [Complex] is also zero when the response time t is zero. The ordinary differential equation yields the following results.
In the actual case, k1、[Aptamer]、t1 are constants. Therefore, after analyzing the first process, the relationship between the released lysine-complementary strand complex and the initial AFP concentration [AFP]0 should be proportional.
Considering that this step is validated by experiment, the concentration of lysine-DNA complementary strand complex is difficult to detect due to technical conditions，We used the complementary chain of fluorescence instead of lysine-DNA complementary strand complex (Complex), through the detection of fluorescence values, to measure the concentration of the complementary strand. The results show that there is a clear linear relationship between the concentration of the complementary strand and the concentration of AFP. (Please read the Design-biosensor section for details).
The secend step
The Complex, which is separated from the first step, will enter the next chamber of our microfluidic chip where the lysine molecules will be removed from the DNA complementary strand and will be able to enter our engineered cells. So, in the second step we will build the model on the decomposition reaction of the lysine-DNA complementary strand complex.
This is an enzymatic reaction, and its reaction rate satisfies the Michaelis-Menten equation. So we set the expression of the reaction rate:
[Complex] is the concentration of the complex; Vmax is the maximum reaction rate, which is expected to be measured experimentally. Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant of the enzymatic reaction.
We solve this ordinary differential equation for time t, we get
In order for the model to better guide our project, we use this model to predict the relationship between substance concentrations. Based on the literature knowledge we have consulted and the experience of the lab, we have roughly estimated several sets of values for the constant parameters in the equation and have the following curves:
Obviously, when the detected lysine concentration is in the range of 3 μg/ml, the complex concentration is very linearly related to the lysine concentration, and can be well fitted as a linear relationship, which is what a diagnostic item is required.
Finally, putting the two models together, we found that in the detection range, there is a good fit"

Meeting up
Meetup held by ITCCC
On July 24th, we were invited to take part a meeting upheld by International Teenager                         Competition and Communication Center on campus of USTB, during which 4 teams shared the                         experimental process about their project of iGEM. We found some problems in the design of each                         other's projects through communication, and discussed some solutions and ideas. Each team                         received a lot of pertinent suggestions from the others, which helped a lot to our project.
Meetup in Shanghai
By the end of August, we had preliminarily completed all parts of experimental verification,                         constructed the relevant proteins, and verified the strength of each promoter. In order to                         further improve our project and make progress with other teams from communication, we                         participated in CCIC. All of the teams exchanged ideas about their project and original design                         and have a quick exhibition of the poster, give some simple but classic presentation. Among                         which we also try to find ways to better collaborate with other teams, especially in the                         modelling and outreach. We received more than 10 useful advises about our project and having a                         great time!

Throughout summer, we’re glad to collaborate with team CCA_SanDiego from Canyon Crest Academy (CCA) in San Diego, California. Team members from both team first meet up during session Biological&Biomedical Science of Yale Young Global Scholar Program. After the summer program, we keep in touch, discuss about each other’s iGEM project and team Nanjing_NFLS help characterize CCA_Sandiego’s part.
Characterization of part NADPH P450 Reductase and CYP2e1/NADPH P450 Reductase
After excising the target gene NADPH P450 reductase from the plasmid provided by Vanderbilt University, Sanger sequencing is carried out to determine the sequence of the target gene and match it with information derived from gene bank to ensure the precision of the extraction.
After the coexpression construct plasmid containing NADPH P450 gene as well as a P450 enzyme (CYP2e1) gene assembled by 3A assembly is transformed into E.coli, resistance screening of E.coli is carried out to screen out the E.coli containing the recombinant plasmid and further plasmid extraction from the E.coli screened out runs gel electrophoresis and endonuclease identification to prove that the correct segment of the target gene has been linked to the plasmid.
Finally, we plan to carry out western blotting to verify that P450 enzyme express normally in the conexpression construct in E.coli with the help of Homo Sapiens (Human) NADPH reductase gene which donates electrons from two-electron donor NADPH to P450 enzyme in a coupled two step reaction.

Combining pHsensitive promoter4 with bacteriorhodopsinand osmolality sensitive promoters (OmpF, developed by iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei in2008) with channelrhodopsin,  the light-coupled expression platform can beextended to more accurate and more complex regulation, which facilitatesbacteria being more programmable by computer.
Together with channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin alsoenables water desalination utilizing solar energy. Sea water desalination haslong been attractive and difficult to implement efficiently. E. coli which can express halorhodopsinand channelrhodopsin could be one promising way to solve this problem. It ispossible to drive E. coli to capturevarious ions (mainly sodium ions, potassium ions and chloride ions) in seawater and move these ions away by controlling the movement of E. coli. By this means sea water couldbe desalinated for drinking, irrigation or other daily usage.
In conclusion, halorhodopsin could fulfill the needof utilizing light as signal or energy resource. We believe that halorhodopsinwould be one of the most interesting tools of synthetic biology in the future.

It is also appreciated to provide a link to the iGEM mainpage ( http://20xx.igem.org/ ) in your header section. CSS is a very powerful technique that cannot be explained in this tutorial completely. Learning more about CSS can save a lot of time when customizing your wiki. You might also want to take a look at this page from this year's  TU Delft team , where some more iGEM-specific CSS styling is listed. You will also find many tutorials or look-up pages about CSS on the web. And don't forget to take a look at previous teams, they might inspire you or have that piece of code you where looking for...
Congratulations! You made it through the tutorial. Now you are ready to play around with CSS and add some more eye candy in your templates to produce a nice looking wiki. Have fun and don't hesitate to try new things, you can always go back using the MediaWiki history!
Part II: How to use the iGEM MediaWiki
This part will give you a short introduction, how to use the iGEM wiki and will gibe you some advice that will save your time and your nervs. Furthermore it will give some hints, specific to a wiki created according to the above tutorial.
Login in
First of all, you always have to be login into the iGEM wiki before you can change your page. Just click the log in button on the top of this page or any other iGEM page and make sure you have your account set up.
Creating a new wiki page
There are several ways of creating a new page. The easiest way is to type the name of the new page into your browser, for example http://20xx.igem.org/Team:xxx/bane of the page you want to create.. Please note, that all names are treated in a case sensitive manner! After typing in the name, just click ""Create"" or ""Edit"" and you can add content to your newly created page. Hit ""Save"" to save the new page.
Since all iGEM teams share one common wiki, it is important that every page you create is in your namespace. In other words, all pages you create have to have your team name as a prefix. For instance, all page of our wiki are in the namespace ""Team:TU_Munich"".
One other important aspect is, that at the beginning and at the end of every wiki page, your have to link to so-called template"

Cyclic-di-AMP   concentration from the strains used fort he microarray in Groningen.
With the microarray we wanted to analyse different expression levels in the wildtype, GP 1344   (supposed to have much c-di-AMP) and GP1346 (supposed to have little c-di-AMP   amounts).
The c-di-AMP amounts were confirmed via c-di-AMP measurements (see figure   above; the measurements were done at the MHH in Hannover).
The results from the microarray analysis were useless since only one dye   worked. Therefore we did RT-PCR studies (see below).

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Modeling Cascade_-_-_TEXT.html," the default parameters of the system of ODEs can be seen below:
A function was written to determine the point at which the concentration of the final product reached a certain threshold. A threshold of 1E-8 M was used in our simulations, which corresponds to a handful of proteins within a cell, assuming a cell volume of around 1E-15 L. Using the default parameter values, a delay time of 385 min was predicted.
Sensitivity
A sensitivity analysis was done on the system. This looked at how variations in each parameter would influence the delay time. Parameters were swept over a range of values while the change in delay time was observed. The normalized sensitivity for various parameters is shown below, ordered with the most sensitive parameter at the top.

As we can see in the table above, the system is most affected by changes in dmRNA, dCI, and aλp. This agrees well with the analysis done in the paper A general computational method for robustness analysis with applications to synthetic gene networks [9] on a similar cascade system. That analysis also found the sensitivity to be greatest for the degradation parameters.
The analysis also revealed that the leakage on the last stage of the cascade is also an important parameter. The plot below shows how the delay time quickly drops as the leakage passes 10-4 %.

However, if the concentration of recombinase is low, there is no significant difference in fluorescence intensity. The results of the image C show that Bxb1 and TP901 recombinases have a threshold property. So, the proportion of fluorescent cells have a jump discontinuity between low concentration and high concentration of recombinase.

The results show that the recombinase-RDFs can recognise the sites and reverse the sequence between sites in HEK 293T.
Conclusion
We verified the functions of most parts and most upstream and downstream paths step by step. We verified the function of synNotch, the inhibition of TetR after modification, the reversal function and threshold characteristics of some recombinases and promoter combinations. However, due to the time constraints, we are unable to complete verification of TEV and the combinations of some recombinases and promoters. Moreover, the combination of upstream and downstream circuits needs to be verified by experiments. We will carry out supplementary experiments in the future to carry out a complete experimental verification of our subject.
Future experiments
In a short period of one year, it is not easy to fully realize such a complex idea. Therefore, we have envisaged the next series of experiments to further realize our project idea, combining the idea of continuous feedback between modeling and wet lab to ensure the best system.
1. Optimized functional verification of TEV suppressing TetR Inhibition
As mentioned earlier, since the reporter gene selected GFP, our experimental results are not intuitive. We will replace the reporter gene with RFP to solve this problem.
2. Verification of the combinations of remaining recombinases and promoters
We plan to continue the experiment of remaining combinations that have not yet been verified in order to verify the function and threshold characteristics of these combinations of recombinases and compare the inversion efficiency of recombinases.
3. Construction of a fully functional stable cell line combining upstream and downstream circuits
We plan to finally construct our parts on two"

Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

There might be some questions we won’t be able to answer until we get into bee experimentation, but we should consider possible risks such as the addition of external AMPs to the colony atrophying the natural production of AMPs in bees, as well as the possibility of weakening their microbiota.
He emphasized that it is not an easy project to develop as working with American and European foulbrood of honey bees is extremely complicated because of the specialized infrastructure, techniques and studies required to work with honey bee brood diseases.
Regarding American and European foulbrood disease presence in Canada, he stated European foulbrood predominates over American foulbrood in Canada.
There are no regulations in Canada concerning experimentation on bees, yet, he doesn't consider there should be since regulating it would hinder and inhibit research with them.
Detailed Description
Dr. Ernesto Guzmán is a professor and head of the Honey Bee Research Centre at the University of Guelph; he received a DVM degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a MSc and Ph.D. in entomology from the University of California, Davis. Dr. Guzmán has advised or co-advised the theses of more than 50 DVM, MSc, and Ph.D. students. Research in his lab focuses on three main areas: genetics, behavior and parasitic mites of honey bees, identifying factors that affect honey bee health.
On October 2, we met with Dr. Guzmán on a video conference to speak about our project; he referred to it as something new since to the best of his knowledge, no one has worked with bee’s antimicrobial peptide genes to treat diseases in these arthropods. He mentioned there might be some questions we won’t be able to answer until we get into bee experimentation, but we should consider possible risks such as the addition of external AMPs to the colony atrophying the natural production of AMPs in bees, as well as the possibility of weakening their microbiota.
He emphasized that it is not an easy project to develop as working with American
and European foulbrood of honey bees is extremely complicated because of the specialized infrastructure, techniques and studies required to work with honey bee brood diseases. It can take months or even years to standardize the protocols needed, so he was curious if we were planning to continue working on this project after the competition.
Regarding American and European foulbrood disease presence in Canada, he stated European foulbrood predominates over American foulbrood in Canada, but in Mexico, American"

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," to reduce blood glucose is one of the treatments for diabetes. Canagliflozin is a drug of an inhibitor of subtype 2 sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2) (Can J Diabetes., 2017). SGLT-2 play a major role in renal glucose reabsorption. When blocking SGLT-2 by canagliflozin, the blood glucose could be eliminated through the urine. However, the drug has adverse side effects such as fungal infection, thirst, increased urination and low blood pressure. DPP-4 inhibitor is a relatively new antidiabetic drug (Postgrad Med., 2017). DPP-4 is an enzyme destroying a gastrointestinal hormones called incretins which stimulates insulin production and inhibits the gluconeogenesis by liver. Blocking DPP-4 function by the inhibitor may reduce blood glucose level and lose weight. But DPP-4 inhibitor has severe side effects of nausea, diarrhea and stomach pain, etc.
Exercise to burn off the calories you take from food is not realistic. Artificial sweeteners and diet drinks are considered bad to your health and have higher risk to some diseases. Medicine is the bottom line and you never want to crave food followed by taking pills with side effects. Then, what should you do to deal with the excess glucose?
What have iGEMers done to solve the obesity and diabetes problems?
Problem-solving iGEMers
What have iGEMers done to solve the obesity and diabetes problems?
iGEMers are always tackling real problems happening in the world and seeking a potential solution based on synthetic biology. In the issues of obesity and diabetes, iGEM teams NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan and Stony_Brook in 2015 contributed to the work of body weight control and diabetes treatment, respectively.
NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan has developed Appetite Controller to reduce appetite so as to control body weight. They engineered a probiotic, Lactobacillus casei, to produce CPP-PYY fusion polypeptides. Peptide YY (PYY) is one of the gastrointestinal hormones which controls appetite. The PYY is carried by Cell Penetrating Peptide (CPP) to penetrate into the intestinal cells. The products would keep the body fit by lowering appetite when people crave foods but aren’t hungry.
Stony_Brook has engineered a QSP tripeptide secreting E. coli to regulating blood glucose level. The QSP tripeptide is encoded by RSC1A1 gene and acts on kidney cells to inhibit the expression of a glucose"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," GATK
Variant calling algorithms are heavily sensitive to the quality scores of the sequences. The base quality scores are often subjected to various technical errors due to the sequencing technique. For this reason base recalibration is key                   to ensure that the quality scores are accurate and that the variant calling analysis is accurate. Base recalibration was perform with BaseRecalibrator inside GATK package (v 4.0.9.0) (McKenna et al. 1297-1303).
Before recalibrating the bases, it is necessary to ensure that the samples must be sorted, indexed and contain the appropriate read groups. Read groups are fields contained in the header of the libraries (@RG) and the represent a set of                   runs that were obtained in the same run. Due to the unknown specification of the dataset used, it is not possible to determine the appropriate read group, however, for the validation of the pipeline it was decided that each sample was                   part of a unique read group. To view if the sample contains any read group, Samtools view command can be used by specifying the header group of interest (ex. -H <sample.bam> | grep ‘@RG’). For more information about read-groups                   and correct usage please refer to (Van deer Auwera).
In addition to the sample input BAM file, BaseRecalibrator has the option to add more additional fields labeled as known sites to calibrate the analysis. The know sites refer to any database of known polymorphic sites for the specific                   reference sequence. This include a list of know SNPs and Indels sites within the reference genome. During the creation of the model and analysis of reads, this known sites will be avoided and the program assumes that all reference mismatches                   seen outside this sites are therefore errors and indicative of poor base quality. There are three main files recommended for a correct BaseCalibrator analysis: the dbSNP sites, Mills and 1000 Genome Project gold standard indels and the                   1000 Genome Project standard Indels. This datasets can be obtained from the Broad Institute FTP server and are specific for each human reference genome. For this study hg19 reference genome and known sites were used. Base recalibration                   was performed with standard settings. The output of the analysis is a GATKReport file containing the various recalibration tables.(McKenna et al. 1297-1303) For more information about the format and characteristics of GATKReport format                   please refer to this link. A summary of the recalibration table by read group can be found in Table 6. The full reports"

At least two of the following goals:
✓ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
✓ Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We have significantly improved the characterization of two inducible promoters in the Registry - the pCUP1 promoter (can be found as BBa_K945002 ) and the pGAL1 promoter (can be found as BBa_J63006 ).
✓ Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We have helped Team Chalmers Gothenburg with modeling and simulating their system. We also cooperated on Multinational GMO survey .
✓ Choose one of these two options:
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
We have integrated some of the ideas from the Interview with two experts on the CTCs into our project. As recommended we tested the agglutination in the microfluidics chips instead of tubes. Also, for the orthogonality tests in Module 2, we used GFP as the output signal instead of agglutination to make the result more obvious as suggested.

This time we utilized AEMD's Stability mode (click here for AEMD user's guide) to screen for                                 mutational sites that benefit the ceaS2 enzyme activity.
Because of the complexity of enzyme catalysis, it’s difficult to predict point mutation                                 improving protein activity accurately. How AEMD work？
Firstly，the development team of AEMD recently described a method which is able to identify                                 desired mutations by analyzing the coevolution information of protein sequences (Liu, et                                 al., 2016). In the AEMD-web, some point mutations are suggested by this method. Besides,                                 AEMD’s analysis generated some residues close to active center and transport tunnels which are recommended to saturated mutation to improve activity (Fig. 1C). For the input of target                                 protein sequence, AEMD first obtain the PDB file using RosettaCM (Song, et al., 2013). Next,                                 the substrate of template PDB was mapped into target PDB using the “struct_align” funciton                                 of Schrodinger software (QikProp, 2015). The spatial location of substrate in target PDB                                 can help to determine the ligand-binding pocket of target enzyme. If all potential template                                 PDB had no substrate in the PDB file, AEMD predicted the ligand-binding pocket by a Rosetta                                 script (gen_apo_grids.linuxgccrelease) (Zanghellini, et al., 2006). After the determination                                 of ligand-binding pocket, AEMD generated the possible catalytic sites by search local Catalytic                                 Site Atlas (Furnham, et al., 2014); the residues within 5Å distance from ligands by calculating                                 the minimum distance between residue and substrate; and the residues located within 3 Å distance                                 from transport tunnels by CAVER (Chovancova, et al., 2012).(see the Fig.1 (C))
We submitted the amino acid sequence and PDB file of ceaS2 online and got the prediction                                 result in half an hour.As shown below, you can also download PDF version .

OUR PARTS
We submitted two composite parts to the registry: BBa_K2411005 and BBa_K2411008.
 
BBa_K2411005 : Forward Engineered Toehold 1 with deGFP gene
This device encodes for a toehold that when activated expresses deGFP. It has an OR2-OR1 promoter, followed by the first forward engineered toehold sequence designed by Green et al. The deGFP follows the toehold, and the device ends with a T7 terminator. The part has been designed for and tested in an E. coli derived transcriptional translation cell free system. In order for the part to function, it needs to be used in conjunction with a trigger RNA. Characterization data can be view on our results page or on the registry.
 
BBa_K2411008 : Forward Engineered Toehold 2 with deGFP gene
This device encodes for a toehold that when activated expresses deGFP. It has an OR2-OR1 promoter, followed by the second best forward engineered toehold sequence designed by Green et al. The deGFP follows the toehold, and the device ends with a T7 terminator. The part has been designed for and tested in an E. coli derived transcriptional translation cell free system. In order for the part to function, it needs to be used in conjunction with a trigger RNA. Characterization data can be view on our results page or on the registry. 
In addition to these composite parts, we created registry pages for the OR2-OR1 promoter, the T500 terminator, and both toehold architectures that we used in our composite parts.
 
BBa_K2411000 : OR2-OR1 Promoter
This is a constitutively active promoter that can be used in E. coli and E. coli derived transcription translation systems. This part is derived from the lambda bacteriaphage.
 
BBa_K2411002 : T500 Terminator
This is a bacterial terminator.
 
BBa_K2411004 : Toehold 1
This sequence is the forward engineered toehold from Green et. al. This part contains the hairpin loop sequence that with the RBS. There is no gene associated with this toehold.

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," laser is many magnitudes below the dimensions of a standard mammalian cell (diameter: 10-15 µm ; volume: ~4,000 µm3 ). This means that our siLACE system is not only able to activate genes on a single cell level but even modulate the expression via subcellular activation of only certain plasma membrane areas.
The main advantages of this siLACE system over previous designs is its independence of widefield illumination, its ‘memory’ and its ability for modulation. The system allows activation of genes solely via a single laser beam and once activated stays in an active state until the siLACE protein is naturally degraded. Additionally by changing the laser radius and the exposure time it is possible to activate different amounts of dCas9-TF’s at the same time, leading to short or long expression of the target gene.
Design considerations
For the construction and testing of our siLACE system we divided it into two testable components: the plasma membrane delivery system (PMDS, BBa_K2332315 ) and the dCas9-p65 ( BBa_K2332316 ).
Plasma membrane delivery system (PMDS)
The aim of the PMDS design was to create a generally practical transmembrane protein embedded in the plasma membrane that localises a target protein to its cytosolic side and allows subsequent delocalisation via light-induction.
There are many commercially available expression vectors available that target recombinant proteins to the surface of mammalian cells. (e.g.  ThermoFisher’s pDisplay). However, our PMDS is not only supposed to target a protein to the outside of the PM but also to the inside. LIT therefore had to investigate membrane trafficking in mammalian cells in depth to ensure the most efficient design.
In mammalian cells, all proteins start translation in the cytoplasm (with the exception of some mitochondrial proteins) and either undergo protein sorting during or after translation. PM transmembrane proteins first encode a signal peptide that is immediately bound by the signal recognition particle (SRP) which localises the translation complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the translation continues through the Sec61-channel. During the co-translational import into the ER the presence or absence of special sequences of hydrophobic amino acids defines if a protein will contain one, two or multiple transmembrane domains or if the protein will be soluble (absence of hydrophobic sequence). If only one hydrophobic sequence is encoded the protein will be a single-span transmembrane protein. By default all proteins encoded enter the secretory"

We also carried out this binding test with 2 different strains of cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cells of the experiment group and control group were both incubated till their   OD600 reached 0.6. Then both E. coli and M. aeruginosa were applied to short period of mild sonication   to break up the colony formed and harvested by centrifugation and PBS washing. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa were co-incubated and observed under fluorescence microscope afterwards. We used microscopic counting   to quantify the binding effect. The same procedure was used to the cells with plasmid having different promoters.   (Result here)
Gas vesicles
Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC are needed to form a protein complex to help the E.coli cells float. GvpA, a hydrophobic protein with the size of 7.4 kDa, is assembled as the framework of the protein complex,   which is later stabilized by the hydrophilic protein GvpC, a larger protein consisting of 193 residues. GvpA   and GvpC can assemble into a low-density protein cylinder in assistance of floating (see Fig. 8). Gas fills   space inside the protein complex by diffusion while water is rejected outside.
Figure 8. Schematic presentation of the Gas vesicle formation. Two   proteins, GvpA and GvpC, are expressed in E.coli at the same time. Then, they can polymerise in to a protein   complex Gas Vesicle which has a lower density than water so that E.coli can be floating in the   water.
Floating cells regulate the proportion of GvpA and GvpC by having different ORF copies in the gvp cluster. On   average, the molar ration of GvpA and GvpC is around 30:1 in one cell. Considering this, we inserted gvpA and gvpC   gene into pSB1C3 and pSB4A5 vector respectively to get the wanted expression results. The OUC-China iGEM team used   this design in 2012 and we continued to adopt this strategy in our project this year. The gene cluster was also   kindly give by the OUC-China iGEM team.

Washington,2016,Team:Washington#Project1_-_-_TEXT.html,", and yeast; however, it is known to display many anti-pathogenic characteristics , which could limit feasibility in certain model organisms. In high dosage, violacein has been shown to cause DNA damage and cytotoxicity which could be detrimental to experimental control if not taken into consideration (Durán, 2007).
Methods
We’ve dedicated a page to our experimental procedures here .
Our end goal for wet lab is automating the production of metabolites. The steps our team took in order to achieve this was by choosing a pathway that produced metabolites whose colors were observable using the naked eye. Genes VioC and VioD were then modified by attaching inducible Copper (Cup1) and Galactose (Gal1) promoters respectively. This was successfully done through overlap-extension PCR. Originally the promoters were constitutively activated; but with the new promoters we are able to produce four different colour outputs. Next, we attempted to create a plasmid consisting of the Vio gene cluster (VioA, B, and E with constitutive promoters and VioB and D with their respective inducible ones) and the vector backbone. And then assemble all the parts via a four part Gibson Assembly.
After repeated attempts, we were unable to successfully produce a singular plasmid for the entire violacein system. We stepped back and redesigned our plan. We decided a more efficient course of action would be to utilize a three plasmid system. We decided to introduce a new region of overlap into the backbone plus VioB fragment and the VioA plus VioB fragment from our previous attempts and utilize gibson assembly to produce a chassis strain. This chassis, which has the enzymes necessary to create protodeoxyviolaceinic acid (the latest precursor for producing all four pigments), would then be transformed with two additional plasmids: Cup1+VioC and Gal1+VioD. At this point in the project, the codon-optimized versions of VioC and VioD were prepared, pGal1 was available, and pCup1 in its standard biobrick assembly form was on the way. We opted to produce these through biobrick assembly. While there are potential complications to using a multi plasmid system, such as the required variety of selectable markers or a potential loss of a plasmid, this avoids some of the difficulty of producing a 16 kilobase plasmid.
Results
While we successfully extract violacein from the original strain we received from the University of Washington’s DAWGMA group,"

Combined all three overnight cultures with 100 mL of fresh media.  This yielded a titer of approximately 4.74E6 cells per mL, which is just under the recommended titer of 5E6 cells per mL.  Note that 115 mL should make more than 20 transformations.

However, 15% renounced to actually use them, which shows how patent can impede research and innovation: getting a license may be dissuasive, especially in France where the Research budget is limited.
The next answers are related to the current iGEM projects. The poll shows clearly that patents have been a problem for 10 % of the participants, which is not that much. But still :  they do have been a concern in some cases. The relatively low number could be explained by the aforementioned reasons about the providing of non-patented tools by the iGEM organization.
It could also be explained by the redundant solutions offered by the living matter in general and the synthetic biology in particular. For instance, our team specifically picked a Dispersin gene that was not patented, though others were available (whose commercial use was protected).
Nevertheless to the question : “have other IP concerns (copyright, trademark) have negatively affected your current iGEM project ?” about 67% of the participants answered yes, which is considerably more, but as we have not even been concerned by such a problem, we find it hard to explain why this number is so high.
Our sole conclusion on this matter is that the IPR often does affect iGEM projects, even if in general the patents are not the limiting IP tool for them.
May a project be built on patented materials?
19% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented materials. This means that privatized knowledge and the iGEM contest are compatible in some way or another. However, the potential industrialization of these teams’ work will probably be restricted because the commercial use of something built on patented material is forbidden. This is a shame as one of the iGEM objectives is to generate projects that may have economically viable applications.
It is also surprising to note that 48% of the participants do not know whether their work is based on patented information or not, which shows a lack of information on their project material. Besides, it could stab them in the back if they were wishing to industrialize their ideas. Several questions were asked on the use of patented material. As it was discussed before, it is the most important IP issue in iGEM.  Nonetheless, only 20% of the survey participants said that their team’s project used patented material.
Furthermore, two thirds of the iGEM team members believe that using patented work would not stand in the way of patenting their own one. This is quite surprising because obviously one’s research cannot be patented if based on protected materials. This"
Pasteur_Paris,2017,Team:Pasteur Paris#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," backed a conclusion we had formed: there is still too little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most dangerous and toxic. Creating an indoor pollution database would be an excellent initiative. Azéline and Juliette then attended a conference on air purifiers with a presentation of the state of the art existing models. It turned out that systems that have the most chance of success in the future are those that do not consume energy (passive), that do not produce more pollutants after use, and that are not too expensive. Azéline and Juliette then had the opportunity to present our project aether, which received very good feedback.
Thus, we spent a lot of time outside the laboratory to meet all the actors of the French ecosystem of the fight against air pollution. We synthesized the results of our surveys with the general public and institutional actors in a major report presented below.
A study on the political, economic, social and legal issues of air pollution.
When we chose our topic in January 2017, we were in the middle of the French presidential campaign and many of the political platforms were mentioning the topic of pollution. One of the candidates had even directly targeted the endocrine-disruptors.
Once our subject was chosen and the project had begun, our law students, decided to make a report on air pollution and especially on how it affected our society in several aspects. Therefore, they decided to try to explain the political, economic, judicial and social issues when dealing with air pollution.
For this report, we have met with some major players in the French fight against air pollution such as associations but also people working for the French administration such as mayors’ and minister’s counselors (those meetings were described in the last paragraph).
With our project aether, we hope to give a technical solution against air pollution, but we think that technical means cannot do it all. We believe that each and every one should understand what are the main issues related to air pollution. Thus, we designed a report that you can read here:
The Particulate Matter Hunt
Finally, after our investigations and meetings, we returned to the general public to share our expertise on the issues of air pollution.
On September 16th, 2017, we organized an unseen event to raise awareness about the growing issue of air pollution and the stakes of our project. This event: a treasure hunt in the streets of Paris to educate and alert the participants in a fun way to the problem of air pollution and show them how synthetic biology could be a solution to fight this issue.
