Description Design Modelling Results Proof Notebook Safety
Mathematical modelling of the natural systems is often a necessity in understanding the probabilities of certain outcomes or dependencies of certain factors on the whole system in experimental science. Such models have a vast application, as they can provide the information based on the interaction of multiple systems, which cannot be achieved in the laboratory conditions. It is essential, that mathematical modelling is of crucial importance in the field of synthetis biology, as it helps to predict all the possible outcomes of a particular novel approach. Mathematical models are useful not only in describing natural systems, but also in predicting the response of a system at various conditions. Here we present the mathematical and kinetic model of a part of our engineered system: a bacteria, which expresses a recombinant enzyme PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and phenylalanine channels. The purpose of the model is to define the efficiency of the system and the limits of its performance as it is crucial to ensure that the approach is prospective and liable.
We were very happy to have the opportunity to collaborate with Oxford iGEM team on the modelling part and would like to thank iGEM for providing the possibilities of such interraction.
Systems
This year‘s project focuses on Escherichia coli, which acts as a probiotic that counteracts the presence of phenylalanine in the intestine of the patient with PKU. We have developed two systems for this purpose.
The first system incorporates phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) for the conversion of phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid (TCA). As this enzyme is overexpressed inside the bacteria, constantly expressed PheP transporters are facilitating the diffusion, since the concentration of phenylalanine in the bacteria is always deficient. The development of this model was a part of collaboration with Oxford iGEM team. The second system, in addition, incorporates the reliable mechanisms of the central dogma to produce a phenylalanine-rich protein that acts as a phenylalanine „sponge“. This system is more reliable than the enzymatic approach and could act in the background. However, for the bacteria to be able to express large amounts"

Figure 1. The violacein pathway. Post-pigment decay products are not shown. (Lee 2013; Kim 2016)
Violacein is a 4 to 6 step pathway whose final products (before decay) are a series of pigments. Originally produced in various chromobacterium, we worked to set up a recombinant yeast strain as a proof-of-concept for a viable and organism-versatile indicator or a cell culture’s status. The pathway works much like a two-bit operator. The pathway has two inputs – two promoters each enabling the production of its respective enzyme, VioC and VioD. The status of these inputs display four different pigments: Green, Purple, Pink, and Teal. Assuming VioA, VioB, and VioE are expressed (these produce the precursors necessary for VioC and VioD), the following pathways are possible: only VioC produces pink, only VioD produces teal, neither VioC nor VioD produces green, and both VioC and VioD produces purple.
In our example, violacein can either serve as either a model of another color-producing pathway or as a coupled pathway via utilizing identical inducers. The idea is that these pigments will be able to indicate the state in which a cell culture is in. Possibilities range from the simplest (ex. indication of the presence of two inducers in solution) to the complex, (ex. indication of varying hormone levels through gradient-sensitive promoter pathways).
Violacein is known to express as expected in “ a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (Pemberton, 2007),” including chromobacterium and E. coli, and yeast; however, it is known to display many anti-pathogenic characteristics , which could limit feasibility in certain model organisms.

Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,": how can we best bind metals on a molecular level, and how can we use synthetic biology to create a platform for functionalizing mycelial material? We also considered the advantages of our platform in comparison to previous efforts, such as flagella-based or cellulose filtration tools [10, 11]. One of the largest benefits of using mycelium material is that it leverages the concept of economies of scale, and presents an entirely feasible option of scale-up of our technology to a level that could be successfully implemented on a space mission and on earth in developing countries with poor access to clean water. Fungi are capable of displaying growth on an enormous variety of biomass types, and grow at a rate that is unparalleled by other biological agents used in synthetic biology today [12].
2.2 Chitin Binding
We sought to find ways to utilize mycotecture and enhance its properties, and in the process realized that chitin is ubiquitous in nature in organisms ranging from fungi to insects - in fact, it’s the second most abundant biopolymer on earth [13]. Methods to take advantage of this fact using synthetic biology are limited - we established a part collection using chitin binding domains as a novel platform to functionalize chitin-containing surfaces, with almost unlimited potential for modifying regions of organisms. We demonstrated the utility through designing novel biological cross-linking glues, fluorescent dyes, but most directly, filtration tools. Our use of the CBD in fusion protein production forms an important pipeline for future teams and the global scientific community for numerous applications, and here we focused on its use for metal recovery from mixed aqueous solution.
2.3 Copper Binding
We then sought to optimize the actual binding interaction between our peptides and metals. We chose copper as our proof of concept as a metal that is both biologically and economically important. When looking at past iGEM teams working with metal binding domains, we found that very few, if any, focused on optimizing the manner in which the metals were bound, instead choosing to simply obtain a binding domain from nature and attempting to implement it. We thought we could do better. A researcher in our lab, Dr. Jesica Urbina, developed a 20 amino acid long peptide (referred to as HHTC-Re (HNLGMNHVLQGNRPLVTQGC), that is a modified peptide with  substituted amino acids adapted from the peptide HHTC designed by Kozisek et al. [14]. We wondered whether we could apply this in tandem with repeats to bind multiple copper atoms to the same biomolecule, and if we could use chitin binding domains ("

Our Concerns
Synthetic Biology is largely restricted to well-funded laboratories at major research universities in high income countries. One significant barrier to entry is the capital cost of instruments. The cloning and assembly of BioBricks, for example, includes the transformation of Escherichia coli, which requires the purchase of a refrigerated centrifuge and an ultra-cold freezer. Here we assemble BioBrick-compatible shuttle vectors for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a naturally competent relative of E. coli that grows as rapidly under identical conditions. We will show that A. baylyi can be transformed with recombinant DNA simply by adding ligation reactions to mid-log cultures; transformants are selected as usual by spreading them onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime or amikacin). These experiments will show how BioBricks can be constructed and assembled in modestly funded laboratories in community colleges, high schools and even private homes. The resulting plasmid constructs retain their pSB1C3 backbones and will thus remain compatible with the BioBrick standard and capable of replication in the widely used E. coli chassis.

Joining the iGEM team of ColegioFDR_Peru in March 2018 was my first real science group project since I came to Peru in June 2015. I’ve always been interested in the science that involves chemistry and the project we’re doing is piquing my interests. I’ve never had much knowledge in this type of science before but this is a good place to start.

Before starting high school two years ago, science class was never my favorite and was quite boring to me. After taking biology last year my interest for science grew and I started finding myself watching videos about different topics in biology, chemistry and even astronomy. I decided to join iGEM and I certainly don’t regret it because it has allowed me to expand my knowledge of synthetic biology, something I couldn’t have done during class hours.

PBAD promoter BBa_I0500 in Part Registry
There are several PBAD promoters in the Part Registry. The promoter that we were interested in was BBa_I0500 because of  two reasons. First, BBa_I0500 , along with PBAD, has araC gene is regulated by the Pc promoter. Without the AraC, the  repression and induction of PBAD can only work on strains that are AraC+. By coupling the araC gene with the PBAD promoter, we can be free from such restraints.  Second, BBa_I0500 needed debugging. BBa_I0500 , although it is useful, it is not  requestable because of inconsistency in sequencing. Also, in the experience page, two teams, Groningen 2011 and Cambridge 2011 had some discrepancy on how the promoter responded  to the arabinose induction. In brief, Groningen results show that the induction of the promoter by arabinose was gradual while Cambridge results show that it was an “on-or-off”   response. We wanted to analyze these problems so that the part could be more reliable for other users. Cambridge cited a paper that mentioned that variation in response could have   resulted from cell strain variation. (Khelbnikov, 2001)
Results
All-or-none response was observed for individual cells.
Flow cytometry can measure the fluorescence of individual cells. The individual measurement of cell    fluorescence can be plotted in a forward scatter (FSC) intensity value versus fluorescence graph. An arbitrary vertical line divided the region of the graph with low    fluorescence (Q3) and high fluorescence (Q4).
For the negative control, DH10B transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_E0240 , we see cells distributed in Q3 while absent in Q4.  The reverse was true for the positive control, DH10B transformed with pSB3K3- BBa_I20260 (GFP generator regulated by BBa_J23101 ).  We see most cells distributed in Q4. For our experimental sample,  (pSB3K3- BBa_I0500 - BBa_E0240 ) similar trend could observed for three strains.  At no arabinose induction, we see most of the cells in Q3. The distribution of cells shifted to Q4 when arabinose was added to the medium. We also see that the cells remained in Q3"

Deletion of the codA gene could be useful for our project due to its ability [[to transform isoG and isoC]] into uracile.  In this case the concentration of the UBPs decreases and our plasmid carrying the UBPs could not be replicated properly.  We designed three compatible constructs for the potential deletion of codA following the protocol of Jiang et al.,  2015 using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. .
At first, we designed  our construct carrying our synthesized single guide RNA (sgRNA), which is essential for the targeting specificity.   Because of the presence of the sgRNA, Cas9 could carry out a sequence-specific, double-stranded break.  In the case of a repair via homology directed repair with our designed repair template, codA gets deleted.   Just like Jian et al., we chose pTarget as our vector. Therefore, we annealed the sgRNA oligos, cloned them into   the pTarget backbone via golden gate assembly and selected positive clones via blue-white screening.
The PCR-construct responsible for the homologous recombination, and therefore the codA deletion, was generated by two PCRs. In a first step, 700 bp upstream and downstream of codA were amplified. These two fragments were then inserted into the backbone using Gibson Assembly. The homologous recombination of the neighboring sequences of codA with the plasmid bound flanks leads to a deletion of this gene.
Figure 3: Design of the flanking sequences upstream and downstream of the codA gene for the potential deletion of codA.
As the CRISPR/Cas9 system plasmid, we conceptualized pCas, also used by Jiang et al., containing the lambda-Red system for a   higher recombineering efficiency. For the codA gene deletion, you need to generate E. coli BL21 DE electrocompetent cells harboring pCas,    and Arabinose (10 mM) has to be added for the induction of the lambda-Red system. For the homology directed repair, one needs    to transform pTarget and the PCR fragment into the competent E. coli cell harboring the pCas plasmid.   Then, one needs to verify positive transformants by colony PCR and DNA sequencing.
To cure the cells from pTarget, one can inoculate a positive colony at 30 °C for 8 to 16 hours in media containing kanamycin  (50 mg L-1) and IPTG (0.5 mM). For the curing of pCas, the cell can be"

Aequorin alone worked – upon the addition of Coelenterazine and Calcium it luminesced. We then attempted to characterize ChR2’s and CatCh’s calcium influx in response to blue light. We conducted these experiments by loading HEK293T cells expressing ChR2-eYFP or CatCh-eYFP with Fura-2 AM dyes, which measure intracellular calcium. We imaged these cells for 340/380nm emission ratio while illuminating them with pulses of 470nm light. To test whether the Sender Cells could activate the Receiver Cells, we co-cultured Sender Cells with ChR2-eYFP or CatCh-eYFP expressing HEK 293T cells and conducted Fura-2 imaging while adding Coelenterazine to activate the Sender Cells.
Pre-Coelenterazine
Since the Receiver Cell relies on the addition of Coelenterazine, it is not truly dependent on light signaling from the Sender Cell. We  attempted to solve this problem by developing a genetically encoded Coelenterazine. A patent from the lab of Martin Chalfie showed that Coelenterazine can actually be derived from Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (Ward, 1998) – a GFP molecule with two point mutations is naturally cleaved into Coelenterazine. With site-directed mutagenesis, we attempted to express this “Pre-coelenterazine” in our HEK 293T cells, but found that it did not function as normal Coelenterazine – it did not result in luminescence in the presence of Renilla or Aequorin and Calcium.

If the interaction is still energetically favourable once the R-loop has been formed along the full length of the gRNA, Cas9 will cause a double stranded break in the DNA, 3-4 base pairs from the PAM [1], and dissociate, losing its efficacy (as a single-turnover enzyme) [2].
The kinetics used to model this process are very heavily influenced by the work of the Salis Lab, although similar work was done by the 2013 iGEM team from Wuhan University in China [3]. From its site of production, the Cas9:gRNA complex can be taken to undergo molecular diffusion in the form of an isotropic, 3-dimensional random walk. This leads to the following equation to describe the rate of contact of the Cas9:gRNA complex with all possible sites on the genome:
Eqn 2
Where:
rRW is the rate of DNA site contact
D is Cas9’s diffusivity
λ is the characteristic length between the site of Cas9:gRNA complex production and binding site
V is the chloroplast volume
As mentioned previously, Cas9 binding is governed by the sum of the free energy changes involved. Three energy exchanges are involved in this process. The first energy exchange results from binding of the PAM, ΔGPAM.
A second energy exchange, ΔΔGexchange, comes from R-loop formation. Using a nucleic acid nearest neighbour model, this can be considered a weighted sum of the energy exchanges involved in binding each gRNA duplex to its corresponding DNA duplex. 256 of these energy exchange parameters exist (for all existing RNA duplex combinations, binding to all possible DNA duplex combinations) and are expected to be near 0 for a match (e.g. rCG/dGC) and to carry a positive energy penalty for a mismatch (e.g. rCG/dAC). Mismatches occurring nearer to the PAM have been shown to carry more of an energy penalty than those further away. Thus, the equation for ΔΔGexchange for a 20 nucleotide gRNA is given by
Eqn 3
Where dk is the weight of a mismatch k nucleotides from the PAM, and ΔΔGgRNA:Cas9[k,k+1] is the free energy change from binding of the duplex formed by nucleotides at the kth and k+1th positions.
A final energy consideration proposed by the Salis lab is that which results from the supercoiling which is induced by Cas9’s binding to other, nearby"

Some potent bacteriocins have incredibly complex post-translational modifications, but we have also chosen ones that don’t require any modifications. The genes will be cloned into the standard pSB1C3 vector, and the peptides heterologously expressed by inducing the expression of T7 RNA Polymerase in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The efficacy of these recombinant proteins will be tested via zone of inhibition assays and growth curve assays.
Chassis
BL21(DE3): BL21(DE3) contains the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the lacUV5 promoter and is deficient in common proteases. Therefore, this strain optimizes the expression of proteins placed under a T7 promoter after IPTG induction [5].
XL1B: XL1-Blue supercompetent cells allow for blue-white screening of recombinant plasmids. In addition, XL1B cells are endonuclease and recombination deficient, which greatly improves miniprep DNA quality and yield [6].
Mastitis-Causing Pathogens
Bovine mastitis is caused by a diverse group of pathogens, ranging from bacteria to algae. Here, we list some of the bacteria that are known to be the most historically significant pathogens, the most virulent pathogens, as well as the most common pathogens.
Enterobacter spp.: Enterobacter spp. are mastitis-causing, Gram-negative bacteria. They are found in the environment, specifically areas such as manure, bedding, soil, and muddy lots or corrals. Enterobacter spp. spreads to a cow’s mammary gland through environmental contact, especially when teats come in contact with manure or contaminated bedding. Notably, these bacteria do not respond well to antibiotic therapy. Therefore, it is very important to keep cows clean and dry and employ proper milking procedures to prevent infection from Enterobacter spp [7].
Enterococcus spp.: Enterococci spp. are Gram-positive bacteria and common environmental pathogens of bovine mastitis, contributing to 11% of cases in Central California. It has been shown to be resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial compounds [8].
Escherichia coli: E. coli is an environmental pathogen and a very common cause of mastitis in dairy cattle, with severity ranging from subclinical infections to severe systemic diseases. Antimicrobial treatment options are very limited and with negative implications on human health [9].
Klebsiella spp.: Klebsiella spp. is a group of environmental pathogens that are significant causes of bovine mastitis,"

- Application and Specificity
Introduction
     BBa_J33201 is a promoter containing the E. coli JM109 chromosomal arsenic detoxification operon (ars operon). Both 2013 Buenos Aires iGEM team and 2006 Edinburgh iGEM team used it to detect arsenic ions in the water. Buenos Aires team ligased it with GFP and Edinburgh team ligased it with LacZ α. The two teams also submitted biobricks, BBa_K1106004 and BBa_J33203. We wanted to know whether these two biobricks have more application, such as detecting the arsenic pollution in Chinese medicine. We also wanted to know whether they can detect other metal ions. Several experiments were done to evaluate the function of this promoter.
The Expression of GFP (BBa_K1106004)
1. Experimental Design: Growth curve of GFP biosensor in arsenic solutions of different concentration
      This experiment was to test the growth of E. coli DH5α with the arsenic solution in comparison to the solution without arsenic ions. Table 5 shows the experimental design for the growth curve                         of E. coli DH5α and the result shows in Figure 9.
Table 5: The experimental design for the growth curve of E. coli DH5α.
Figure 9: The growth of E. coli DH5α in different conditions.
     The result shows that the growth of E. coli GFP biosensor in solutions was not affected by the arsenic ion, so GFP biosensor can be used to test arsenic ions.
2. Experimental Design: Function test on detecting arsenic ion in Chinese medicine

Wageningen_UR,2011,Team:Wageningen UR#Softwaretool_-_-_TEXT.html,"GM’s. Because each FGM can function on its own due to the promotor and terminator, it doesn’t matter where it is in your construct. So you can just scramble the sequence of the FGM’s of the hypothetical construct, to for example 135264 or 125643. This won’t have any adverse effects on the molecular workings, due to the promotors and terminators.
For this hypothetical construct there are 720 (6 faculty) different combinations of arranging the functional modules. The rearranging of the sequence of the functional modules is critical for optimizing the cloning strategy due to the following: lets say we use the previous mentioned functional modules R0062-B0034-E1010-B0010-B0012 (1) and R0062- B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012 (2). With these two modules two combination can be made namely 1-2 and 2-1, as seen below.
(1-2) R0062-B0034-E1010-B0010-B0012-R0062-B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012
(2-1) R0062-B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012- R0062-B0034-E1010-B0010-B0012
With these two combinations we search the registry for composite parts which could be used to construct the constructs with. Let’s say you will get the following composite parts for the two constructs:
(1-2)
R0062-B0034-E1010
B0010-B0012
R0062- B0034-C0062
B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012
(2-1)
R0062-B0034-E1010
B0010-B0012
R0062- B0034-C0062
B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012
R0062-B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012- R0062-B0034-E1010
As you can see the majority of composite parts found could be used for both constructs, however for the construct 2-1 you find an additional composite part namely.
R0062-B0034-C0062-B0034-C0061-B0010-B0012-R0062-B0034-E1010

Everybody should be able to understand the main principles of this field and it is with a great enthusiasm that we use the gamification and digital trends in order to promote popularization both to scientists and non-scientists of all ages.
Through our online investigations, our Bio-Console and Application, our aim was to empower citizens by giving them the knowledge they need to build an aware opinion and to encourage them to take part in the future of science by questioning themselves.       Indeed, this matter will be of great importance, especially when new laws and regulations will be debated.       By working on a kill-switch triggered by light, we also hope synthetic biology projects would be safer and could be used more commonly in closed bioreactor, preventing any spreading but allowing society and people to benefit of the many solutions made possible by genetic engineering.

After hearing the community's concerns about SynBio, we held workshops and seminars to clear misconceptions.
Youth Education
Synthetic biology can be a blast with the right approach. The 150 kids at our workshops sure thought so!
Long-Term Sustainability
We made a teacher-friendly educational activities booklet to keep up the momentum long after the Jamboree.
Spreading Public Awareness of Our Project
We presented these two talks on two project subjects: ""What is Synthetic Biology?"" and ""Biomath"".                 We created an outreach blog directed at the general public about our project, iGEM, and Synthetic Biology as a whole. This blog received thousands of page views and was used by people around the world.  We created and maintain a William & Mary iGEM 2015 Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness of our project.
We conducted a survey that measured Synthetic Biology awareness and gauged public concerns about Synthetic Biology at our local farmer's market.                 Two articles about William and Mary iGEM were published in the Flat Hat, William & Mary's Newspaper:                         An article about our team and our outreach efforts, and an article by two team members, Elli Cryan and Panya Vij, about communicating science.
Public Workshops
We conducted a lot of educational workshops this summer! Click here to learn more about these outreach efforts.
Parent Sessions
Parent sessions: Four of our nine workshops gave parents the opportunity to learn about synthetic biology, and half of those gave parents the opportunity to see our lab and discuss ethical questions about subjects pertaining to Synthetic Biology, such as GMO consumption and the morality of Synthetic Biology research. We also gave parents the opportunity to ask any questions and voice any concerns they had relating to Genetic Engineering and Synthetic Biology.
In Progress
The Williamsburg Library has agreed to distribute free pamphlets about synthetic biology. These pamphlets will address concerns voiced in the survey we conducted.                 We are organizing more lab visits from schools and groups in our local community. We are also hosting a 2 hour event at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History on November 21, 2015 in their new Q?rius Lab. There, we will be sharing doing four synthetic biology activities with the public.

Additionally with our new design, we have continued cost analysis comparing the original device manufactured with our rendered picture of our new design and the changes we would make to the new design.  Although collectively as a team we chose not to produce another prototype, we are still planning on doing a full analysis and justification of the chances were made and how this is more economically feasible and positively impacts the end-user.  We began by looking up the bulk cost of many of the materials that were used, such as Teflon and calculating the dimensions of the new device.  Although we have not received a full cost-breakdown of the device, we are trying to calculate the impact of mass production versus development cost would have on the device.  We plan on analyzing all materials that were used in the creation of this device and making a plan with new dimensions to compliment the new design
Week 23: October 6th  - October 10th
This week we worked on the schematic. After receiving feedback from the rest of the team, we decided to make the schematic flow horizontally from left to right rather than vertically. We also worked on writing a script for the narration for our 3D animation of the device. A sample narration was recorded to show the team and receive their feedback to ensure that everything is clear and correct. Minor changes to the script were suggested to ensure that the description accurately and concisely describes the illustrated process. Next week we will be making a final recording in collaboration with the narration and upload this final version to the wiki.
Week 24: October 13th  - October 17th
This week we worked on adding our final information to the wiki and finalizing the website content and design.  Additionally we recorded the narration for 3D Maya animation to explain how our system works with our visual modelling. The animation was finalized and added to the wiki.  Our sub-team wanted to ensure that all information regarding engineering and modelling is clear and shows our iterations of design.

CrtEBIY Characterization
Biobrick K274200 is the β-carotene-producing device submitted by team Cambridge 2009. It is used to produceβ-carotene which is a yellow pigment which can be detected by the naked eye.    However, we find that BBa_K274200 represented a significant leakage expression when exploited as a reporter gene and even bacteria bearing BBa_K274200 only could also represent significant color change, compared with the blank. We speculate that it’s because of a putative promoter upstream, resulting in the leaky expression of CrtEBIY. In order to verify the speculation, we further characterize this biobrick. This biobrick was suffixed to the constitutive promoter BBa_J23103. Resulted new biobrick is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 1. The biobrick we constructed to characterize biobrick BBa_K274200. It is Constitutive promoter BBa_J23103 driving CrtEBIY.
After the biobrick was constructed, it was transformed to JM109, BL21 (DE3) and DH5α, respectively. Then we compared their color with the corresponding strains that bear plasmid with only CrtEBIY as the insert.
After cultivated at 37℃ for 12 hours, as shown in Figure 8, bacteria bearing BBa_J23103-CrtEBIY and naked CrtEBIY represented a yellow color and blank vector appeared white (Fig 2).

Figure 2 Color contrast after 12 hours’ cultivation (for each photo, from the left to the right are JM109, DH5α and BL21)
From these pictures above, we can see that both strains bearing constitutive promoter-CrtEBIY and strains bearing naked CrtEBIY appeared yellow. This demonstrated that CrtEBIY has a serious leakage, and the cause of leakage is probably the same as CrtEBI. It is noteworthy that CrtEBIY pathway need one more enzyme (Lycopene Cyclase, produced by CrtY) than CrtEBI and the Km for Lycopene Cyclase is 1.8μM (Schnurr et al., 1996), so the leakage was more serious as expected.

After investigating commonly used ecosystem health indicators, we decided to use evenness, measured by calculating the Shannon index, to quantify soil integrity. The addition of this value allows users of our system to compare soil health before and after biostimulator use and helps determine the most environmentally friendly method of increasing crop yield.

Growth study of B. subtilis and P. fluorescens
In exchange for recording the script in English, we studied the optimal growth of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens for the Imperial London College team . First, we did an experimental plan to observe if pH is in interaction with temperature. Finally, the conclusion was that pH and temperature were two independent parameters. We ran the experiments again, changing only one parameter.

However, a closer look at the differences in trend between the samples washed with water and PBS reveals a modest increase in the survival of bacteria with plasmids for the production of cytosolic abundant proteins (CAHS) and a decrease for the secretory abundant protein SAHS 33020, which proves that either the proteins or the mechanism by which the protection is conferred are affected by the media used to resuspend.
Preserving Cas13a activity with TDPs
After evaluating the influence of TDPs on the desiccation tolerance of LDH, an established procedure, we wanted to assess their protective performance with Cas13a. Our lattice model indicated that it was best to use CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 to preserve Cas13a activity at a concentration of 1 g/L or higher. Furthermore, it was observed previously that these two TDPs preserved LDH activity after drying and subsequent rehydration, even after several weeks.
Both CAHS 94205 and SAHS 33020 were dried with Cas13a in a concentration of 1 g/L, as the protein purification yielded low concentrations for SAHS 33020. Subsequently, Cas13a was rehydrated and its activity measured via an RNase alert fluorescence assay . All measurements were performed in duplicate.
Figure 31: Cas13a activity with CAHS (94205) (a) and SAHS (33020) (b) in RNase Alert assay after drying and rehydration. SAHS 33020 and CAHS 94205 were dried with Cas13a and then combined with the target. Additionally, the fluorescence activity of the same sample without target, as well as a Cas13a sample with target, but dried without TDPs was measured. Cas13a with the respective TDP and the target without previous drying were used as control.
As shown in Figure 31a and b, the fluorescence intensity triggered by the RNase-like activity of Cas13a dried without any TDPs is very low in comparison to that of the Cas13a undried and stored frozen. However, while the fluorescence intensity and thus Cas13a activity was higher when Cas13a was dried with CAHS 94205, it also seemed to lose its specificity: the fluorescence intensity after one hour was the same with crRNA and target as without (Figure 31a). However, when the same experiments were repeated with SAHS 33020 instead (Figure 31b), Cas13"

Designed primers for making the melanin biobrick - produced brown, purple and orange pigment colours on solid media - characterised orange pigment - researched degredation tags (later turned out not to be needed) - researched the amplification/threshold processing system
Monday
Primer Design
Primers were designed to convert MelA into a biobrick. Primers A and F are for either end (including prefix and suffix - highlighted in green). The other primers surround the unwanted restiction sites (highlighted in yellow) with the changed base in red.
These correspond to the parts on the gene shown below. The stars correspond to the two unwanted restriction sites.
Orange Pigment
Used plasmid editor to examine the genes used for the production of orange pigments. The (supposedly) orange-producing pigment from the biobricks:
We also tried a preliminary design for a biobrick we could construct, in case the orange biobrick does not function. This uses the same genetic synthetic pathway for gene consruction:
Transformed Pigments
The MelA plate left on the bench overnight produced a brown-coloured pigment! Growth on media containing IPTG should produce this pigment a lot faster.
Amplification system
Possible plan
We would want to tag the activator proteins then quantify their degradation in some way
GFP fusion: one idea was to create a functional activator-GFP fusion, to which we would then add a C-terminal degradation tag.  Thus we could express the activator-GFP-tag in E. coli, and could measure flourescence to quantify activator degradation directly.  However, this idea depends on us constructing a functional activator-GFP fusion.
Western blotting: a second idea is to add an N-terminal flag tag to the activator proteins, and"
Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to optimise biosensors and tune their characteristics. We wanted to develop a more convenient, modular approach to facilitate reuse and ease the optimisation process.
Therefore, we propose an alternative, multicellular system for biosensor development with off-the-shelf, modular components. Novel biosensors can be developed simply by mixing three different cell types; a detector, processor and reporter. The biosensor response characteristics can be tuned simply by mixing different ratios of the three cell types.
This design paradigm is a product of iGEM projects of previous years and is steeped in the findings of 121 other iGEM sensors. We conducted a systematic review of all biosensors previously made in iGEM to identify design patterns. We showed how other tightly coupled designs could be converted to our modular framework. We also designed and implemented a range detectors, processors and reporters for others to use.

Sensynova vs alternatives
Sensynova has no comparable platform as it is a truly innovative design paradigm. The alternative to this method of biosensor design is the genetic engineering of whole cell biosensors. As biosensor components are typically tightly coupled in a single cell type, it would require extensive engineering to optimise biosensors and tune their characteristics. To optimise a Sensynova biosensor, a simple reculturing of modules is needed to test and find the best variation of parts. Once this is found, the variant chose could be express in a whole cell biosensor or in a cell-free system. We have designed and created an optimised cell free system to facilitate this process.
Integration
To confirm that our design could successfully be applied to all biosensor systems, we looked back at our systematic review of all biosensors previously made in iGEM to identify design patterns. We also designed and implemented a range detectors, processors and reporters for others to use. This produced a biosensor development ‘kit’ where we designed and characterised many different modules for biosensor developers to use so they can look through our library of parts and test many variants of their biosensor without further genetic engineering. This allows our platform to be integrated into the biosensor development system.
To demonstrate how other biosensors can be designed to fit our system, we took the arsenic biosensor, created by Edinburgh 2006, and the psicose biosensor, created by Evry-Paris 2017, and designed their detector modules to fit our system.

Ashlee and Emily digested 12 dCas9-Plasmid 1 ligation colonies and sent them for sequencing. The size of the band on the gel were not what we expected, so we hope the sequencing results will shed some light on this. We continued to work on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools. We made preparations to attempt our first homologous recombination to insert the dCas9 system into the genome.
The great miniprep adventure of summer 2014! All five GFPs re-cloned, and all of the five variant GFPs had colonies on their respective plates. The decision was made to pick six (6) colonies from each plate and prepare them for plasmid harvest.  These thirty (30) samples were picked, minipreped, and streaked so that they could be saved for future analysis if needed. All of the samples had acceptable concentrations after plasmid harvest, so each sample was digested with Xma1 and Sac1 to see if the correct bands would appear when run on a gel. The samples that showed the bands in the correct part of the ladder were selected to be sent for sequencing in the upcoming week.

Before Ashlee and Emily left on vacations, they plasmid prepped eight plasmids containing dCas9.  These and three CBA colonies were sent for sequencing.  The team had a meeting with Dr. Richard to discuss some upcoming dates and to get feedback on the progress of our projects.
More results of cloning sent for sequencing. Unfortunately it appears that the R2 sequencing primer is bad (probably too much secondary structure, as it was erroneously designed to anneal within the terminator) and if so, this is the source of a lot of our headaches. Developed a presentation for SCIENCE U, an interactive presentation to give to high schoolers at a science camp  at PSU.

After returning from vacation, Ashlee and Emily checked the sequencing results.  Only one colony from the ligation (termed ""L6"") had dCas9 inserted in the plasmid.  No other colonies were found to have the proper sequencing.  L6 is now the most important plasmid we have!  More digestions and transformations were done to keep the flow of the project moving well.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

Supervisor
I’m a post-doctoral research fellow at the Synthetic Biology Research Centre Nottingham, and I will be one of the advisors to the Nottingham iGEM team this year. I am currently working in the field of gas fermentation, capturing carbon from a variety of waste gases and converting it into platform chemicals and fuels. My research involves the genetic and metabolic engineering of acetogenic species in order to expand their product profiles and generally make them more industrially favourable organisms. The opportunity to simultaneously limit our negative impact on the environment through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and recycle that waste gas into useful commodities makes this a fascinating area to study.

Communication
1.Communication with USTC team member
Our contacts with USTC(University of Science and Technology of China) started in June 3rd, when Sitao Zhang, the team leader of 2013 USTC iGEM team visited our lab. We shared ideas about synthetic biology and informations for iGEM. Later in July, They asked us whether we had any suggestion on protein expression of Bacillus subtilis, as there is no teacher employing such system in USTC. We collected information for Bacillus engineering by asking the teacher and graduate student in our university who are using the system. And then we sent these information to USTC. Hopefully these information did some helps. 2.Communication with Shenzhen_BGIC_ATCG team member
As our busy experiments moving towards the end with the passing  summer vacation, our long-term partners –iGEMers of Beijing genomics institute(BGI) in Shenzhen are also trying their best doing their research. After a short telephone conversation between our team leaders, we fond that it was time for our two teams to hold a seminar and exchange our experiences and advices we have gathered during iGEM. It was at this great time that Shuang Zhu from Shenzhen BGI came to Wuhan University for a visit and we held this seminar between Wuhan university and Shenzhen BGI with great joy. In our WHU-IGEM lab, Shuang Zhu told us about their project idea and plan in detail and we also shared ours. Then we had heated conversations about our preparation and experiment experiences during iGEM and we find that we have so many interesting  experiences and exciting feelings to share as iGEMers. Our team leader- Hangxing Jia also told Shuang some of our problems as we try to produce our own biobricks and Shuang gave us some valuable and effective advices with the practice of her team. Finally, we made a conclusion of our process during the past months and planned our future assignment with the helpful advices from Shuang Zhu. As faithful and helpful partners for each other, We are all looking forward to further cooperation between WHU-iGEMers and Shenzhen BGI-iGEMers in the near"

BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#overview.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"50% of a typical cell (Waldrom & Robinson, 2009). Metal, such as Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni involves in many important biological process, including the legume-specific stages of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. (Gonzalez-Guerrero et al, 2014) Molybdenum is also a pivotal part of protein ModA, an essential enzyme for azotobacter to fix nitrogen. The ModA protein was localized to the periplasmic space of the cell, and it was released following a gentle osmotic shock. The N-terminal sequence of ModA confirmed that a leader region of 24 amino acids was removed upon export from the cell. ModA gene product is essential for high affinity molybdate uptake by the cell.
Module 1: Armed with Molybdate
Schematic representation of cell surface display using INP. INPN domain and surface display with only the N-terminal anchoring domain. ModA is shown in orange.
We transferred plasmids into E.coli Prometheus to make it express a special fusion protein: one side of it, INPN, anchors on the outer membrane, and the other side, ModA, absorbs molybdate. The engineered E.coli Prometheus can thus recruit molybdate.  With the help of auxin tendency system design by Imperial College 2013, our Prometheus would head for the roots.  We also design a suicide clock system for bio-safety concerns. E.coli Prometheus will deliver Mo directly to the root of plants, so the heavy mental pollution of Mo will almost decrease to Zero according to our experiment results. This will also open a new chapter of biological fertilizer.
Module 2: Delivery System
The plants root exudates contain TCA intermediates that can attract chemotaxic bacteria. E.coli have five kinds of chemoreceptors, interacting with factors on flagella and inducing chemotaxis; but they don't have receptors for some specific TCA intermediates.  In this respect, Pseudomonas putida can help, with its McpS, like McfR, which can detect malate and succinate.  We made the part BBa_K1405004 to include the McfR sequence. We then detected the chemotaxis towards malate and succinate of both of our part BBa_K1405004 and BBa_K515102.   At last, we designed a model to mimic the movement pattern and predict the efficiency of the Prometheus E.coli.

4. Tracing back.
After filling the complete scoring matrix $H$, a traceback ensues starting at the highest score in the matrix and ending in a cell with score $0$. To obtain a second best alignment, the same is done for the second highest score.
Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
The Needleman-Wunsch ( Needleman et al., 1970 ) algorithm differs from the Smith-Waterman algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) on initialisation, scoring and traceback and computes global instead of local alignment. In the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the first row and first column are subject to the gap penalty. Also, in the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the scores can be negative. Lastly, the traceback always starts at the lower right corner of the matrix and ends at the upper left corner.
Combination of Scoring
We use the Smith-Waterman algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm ( Needleman et al., 1970 ) to compute the local and global alignment of the input sequence with respect to our custom database. Additionally, we use a hybrid form, semi-global alignment that has been implemented in the BioStrings package in R ( Pages et al., 2018 ). We then study the effect of each alignment algorithm on the gene doping classification. We add all alignment scores for a sequence to give a final total alignment score. We varied the weights of the different alignment scores to identify their influence on the characterisation of gene doping and found varying outcomes, as can be seen in the results section.
Machine Learning
We use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify the input sequence as natural EPO, artificial EPO or other DNA. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is a non-parametric pattern recognition method that can classify elements based on their value compared to direct nearest neighbors. In this instance, we chose to classify based on the four nearest neighbours. If no distinction can be made based on the four neighbors, the algorithm as has been implemented in R ( Torgo, 2010 ) will tell. The classification is carried out in two steps. First, the input sequence is aligned to natural EPO DNA. In a second step, the input DNA is aligned to gene doping DNA, resulting in the distinction between gene doping DNA and any other non-EPO DNA.
Input Parameters

To further optimize their software, they have put intervening sequences, random mutations, degeneracy to test the sensitivity and specificity. In practice, they screened all the registry of iGEM and gave an analysis of the result.
Safety
Actually, this project focuses on biosafety from head to toe.
First, it is very persuasive since they didn’t construct any BioBricks, which won’t pose any threats to the environment. Secondly, they also used the reconstruction of the 1918 Spanish flu virus in 2005 as an example to disclose the “double-edged sword “characteristics of synthetic biology, thus put more emphasis on the importance of “GenoTHREAT software” as it can rapidly screen any potentially harmful agents.
Last but not least, they have put it into practice by screening all the registry of iGEM. It showed that after screening the first 1724 first sequences of this registry, the hit rate was reduced from 6.5% to 2.9% by altering certain program parameters. Following further analysis they also ended up with one true hit: the sequence BBa_I10020, which was already claimed dangerous by iGEM. These studies thereby give a strong proof of the accuracy of “GenoTHREAT software”.

UCL,2017,Team:UCLouvain#Badge_-_-_TEXT.html," hole in the capsule, this one serves as an opening to fill the ring and as the second cooperating part regarding the biosafety mechanism. You can also find a little bump on top of the ring, which is hanging inside. This ring is placed around the capsule, which is already inside the support. The ring needs to be able to turn freely around the capsule, only limited by the small bumps.
A seal is needed in-between the last two parts to ensure that there are no leaks. Once the three parts are assembled and filled with their respective liquids, the badge is finished and ready to be used.
In order to secure the capsule into the support, you need to put the capsule into the support first, by matching the teeth with the grooves. Then you add the safety ring around the capsule, making sure that the holes are not facing each other. Finally, you turn the safety ring clock wise. When the bumps on the capsule and on the ring come into contact, continuing turning will force the capsule to turn with the ring. It will be secured inside the support, thanks to the groove at the bottom. The badge is now assembled and ready to be used as a UV sensor.
Once the capsule has been used, it needs replacing. To do so, simply turn the ring anticlockwise. Once the small bumps are in contact, keep turning. The small capsule will turn too, enabling it to leave the support with the ring. When the small bumps get in touch, both hole in the capsule and in the safety ring will perfectly match. This means that the solution of each compartment will be mixed together. The bleach will kill all the bacteria, leaving nothing but dead cell fragments and protein aggregate. Using this mechanism, we ensure that every time a capsule is replaced, the bacteria inside the old capsule are killed. The capsule can then be trashed safely or recovered to replenish it with bacteria.
Our prototype was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2X Experimental 3D Printer and with polylactic acid (PLA) as a polymer. The top of the capsule was not printed due to some technical limitation. Nevertheless, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) could be used as it allows light transmittance in the visible range and at our desired wavelength (365 nm)[1].

However not everything is as straightforward as it seems; the bands exhibited when restriction enzyme-treated mini-prep samples were run on the gel on Friday weren't what was expected. Whilst the backbone fragment looked realistic, the small insert fragment looked significantly smaller than it should have done. As suggested in the previous lab session this result could be due to the efficiency of the restriction enzymes, which came from previous aliquots (they did not come straight from the original container meaning they may not work as well)
Friday's lab session also involved Team Newcastle's first attempt at carrying out a PCR reaction. To prove that the plasmid pGFP-rrnB had truely integrated into the amyE gene in the Bacillus subtilis genome (in those B. subtilis which had been transformed), the Metal Sensor team carried out PCR reactions using primers which correspond to regions within the amyE gene in the Bacillus genome. Any PCR products that arise from the different samples we used can determine whether the plasmid has truely integrated.
In any case today's work involves removing the ethanol from the DNA and concentrating it (as observed in the midi-prep protocol). We also hope to make some agarose gel up and run the digests of the midi-prep samples on it through DNA gel electrophoresis. In addition to these tasks, we hope to prepare the PCR 'results' and run them on the gel in DNA gel electrophoresis; once analysis has been made and the verdict given we can decide on where we go from here.
Practical Outline
These are the tasks that the Metal Sensor team are aiming to complete by the end of the day:
Run the PCR 'products' on agarose gel (DNA gel electrophoresis)
Carry out ethanol precipitation of midi-prep DNA samples and concentrate them.
Treat the midi-prep DNA samples with restriction enzymes and run them on the gel also
Procedure
PCR Products analysis
The PCR samples
We prepared the PCR reaction products in the way in which we would treat normal DNA samples, which can be found in the DNA gel electrophoresis protocol , i.e. 9 microlitres of DNA to 1 microlitre of dye.

We need to make sure that our audiences know that this modeling approach can be used to model any biological systems that could be defined by compartments and interactions (it is really hard to find any biological systems that do not have any compartment (such as membranes) and  interactions). We also need to insure that we demonstrate the features available in our framework, such as the nice interface we have which makes it very user-friendly as well as various results that it can produce. The good news is we are the winners of aGEM and we still have time to work on our projects to make them even better.

Review of aGEM
Alberta Ingenuity's very own Jen Hill came to visit today with the entire team, and we discussed the aGEM competition. We talked about things that we had done quite well, and things that we need to improve on for aGEM. The largest improvement can be made with respect to finding a 'link' between the four aspects of our project to make sure this is clear. SecondLife must also be a point of great emphasis when we are at aGEM because of the impact it will surely have in the field of educational technology with respect to Synthetic Biology.
KATIE
Follow-up of aGEM
This week there was a meeting to review aGEM, which was a successful precursor to the actual iGEM competition in Boston. It was useful to become more comfortable in that sort of environment, but on a small scale before being faced with the stress and the pressure that will most likely be placed on the team at MIT. It was also a good opportunity to learn about the different approaches the other teams in Alberta are taking for their projects, which contrast to ours quite a bit and it serves to provide some focus as to what needs to be improved and completed before the international competition.
During this time, I also discovered that the PCR script in the second lab was an older version that the one in the first lab so I have spent some time looking over it and testing a few parts of the script once it had been altered to mirror the functional PCR machine.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," also plugins for Maya that can be used for modelling biological parts such as proteins or enzymes. This week we also continued exploring and researching the Arduino Uno's functions as well as continuing to look into different designs of a device and how we would improve production to produce a low cost but effective device.  Potential ideas have suggested to have a device that uses disposable strips for individual tests to reduce costs, while other models suggest effective technology such as microfluidics.  In coming weeks we plan to continue research and talking to professors about the benefits and drawbacks of these potential prototypes.  Using quantitative modelling in the future we will be able to effectively design such a device so that it operates at its greatest potential.  Additionally we want to look into what our system will use as a reporter, and how we will determine a threshold for the signal of the device
Week 4: May 26th - May 30th
This week was primarily focused on the use of Autodesk Maya and learning the functions of the program.  Initially Maya 2015 was downloaded, however due to compatibility issues 2013 will downloaded in the coming weeks to work effectively with the various plugins.  Tutorials were performed to learn the basic functions of modelling and animation of the program.  Using this knowledge we would be able to eventually use this programming to model the proteins of the project.  Additionally we continued to look into potential sensors that could be compatible with the Arduino Uno and what other designs could be used for a device.  As all team members are familiar with using Maya for modelling, we are planning on using the animation features to visually illustrate the biological processes that are occurring within the device when it is in use.  This will help to better explain the project through visual aspects and can cause a greater curiosity and interest in the device.  This shows the melding of biology and engineering and can communicate our system to viewers from all backgrounds with different levels of knowledge and perspective.  Learning all of the skills of Maya will be an ongoing process throughout the summer, however a focus was placed on developing basic skills this week as there is a large learning curve.
Week 5: June 2nd - June 6th
This week we continued using Maya for modelling and animation purposes.  We also began to explore and refresh our memories using Autodesk AutoCad and Inventor for design purposes, as well as downloading matlab for quantitative modelling.  Although we currently don’t have all of the necessary data for some of the proposed models, we are currently examining the software to see how we would create these models when the data becomes available.  We are continuing to gain more knowledge"

Dr. Kerr was our principal contact between stakeholders and experts in the bioplastic field. During meetings we discussed our project, objectives and approach to work out the story and how to talk to stakeholders. She advised us to use the expert's experience and point of view to get more specific information, define targets and to set goals prior to interviewing.

Plastics are one of the most versatile materials that are immensely beneficial to our society (e.g. food packaging which helps in reducing food wastage). However, their life cycle constitutes a big challenge. Current proposals to confront this issue include recycling, the reduction of plastic consumption, and a change from plastic to bioplastic. Nonetheless, it is necessary to consider the type of bioplastic and its life cycle. On top that, it is not recommended to consider bioplastics as carbon sink, instead we should look into the circular economy where plastic is use multiple times instead of one, in addition to the design of products where recycling could be possible. The major barrier in bioplastic production is the economy of scale – the increase in innovation can only happen with the increase in production, however the current condition does not permit that due to low sales.

The majority of the wikis have a menu which is usually the only part of the text that was captured (low word count). because most wikis have this format, this restricts the ability of this analysis to detect representative co-ocurrence word trends. We defined as usable wiki texts that did not contain the template text or provided a warning of no text.

Lajja heard back from the CTD administrators and they would be happy to have us visit a biology class.
Grant worked on preparing a presentation for the CTD kids; however, their age is still unknown so the level of the material can vary
The primers for e. coli phytase and e. coli clc antiporter came in!
PCR was performed to get the ECphy and the ECClc out of the K12 e. coli genome
Wednesday
Lajja confirmed that the age of the CTD kids will be 15-17 and that they already know much about biology
Grant worked on preparing a more accurate presentation for 15-17 year old CTD kids.
The team brainstormed possible avenues of keeping older kids interested in a presentation. Specifically, ideas about transforming some simple biobricks from the registry that did “cool” things were thrown around. For example: GFP/RFP/CFP, luciferase, e. coli that smell like bananas or wintergreen
Brian, Grant, and Mike went to a biotechnology lecture on modeling in metaboloic engineering. Although insightful, much of the lecture was above our heads.

Sensitivity Analysis
We performed sensitivity analysis to give us insight into which parameters will have the greatest effect on each species in
the reaction equations. We calculated the local derivatives of each species with respect to the parameters to determine how
much the parameters affected the result. The concentration of methylmercury in the cytoplasm was found to be most sensitive
to the V and K parameters of MerB. Additionally, the concentration of Hg in the extracellular space and cytosol were both
most sensitive to the V and K parameters of MerA. We can use this sensitivity analysis as a guide to what parameters are most
useful to improve. If we want the device to be more efficient at methylmercury conversion, efforts should be directed towards
improving the enzymatic activity of MerA and MerB.
Device Design
This device incorporates two key elements of mechanical engineering design: simplicity and functionality. Key concepts from fluid mechanics are applied to pump water into and out of the encapsulation as efficiently as possible. The system can be placed in or out of the water, which makes it easy to use in any situation. The sleek aluminum casing offers a durable resistance to the ever-changing surroundings and environment. Overall, the simplicity of the design makes it user-friendly and adaptable.
Our design is very similar to commonly used fixed-bed adsorption and ion exchange columns in that it involves flow of a fluid down through a packed bed that removes a solute. However, an important difference is those types of columns contain chemical resins or adsorbents that can become saturated (i.e. reach capacity) as they adsorb solute. Since we use encapsulated bacteria whose ""capacity"" is only limited their lifetime, our device has the added benefit that the mass-transfer zone (the part of the column where the solute is removed) doesn't move down the column due to saturation. This also means that we don't need to alternate between adsorption and regeneration cycles.

Policies & Practices
Our Policy and Practices approach this year has focused on establishing an effective two-way discourse between our team and the public in order to inform our design, educate the public, and illuminate ethical issues related to both our project and integration of public opinion into project implementation. We focused our discussion on safety, ethics, sustainability, and intellectual property in order to design a project that fits the needs of the public while maintaining technical viability and high potential for commercialization. Our team did extensive educational outreach in addition to educating ourselves on public perception of our work. We used this"

Culturing
The record player has been rescued, the incubator designed, and the microbiome records fabricated.                     Now,                     time to bring everything to life!
First, is the question of how microbiome samples from different parts of the body grow, in various                     conditions. During this phase of experimentation, we attempted to culture the microbiome on various                     mediums at different temperatures, ultimately settling on a solid agar medium and a combination of                     incubation and room temperature settings.
Then, how to replicate these results on our unique record plates? This second part involving the                     pouring                     of the agar medium into these plates, and then replicating results once more, but at the community                     lab.
Protocol
All materials, such as glassware and acrylic record dishes, were disinfected with Kimwipes soaked in                     isopropanol; additionally, all lab members wore disposable vinyl gloves when handling all chemicals                     and other materials.
In a 1 liter glass bottle, 25 grams of LB and 15 grams of agar were added to distilled water to                     create a                     1.5% agar medium. The bottle was capped, inverted, and shaken to mix the solution thoroughly. The                     solution was microwaved for 30 second intervals until boiling, and intermittently stirred to ensure                     proper mixing. After the mixture began to boil, it was microwaved for an additional 20 seconds                     (beware                     of splashing), and then removed from the microwave and placed in a water bath to quicken the                     cool-down                     and control temperature. Once the solution was sufficiently cooled (until a hand could be placed                     comfortably on the container for 5 seconds), portions of the solution were poured into smaller 80mL                     beakers and used to pour the medium into the plates. Disposable plastic pipettes and micropipettes                     were                     used to remove bubbles and even out medium distribution between the divisions on the plates. Once                     the                     medium solidified, lids were placed on the dishes, which were then sealed with parafilm. All plates                     were                     stored in the community lab fridge at 4°C.
Plates were inoculated with body bacteria using cotton swabs and distilled water. After dipping a                     cotton                     end into the water, the swabs were rubbed 1) under the tongue, 2) around both armpits"

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the volume of spheres, which is more generally known, and defined as Volume Sphere = 4/3π * r3. Using this formula, we got a volume of 0.88 μm3 = 0.88 * 109 nm3. When dividing the volumes, you would think that this means that there are about 1,2 * 107 proteins in one droplet. However, this is not quite the case, as you have to take into account that sphere packing has a lower density and that there are different ways of packing, and we don’t know which is applicable yet. If we assume there is a surrounding of 4 molecules, as in a tetrahedral lattice, there are only 4,1 * 106 molecules that should fit in the droplets.
Because simulating that many molecules takes a lot of computer memory, which Eindhoven didn’t have, they rescaled the system. A yeast cell has a volume of 42 ± 2 μm3 [3] and they used a simulation box with the size of 10 μm3. If we rescale the measured droplet size, which is 2% of the yeast volume, we expect to have cluster that also have a size of 2% of the initial amount of molecules. This would indicate that the simulated complexed would have an average size of somewhere around 60 molecules, as the initial amount of molecules was 3010. In the table below you can see what the results of the simulation for different valences are, and that the average complex size of 60 lies between a valency of 3 and of 4.
We used disordered regions that can interact with itself, the valency is not specified and indeed can differ for each protein.

Microscopic image of G. lucidum mycelium, taken by team member Leo Penny and advisor Lynn Rothschild.
The mycelium is then able to grow and completely fill the plate. An uncontaminated mycelium culture is characterised as completely white, with a fluffy texture. To prevent contamination, all procedures were formed under a sterile laminar flow hood. Below on the left (Figure 1) is a contaminated plate of mycelium, while on the right (Figure 2) is a photo of a well established culture.
Figure 1: Contaminated plate of mycelium.
Figure 2: Well established mycelium culture.
Once a culture of mycelium is well established, pieces of mycelium may be extracted from a single source plate and transferred to other plates of PDYA. This reduces the potential for contamination of mycelium plates as it reduces the chances of bacteria from the live fungus to be transferred onto the plates of PDYA.
Two forms of Ganoderma lucidum were grown; one was the monokaryon, and the other was the dikaryon. A monokaryon is a fungal cell which has only one nucleus. In contrast, a dikaryon is a fungal cell that has two genetically distinct nuclei, although they are allelically-compatible. These two species were provided courtesy of Perez. Based on the analysis done by Perez’s lab the dikaryon variant grows at greater speeds and produces composite materials with greater strength. The monokaryon was grown in addition to the dikaryon as it was easier sample to isolate a sample as it was grown in a petri dish, while in contrast the dikaryon first had to be grafted from a live mushroom that was gifted to us.
Substrate Tests
To further investigate the potential for using mycelium to grow materials and structures both on and off planet, the growth of mycelium on varied substrates were tested. Noteworthy substrates with exceptional material and environmental promises are yard waste, sawdust, used ground coffee beans, and other forms of food waste. Even more importantly, the mycelium successfully grew on lunar and martian regolith simulant with minimal nutrients added in the form of PDY. Below is a table of all the various substrates that the Ganoderma lucidum mycelium was grown on with attached images.

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"The far1 of △far1+△sst2, △far1+△sst2+△ste2 is knocked out successfully, and these strains will still keep growing under the effects acted by α factor and Zone of inhibition will not be shown either.
Fig.3 inhibition zone of △far1+△sst2 and △sst2+△far1+△ste2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion： Knock out the gene sst2 can eliminate the inhibition of the signal so that the strain △sst2 can amplify the signal when cultured with α factor. From the results above, the strain △far1+△sst2 didn’t stay at the phase G1, because the gene far1 knockout eliminates the growth arrest. Gene ste2 knockout makes the strain don’t response to the α factor.
Growth curve
Research the impacts acted by the various concentrations of α factor to the growth tendency of these strains in the liquid medium.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
Plan and method
The growth tendency of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by the initial concentrations of α factor from 0µM to15 µM. We planned to cultivate every engineered strain with these concentrations of α factor and obtain the value of OD600 of these strains at wavelengths of 600nm during cultivation measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometer which was calibrated by the YPD solution without strains.
Results and discussion
(1) With the concentration of α factor increasing, the growth of CEN.PK2-1C was inhibited more obviously.
Fig.4 growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2 is lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It was strongly inhibited by α factor.
Fig.5 growth curve of △sst2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion：From the results above, we could see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain would be inhibited by α factor. With the increase of the concentrations of the α factor, the inhibitory effect to the growth of the strains enhanced. Obviously, knocking out the gene sst2 makes the strain respond to α factor more sensitively.

Meeting the Waag society - Infinite Possibilities
Regular open Wetlab
We visited the Waag Society at one of the regular open Wetlab days. Every Tuesday evening, interested guests are invited to have a look at their FabLab as well as their biological lab and are encouraged to participate in various open discussions addressing a wide spectrum of scientific topics.

Residence of the Waag Society
Afterwards, Lucas Evers, who is leading Waag Society's Open Wetlab, gave us a tour through the castle tower, the Waag Society inhabits. Quite quickly, a diverse discussion group evolved, mainly consisting of students, artists and scientists. Some attendants were regular guests, others were visiting the Waag society for the first time.
The following discussions lasted several hours and covered projects of present as well as absent members of the Waag Society. We learned a lot about the multifarious prospects of DIY Biology and discovered the colorful world of bioart. The outlined bioart projects ranged from simply painting with different-colored microbes to experimentally expressing the behavior of a biological network as a theater play with actors as nodes of an computational algorithm. Using bioart as a starting point, the Waag Society also promotes controversial debates about the progress and opportunities of synthetic biology and biotechnology in general.

In addition to private persons, also newly founded national and international Community Labs use this service.  To make this possible and to maintain the platform provided by the Waag Society, they do not only receive membership fees and donations but also governmental funding.
To sum up, the Waag Society is multinationally connected and involved in a variety of different DIY Biology projects. When we mentioned that this year only one European Community Lab is participating in the iGEM Competition, they revealed"

As reviewed in the MFC part of our wiki, the DET route depends on the c-type cytochrome (MtrC and OmcA) in the cytoplasmic membrane interacting with the electrode. It can also use nanowires to transfer electrons to the electrode that is located distantly from the cells.
 
In the iSO783, we considered the reaction flux of CYOO2 as our optimization objective as it involved in the reduction of a type of cytochrome c protein, denoted as Cco (SO2361 and SO2362 and SO2363 and SO2364) or Cyco (SO4606 and SO4607 and SO4609) in iSO783). In such case, the reaction flux of CYOO2 is taken to estimate the DET flux.
 
DET- Lactate
As noticed the ability of S. oneidensis MR-1 utilizing lactate to generate electricity [3], we first examined the FBA model using lactate as the carbon source for electricity generation. We examined the effect of varying lactate uptake flux on two separate objectives, i.e. maximizing biomass growth and maximizing DET flux. We assume 5% of maximum growth as the boundary of biomass growth flux, which would be the minimum viable growth rates in practice as described by Mao [4].
Figure 4. The effect of lactate on maximum direct electron transfer(DET) flux of Shewanella utilizing lactate at viable growth flux boundary
Figure 4 shows that the DET flux reached a plateau at 81.68 mmol/gDW/h as lactate uptake flux increased. An upper bound existed such that increasing lactate uptake would no longer increase the electricity generation.
Figure 5. The trade off relationship between direct electron transfer(DET) flux and biomass growth flux when lactate uptake is set as constant
Noted that the biomass growth is driven to its lower bound when the optimization objective is set as DET flux, we studied the relationship between DET flux with biomass flux at constant lactate input. In figure 5, the DET flux first sustained at 81.68 mmol/gDW/h but then decreased when biomass flux increased beyond 0.164h-1. This implies the electricity generation could possibly be maximized when below a certain growth rate, however, higher growth rate could possibly decrease the electricity generation.

After we explained our project in quite some detail, Ms. Oosterwijk wondered whether our system would be able to precisely mark the location of landmines. “Many new methods to search for landmines have been developed, such as the use of dogs and rats, but in practice everybody still uses metal detectors, because these are the only devices which can precisely locate the landmines” We explained that, although precise localization will probably not be possible, our device can be used for screening purposes and that it will be especially strong in the detection of IEDs, which are currently hard to find due to low metal content. “If you get it working the way you envision, we will probably pop some champagne corks here at PAX!”
Finally, we asked whether or not a device like ours would pose a dilemma for PAX, since on the one hand it would be a step in solving the landmine problem, but on the other hand it involves synthetic biology, which might be conflicting with the Christian roots of PAX (Parent organizations IKV, which stands for interkerkelijk vredesberaad (interdenominational peace council), and Pax Christi, which is rooted in the Catholic Church, where both Christian organizations). “It would surprise me. PAX works on the basis of two central values of peace in conflict areas: human dignity; solidarity with peace activists and victims of war violence, so a world without landmines and cluster munitions. We are fully focused to fulfill that endeavor, so we would be very happy with any opportunity to do this. The requirements are implementability, economical feasibility and it should be comprehensive. Discussions that might arise from a method like yours are to be dealt with when they come.”

What is iGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine is a student-led synthetic biology competition with more than 280 participating collegiate teams worldwide. Each fall, teams from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas gather in Boston to share their research findings. iGEM is also much more than a competition. The iGEM Foundation is dedicated to education and competition, advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of open community and collaboration. The community has a long history of involving students and the public in the development of the new field of synthetic biology.
What is Synthetic Biology?
""If you ask five people to define synthetic biology, you will get six answers.""
--Prof. Kristala Prather, MIT
""Synthetic biology aims to make the engineering of new function in biology faster, cost effective, scalable, predictable, transparent and safe. It focuses on improvement of standard genetic engineering technology; development of standards for genetic assembly and rapid characterization; creation of families of genetic 'parts' that behave reliably in designated hosts and have no undesigned interactions; and generation of safe, robust host cells.""
--Prof. Adam Arkinm, UC Berkeley
""Synthetic biologists construct new biological entities—molecules, pathways, regulatory networks, organisms and ecosystems—by programming them, or reprogramming them, at the level of the DNA code. The new name 'synthetic biology' reflects an explosion in our ability to genetically engineer increasingly complex systems and the desire of scientists and engineers from fields outside molecular biology and genetics to participate in the fun, contributing to the technology and its applications.""
--Prof. Frances Arnold, Caltech
Simply put, it is a rapidly emerging field that combines biotechnology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, computer engineering, and is in many ways related to genetic engineering. It can be used to solve a wide variety of economic, scientic, and societal problems.

Smaller collaborations
In addition to the bigger collaborations we also Skyped with UPMC-Paris and UPS-INSA Toulouse , as well as distributed and answered the surveys by CCU Taiwan and iGEM IONIS-PARIS . We also gave our Finnish video with English subtitles about synthetic biology to team Tübingen’s YouTube channel, which we found from the iGEM collaborations. This gave more views for our video and helped to spread knowledge about synthetic biology while also giving more content to a fellow iGEM team’s YouTube channel. The channel and our video can be found here .
The Purdue University team approached us through email, as the previous Aalto-Helsinki team (2016) had built a very cool and trendy wiki page, and they wanted to do something similar! We directed them to some of the internet’s best resources to get started with web development and shared with them some code from the previous team, in order to highlight features that they wanted to implement.

“What can we do for the experimentalists?” I saw my team members. It’s the third time for me to take part in iGEM. Interestingly, in this time I am the only person with the background of biology, while nearly everyone’s background is solo. It is really a mixture. I hope there will be chemical reactions among us.

Environmental Safety
No biological system is leaked into the environment and measures are taken to limit the spread of potentially harmful genes.
E. coli DH10B and SURE were used exclusively when building our constructs. The SURE Competent cells are classified to be a non-hazardous substance. All DH10B cells are classified F- and thus do not possess the Fertility factor. The risk of these cells acting as a donor in horizontal gene transfer via conjugation is greatly reduced.
The E. coli DH10B bacterial cell strain possesses an amino acid leucine metabolism deficiency that reduces its competitiveness in the wild. Such phenotypes reduce its survival opportunities beyond the lab.
Prior to disposal, harmful waste (toxic and/or biohazardous) was clearly separated and sterilized, either by application of bleach, or autoclaving.
University Safety
Hong Kong Laws & Guidelines
The Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety under the Convention on Biological Diversity (the Protocol) was extended to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in May 2011. Under the Chapter 607, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Control of Release) Ordinance (the Ordinance), release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) knowingly without approval from the Deputy Director or an Assistant Director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is considered an offence. The full text of Cap. 607 can be downloaded by following this link.
No part of the project is directed for release into the environment. HKUST iGEM 2013 team experiments are concerned strictly with molecular cloning and testing of recombinant technology biomolecules. Application for approval to perform such a procedure under the Ordinance is therefore not required.
Laboratories in Hong Kong follow Guidelines on Biosafety in the Clinical Laboratory, a publication of the Centre of Health Protection under the Department of Health. The full text of the Guidelines can be accessed here . As our laboratory is operated by the university’s Division of Life Science, the activities performed within the lab adhere to the above Guidelines.
HKUST’s HSEO
The enforcement of safety regulations is handled by the university’s Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO). The HSEO also provide safety training for staff and students for safe laboratory.

A better understanding of what will happen when the VLPs are injected into the bloodstream, will result into a better treatment for patients.   To test the stability of the CCMV VLPs, we treat the VLPs under different conditions. One parameter we want to test is the temperature stability of the CCMV VLPs. To test this we put the CCMV VLPs for 24 hours in waterbaths with different temperatures. These temperatures range from 5 degrees Celcius to 40 degrees representing the ill human being. After the treatment we tested the samples under the DLS and EM.
Figure 6: The temperature stability measurements of the wildtype CCMV VLPs
Figure 7: EM pictures of wild-type CCMV VLPs after 24h heat treatment of 40 degrees Celcius
As seen in figure 6 and 7, the particles are still detected after a 24 hour treatment with 40 degrees Celcius. This means that the particles will not break down immediately  when exposed to the temperature of an ill human being.
CCMV VLPs are renowned for its wide pH stability. It is stable between a pH range of 4.7 and 6.5. At a pH of 4.7 the CCMV is in it's unswollen form  with a radius of around 14 nm. At a pH of 6.5 it is in its swollen form, the VLPs radius is around 15-16nm. It is possible to change form, but change the pH gradually with the use of dialysis. If you change the pH too sudden, the VLPs are falling apart and forms aggregates as seen in figure 8.
Figure 8: Wildtype CCMV VLPs aggregates after a sudden change of pH, taken with the EM
To test the stability of the VLPs during a long period of time, we designed an experiment. We produced multiple CCMV VLPs and measured them after 3, 6 and 24 hours after formation (figure 9).
Figure 9: The temperature stability measurements of the wildtype CCMV VLPs
It is shown in graph 3 that we still detect wild-type CCMV VLPs after 24 hours. In theory, under perfect conditions (pH at 4.7, T = 4 degrees Celcius) it is possbile to store the"
Arizona_State,2017,Team:Arizona State#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the inducible promoter to allow GFP to be turned on. If there is no transcription of our regulator gene, aka no AHL attachment to the promoter of the regulator protein,  our system won’t turn on. This will allow our team to run various experiments and see if it is working. This particular production of HSLs is just one one type of quorum sensing system out there and the type of system that is utilized in this project. We can test our system of senders and receivers for orthogonality by setting up induction experiments with different sender signals. A positive result means the sender signal will only turn on the GFP signal of one regulator gene, meaning the GFP is expressed in the system.
During the design conception of this project, we noticed that last year’s 2016 ASU iGEM team’s nonfunctioning receivers were not constructed properly on the DNA level.  Since Last year’s team only had one receiver, it  was difficult to find orthogonal pairs of sender-receivers. For this reason,we decided to design and synthesize new receivers for orthogonality testing. First, we researched into designing new promoters for AHL quorum sensing systems. In doing so, we found that the some of the receivers in the system researched last year did not have a proper inducible promoter. For example, some receiver systems did not even include an inducible promoter within their system; or they used a wrong binding site within the inducible promoter. For this reason, designing new inducible promoters for receivers was a top priority this year for our team.
Our team came across a paper by Spencer R Scott and Jeff Hasty from UC San Diego. They designed new inducible promoters that lead to better expression and easier cloning in their specific AHL related QS systems (Scott, 2016). Due to this, our iGEM team utilized their thought and design process into our systems. The goal of our project is to successfully incorporate inducible promoters into our system to have them respond to HSLs and induce expression of GFP in E.coli. In addition, we hope to find undiscovered orthogonality between our senders and receivers. Hybrid promoters Ptra* and Prpa* were created by replacing the lux-box in the commonly used PluxI promoter with the tra-box and the rpa-box, respectively (Scott, 2016). Using this idea, we created new receivers for our system with tra, rpa, and las genes to test in our experiments. In addition to this, new receivers of Bja (Lindemann,2011),"

All projects are pursuing a better future for human or industries. This seminar helped all teams to re-examine the feasibility and conprehensive aspects of their projects for further improvement.
Questions about BioWatcher asked by other teams in this mini-seminar:
1. Bioluminescence is too weak to penetrate tissue?
The bioluminescence used in BioWatcher has an emission wavelength of 490 nm. Although the intensity of bioluminescence at this wavelegth is not as strong as a aprt of it will be absorbed by body tissue, experiments proved the successful bioluminescence penetration captured under imaging system. Besides,the fact that this mild intensity of this bioluminescence is invisible to naked eye can ease the users’ concern of turning into green-glowing lamp.
2. Concerns about applying engineered cells in human bodies
The application of our system can be widely used in detecting soluble and insoluble ligands in the enviroment, living organisms and,our ultimate pursuit, in human bodies which post serious concerns. In terms of deliverying engineered cells into human body, invasive and noninvasive measures, such as injection, nasal delivery and viral therapy, are considered.However, we faced our biggest challenge--choosing the proper cell to be applied. Several aspects need to be evaluated including life span of the cells, its amount in circulating system, possible immune rejection…etc. As hard as it is, existing cellular immunotherapy is keeping our hopes up. Undoubtedly, this project is still immature. However, white blood cells and mesenchymal stem cells are our candidates so far.
Industry
Industry
On July 16th, we visited Singular Wings Medical, a very successful award-winning biotech wearables startup, to learn about biotech industry and how our project--BioWatcher is perceived in industrial and commercial point of view.
BioWatcher is a very novel and tentative idea, though; we believe BioWatcher has potential in the diagnosis industry. Entrepreneurship is the ultimate goal where biologists bring biotech into the real world and make the world a better place. Therefore, we presented BioWatcher to Singular Wings Medical, a very successful award-winning biotech wearables startup.
While Singular Wings Medical was very impressed with our innovative idea, several interesting and important concerns and useful advices were proposed during the discussion.
1. Why watch?
It’s true that watch is not the only available option for bioluminescence detecting devices.As Singular Wings Medical suggested,manufacturing a"

This is a gene for the lac repressor lacI with a LVA degradation tag. We used this BioBrick to build a tightly regulated lac-operon <partinfo>K389050</partinfo> with low basal transcription. It seems that this lacI is either degraded too quickly or it does not work properly because it is not possible to repress the lac operon with this part.

OUR TEAM
We are iGEM Colombia Team, we are students from Universidad         de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia and this is our fourth year in         the iGEM Competition.
In 2012 the team won the Regional Jamboree with a bacteria         capable of detecting a phytopathogen and alerting the plant of its         presence. Students from biological sciences, medicine, physics,         chemistry, computer and chemical engineering comprise our         team. We have students from different ages: we have master         students that help the smaller ones to learn the techniques and         undergraduate students that go from freshman to senior year.
OUR PROJECT
Cholera, caused by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, has     been a scourge to civilizations the world over since ancient times.     Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a V. cholerae     sensor using a new technique. We propose detecting V. cholerae’s     species-specific quorum sensing molecule. If we rewire V.     cholerae’s own quorum sensing mechanism in a harmless E. coli     chassis, we can build a biosensor that gives a color output when it     senses the pathogen.
