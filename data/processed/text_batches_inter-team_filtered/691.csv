As can be seen from the table, there is DNA presence in the samples. Therefore, something else should be causing the transformations not to work. Since last year's distribution kit plates are still available in the lab and those plasmids were not taken we will try to get these parts from 2015 distribution kit.

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

COLLABORATIONS
Tec-Monterrey
We turned our attention to computer-based modeling of biological systems as a less resource intensive and time consuming alternative to iterative experiments.
We had hoped to be able to build a reliable tool to predict the behavior of our co-culture, however, our team lacked the necessary experience in this field. As such, we were happy to be offered the possibility of a collaboration with the iGEM team of Tec-Monterrey. This team, unlike ours, is more experienced in modeling.
The model they provided to us uses the following equations:
Where [A] is the population of organism A, CA is it’s consume constant, iA is the Input resources available for A and Am is the maximum sustainable population.
And:
Where KA[B] is the influence of organism B on the resource availability to A, KA[C] the influence of organism C and the other variables are defined as above.
This is far more simple than our approach. It has however, also produced results that were useful to us. The model provided by Tec-Monterrey took a different approach to the concept of co-culture and it offered us new insights into our model. By allowing us to refocus our attention we were able to bring our own theoretical work to a point that is closer to reality than it had been previously.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Degradation_-_-_TEXT.html,". Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the"

1) Redesign of CUP1 promoter
First, based on the part (BBa_K2165004) provided by iGEM16_Washington, we tried to ensure the core sequence for transcription. Researches about this promoter mainly published in the 1990s, and the mechanism of induction has been researched thoroughly. There exist 5 ACE1 binding sites (UAS), 2 TATA boxes, and one initiation element in the promoter. The complex of ACE1 and copper ions will bind the promoter, which causes the activation of CUP1 promoter with TATA boxes’ help. ACE1 complex’s binding directly increases the possibility for TBP (TATA-Box Binding Protein) to bind the promoter, which can enhance the expression.
Fig. 4-3. structure of redesigned CUP1 promoter used in our project, based on BBa_K2165004
Fig. 4-3. structure of redesigned CUP1 promoter used in our project, based on BBa_K2165004
Based on this mechanism, we redesigned the part sequence provided by iGEM16_Washington. We deleted irrelevant based on the two ends of this promoter and retained the core sequence. In this way, this promoter played its key role with fewer bases. Strains of S. cerevisiae BY4742 containing either BBa_K2165004-yEmRFP and BBa_K2407000-yEmRFP with an initial OD600 of 0.1 were grown for 24 hours in SC-URA medium at 30 degrees Celsius, and then were induced with 0.1 mM Cu2+. Samples were tested with fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2700) after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.

Figure 4-4 shows the expression of yEmRFP with both the two promoters were very similar, so we can tell the deletion didn’t influence the core function of CUP1 promoter. Based on the new part, we carried out a further improvement.

At 2:00 we joined Dr. Jaime Jensen for an insightful, productive and encouraging meeting about our book.  Dr. Jensen has her Ph.D in biology education, and was able to offer some very good insights on our book, its parental guide, and the pre/post test questions we will administer.  Unfortunately, we have a significant roadblock: our project has not been IRB approved.  We weren't aware that in order to ask children to take a test on their understanding of synthetic biology and collect data there must be IRB approval.  So, we've either got to luck out with an exempt status, or rethink collecting data from school classrooms.  It would be less paperwork for us if we cleared a parental consent form with the IRB and visited a library, where we could ask parents to sign the form right there.
I found a protocol for purifying bacteriophage lambda! We hope to be able to do that tomorrow.

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

I am Kun Jiang, the cheif software developer in iGem 2010 USTC_Software team, responsible for designing the global architecture of our software and  developing the ODE Solver module, Berkley database interface module and several simple tools for teammates.
It is my second year of studying in computer applied technology lab of Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master candidate. I am interesting in software engineering and Computer Sicence.  Last year I noticed the recruit advertisement of iGem 2010 USTC_Software team in school BBS website. I make the decision to apply immediately. It's really happy for me during those past server months working with our team.
I play Ping Pong most during my spare time, because Ping Pong is a sport emphasizes on speed, skill and acting harmony ability rather than brute force. And I go jogging every day, which i think is a good way to relieve  pressure and keep me in health!
I want to be a brilliant software engineer developing some brilliant works. I gain strong knowledge in software engineering and computer algorithms. IGEM 2010 is one step to my ambitions,"
BYU_Provo,2013,Team:BYU Provo#Cholera - Detection_-_-_TEXT.html,"films with engineered enzymatic bacteriophage - this is a synthetic biology approach to, like the name of the article implies, engineering phages to break down biofilms!! Written by a Harvard-MIT researcher
KP 3/22/13 Today we decided to stick with the cholera project. I am glad, because at first I was slightly disappointed when I realized that our project wasn’t as novel as I originally thought, but I am still very interested. Today we realized that the most important thing that we can do now is to find a way to disrupt the biofilm from the outside. I found a summary article on using phage against biofilms and each one of us chose a few article to read in order to understand the best ways to tackle the problem. I like the idea the paper that Kendall cited above that talks about bacteriophage that have been engineered to express enzymes that degrade the biofilm. I think that that is a good approach because we can combine our findings with the phage group and have a great presentation.  Also, there is a lot of research that I have found from the papers that I have read suggesting that it is very possible to do what we will be trying to do.
NRS 3/22/13 After discussing it in class we decided to stick with the cholera project. We redivided the group and now I am in the biofilm destruction using enzymes group. We are going to try and read at least three articles by monday to help get a scope of the project and decide what we need to do with it.

With mutagenesis PCR we adapted the binding motifs in the cry3Aa gene on this construct. This was finished merely a few weeks before the wiki freeze. We intended to remove all the forbidden restriction sites, so we would be able to submit it as a real biobrick. Even though we ordered the primers to perform the four mutagenenis PCR's, we were not able to finish perform those in time. Since future iGEM teams still may want to use the gene, we did sent it for shipping to the iGEM headquarters.
Figure A2. Schematic overview of elements contained in this non-BioBrick.
A Positive Control for Testing the Cry3Aa Mutant Library
Taking a closer look at the protocol of the carboxyfluorescein leaking experiment performed earlier (link to protocol), the pH of the environment of the BBMVs was increased prior to the measurement itself. The increase of the pH influences the fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein 1 and could also influence the speed at which standard fluorophore leaking occurs. Hence, it will be difficult to compare data obtained at a normal pH compared to data obtained at a higher pH. On top of that, comparisons becomes even more difficult, since the protein concentrations are not known.
In order to be be able to compare the influence of Cry3Aa on T. molitor BBMVs and the influence of Cry3Aa with mutations in their binding sites on V. destructor BBMVs, the following construct, see Figure A3, was made by restriction digestion and ligation, creating pSB1A3. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3).
Sequencing results (link to sequencing results) and a colony PCR showed that this construct was correct for colonies 1 to 4.
Figure A3. Colony PCR of transformed E.coli with the verification primers. Lane 1 to lane 6 are transformants. Lane 7 is the positive control (pSB1A3 with RFP) and lane 8 is the negative control.
The proteins expressed by this bacteria were extracted and tested on BBMVs obtained from T. molitor. As a negative control the proteins expressed by the same strain but without the pSB1A3_Cr3Aa_TEV_HIS construct were extracted and simultaneously tested on brush border membrane vesicles obtained from T. molitor. 8 measurements were performed for both Cry3Aa and"

Work, work, work, work, you see me I be work with “Rihanna”. Yes, the insole is “Rihanna” featuring “Drake”. Strain “Drake” includes gene aarC to covert acetic acid into TCA cycle. It also competitively utilizes leucine to prevent the production of isovaleric acid in shoes.
Overview
Besides releasing AMP, we want to absorb the foot odor as well. Researches show that the isovaleric acid is key component to cause uncomfortable odor for human beings, though it only occupies 2.3% in the fatty acid components of foot odor. And another major component in the odor, acetic acid, which occupies 85.1% in the fatty acid components, contributes to the odor of sweat. (Figure 1)[1]. As a result, we decided to remove those two fatty acid components.
Figure 1
In order to reduce the acetic acid production, we utilize Succinyl-Coenzyme A (CoA): Acetate CoA-Transferase (aarC), which is derived from Acidophile Acetobacter aceti. aarC can transform succinyl coenzyme A and acetic acid into acetyl coenzyme A and succinic acid.
But for isovaleric acid, it’s hard to deal because we didn’t find specific enzyme to degrade it because it enters branched chain fatty acid metabolism pathway. But isovaleric acid is the degraded product of leucine which comes from the skin. As a result, we decide to competitively utilize leucine to prevent the production of isovaleric acid. (Figure 2)[2]

We want to overexpress the ABC transport of leucine, tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, a special synthesized gene called polyleu, whose coding protein is full of leucine to enhance the whole protein synthesis process. But at last"
Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#busi overview_-_-_TEXT.html," is also a more efficient means of individual testing. If a test on an individual must be performed and a sample from the subject cannot be stored due to the risk of hormone degradation, Researchers would currently have to use an entire monoclonal antibody kit to test it. These kits are designed to perform tests for many subjects at once and it would be wasteful to use a kit for only a few tests.
When BEAR reaches the diagnostician market, it can be assumed that each hospital that buys the device will need more than one to keep up with the demand for tests in multiple departments.
Synbiologica Ltd wishes to provide researchers with a new, faster, accurate method of hormone detection that will ultimately speed up the process and lower the costs of research. This will lead to new discoveries in many research labs, including the labs with which Synbiologica Ltd is associated. Money made by the company will be put towards further research and allow Synbiologica Ltd to continue development of biotechnological devices and technologies. Research done by Synbiologica Ltd and the labs with whom the company works will be the means of attracting the target market of hormone researchers.
Currently, the team members of Synbiologica Ltd work out of research laborator space provided by the University of Lethbridge as well as incubator space provided by Tecconnect.

Short introduction
Malaria is an infectious disease that affects 200 million people a year and lead to 400 000 deaths in 2017. It is spread worldwide with a concentration in subtropical and tropical areas. Malaria is caused by the parasite that is conducted through the bite of a mosquito. 1
Systematic classification
Plasmodium are pathogenic blood and tissue protozoa that infect humans. To date, five different Plasmodia have been recorded which cause different types of Malaria in humans. 2

disease
Plasmodium falciparum
Malaria tropica
Plasmodium vivax
Malaria tertiana
Plasmodium ovale

Plasmodium knowlesi
Different kind of Malaria
Symptoms
The incubation period in most cases varies from seven to 30 days. Shorter periods are observed most frequently with P. falciparum and longer ones with P. malariae.
Uncomplicated Malaria: This type lasts six to ten hours. Patients show following symptoms: a cold stage (sensation of cold, shivering), a hot stage (fever, headaches, vomiting; seizures in young children) and finally a sweating stage (sweats, return to normal temperature, tiredness).
Severe Malaria: This type causes serious organ failures or abnormalities in the patient’s blood or metabolism. The manifestations of severe malaria include for example cerebral malaria, with abnormal behavior, impairment of consciousness, seizures, coma, or other neurologic abnormalities, severe anemia due to hemolysis (destruction of the red blood cells), Hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine) due to hemolysis etc. 7
Medication
Medical treatment depends on already existing drug resistance, as well on the Plasmodium causing Malaria.
Different medication is applied whether the patient needs prophylactic treatment, “stand-by” therapy (emergency self-treatment in absence of a physician with existing symptoms) or a standard therapy and is also adjusted to the patient’s age and weight."

Alexis Info
×
Hello world! I’m Alexis, a student from Shenzhen College of International Education, blue-haired, not very humorous. This is my second year participating in iGEM but the first time as a team leader. I am involved in a lot of parts of mCATNIP, but mainly I focus on project design and team management. Speaking as a high school student, this experience with iGEM and synbio is simply fascinating: after being overwhelmed by the existing delicate rational designs, we get to create our own designs and build them from pieces. But it’s a huge challenge towards my resilience to be honest, especially when the transformation keeps failing and colony PCR shows no correct results. But still, I would listen to Paciencia y Fe by Lin-Manuel Miranda and continue working. Beyond iGEM, I’m a fan of musical theater, an equestrian enthusiast, and a cheese lover.

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," shown to penetrate and move through the membrane of eukaryotic cells and has also been previously used to deliver macromolecules through the membrane (Schmidt et al., 2010). Although this peptide is non-specific, it is a great proof of concept modification for cell-penetrating small molecule delivery.
Furthermore, the polyarginine tag enhances the modularity and accessibility of this part as they are also effective for purifying proteins (Fuchs and Raines, 2005). Thus, the MS2 capsid can be purified in one step using this tag. The polyarginine tag linker to the coding sequence has also been designed with a thrombin cut site for users who would like to exclude the cell-penetrating peptide.
Arc (Full-Length and ""Minimal"")
While virus-like particles are useful components of VINCEnT, we also wanted to develop a non-immunogenic PNC with RNA packaging capabilities. Such a tool could potentially enable simpler transfection of mammalian cell lines for fellow iGEMers and other researchers.
Arc is an activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein that has recently been recognized as a repurposed Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon. A bi-lobar domain within Arc has significant homology to Gag proteins, which are the major capsid proteins of many viruses including Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Rous-Sarcoma Virus (RSV). In response to synaptic activity in neurons, Arc proteins self-assemble via this Gag domain (similar to the related viral particles) to encapsulate Arc mRNA and shuttle it to neighbouring cells (Pastuzyn et al., 2018; Ashley et al., 2018).
For RNA encapsulation, we take advantage of the self-mRNA encapsulation strategy employed by Arc proteins in vivo. Based on sequence homology with HIV-1 Gag, the predicted mRNA encapsulation sequence is located within the N-lobe of the Arc protein and so fusion of cargo RNA to the Arc mRNA (or this short predicted consensus sequence) should enable encapsulation (Clever et al., 1995). However, Arc PNCs also readily encapsulate nearby non-specific RNA molecules lacking this consensus sequence in vitro (Pastuzyn et al., 2018). To test RNA encapsulation efficiency, Clover and mRuby RNA with or without the predicted Arc encapsulation sequence was incubated with Arc proteins in vitro before application to various cell cultures.
To ensure we would not retain any native Arc functionality that might impact cellular activity in culture, we also designed a “minimal” Arc"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.

Latest Advancements on Projects
Anabaena Transformation and Successful Cell-Type Specific Expression Control
We successfully transformed our cyanobacterial chassis, Anabaena PCC 7120, with our designed PowerCell genetic construct. Unlike more common cyanobacteria species such as Synechocystis PCC 6803 or Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Anabaena is not naturally competent and does not easily uptake foreign DNA. We performed a triparental conjugation in order to bypass the natural barriers to transformation.
To demonstrate that expression of our construct is properly co-localized to vegetative cells, we grew cultures of Anabaena in nitrate-free BG11 media to promote heterocyst formation. We demonstrated the successful control of our pSac promoter over our sugar secretion construct through GFP expression. The sugar secretion construct is only expressed in actively photosynthesizing cells. In the first picture, we observe areas of diminished GFP fluorescence at regular intervals (approximately 1 in 10 cells) along our transformed Anabaena filament (the background fluorescence is likely due to chlorophyll). Since our GFP reporter should only express under the pSac promoter and only in non"
Toronto,2014,Team:Toronto#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," up mutating are going to be the ones that eventually dominate the population.
A new approach: Plasmid loss genetic safeguard system
The way we've approached this issue is to make synthetic organisms lose their synthetic plasmids, instead of killing them outright. When we turn on a plasmid-loss system, most individuals in a population of synthetic organisms would lose the genes responsible for the engineered trait and revert to a wild-type genotype and phenotype. As in the kill-switch systems, a small proportion of individuals could still retain the engineered trait due to mutation inactivation of the genetic safeguard system. However, while we may not be able to get rid of mutation, we can remove the selective pressure on the non-mutants so that the mutants can't dominate the population.
Figure 1: The effect of (Top) kill-switch and (Bottom) plasmid loss genetic safeguard systems on a hypothetical population of synthetic organisms, containing a small proportion of mutant individuals resistant to the effect of the genetic safeguard. Not shown: the effect of genetic drift on the mutant sub-population over time.
Although resistant mutants are present in both the kill switch and plasmid loss systems, their evolutionary outcomes differ:
Kill-switch system: Once the system is turned on, all individuals with an intact genetic safeguard die, leaving a new population consisting entirely of mutant cells resistant to the kill switch. In evolutionary terms, the resistance allele has gone from a very low allele frequency to fixation (100% allele frequency). Since the non-mutants in the population are all dead, the mutant survivors have unimpeded access to all the resources available in the environment and are able to quickly grow and replicate.
Plasmid loss system: The allele frequency of the inactivated genetic safeguard does not change. This is because the individuals with an intact genetic safeguard do not die, they simply revert back to the wild-type genotype and phenotype. In the new population, the proportion of resistant individuals remains small due to competition from the majority of wild-type individuals.
The effect of genetic drift
Genetic drift is the effect of random chance on proportions of alleles in a population. In a population containing both mutant and wild type cells, the proportions of the two will fluctuate slightly every generation simply due to random variability. In most cases the effect of genetic drift is small. However, in a situation where there are very few mutants and many wild-type cells, the ""luck"" of these few mutant cells will have a disproportional effect on the overall proportion of mutants in the population.
In the kill switch scenario, the population of mutant cells increases quickly, so they are no longer susceptible to"

JOINN
In mid-october, our experiment has been basically completed. And we have completed the goals which we want to achieve before. We went to JOINN Laboratories, Inc. (one of the most famous biotech company in China) to communicate with our project. We had a clearer picture of the value of our project. They were interested in our project very much, and they gave us much advice about targeting the market.
Among these proposals from JOINN Laboratories, Inc., the followings are the more important ones:
(1) With the improvement of the life quality, people’s pursuit of health is getting higher and higher. People's appetite for food is mainly concerned with the followings:
① low calorie
② good taste
③ high sweetness
④ a sense of happiness
So on the basis of detecting the sweetness of sweet substances，we should think about taste and calorie of sweetness, which is important for our product to enter the market.
(2) Our biometric method involves the growth of the fungus, which may cause people to think about safety and health, so we should pack our items and ensure that the strain are safe and harmless.
(3) Before entering the market, we need to consider our project cost. Compared to the existing physical detection technology, our project cost shoule be an advantage.
ITCCC
In October, 2017, BIT-China was invited to take part in the the CGEM conference held by INTERNATIONAL TEENAGER COMPETITION AND COMMUNICATION CENTER. About 8 teams participated in the conference. All of them made splendid speeches to present their own projects and discuss with each other. During the special journey we got to know plenty of exciting ideas and got many useful help.
Conclusion
In our human practice, we got the idea of the project. Through this idea, we attached this idea to synthetic biology step by step. Finally, we completed it. In this process, we first understood the importance of sweetness for food through the form of social surveys. And we realized that people prefer natural sweeteners. Later, in order to target market, we went to one of China's most famous food companies, COFCO, learned that if we want to enter our project idea to the market in the future, we still faced with many problems. Such as cost, function and the value of the project itself. In addition, We"

Laccase Secretion Efficiency Model
Introduction
According to our project modules, we try to categorize our modelling into three parts.
The first one is from the Laccase Module, where we attempt to characterize our laccase construct from previous iGEM data.
The second one is from the Alkane Metabolism Module. We are fitting the kinetic parameters of fumarate addition mechanism to observe the activity of ASS and observe the rate of conversion from alkane to succinate.
While for the MFC module, we focus our modelling to establish data to find the optimum concentration for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 growth, as well as estimating the voltage and power density that can be produced.
 
Laccase Module
As there is little documentation about the usage of laccase from E. coli, we rely on the literature reviews [1] of laccase secreted by fungi to correlate with the number of alkane and alkene chains that can be formed. Using simple calculation, it can easily be translated that 2900 alkane chains (30%) and 900 alkene chains (10%) should be formed after polyethylene is treated with laccase for every centimeter squared.
Using UCL iGEM 2012 team's [2] findings on polyethylene degradation, we assume that the rate of degradation will eventually be linear with 0.9 PE molecule degraded per second, of which 28 molecules of alkane and 9 molecules of alkene will be formed in 100 seconds. Using the weight and the density of polyethylene, there would be 3.86×10-12 mm3 or 82,000 polyethylene molecules degraded within one day.
To improve BBa_K863006 obtained from the Bielefeld iGEM 2012, we try to characterize it by adding OmpA and his-tag. However, due to time constraint, our wet lab experiment could not acquire any valuable data and the modelling team will only rely on literature findings.
OmpA itself is a major protein that can be found in the outer membranes of most gram-negative bacteria, including"

2. Preparation of donor fragment
We designed homologous arms with the length of 50bp and 500 bp. The short one was designed on the primer, while the long arm was constructed through over-lap extension PCR                                     (OE-PCR).
After several times of try-error, we confirmed the comparatively optimal condition for lambda Red recombination. The target site is LacI and the host is DH5α. The homologous arm of 50 bp is enough for recombination.
Using the pKD3 as template, we added the cat expression cassette behind the testing parts, the whole donor fragment was sandwiched by 50bp left and right homologous arm.
Fig.2Four testing circuits used as our donor fragment
Fig.3 DNA Agarose Gel electrophoresis of donor fragments
3. Transformed the donor fragment through electroporation into the competent cell we prepared before
After transformation, we observed clones on the chloramphenicol plates. We selected the positives clones through colony PCR.
Fig.4 Recombination model and the sites of verifying primers
According to our design, the donor fragment is about 2000 bp, while the substituted fragment on genome is 1083bp, which means the successful integration will result in over 1000 bp increasing of length on the locus of LacI. We used the verifying primers to test whether we have successfully integrated these donor fragments.
Fig.5 The positive clones are 1~7, separately indicating the testing circuits above, and 8 is the negative control whose template is the original genome without any integration.
Compared with the negative control with no integration occurred, the colony PCR showed that we have successfully integrated the four circuits into the LacI locus of genome.
Site-directed promoter mutation
We have two combinations of inhibitor and ""in-promoter"": TetR-PTet, CI-PR. The strength of ""in-promoter"" will decide the expression level of killer gene. Directly applied these two combinations, we got the initial threshold. In order to adjust the threshold, we planned to mutate the ""in-promoter"" and got mutants with various strengths. We chose PTet as our target promoter. Through literature research, we chose the -35 region as our mutation region. We mainly used RFP to indicate the promoter strength in our wet experiment.

However, I also helped in proofreading other portions of the wiki, drafting survey questions, presenting at Biotechnology Information Night, and generally being a source of calmness and stability for the team. The highlight of this iGEM season for me lies in the time I spent studying abroad in England. It was nostalgic and encouraging to stay in contact with my team back in Wisconsin. Hearing about their progress on the project always brightened my day.
Ryan George
I am a senior Biochemistry major at WLC. I have been a part of the iGEM team for the past two years. This year I took a step back due to having multiple jobs, so I primarily worked on graphic and website design for the ‘tolsee’ project. My favorite part of iGEM this year was learning how to use Photoshop from scratch. During just about any day you can find me at one of my three jobs: I work as a dental assistant, ER medical scribe, and as a team lead concert technician. When I have time to life, I enjoy cooking and playing the guitar.
Lakaysha Blacksher
I am the Research Assistant to the Professor of Anthropology (Dr. Ned Farley) at WLC. I graduated from Saint Francis High School in 2012, and am currently a junior studying Biological Anthropology with an intended minor in Spanish. My involvement with this year's project is based in Human Practices; exploring the cultural boundaries and effects of introducing biotechnology to developing countries. My hobbies include billiards, music, reading, and crying before exams. I hope to use my degree to become a Forensic Investigator or professor of Anthropology. I intend to stay on with WLC's iGEM team until graduation, and also plan to publish several articles, including a study on Roman-era metallurgy.
Jacob Jodat
I am a junior biochemistry major with aspirations to attend medical school following my undergraduate education. This is my second year on the iGEM team. My role on the team was to assist with lab work, research diseases that are relevant to our project, and help out at our synthetic biology summer camp.  My favorite part about iGEM is getting experience in the lab. I enjoy being able to see the whole process of a research project rather than doing several unrelated labs one time in a class. Outside of iGEM I participate on the track and cross-country teams on campus.  I also work part-time as an ER medical scribe.  In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and watching"

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest_-_-_TEXT.html," an interdisciplinary scientific area that has recently developed. It links various fields of science like biology, chemistry, physics, molecular genetics, informatics and engineering.
Due to this combination the relation of biological design and function can be investigated from an entirely new perspective. The previous approach was limited to the examination of a structure and its function and the attempt to explain how they correlate. Recently, the reverse strategy is applied. Biological parts are specifically designed and constructed according to a desired function. These parts are characterized by a standardized modular design that facilitates their handling. The subsequent introduction of the synthetic constructs to living cells can either cause the replacement of original cellular components or result in additional elements that act cooperatively or more or less autonomously (see fig. 1).
Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz. (2011). Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits. SCIENCE, Vol. 333: 1244-1248.
Another very important and necessary feature of biological parts is orthogonality, which means in this context that independent devices can be combined unrestrictedly.   This principle derives from the area of engineering and aims to alter subsystems,   without impeding others.
This way cells can be modified as requested, resulting in a predictable behaviour. Among others, this technique can be beneficial for the effective production of certain substances, like biofuels or antibiotics.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#K343007_-_-_TEXT.html,"ublicate determinations of the light gradient experiment would have to be made. The data analysis also needs more time, since our team could only spend one day doing the experiments and another two days analyzing the results. So there are still a lot of parameters, like tumbling frequency, that simply have not been calculated.
Stability assay
To determine the stability of our pSB1C3-K343007 plasmid, a stability experiment was carried out according to protocol[ SA1.1 ]. E.coli MG1655/pSB1C3-K343007 was grown in LB media without chloramphenicol, whereby no selection pressure is exerted on the bacteria. Dilutions of the culture was spread on LA plates and LA plates with 35µg/mL chloramphenicol, respectively, and the colony forming units (cfu) was determined for each plate. The CFU for the LA plates represents the total amount of bacteria in the culture, and the CFU of LA plates with chloramphenicol correspond to the amount of resistant bacteria (those carrying the plasmid). The percentage of the total amount of bacteria carrying the plasmid was plotted in a semi-logarithmic graph as a function of number of generations.
Figure 8: Stability curve of E. coli strain MG1655-pSB1C3-K343007 showing that the bacteria shed the plasmids within 20 generations. All data can be seen under Raw data
As seen in the graph, almost all of the bacteria had shed the plasmid after 20 generations, suggesting that the plasmid is only stable within the cell for a few generations (<20). This is presumably due to the strain brought upon the bacteria by the plasmid. Thereby when the bacteria are carrying a high-copy plasmid like pSB1C3-K343007 it is plausible that the bacteria will quickly shed the plasmid when no longer exposed to a selection pressure.  It is likely to believe that pSB3C5-K343007, since being a low-copy plasmid, will not exert as much strain on the bacteria, and might therefore be stable for more generations than pSB1C3-K343007. Therefore a stability assay of this plasmid might be of interest.
Growth assay
The purpose of this assay is to see if our transformants deviate from the wild type in growth rate. In the growth measurement assay we have measured OD at 550nm every hour for 12 hours and at hour 24. In the experimental setup we used, no lag phase was observed in any"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," in pairs of neurons as light receptors. CoCHR is the channelrodopsin in transgenic AWA. In order to express CoCHR in AWA specifically, we express CoCHR through the linkage to the AWA cell-specific promoter odr-10. Thus, when we shed excitation light of around 470nm to transgenic C.elegans, the activated AWA is able to have obvious response such as body swimming towards. While wild-type C.elegans behave normally under the same stimulation. Whether the certain neuron is activated or not is indicated by GEM-GECO, a calcium indicator. In short, we established a light-sensed AWA controlling system, so as to utilize this part to manipulate the activation of AWA, establish the response to input stimulation. The merit of CoCHR is its sensitivity to light which is five-times larger than formal ChR2. Thus, the low intensity requirement prevents the cross-activation of Crimson(Chlamydomonas noctigama channelrhodopsin). Chrimson is another integrated channelrhodopsin in AWB. (Moreover, in order to indicate where the target neurons are, we also construct a fusion reporter protein called mCherry. At the same time, the fusion protein is allowed to estimate the expression level of CoCHR.)
Part: BBa_K2492002
In short: Part BBa_K2492002 codes mCherry, which indicates the position of neuron AWA. This fluorescence reporter direct reveals the position of transgenic neurons and roughly estimate the expression level of injected plasmids.
Universal mCherry coding sequence of three introns for capacity of expression in C.elegans. MCherry is a commonly used reporter. Since wild-type mCherry may not have high expression in C.elegans, artificial introns are inserted in the constructed plasmid[3]. We can obtain ord-10::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::mCherry transgenic offsprings through microinjection. MCherry driven by promoter ord-10(Part:BBa_K2492004) indicates the position of neuron AWA. Moreover the fluorescence of mCherry aids the imaging for the neuron AWA pattern. The intensity of fluorescence reveals the expression level approximately.
Part: BBa_K2492003
In short: . BBa_K2492003(GEM-GECO) is an calcium ions indicator part, it provides the function of monitoring and responding to the concentration of calcium ions. This part provides us with more direct visualisation of neuron activity.

Problem Lambert iGEM Strived to Tackle
884 million people lack access to clean water, and 3.4 million people die every year from water-borne diseases. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive, efficient water-borne disease detection mechanism.
Cholera takes the lives of approximately a million people annually. Due to their prevalence in developing nations such as Yemen, strategies are being employed to solve these critical issues; however, these methods are often ineffective and expensive. Cholera cases are concentrated in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene and in places suffering from economic instability; therefore, these pathogens are able to thrive. Without an effective solution, cholera cases will continue to claim millions of lives in the future. The 2018 Lambert iGEM team strives to develop a practical, yet efficient detection mechanism to ensure that these epidemics can not only be detected but prevented as well.
Project Goals
Construct an inexpensive and efficient detection tool-kit for pathogenic cholera
Develop and distribute alternatives for expensive lab equipment such as the Chrome-Q and 3D Fuge
Contribute to an open-source platform to advance the field of genetic engineering and disease detection
Create a software model through machine learning to predict the occurrence of cholera outbreaks
Educate and inform the public about the devastating effects caused by pathogenic cholera
Empower the next generation of scientists by planning a 3-day summer camp and by designing a girl scouts kit
Toehold Switches | Why?
A significant obstacle in diagnostics: lack of accessibility and practicality.
Many developing nations lack a simple yet specific test to detect waterborne diseases such as cholera. Toehold switches are biosensors that can activate gene expression in response to a specific RNA sequence.

PcomFA promoter was assembled with the promoter measurement kit BBa_E0240 to give the PcomFA Measurement Kit BBa_K1379003 in plasmid pSB3K3. The construct was further assembled with σX generator BBa_K1379006 to give BBa_K1379007 .
Qualitative characterization was performed by comparing intensities of GFP signals from colonies of E. coli DH10B strain holding the PcelA and PcomFA Measurement Kits with and without the σX generator under a fluorescent macroscope with UV filter. Measurement kit for standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 , BBa_I20260 was used as a positive control; BBa_E0240 was used as the negative control for background fluorescence.
Quantitative characterization was performed following the protocol described in “Measuring the activity of BioBrick promoters using an in vivo reference standard” (Kelly et al., 2009). E. coli DH10B strains holding the constructs with or without σX generator respectively were grown to mid-log phases. GFP intensities and cell densities were then sampled every 30 minutes for 5 consecutive time points to obtain growth rates and GFP synthesis rates. The GFP synthesis rates were then compared to that of standard reference promoter BBa_J23101 measurement device BBa_I20260 to obtain the Relative Promoter Units (RPUs). For subtraction of background fluorescence, pSB3K3 holding BBa_E0240 was measured alongside. The measurement was done with 3 replicas.

iedere speler kan elke strategie kiezen op voorwaarde dat je tegelijk aangeeft voor welke bacteriekloon ze bedoeld is, bv. door een AND poort te gebruiken met steeds een specifieke input voor kloon 1 (rood) of kloon 2 (groen) en een andere input die het personage bepaalt
Als major input van de AND gate is bvb een T7 polymerase ideaal. Dan zijn de output promotors zeker vrij onderdrukt als er geen signaal gegeven is en moet de T7 promotor gewoont telkens gecombineerd worden met een activeerbare operator (eg Lac operator) voor bepaalde strategie-parts. Stel dat je in klone 1 het T7 polymerase gen achter een lichtsensing promotor zet (werkt de lichtsensor eigenlijk al endelijk) en in klone 2 lichtsensing promotor - invertor - T7 pol gen. Dan is er altijd iemand aan zet (licht = player 1, donker player 2 bvb), verspillen we niet te veel parts en blijven de dubbel gecontroleerde promotors haalbaar. - Zeunas 21:45, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
we hebben de originele lichtsensor (niet-BioBrick versie) ondertussen in huis en die blijkt perfect te werken volgens anderen maar wij hebben hem nog niet gebruikt - Ingethijs 10:53, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
De andere mogelijkheid lijkt mij een Ribokey ipv het T7 polymerase gen. Heeeeeeel gemakkelijk te combineren met allerlei induceerbare promotoren in de registry (de ribolocks dan). Bespaart dus wel wat werk in vgl met de T7 approach maar zal een hoger basaal expressieniveu van de verschillende strategie-parts tot gevolg hebben vrees ik. - Zeunas 21:45, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

No Lag phase is seen.All data can be seen under Raw data
From our data we see no significant difference between the plasmid carrying bacteria and the wild type. This can be said to be quite contradictory to our results obtained from the stability assay. The transitory stability of pSB1C3-K343006 suggests that it is highly unfavorable for the bacteria, wherefore it might be expected that the growth of the bacteria containing this plasmid would be affected. Thus, however large a disadvantage the plasmid pose to the bacteria, their growth are not significantly influenced by the plasmid. The added reproduction load due to the plasmids, might also prolong the lag phase of the bacteria. Whether this is the case can not be concluded based on this experiment as no lag phase was observed in this experiment.

Communication
On July 25th 2014, the iGEM team SCU-China from Sichuan University went to our school and communicate with us. We exchanged our project with them. We led them to our lab, talking about the school life in school respectively. The number of people from SCU was 6, and at the end of the activity we gathered to have a lunch.
Communication
We sat together to chat, and briefly talk about our project and experimental schedule. The students from SCU were astonished that we chose plant as our target organism, because the lifecycle of plant is a little bit long and that was also why they chose microorganism as the targeted object.
Visit our lab
After a small talk, we led them to our culture room where we placed our transgenic tobacco. We introduced the transgenic tobacco to them, and briefly gave an account of the experimental schedule of our project. We all felt a little bit nervous whether we could finish our project in time at the end of September.
One member of SCU iGEM team was introducing their project after listening to our project. They said they were astonished by the desire of us to use plant as experimental materials. And they expressed their views on our experiments.

3. Isolation of the plasmid DNA
1. Transfer the cleared lysate (approximately 850 μl, Section 3.B, Step 6) to the prepared Spin Column by decanting. Avoid disturbing or transferring any of the white precipitate with the supernatant.
1. If the white precipitate is accidentally transferred to the Spin Column, pour the Spin Column contents back into a sterile 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for another 5–10 minutes at maximum speed. Transfer the resulting supernatant into the same Spin Column that was used initially for this sample. The Spin Column can be reused but only for this sample.
2. Centrifuge the supernatant at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 minute at room temperature. Remove the Spin Column from the tube and discard the flowthrough from the Collection Tube. Reinsert the Spin Column into the Collection Tube.
3. Wash the plasmid DNA.
1. Add 750 μl of Column Wash Solution.
2. Centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 minute at room temperature.
3. Remove the Spin Column from the tube and discard the flowthrough.
4. Reinsert the Spin Column into the Collection Tube.
4. Wash again the plasmid DNA.
1. Add 250 μl of Column Wash Solution.
2. Centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 2 minutes at room temperature.
3. If the Spin Column has Column Wash Solution associated with it, centrifuge again for 1 minute at maximum speed.
4. Transfer the Spin Column to a new, sterile 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube, being careful not to transfer any of the Column Wash Solution with the Spin Column.
5. Elute the plasmid DNA
1. Add 50 μl of Nuclease-Free Water to the Spin Column, wait 5 minutes
2. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute at room temperature in a microcentrifuge.

We tried traditional digestion and ligation to construct ACEB but we found that four segments ligation is hard to be achieved and time-consuming. As an alternative, we used Gibson assembly to assemble four segments at the same time. More details on the Gibson assembly can be viewed in Protocol page .

Evry,2015,Team:Evry#Practices#Innovative_-_-_TEXT.html,"1986 to 2000 (Lichtenberg 2005). This particular economic situation, greatly influenced by health preoccupation contributed to the develoment of new funding approaches to support innovative drug development. Here we explored some funding alternatives to traditional funding approaches.
From Rock band to innovative drug development : The Crowdfunding
Watch the interview video.
Developped in the eighteenth century, Crowdfunding was first recorded successful in 1997, when a British rock band funded their reunion tour through online donations from fans. Then, in the last decade, this new method of funding evolved as an industry and emerged as a popular option for entrepreneurs to validate their ideas, gain exposure and funding. As a result, crowdfunding revenue tripled from 530 million dollars in 2009 to 1.5 million dollars in 2011. Crowdfunding grew so important that it led Barack Obama to sign the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act into law more commonly known as the « crowdfunding bill ». The JOBS Act was finalized earlier this year in March 2015, as the Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC), a governmental organization whose aim is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, approved the final rules to activate implementation of Regulation A+, which represent a major breakthrough in the crowdfunding as it allows startups and small businesses to raise a maximum of 50 million dollars through crowdfunding under law.
As much of an interesting way to fund innovative drug developpment crowdfunding represents, we are still far from the 1 billion dollars needed to go through every stages of the drug development. Furthermore, an article from the NewsRX Health published on August 30th 2015, titled « Patient-funded trials may do more harm than good, ethicist warn », was concerned about taking advantage of sick patients desperate to live: « But patient-funded trials often attract people who are seriously ill and therefore willing to take large risks. They also allow clinics to pop-up that are clearly motivated by profit under the guise of offering new interventions, some of which do not have sufficient basic science findings to support them ».
The participatory funding or Crowdfunding, is a way for companies, associations and private person to finance their project.   This system allows pooling person and skills around project and to promote a start-up or an association in development.  The funds collected can have four origins:
The donation: In the case of simple donation, a natural or legal person (company) gives money for a Company or an association receiving. The donator earns nothing, only the satisfaction of having"

Theoretically, you could copy and put specfific DNA in the place of crime scenes to frame somebody for a certain crime. How can we prevent such misuse?
Gain
Every new technology and its increasing availabilty harbors potential risks. But in assessment of its usefulness the balance of risks and gains has to be evaluated. If we consider Community Labs, there is a great number of advantages in the growing BioHacking scene, too!
Deeper discussions: If people have fun in doing their own experiments, they will speak about it with their friends and acquaintances. This can promote having deeper instead of superficial discussions about the features of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. If the general public has access to methods to determine e.g. what is in their food and everyday products, this will not only lead to a better consumer protection but also to a better acceptance of these methods. The fear of GMOs would decrease if people found out that about 70% of their food and a lot of their everyday life products somewhere in their production chain derive from GMOs or their products.
Educational opportunities: The more people getting the opportunity to realize their ideas the higher the diversity in performed biological experiments, maybe even leading to accelerated scientific progress.
But also the social progress can profit from the growing community lab scene. On the one hand, Community Labs can cooperate with schools in offering classes to perfom biological experiments. Pupils will get a better insight into the world of biotechnology and synthetic biology.
On the other hand, similar to hobby engineers, hobby biologists could teach their children about main principles of biology at home. Children would not only learn about biology in theory but in their own experience. Just as our generation grew up with personal computers and the next generation with smart phones, in five to ten years children could grow up with synthetic biology.
Conclusion
As our journey through the multifaceted world of Community Labs comes to an end, we completed it by having a concluding skype call with the people who accompanied us at the start, the members of the iGEM Team Darmstadt.
After our last meeting, the iGEM Team Darmstadt had lead a panel discussion about the ""Risks and chances of community labs"" (please visit their wiki for further information). They shared their results and we shared our experiences in outlining how we helped Community Labs and how Community Labs helped us. We then came to a joint conclusion.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," GFP to be able to be transported into vesicles, it needs to be present in the periplasm. Therefore, an osmoshock was performed using the osmoshock protocol , to check the periplasmic fraction of the KEIO and WT strain, both with and without TorA-GFP. After the osmoshock the fluorescence of the GFP in the periplasm and cytoplasm was measured in the plate-reader.
In Figure 44, the fluorescence intensity in the periplasm in WT is significantly higher than in the cytoplasm. However, this difference in intensity is much less pronounced in the KEIO strain. A possible explanation for this is the previously demonstrated vesicle production. Previously, it was shown in Figure 40, that the KEIO strain produces a large amount of vesicles, while the WT strain produces none. This result suggests that in the KEIO strain GFP is transported into the vesicles, which reduces the amount of GFP in the periplasm. Another possibility could be that both the growth and the protein production is greatly impaired in the KEIO-strain, due to its mutation. This means that the overall GFP production is lower, leading to a lower concentration in the periplasm as well. All in all, we see that GFP-TA is transported into the periplasm.
Figure 44: GFP fluorescence in the periplasm and cytoplasm. Intensity of GFP in the periplasm and cytoplasm. The fluorescence intensity is measured for the samples TorA-GFP in the WT and KEIO strain and WT ad KEIO strain without plasmid.
In Figure 45, the analysed data is shown. Evidently, GFP is present in the purified sample of GFP-TA in WT, even though previous experiments showed that WT produces little to no vesicles, suggesting that those values are a background from the protocol used, due to a cell destruction during the centrifugation step.To test this hypothesis, the protocol could be adjusted to see whether GFP is still present at lower centrifugation speeds. Regardless of these possible changes, the fluorescence intensity of both GFP-TA with and without TolR in KEIO is significantly higher than GFP-TA in WT. Taken together, we can conclude that GFP is transported into the vesicles.

One of the main benefits of our test is the fact it is detection of the causative organism (M. bovis) meaning it would have the ability to act as a DIVA test. Our test relies on the presence of RNA from the bacterium so a positive result will definitively tell you the animal is a carrier of M. bovis, regardless of if the animal has been vaccinated or not.
Genetic Immunity
George explained to us some of the most recent advancements DEFRA has made. One of these that related to our test is the investigation of Genetic Immunity against M. bovis. In research led by the University of Edinburgh, scientists compared the genes of healthy and infected female Holstein-Friesians (cows) to identify any genetic traits that through selective breeding could be easily incorporated to the majority of animals. Selection of animals with genotypes that offer a better resistance to bTB would allow another way of controlling the disease in cattle. However one current problem with this research involves the ability to detect if the animal actually shows a higher degree of bTB resistance or if the animal is simply better at masking the symptoms of bTB. George explained how a test that could definitively conclude if an animal is carrying bTB would allow greater understanding of whether the individual is simply masking the symptoms of bTB or whether the animal actually has a genetic code that offers bTB resistance. Identifying the animals that have a genuine genetic resistance to bTB is highly important for this strategy.
Others
In addition to the individuals that we were in constant contact with, there were also several organisations that were involved to various degrees in our project. The National Farmers Union (NFU) were aware of the work we were doing during the initial stages of development, and through our contacts, we were able to gain an understanding of the issues that farmers themselves face when dealing with bTB. Furthermore, we had the opportunity to meet with two farmers who both had personal experiences with bTB within their herds. This early interaction with farmers who had been directly affected was important because as it helped us to appreciate the impact bTB has on them.  Being exposed to the devastation this disease caused to their respective businesses motivated us, as a team, to reach out to public, and educate people within Devon & Cornwall about the devastating impact bTB. To respect their privacy, we chose not to include them specifically in their timeline.

The last centrifugation step was repeated and after supernatants discarded, the cells resuspended with 2 mL of ice-cold CaCl2, dispensed into chilled sterile polypropylene tube in aliquot of 50 µL, and immediately freeze at -80°C. Cells competency were analyzed with iGEM Bba_J23119 plasmid.
Cells Transformation
The competent cell 0.6 tube were thawed in hand, kept on ice and added 300pg of DNA from iGEM distribution kit required parts and maintained on ice for 10min. In water bath at 42°C cells were heat shocked for 2 min, and immediately after, 500 µL of pre-heated LB medium were added to the tube and then transfer to another 1,5 mL tube filled with 500 µL pre-heated LB medium, and incubated at 37°C, 250rpm for one hour.
The LB-agar plates were heated at 37°C in between culture incubation time. After the initial incubation, 40 µL were transferred to the plate and, with an iron loop, the content were distributed on top of the agar, and incubated for 16 hours.
One colony of each plate was selected and transfer to a 50 mL LB medium and growth overnight. Then, plasmid purification was performed.
Plasmid Purification
Quiagen purification plasmids were used to perform this step as manufacture instruction. Briefly, culture cells were transfer to a 5 mL tube and centrifuged at 6.800 g for 3 min at room temperature. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 250 µL buffer P1 and transfer to a 1,5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and then added 250 µL of P2 buffer and gently mixed by tube inverting. To neutralize the lyses buffer, 350 µL of N3 buffer were added and mixed. The solutions were then centrifuged for 10 min at 17.900 g. This step supernatant were applied into a QIAprep spin column, and centrifuged for 60 seconds. Wash buffer PB and PE were respectively (0.5 and 0.75 mL) added to the column and spun for 30s. One final spin were done for one minute to remove wash buffer, and the plasm"

iGEM
The Project
The Columbia-Cooper iGEM team is working with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to create a light-controlled printed circuit board manufacturing process. This bacteria’s metabolism relies on its ability to oxidize iron; the iron can then be used to oxidize, and in turn solubilize, copper. By genetically altering the bacteria, we intend to install a light sensitive mechanism which will enable us to etch copper in a desired pattern, leaving a finished circuit board. Once a blank printed circuit board is placed in a thin layer of solid media, the bacteria will be applied onto the surface of the media and light will be focused on it in a desired pattern. The light sensitive mechanism in ferrooxidans would activate and self-destruct in the pathway of the light. In the end, the circuit board will be ""etched"" by the bacteria everywhere but the illuminated spots, leaving the desired pattern behind on the circuit board.
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. In 2011 iGEM expanded to include a High School Division and an Entrepreneurship Division is 2012.

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#HPSS_-_-_TEXT.html," with XJTLU. We have a poster to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and our team. What attracted people most was the room escape computer game. It made up a story in our lab, in which you have to find all the clues to decode the cipher in order to escape the room, and the key is the principle of our biological cipher machine. Since room escape is a popular game in China, we think fusing it with some basic knowledge in synthetic biology will make it easier to be taken. And it is welcomed!
    Those who came to the festival were mostly general public who were interested in science. We met a teacher who are fascinated by our idea and synthetic biology, and asked us to talk to his students about these. There were young people attracted by our computer game. However, they were baffled by the new idea it conveyed and eager to learn more about the knowledge behind it. Once curiosity was stimulated, learning efficiency double, which fit in exactly with our wishes. We are very pleased to see that we can make a difference. However, we still met some old people who treated us with wariness.
 
    We also went to the Wuhan science & technology museum. We set up our stall in the information exhibition hall, which is a hall set up for people to learn more about how information processes. And this is exactly the problem we are dealing with! And our stall can provide a biological aspect of information processing, which enriched the knowledge of the hall.
 
    Here we played a decryption game with children using candies, which helped them to understand what we have been doing in a funny way. A video which told a story based on synthetic biology was also played beside the game area. Many kids were attracted by it and asked us to explain the details of it.
 
    We find it is a good way to introduce new idea to the public by integrating it with other funny things. It is obvious to see that the computer game and the interesting video conveyed the idea of synthetic biology do work in the process of public engagement. And taken the low acceptance of the old into concern, it is necessary to find a better way to explain these thing to the old, in order to establish a more complete education model.

Insilico Analysis
 Description  Optimisation  RNA pH Meter
Description
Insilico analysis of any system is essential as it provides a better scientific understanding and serves as a guide for future physical experimentation. We have carried out insilico studies by using an online bioinformatics tool called RNA VIENNA FOLD to predict the secondary structures of the new parts that we are adding to the Registry this year. This helped us to anticipate if our system would work as expected or not.
Optimization of the ROSE RNA thermometer for B.subtilis
The functionality of the RNA thermometer is based on the intrinsic property of its structure. Hence just by altering the Shine Dalgarno sequence, it can be made functional across a variety of prokaryotic hosts. Since B.subtilis is the second most used chassis organism in iGEM, RNA Thermometer optimized for this bacterium will be a valuable addition to the Registry. The secondary structure of the RNA thermometer optimized for B.subtilis was engineered by submitting the modiied sequence with the altered SD sequence in RNA VIENNA FOLD. This was very similar to the one optimized for E.coli by Team TUDelft (BBa_K115001) and both had nearly equal thermodynamic free energies as shown in the figures below.
RNA pHmeter
Insilico analysis was done to obtain the 2D structure of this part, the sequence of which has been obtained from GENBANK. To make the pHmeter adaptable and easy to use we decided to replace its natural scar site with the BioBrick scar site. The modification to replace the scar site was carried out such that the secondary structure and Gibbs free energy change remained similar to that of the natural one as shown in the figure below. Both the variants of the RNA pHmeter i.e the wild type riboswitch with the natural scar site and a modified one with a replaced BioBrick scar site were then tested and their performances were compared."
UCopenhagen,2018,Team:UCopenhagen#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"SM:DOPC:DOPS:Chl). The ratio of the membrane components was inspired from Chatterjee and colleagues [1] who showed that EspD, which is required for formation of pores in the host membrane, spontaneously bound to lipid vesicles with this lipid composition. This lipid composition is also similar to the composition of the outer leaflet of a mammalian cell plasma membrane [2].
The dye Atto655 was also included in some of the lipid mixtures to enable detection of the lipid bilayers and liposome by fluorescence microscopy.
4. Binding to supported lipid bilayers
In this experiment, binding of SIEC and SIECΔp1 to supported lipid bilayers were investigated using fluorescence microscopy. The protocols used can be found here . The bacterial strains expressed GFP (BBa_I20270) for visualization in the microscope. We expected that the SIEC strain would bind to the membrane due to expression of the injectisome whereas SIECΔp1 would not bind to the membrane. Microscopy slides covered with supported lipid bilayers with the dye Atto655 were prepared and incubated with bacterial culture. After incubation, the microscopy slides were washed in LB media to remove unbound bacteria. An initial test where SIECΔp1 bacteria expressing GFP were incubated with supported lipid bilayers showed GFP signal after washing the microscopy slide 15 times. The integrity of the supported lipid bilayer was not investigated here, but it could be investigated using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Due to time limitations, this experiment was not pursued further.
5. Injection into liposome experiment
Outline
The purpose of this experiment is to see if the bacteria with the right genetic constructs is able to inject a specific protein into liposomes that mimic the injectisomes natural membrane-targets. By varying the presence of the injectisome, specific chaperones and the signal peptide , the experiment is set up to give information about the effect of these genetic products concerning the secretion into liposomes. Any differences of injection that is observed when varying these components provide information about if the parts are needed for secretion or if the components increase secretion rates.
Bacterial strain abbreviations are ""I"", ""S"" and ""C"" which corresponds to ""injectisome"", ""signal"" and ""Chaperones (CesT, CesF)"" respectively. For example strain I+S+C- have all components present, except the chaperones.
The strains that are used are: I+S+C+, I+S+C-, I+S-C+, I+S-C-, I-S-C-,"

Overview
At the beginning of iGEM, we created a flyer showcasing the strengths of our team and the various ways we could help other teams. As a result of this, we were contacted by three teams: Edinburgh overgraduate team, Exeter, and Evry Paris-Saclay.
For the Edinburgh team, we used our modelling knowledge to help fix their model. We aided the Exeter team by repeating one of their experiments, and they gathered single-cell fluorescence data for our deGFP construct using their FACS machine. Finally, Paris designed a novel psicose-regulated promoter to be used in a biosensor. We then incorporated their promoter into our framework so that many different variants of a psicose biosensor could be designed, made and tested.
Edinburgh OG
We were initially contacted by Anton Puzorjov from the Edinburgh Overgraduate team after meeting them at the Northern UK iGEM meet-up. As our team contained members who have been trained in modelling for synthetic biology, they were wondering if we could help them with their model as they were struggling to convert their deterministic model into a stochastic one.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how far they had gotten and to explain the theory behind stochastic modelling. After a long talk, we understood the issues and Anton had shown us the software they were using to model with (StochPy). We were then given their code and went off to work out the issues.
We corrected their code by fixing the reaction for infection of bacteria by phage, and converting the rate law for infection of bacteria by ph"

Assembled around the same time and representing the same university, we have since built a strong                             and cooperative relationship. We, Team:Fudan , and Team:Fudan-CHINA , have always been                                     on a fantastic and harmonious journey together, aiding each other and providing useful feedbacks                                     whenever we met or discussed. We frequently shared our plasmids and reagents to them, and                                     also provided them with immediate help on experiments including cell culture, fluorescent imaging,                             and flow cytometry"

Results
For our first attempt we used the Quick 50ul reaction from above and a higher concentration of insert (10:1), electroporated using the second protocol (see electroporation protocol) using electrocompetent cells kindly donated by the Birkbeck iGEM team. The reaction was a success and we had pink colonies on every plate!

We plated -4 dilution titers with x6 and x8 top agar using similar procedure to the previous selection test.
6) Selection - round 1 (6.7)
From preliminary selection test - third round, we were able to determine that we need to plate at -4 dilution to have enough plaques per plate
We plated 45 plates with -4 dilution of 200ug stock using x8 top agar. We also plated 5 plates with -3 dilution of 0ug stock using x8 top agar as control.
7) Large plaque confirmation (6.10)
From the 45 plates above we picked 12 of the biggest plaques and plated them using x8 top agar to confirm whether the supposed mutant have stable phenotype. Specifically, we added 50uL of LB to 12 eppendorf tubes. Each plaque was then stabbed with a pipet and the pipet was dipped into the 50uL LB; we pipetted up and down several times to ensure that phage particles got in the LB.
To 12 test tubes, we added 0.75mL of Bl21 overnight and 30uL of phage in LB prepared in the previous step. They were incubated for 20 minutes.
To each of the test tubes, 7mL of x8 top agar was added and then plated unto LB plates.
The plates were incubated at 37C for approximately 24 hours.
V) Results
1) Applying mutagen
Phage did not amplify in the liquid culture with 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Calculations revealed that the initial concentration of phage in liquid culture should be approximately 2.5E7 phage particle/mL. This is on the same scale as the final phage concentration as revealed by the spot test below.
2) Spot test
Lower concentration of mutagen seen to stimulate phage production, while higher concentration inhibits phage production
3) Preliminary selection test
Only one or two plaques are seen on each plate. The resolution of the following photo does not allow showing.
4) Preliminary selection test 2
-6 at x6 only showed a couple plaques on each plate.   For -4 at x6, there were many plaques.  It seems like the number of plaques increase as we increase the mutagen concentration.
5) Preliminary selection test - third round
x6 top agar produced bigger/more plaques than x8 top agar. For selection purposes, we decided to"

Also after the largest peak of the epidemic, when the number of cases starts to drop, diagnostics are still relevant to test for most pathogens. However, now not everyone will be tested, only risk groups are screened.
The cost of the device is not the most important factor, due to donors and investments by the Western world. A test should have reproducible and specific results. Furthermore, it should be robust in tropical settings such as high temperature, light intensity, and humidity. The ease of use plays a big role too.
The prevalence of a disease only becomes clear by applying a diagnostic. Predicting where a disease might emerge is unfeasible since it is a chance scenario. Moreover, the difference in genetic makeup of the target population and the corresponding resistances also plays an important role in the disease segregation. A modular tool sees use when there is an outbreak of a pathogen where no convenient diagnostic already exists.
Collaboration between different stakeholders to tackle the infectious problem is one of the most important factors to consider. Groups that will have to work together, are for example social scientists, clinicians and epidemiologists. To set up laboratories in the area of operation and acquire licenses to do so, may pose difficulties due to the fact that third-world countries cannot pay for these themselves. Negotiations with the private companies should solve this in case of a global problem.

The last missing links
We now have a clear image on how the situation in different areas is with regards to infectious diseases. However, we felt like we still missed some real inside-information. Moreover, we wanted to discuss our latest prototype with an expert.
Dr. Erwan Piriou
Laboratory advisor at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)
Dr. Erwan Piriou has expertise in international and humanitarian medicine, clinical immunology and infectious diseases. He discussed with us the bottlenecks in current diagnostics. Most were in line with previous conversations. However, he mentioned funding could be a big problem as obtaining funding for diagnostics is not centralized and developers can make only a small profit.
The advantage of our test is the modularity. He believes the prototype is easy to use and requires minimal training.

Dr. Erwan Piriou started by describing what is currently the main problems for new diagnostics. According to him the funding of diagnostic tools is very difficult to get due to the low profit margins developers can make on these tools. Funding for diagnostics is not centralized like it is for vaccines. As an example, he mentioned the current situation of malaria diagnostics, where 95% of all diagnostics"

Engagement in Asia
The way people value sports is just as diverse as the people who love it, all around the globe. That is why it is important to weigh opinions not only in the Netherlands, but in the Peoples’ Republic of China as well. During our time there organizing the iGEM Eurasian Meetup , we spoke with Dr. Li Wei at NIFTY prenatal screening, who works with cell free DNA as well. He confirmed our assumptions on the cfDNA levels in the blood and outlined several possibilities of detecting it, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of next generation sequencing with us.
In addition, we spoke with Mr. Cao Jun, CEO of Sports Genomics Inc., on the future of genetic enhancement in amateur sports. His department’s main focus lies with helping people choose a sport that fits them based on their genetic information. For them, the border lies with reading the genetic information and recommending a course of action based on this, not enhancing.
During our time in China we furthermore handed out surveys in the streets, buses and subways. This gave some very interesting results as is further described on our Education and Public Outreach Page .
2.2 General Public
Train Debates and the Public Opinion
On the June 26th, we extended the Belgian Biotechnology Day to The Netherlands. We wanted to open up the discussion on synthetic biology with a broad public. In order to find a diverse audience we organized train debates all over The Netherlands. The topic we chose was gene editing, which at the same time provided us with valuable information for our project. We spoke with people with radically different ideas and background. We even happened to talk to a professional soccer player who was, anonymously, quite open in admitting he would use gene doping if it was safe and undetectable.
“If gene doping is safe and undetectable, then everyone would use it. So why not me?”

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Collaborate_-_-_TEXT.html," the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.
Figure 4: On and off-target effects of Munich crRNAs on different bacterial targets. On and off-target effects of designed crRNAs on different bacterial targets. A) crRNA 1-3 yield 7 on-target hits (blue) on the E. coli DH5α genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in 10 million per site. B) crRNA 1-3 yield off-target probabilities below 1 in 10 million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome. C) crRNA 2 yields off-target probabilities below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the E. coli DH5α genome. D) crRNA 4 yields 10 on-target hits (blue) on the B. subtilis genome, while off-target probabilities (orange) remain below 1 in a million for all possible sequences on the B. subtilis genome.
We establish that the two designed crRNA sequences target their designated bacterial species specifically. crRNA 1-3 contains 7 on-target hits on the E. coli DH5α genome, while crRNA 4 contains 10 on-target hits on the B. subtilis genome. From this it can be concluded conclude that the designed crRNA sequences allow differentiation between the (Gram-negative) E. Coli and (Gram-positive) B. subtilis species. Arguably, designing one crRNA that targets both strains could be beneficial in distinguishing between for example a viral and bacterial infection by requiring less experiments, however a Gram-positive or negative distinction could is already very helpful.
We also compute $P_{FP}$ (the probability of a false positive output, provided that there is a positive output, for the four simulations (Figure 5). For all simulations, the probability of acquiring a false-positive result was found to be low: in the order of one in a million times. Moreover, having multiple on-target sites on the genome of the bacterial species to be detected decreases $P_{FP}$ on the targeted genome. The $P_{FP}$ on the non-targeted genome, however, is unaffected. This implies that having more on-target sites intuitively also increases the sensitivity of the assay. However, the off-target probability on non-target species remains unaffected by this.

XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," and learning from teams applied themselves in diseases detection theme. We divided these activities in four stages which are Laws and Regulations, Inspiration and Reality, Public and Promotion, Idea and Wisdom, respectively. We have completed Human Practices silver medal criteria, Human Practices gold medal criteria/ Best Integrated Human Practices award and Best Education and Public Engagement award.
In addition，during human practice activities, we found that most disease-diagnosing methods are confined to specific delicate testing apparatus, which are expensive, time-consuming and low sensitivity. The study of Point-of-care testing (POCT), also called bedside testing (with the definition of medical diagnostic testing at or near the time and place of patient care), has become very heated because of its convenience, simplicity and highly efficiency. Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables the connection and exchange of data.
Here we came up with a design. We combined the idea of our project-Aptamer-based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system), IoT, and the above concept of POCT so as to develop a microfluidic device, which is small while convenient for real-time detection of cancer.

Inspiration and Reality
Creating a brainstorm is simplified, how to put theory into practice matters more. For understanding diseases detection reality socially, we visited three organizations, which all have authority background in Xiamen area. In order to consider the feasibility of the ABCD system in our project, we interviewed Prof. ZhiZhu who has very fruitful results on aptamers, the Chief Physician Weiwei Tang and Prof. Zengfu Xue. We finally visited a grass-roots Health Service Center to find our product's market positioning.
