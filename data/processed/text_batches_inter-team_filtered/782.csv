Forms a complex with naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 2 (E1_2) to form an active enzyme to oxidize PAH that can be used as substrate. This oxidation with dioxygen form a vicinal diol and add two hydrogens on the ring. This step need energy to break the aromaticity. This complex enzyme need NADH,H+.

Gets complex with naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 1 (E1_1) to form an active enzyme to oxidize PAH that can be used as substrate. This oxidation with dioxygen form a vicinal diol and add two hydrogens on the ring. This step need energy to break the aromaticity. This complex enzyme need NADH,H+.
BBa_K2198002:E2 The dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. Ref. [2]
This step allows the restoration of the aromatic with a dehydrogenation of the vicinal diol. Thanks to this, E3 will be able to open the ring with an oxidative cleavage.
BBa_K2198003:E3 The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida Ref. [3]
In our degradation pathway the key step is to remove ring from PAH to reduce their toxicity. The E3 is able to do an extradiol ring cleavage. Thanks to this step, the PAH are now less toxic and available for an alkyl removal by E4. If this step is the last one of the process all the products can be handle by chemistry thanks to this alkyl"

I ligated protein A ZZ domian into the digested bank vector C to be able to make fusion proteins with IgG protease and CPP but also to send in this part to iGEM hq since they want the genes to be sent in this vector.
The vector concentraion should preferably be 25 ng/ul when performing ligation with a gene.
I used:
bank vector C 0.5 ul
protein A gene 3 ul
quick ligase 1 ul
quicke ligase buffer 2X 3 ul
Incubated in RT 15 min
Transformation of protein A (ZZ domain) in bank vector C
I transformed the ligated protein A (ZZ domain) in bank vector C in 100 ul Top 10 cells.
The transformation method is according to the procedure decribed in protocols. However in the step 1 I thawed for 15 min instead of 10 min. In step 2 I added 3 ul of DNA, in step 6 I used LB instead of SOC and finally in step 10 I spread 50 ul of sample on a chloramphenicol plate.

TARGET ORGANISM: Yarrowia lipolytica
Shortly after the introduction of the project, searching for a potential host began. Initially, we held a meeting with Tom Sousa, a 1st year graduate student in the Bioinformatics Department at UCSC, and an expert on yeast. Tom recommended that we look into using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aka brewer’s yeast. S. cerevisiae is special because it is extremely well studied and is ideal for biological research because of its short doubling time, ability to be transformed, and can be grown as a haploid.
In order to ensure that we were picking the best possible strain of yeast, a few team members continued research on different strains of yeast. Soon after, we discovered Yarrowia lipolytica, another “Generally Regarded as Safe” (GRAS) organism. Although less studied than S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica has several benefits that led us to believe that it would be a better choice for our project:
Y. lipolytica outperformed all alternative hosts in heterologous protein expression and high transformation frequency during homologous recombination of linearized plasmids.
Y. lipolytica can survive on unconventional carbon sources like milk, oil, and glycerol.
Y. lipolytica exhibits low side-product formation and high substrate specificity, which is ideal for producing a single product like progesterone.
Commonly, yeast that are chosen for engineering purposes use the DNA repair mechanism homologous recombination, because it is efficient for inserting genes. Y. lipolytica has a propensity for a less favorable DNA repair mechanism, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). To circumvent this problem, we searched for a strain that had the NHEJ mechanism, which is controlled by the ku70 gene, knocked out.
Our project also required auxotrophic markers for selective screening of our transformants, so we looked for a ura3 and le"

Instructor
Peter Heisig
Peter Heisig was born in 1958 and studied pharmacy at the Free University of Berlin. After his PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, he qualified as a professor at the University of Bonn and was appointed professor for pharmaceutical biology and microbiology at the University of Hamburg in 2000. He and his group carry out research on the development, spreading and consequences of antibiotic resistances with a special interest in fluoroquinolones. In addition to being head of the group, he is a safety advisor for the S2 lab and also involved in teaching the pharmacy students.
We converted him to our project when we presented our ideas and won him over as an instructor for our team. He patiently discussed our experiments with us and offered lots of helpful hints and new approaches for the design as well as for troubleshooting. He regularly asked about the progress of our project and always made time for our issues. Furthermore, he invited us to his group and offered us some space in his S2 lab on short notice when our former lab suddenly was closed down and therefore saved us from interrupting our lab work and wasting a lot of time.

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html,"2400 bp were expected if the part was present in the biobrick. These bands were observed, indicating that the KatG-LAA gene was most likely present.
PCR using Phusion high fidelity polymerase was carried out on dszA, dszB, and dszC in a gradient thermocycler. Amplification of non-specific bands was present for dszA and dszB, however strong banding for the desired size of the gene was observed for both (around 1500 for dszA, 1100 for dszB
Examining the sequences of the dszABC genes led to the discovery that all 4 had multiple illegal enzyme cut-sites in them that we have to eliminate before biobrick composite part construction can occur. dszA has four PstI cut sites, dszB has a PstI and a NotI and dszC has a PstI cut site. In order to eliminate cut sites, the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis procedure is going to be used, with the only alteration being that Kapa HiFi polymerase would be used during the process. Primers needed for the mutagenesis were designed based on the procedure mentioned above.
Ring Cleavage
This week we performed another colony PCR of 5 colonies from the transformation plate of part K398014 and ran the products on a gel. We obtained 4 positive colonies and made overnight cultures. We decided to stop using this part for the project and therefore did not require a further miniprep on these overnight cultures. However we made an overnight culture of the positive colony from the alkane hydroxylase system gel (colony 5) and miniprepped the overnight culture. This resulted in a good concentration of 345.6 ng/μL as we continued verification of XylE by doing two more colony PCRs of each part (K118021 and J33204) but only the positive control worked when we ran the gel.
Alkane Hydroxylase system colony PCR gel (K398014) Lanes 2-8 (Colonies A-E) with a 1Kb ladder (L).
Denitrification
The goal for this week was to grow different strains of Pseudomonas in media containing B-N media + glucose with only carbazole as a source of nitrogen. In theory only those strains which contained the pCAR1 plasmid would be able to use carbazole as a nitrogen source and thrive in this media. The strains we tested from glycerol stock included putida LD1,"

Safety
This year the Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy iGEM team has taken into consideration and put into action many different safety practices in order to keep everyone in our school, community, team and the world around us safe. With these considerations taken into account, we are confident that when our project is successful, it will benefit everyone. Our project will benefit those in municipalities who are currently dealing with hair buildups in wastewater treatment facilities by allowing a more efficient method to deal with clogs. Farmers in the poultry industry will also benefit from our construct because it will allow them to eliminate their feather waste but also to utilize the byproducts created for useful purposes. These benefits however, can only be applied if our construct is safe. If we continue to practice basic lab safety, lab safety education, the creation of a safe construct and thinking about future goals, we are confident that we will create a safe construct ready for proper implementation in the poultry industry and in wastewater treatment both locally, and on a global scale.
This year our safety concerns were focused around two major things. Firstly, our project could be, in the near future, released into municipal water systems or onto farm environments. Our second concern was that we attend a pre-K through twelve school, with our lab just off the main science lab, making the lab accessible to anyone when unlocked. These two things have meant that we must take safety into consideration both in and outside of a lab setting. Everyday we take simple precautions to make sure that us and everyone in our school remains safe. These important precautions are simple but very effective including wearing lab coats, goggles, gloves, locking doors of our lab at all times, washing our hands after lab work has been completed, and tying back hair while working in the lab. We sterilize all of our equipment before and after we use it and use 70% ethanol clean the counters in the lab. We have also undergone certain education in order to know how to be safe in the lab including; lab safety training, in which all iGEM team members and supervisors have learnt, Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS), material safety data sheets (MSDS), aseptic technique, proper sterilization techniques, and biosafety and wet-lab safety protocols. These safety precautions are not very complicated but"

This is particularly important in the context of the human gut, owing to the key role of the microbiota in the modulation of different physiological processes that are relevant for human health. Therefore, we evaluate the effect of the incorporation of different bacterial strains (including L. rhamnosus) on the viability of Transwell co-cultures of epithelial and immune cells that are normally present in the human gut. We then aimed to evaluate the feasibility of establishing microbial-mammalian co-cultures in a microphysiological model of the human gut (i.e., gut-on-a-chip). We believe this approach holds great potential for the development of more accurate experimental platforms to study the influence of bacterial populations on the physiological processes relevant for human health and disease.

We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica)! It was a great way to directly engage with other iGEM participants too, and generate global interest in our project.
Business & Applied Design
We took the biocircuitry of our biosensor that we made in the lab, and turned to engineering to design and assess the viability of a final biosensor product. This involved considering optimisation, immobilisation techniques, potential designs, initial sketches and prototyping.
We also pitched our idea to a range of potential consumers, and worked with them to evolve our design. From there, a full plant sizing and costing was done to assess if the investment would provide a worthwhile return.
Collaboration
Collaborating with other iGEM teams worldwide was an invaluable experience. We did extensive collaboration with the UNSW iGEM and Hamburg iGEM teams in particular, as well as engaging in minor collaboration with 6 other iGEM teams. On top of that, we connected with 46 more iGEM teams on Instagram.
Outreach & Public Engagement
We engaged with people from as young as 4 years of age, up to 65+ years of age, and many between! Through numerous social events and workshops, we successfully taught thousands of people about synthetic biology, the importance of not squeezing fruit to see if it’s ripe, and introduced them to our project. To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Outreach page.
Integrated Human Practices
Through Skype sessions and site visits, we engaged with Zespri Kiwifruit, Avocados Australia, and Fresh Produce Australia, to gain an insight into the context of our project.,
To find out more about how we used this information, check out the Integrated Human Practices page.
Microbe Card Game Project
One of our team members set out to design a card game that stylised various bacteria as little monsters. The card game was intended to be both educational and fun, introducing some of the more common bacteria that are involved in food and health to the wider community. To keep things simple, the game was going to have standard “top trumps” style rules, with categories like “pathogenicity” and “antibiotic resistance.” More complicated words would be bolded, with a reference list explaining these words in an educational way. Although the project was not completed, it remains an idea that will be pursued in the future. You can see some of the designs below.

Without the regulatory of an International Association of Synthetic Biology, we can’t make sure that there is no threat coming from someone’s house or garden, isn’t it?
The interactions between environment and the microorganisms are also an important application of our project. If the “grey goo” disaster breaks out, we can provide a modus to minimize the harm.
Biosecurity
In economy, there are a number of probiotic microbes being used in the manufacturing of various food, biofuels and pharmaceutical products. In biotech industry, high-quality strains are always much expensive, resulting in high frequency of theft events. This problem seriously affected the development of the whole industry.
In contrast to a biohackery scenario that is driven largely by curiosity, another scenario enabled by the availability of this technology may involve illicit economic purposes.
A case on strains theft occurred in China in 2000. In this case, the strains theft caused heavy economic losses to a company. This upgraded the concerning of bio-economy problems to a new focusing level. We must take action immediately in order to protect our profit.
Various synthetic gene circuits are able to provide multiple abilities to industrial bacterial. But to protect the originality result of a research group, not only the patent protection is needed, it’s also necessary to transmit a “bio-lock” into the bacteria.

As a control we did 14 Gibson reactions using the iGEM prefix and suffix, of which 6 were successful (and bio-bricked), giving it a success rate of 42% (meaning that a Gibson reaction with the iGEM prefix and suffix is 10 times more likely to fail than a Gibson reaction using our optimized overlaps).

Fig 2. The fluorescence of PgadA and PgadA-RiboJ                                     in pH                                     6 and pH 7.
Conclusion
We observe that with the RiboJ sequence, the fluorescence intensity has risen dramatically at the 14th hour. We also compare the fluorescence at 3rd, 6th, and 9th hour. The fluorescence of the strain that contains RiboJ is more than that does not contain RiboJ. We can conclude that by adding the RiboJ sequence to the construct, the expression of fluorescence protein is increased. We can also conclude that RiboJ could also strengthen the signal and increase the specificity of the downstream gene of it. We improve the PgadA part so the difference of the surrounding pH condition can be observed easier.

Background
Emerging infectious diseases
Since the beginning of the 21st century, there hasn’t been a year that was without the threat of an epidemic [1]. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have steadily increased over the last 100 years [2]. This is mainly related to globalization, climate change and the exponential increase in population density. Of these communicable diseases, only a few develop into a full-scale epidemic, but consequences can be disastrous if they are not anticipated correctly.
Especially in developing countries, infectious diseases are the major cause of death and account for more than half of all deaths in children [3] and many young adults [4]. Loss of so many potentially healthy and productive years greatly affects the economy [4] and society as a whole. Examples such as the SARS epidemic of 2002, the influenza A pandemic of 2006 or the more recent Ebola epidemic of 2014 have shown that outbreaks can happen unexpectedly and quickly. Other examples are Zika virus, a viral disease causing major outbreaks in South and Central America, and African Sleeping Sickness, which is caused by Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and has been endemic in African countries for many decades. These facts underline the necessity of proper surveillance and global communication for fast responses against possible threats.
When such an epidemic emerges, the main priority is curing patients of their infection. Diagnosis is critical here, as in order to cure a person one should first know which disease the patient"
Edinburgh,2014,Team:Edinburgh#modelling#software_-_-_TEXT.html," or the specific base at which the target starts, produced very different structures.
So we gave AntisenseBot 5000 a considerable makeover:
Small modifications to the Python script meant that now instead of merely producing one antisense gene, it now produced 2,400 different RNAs, each different in length or start-site by one base.
We coupled this to a modified version of the RNAserver program. We downloaded the offline version of the tool, and modified it so that it could now take multiple RNAs, and rank them based in order of decreasing ‘openness’ (in practice, free energy) at the site which we told it was the RBS and start codon. By taking the output of the new Python script, we now had a program which could calculate the optimum antisense gene for any given native gene.
We were quite pleased with AntisenseBot 5001 (as we christened it), and got as far as designing sequences for five antisense genes, against acpP, fabA, ftsZ, rpoD and rpsL.
Sadly, the unfortunate realities of trying to do multiple ambitious things in a single Summer caught up with us. We planned to do the antisense experiments once the initial non-antisense genes had been PCR’d, assembled and transformed, but this took so long that in the end we never got to test our antisense system. We resigned ourself to the fact that our program, while cool, would have to remain an untested curiosity that we could hopefully mention in our final project writeups.
UCL to the rescue
In mid-September, as we were frantically trying to close down our project (and uncomfortably aware that we hadn't secured our coveted ‘collaboration’ required for the gold medal), we got an interesting Tweet from the UCL team.
They'd seen our tweet back in July about the antisense program, and as luck would have it were also working on antisense molecules! We could all see, that here was a golden opportunity. We could put our hitherto unused program to work, help UCL with their project, and secure collaboration points for both our teams.
We skyped one cloudy Thursday afternoon, and worked out the plan of action. UCL were trying to knock down the gene ispB and had designed an antisense gene for the job. Was it going to work? And was there a better antisense gene available?
So, we got to work. We ran their antisense gene through our program and tried to predict how favourable their RNA was based on its secondary structure. We also"

The following graph shows the relationship between time and expected concentration of purple cells for the Keio ClpX Knockout strain; “T” represents the time at which the cells were induced by IPTG.
Keio ClpP Knockout Strain: In this strain, ClpP will be knocked out and ClpX will be allowed to function. ClpP is responsible for degrading the primary structure of the protein itself; it does this by breaking the individual covalent bonds (polypeptide bonds) that exist between the amino acids in the polypeptide chain. Since ClpP will not be expressed, the chromoprotein will not be degraded into individual amino acids. However, despite this, the chromoprotein will still be degraded partially because it will be de-linearized by ClpX. In other words, although the protein will still be in its primary structure, it will still lack the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, disulfide bridges, and R-Group interactions that exist in its tertiary (or in some cases, quaternary) structure; consequently, that will limit the chromoprotein’s ability to express its pigments. With this in mind, we expect our plates to have a smaller number of purple cells present in the Keio ClpP Knockout strain.

DNA
Background
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a new tool that has tremendous power for the future of bioengineering and synthetic biology. A number of projects have successfully harnessed this technology in applications spanning both gene expression manipulation and DNA detection. While historically DNA detection has been carried out via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the specificity and adaptability of the Cas9 protein to selectively target DNA has opened the window to a new and streamlined strategy for detecting DNA fragments in vivo.
Deactivated Cas9, or dCas9, is an adapted form of the Cas9 protein that is designed to sit on the DNA molecule without initiating a cut in the double stranded base pairs as the active Cas9 protein normally does [4]. The 2015 Peking University iGEM team designed a split luciferase dual-dCas9 system that effectively targets fragments of DNA [5]. In their system, two dCas9s simultaneously bind different neighboring sections of the target DNA, and in doing so bring together two halves of a luciferase molecule for a visible indicator of DNA presence. This project was successfully executed and optimized to reliably and adaptably detect DNA fragments of varying lengths.
Our project builds on this dual-dCas9 system by implementing a transcriptional-based reporter system by bridging dCas9 with the prokaryotic two-hybrid (P2H) system. Instead of split luciferase as an indicator, in our system the proximity of dCas9 binding brings together a larger protein complex (adapted from the P2H system) and initiates transcription of red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Figure 2).
While this initial design accomplishes a similarly goal to the 2015 Peking project of creating a fluorescent indicator for the presence of DNA, the key difference is in the adaptability of transcriptional activation as a reporter—instead of luminescence as the sole output of the system, our system can be expanded beyond detection by exchanging the RFP output for other relevant proteins for applications (see applications section below) in targeted therapeutics, bacterial strain engineering, and beyond.
The System and its Scientific Basis
We are adapting a prokaryotic two-hybrid system and combining it with dCas9 in order to selectively detect DNA sequences for disease diagnostics. In order to ensure specificity of sgRNA to dCas9 binding, we used two different dCas9 proteins derived from streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus aure"

Through five months of hard work, we have witnessed great development of our project, and we have prepared for the criteria for the Giant Jamboree. We successfully submitted 12 newly designed iGEM Registry Standard parts while using existing iGEM parts as well. We have also investigated the algal bloom in Taihu Lake. Moreover, we have helped several teams including BIT, BNU , and OUC-China, and we received assistance from the ZJU-China and OUC-China. We also popularized iGEM to undergraduates in Peking University campus. In conclusion, we have met all the requirements for an iGEM team, so we believe that we deserve Gold Medal.

Today Jade and LJ helped us spot test all of the fractions above the band from our last CsCl gradient. These fractions were numbered 12-19, but 15 was skipped. Each fraction was spot tested at a titer of 10^0, 10^-2, and 10^-4 and incubated agar side down at 37C overnight.
9/18/13
We looked at the results from the spot test today. We found that: All fractions had phage at 10^0 Fractions 18, 19, 17, 16, and 14 had large clearings still at 10^-2 while 13 and 12 just had individual plaques. Fractions 18, 19, 17, 16, and 14 had individual plaques at 10^-4.
We also measured the capsids and tails of the TEM images.

Note: A smaller pyrex bottle may be used to accommodate the glucose solution
1L graduated cylinder
Weighing boats and scoopula
70% EtOH wash bottle
Paper towels/wipes
Procedure
Part 1: Making the SOC broth
This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.
Obtain two 1L pyrex bottles. Ensure that the bottles can be sealed with a cap - this will help prevent contamination and enable long term storage.
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500mL dH2O (distilled water).
Using filter paper, separately measure out 10g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 0.292g NaCl, 0.093g KCl, 1.016g MgCl2 anhydrate, and 1.234g MgSO4•7H2O on a scale and add them to the 1L bottle.
Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
Add 400mL dH2O. Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix.
In the separate bottle, and measure out 1.802g glucose on a scale and add the rest of the 100 mL dH20. Recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
Note: The 1 L bottles are autoclaved separately, as the contents will react if autoclaved together.
Autoclaving
ONLY DONE BY EXECS
Lightly seal the top of the bottles with aluminium foil, or unscrew the caps. Label both with autoclave tape. Include a label with SOC – [your name] – [date] - iGEM 2017.
**Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps 2-4. **
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the bottles into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20 min.
The contents of the bottles will be hot after autoclaving, so take necessary measures to prevent burns. After autoclaving, allow the media too cool to 55°C before handling.
Part 2: Making the SOC broth
This part should be done in room WB303, in sterile conditions close to a Bunsen burner.
In a sterile environment, slowly add the autoclaved 1.802g glucose and dH2O"

Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CIlam)2, (tetR)2 and (lacI)4. The internal binding strength of (tetR)2 dimer and (CIlam)2 dimer are stronger than that of (lacI)4 tetramer. more details
Modeling Details of Repressilator
Modeling Details of Repressilator
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

File:Muc 3dnatives 001.pdf ""Forscher der Technischen Universität München haben vor kurzem das BiotINK-Projekt vorgestellt, das die Herstellung von komplexen Zellstrukturen erleichtert und beschleunigt. Als Druckmaterial wird Biotin (Vitamin B7) und Streptavidin auf einem zum Biodrucker umfunktionierten Desktop-3D-Drucker zur Herstellung von lebenden Geweben verwendet.
Das bisherige Verfahren zum 3D-Druck von lebendem Gewebe ist das, was Wissenschaftler „Gerüst“ nennen: Die platzierten Zellen entwicklen sich entlang vorgedruckter Strukturen aus PLA. Diese Strukturen sind die Grundlage, auf der sich die organischen Zellen reproduzieren und zu einem Gewebe entwickeln. Das Gerüst wird dann anschließend entfernt, sodass sich das Gewebe selbst zusammen hält. Die Verwendung von Supportmaterial für die Entwicklung von Geweben war die bisher traditionelle Art, mit der gearbeitet wurde, um Gewebe zu Erstellen. Vor ein paar Monaten erfolgten Versuche zur Herstellung einer menschliche Leber aus Stammzellen mit dem gleichen Prozess. Der Nachteil ist, dass die Zellreifung mit der Gerüsttechnik eine lange Zeit beansprucht und sehr teuer ist. Zusätzlich bestehen Beschränkungen in der Größe des Druckobjekts.
„Durch die Verwendung eines Zweikomponentensystems aus gentechnisch hergestellten Zellen und Proteinen schaffen wir eine Art molekularen Superkleber, der eine präzise Positionierung von Zellen durch Bioprinting ermöglicht, während sie in ihrer Position fixiert werden, wodurch die Bildung dreidimensionaler interzellulärer Kontakte und physiologischer Mikroumgebungen ermöglicht wird“, sagt das Team des BiotINK-Projekts.
Die BiotINK-Forscher funktionierten dazu einen normalen Ultimaker 2 zu einem Biodrucker um.

NGS sequencing for diversity estimation
About 60,000 Nanobody and 30,000 Monobody plasmids were isolated and submitted to NGS sequencing (MiSeq). We expect and underestimation of the diversity due to different issues. Critical points in the sample preparation were the isolation of equal amounts of plasmids from different clones, the fragmentation of the plasmids and the sequencing itself. The sequencing results revealed an approximate minimal number of different plasmids within our sent-in libraries:
Monobodies: 94 unique fragments out of 164 were detected in 50ng DNA so our plasmid isolation of Monobodies contains over 28,200 different binding proteins.
Nanobodies: 437 unique fragments out of 499 were detected so our plasmid isolation of Nanobodies contains over 27,528 different binding proteins.
While calculating it is important to pay attention to the further loss of variety due to fragmentation for the production of the Nextera libraries, the adapter ligation and sequencing bias. Moreover, not the complete Nextera libraries were sequenced.
Additionally, the distributions of the bases for every position were defined. Results are shown in Figures 3 and 4. This number could be affected by PCR amplification while sequencing (four cycles lead to maximal 32 copies of each fragment). Also the size of the colonies for plasmid isolation influences the multiplicity of each plasmid.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#background_-_-_TEXT.html,"uming that an average diabetic needs 15 units of insulin daily to live symptomfree, the global insulin demand would yearly be approximately 79 thousand tons of pure crystaline insulin and rise to more than 120 thousand tons by 2040.     $$\frac{\text{Number of diabetics }\cdot 15 \text{ units day}^{-1} \cdot 365 \text{days}}{288118443.804 \text{ units ton}^{-1}} = \text{ Insulin demand (tons)} $$
Insulin production
In their annual report, Novo Nordisk estimates that of the 415 million adults with diabetes, only 6% receives full care. However, with increasingly broad access to drugs in areas of the world where expensive medication like insulin have previously been unavailable, this number can be expected to increase.
Insulin is produced using glucose as a substrate. Glucose is commonly refined from starch, which again is refined from eg. potatoes or corn. This means that arable land and food potentially fit for human consumption is being used to produce medication instead of feeding the ever increasing population. An approximation of the demand for arable land, starch and crops can be calculated with the expressions below:
$$ \frac{\text{Insulin Demand}}{0.05 \frac{\text{ton insulin}}{\text{ton glucose}}}\cdot 1 \frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton glucose}} = \text{Starch demand} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Starch demand}}{0.17}\frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton potato}} = \text{Potato demand (tons)}$$   $$ \frac{\text{Starch demand}}{0.34}\frac{\text{ton starch}}{\text{ton corn}} = \text{Corn demand (tons)} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Potato demand}}{17.4 \frac{\text{tons}}{\text{ha}}} = \text{Area demand (ha)} $$   $$ \frac{\text{Corn demand}}{5 \frac{\text{tons}}{\text{ha}}} = \text{Area demand (ha)}   $$
Using these and the estimations of insulin production gives the following demands:

Valencia_UPV,2016,Team:Valencia UPV#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"conomy, we set up four scenarios that represent real cases in which HYPE-IT can help to overcome a problem and provide an integral solution. These scenarios include recovering of crops in places with rough conditions (as plagues, drought, salt stress...), improvement of nutritional quality of foods, increasing productivity of crops and enhance of organoleptic properties. For each scenario we assess the three impacts previously explained.
1. Recovering crops
Powdery mildew (PM) is a fungal disease caused by a                         species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, that affects                         many crops such as cucumber, melon, apple, tomato or                         cereals. In Europe it is particularly problematic in                         grapevine, where the parasite covers the leafs and stem                         of the plant, resulting in damage of the plant and                         consequently a lower quality of the grape. It becomes                         acid and contains less anthocyanins and                         sugar.
In France, Spain, Italy and Germany, between 1992 and                         2003, 73% of the fungicides were used only for                         grapevine protection (1). These fungicides for treating                         powdery mildew are sulfur-based and can damage the                         environment. Genetically resistant varieties can be the                         solution for this problem. These varieties exist but                         are not accepted by consumers and producers, as the                         grape has a lower quality and are not the traditional                         varieties of the region. It has been found that                         resistance to PM can be achieved by knocking out genes                         residing in the loci MLO (Mildew Locus O) (2). Using                         the HYPE-IT technology, it is possible to easily knock                         out several genes in a grapevine variety which is                         affected by powdery mildew, without changing the                         characteristic of the variety.
Nutritional impact
Grapes and wine have a high content in polyphenols                         -including anthocyanins-, which have antioxidant                         properties. These compounds have positive effects in                         human health in the prevention of diseases as cancer,                         diabetes and atherosclerosis (3). Grapevines resistant                         to mildew would avoid losses of this highly valuable                         product, as well as preventing reduction of the                         anthocyanin content of the grape. This might reduce the                         price of grapes and wine, making more accessible for                         the consumers these healthy products.
Environmental impact
In 2003, around 60000 tons of sulfur-based fungicides                         were used, and most of it is applied on vineyards (1).                         Currently, powdery mildew is controlled"

Construct an alliance to build a worldwide database
Continued worldwide industrialization has caused extensive environmental and human health problems. A wide variety of chemicals, e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, chlorinated solvents, etc., have been detected in different natural resources such as soil, water, and air. Among the pollutants, the heavy metals are of concern to human health due to their cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity.
Under this circumstance, Tianjin Team came up with the idea that we could gather all the iGEM teams whose projects were about water pollution treatment and build an alliance to unite all information and data concerning the social impact, knowledge and geographical advantages they collected during the conduction of their project.
On 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with Tianjin/SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU. During which we discussed about how we want to use this alliance, and the discussion led to 2 conclusions:
1. Build a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil.
2. Mutually promote the social impact of each parties in this alliance."
Waterloo,2014,Team:Waterloo#Lab Book#CRISPRi_-_-_TEXT.html," the average error, and set this as a threshold.
Choose a parameter named Q.
Partition parameter sets as acceptable and unacceptable.
Calculate the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) of parameter Q for acceptable sets, and for unacceptable sets.
Find the maximum of the difference between the two distributions. This is the global sensitivity of the parameter Q.
Repeat steps 5-8 for all parameters in the system.
The supporting argument for this approach derives from the meaning of the differences in ECDFs. Without loss of generality, consider the acceptable set ECDF to be always greater than that of the unacceptable set. If there is a large difference between the two ECDFs, then a change in the parameter - near the location of the difference - will cause a major change in error (past the threshold to unacceptable). This can be restated as a change in behaviour. However, a small difference in the ECDFs implies that the parameter did not have a major effect on the error and so the parameter did not significantly change behaviour compared to other parameters.
Using a Matlab script, the plots above were generated to show the ECDFs of the acceptable and unacceptable sets for each parameters. It was observed that there was a significant difference in the ECDF for mRNA YFP Degradation and production compared to most other parameters. More significantly, other parameters showed a relatively minor effect. The team concluded that in order to supplement CRISPRi repression, the mRNA needs to be the new target.

We have helped the team BIT-China to verify the function of the RNA thermometer in BBa_K1117009. RFP is linked to this part and we observed its expression by fluorescent microscope. The result shows that SD sequence region is occluded at 30 °C, partial melting occurs at 37 °C, whereas an increase to 42 °C facilitates the mRNA–ribosome interaction owing to full liberation of the SD and AUG start codon. Our result could be seen in following pictures:

In 2007, Carleton L Kingsford et al. [1] described TransTermHP, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators.
They put forward an algorithm to predict Rho-independent terminators.
The first 15 bases of the potential tail sequence are scored using a function:
(1)
where
(2)
for n=1...15 and  =1.
The energy of potential hairpin configurations adjacent to a reference position can be found efficiently with a dynamic programming algorithm. The table entry hairpin_score[i,j] gives the cost of the best hairpin structure for which the base of the 5' stem is at nucleotide position i and the base of the 3' stem is at position j. The entry hairpin_score[i,j] can be computed recursively as follows:

The function energy(i,j) gives the cost of pairing the nucleotide at i with that at j, and loop_pen(n) gives the cost of a hairpin loop of length n. The hairpin's loop is forced to have a length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting loop_pen(n) to a large constant for any n outside that range. The constant 'gap' gives the cost of not pairing a base with some base on the opposite stem and thus introducing a gap on one side of the hairpin stem.

3-4 Quaternary Stage: We tried the dual expression of the two surface expressing proteins
We worked on the simultaneous expressions of INPNC-His-scFv and INPNC-His-CBDcex. We co-transformed the two plasmids. These two plasmids both have chloramphenicol (Cp) resistance marker, but they have different replication origins (p15A for the scFv and pMB1 derivative for the CBD), each belonging to a different incompatibility group. In theory, the two plasmids can be stably inherited. We first tested whether the Cp resistant colonies from the co-transformation have both of the plasmids with colony PCR. (Fig18)
Fig18 Electrophoresis of colony PCR products
PCR products by VF2 and VR were analyzed by electrophoresis.
As shown in Fig18, colony amplified in lane a-6 was observed to have two different plasmids. This was the first time in our project that we had both of our surface display plasmids simultaneously in an E. coli
In order to test whether the two plasmids could be stably inherited, we performed single colony isolation of this strain and conducted a colony PCR on the newly formed 4 colonies. As shown in Fig18, the band corresponding to the INPNC-His-CBDcex were observed in all the colonies, while the band for low-copy plasmid, INPNC-His-scFv couldn't be observed in any of the lanes. This result strongly suggests that the low-copy plasmid dropped out during the formation of new colonies. As both the plasmids are Cp-resistant, deleting one plasmid will not affect the E. coli's antibiotic status. In order for our Noro-catcher to stably pass down both plasmids, we need to construct one plasmid with a different antibiotic marker and grow the bacteria on a medium with two different antibiotics. In addition to changing the antibiotic resistance, it may be better to use different surface display systems for stable expression of scFv and CBDcex (see Discussion).

4-1 Our Accomplishment
As stated above, we tackled on the development of Noro-catcher, a NoV infection-combatting biodevice. We constructed and expressed two handles, anti-NoV scFv and CBDcex on the bacterial surface using INPNC-His surface display system.

He suggested we could use a tube with a preservative in its lid that is only released upon closing the tube. The tube could then be sent out via post to an individual to provide a saliva or urine sample, and could be posted back to a centralized lab for processing. For blood, there would be localized centers for tests (or just GP centers) and one main processing lab.
He also recommended using a multiplexing assay to detect multiple different miRNAs simultaneously from the same sample. However, at the time we had only designed one series of switches which would be activated by homologs. For a multiplexing assay, cross-hybridization levels need to be minimal - so we knew we had to think about new ways to design our switches. Our second series of switches, designed after talking with iGEM EPFL, were designed to solve this problem.
Professor Lovat’s team at UCL also helped us choose the best pieces of equipment for miRNA extraction which helped us with our cost analysis . We also discussed carrying out miRNA extractions in the field with them, as well as automation of the miRNA extraction protocol.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Professor Lovat and Dr Desai were concerned about the specificity and sensitivity of our test, and how it would be used for screening.
There are two types of sensitivity and specificity:
In terms of the toehold switch, sensitivity is the lowest number of miRNAs that can be detected and specificity is whether only the target miRNA can activate the switch. The feedback of doctors prompted us to seek out the advice of iGEM EPFL, to create the second generation switches with massively superior specificity.
In terms of a screening tool, sensitivity relates to the false negative rate, while specificity relates to the false positive rate.
A 100% sensitive test will always pick up the disease but may also pick up patients that do not have the disease (no false negatives).
A 100% specific test will never pick up healthy patients but may also miss patients that do have the disease (no false positives).

Introduction
The bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, used in our project is a gram-positive soil bacterium that, under certain conditions, would commit itself to a developmental pathway leading to the production of spores.[1] Therefore, in this section of our project, we hope to control sporulation in our bacterial population, such that we can decide how much of the population becomes spores, and how much continue as vegetative cells. Should the cell sporulate, it would become a ‘metal container’ , trapping the sequestered cadmium in its spore.
After the cell sequesters cadmium into its spore, it should not germinate or the sequestered cadmium will be released back into the environment as a result. Therefore, the role of chassis comes into play, where the sleB and cwlJ germination-defective mutants are put into use.
In order to control sporulation, our team is proposing the idea of inducing the synthesis of kinA, with IPTG as a sporulation initiation signal.
KinA is a major kinase which provides phosphate input to the phosphorelay, which in turn, activates the sporulation pathway upon starvation via the phosphorylated Spo0A transcription factor,[2] which governs entry into the sporulation pathways of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.[3]
Spo0A
From our research, we found that entry into the sporulation pathway is governed by a member of the response regulator family of transcription facts, known as Spo0A.[3] Spo0A is activated by phosphorylation on an aspartyl residue located in the N"
MoWestern_Davidson,2009,Team:MoWestern Davidson#notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," team had unified around applications of the Satisfiability (SAT) problem to the genome of E.coli via the use of frameshift suppressor tRNAs.
We needed to design and engineer a reporter gene that the tRNA would suppress. Therefore, our research would consist of 2 main tracks: tRNA project and the 5mer Reporter Project.
Week 2 (June 1-June 5)
tRNA Project
We began to plan the construction of a 1-SAT model that would include a modified reporter gene suppressed by its respective tRNA.
The two campuses decided to split up the list of tRNAs according to percent suppression. Missouri Western took CUACC, AGGAC, CCAAU, CUAGC, CUACU, and CCACC. Davidson took CUAGU, CCACU, CGGUC, CCCUC, CCAUC-9 and CCAUC-10. We requested the sequence for our tRNAs from Dr. J. Christopher Anderson. After receiving them, we planned their construction via oligo assembly.
By the end of the week, we had planned to use 4 total oligos for our tRNAs.
5mer Reporter Project
In order to minimize major changes made to the protein structures and gene, we decided to place our 5 base pair addition upstream of our reporter protein. We accomplished this using PCR. We manipulated the PCR primers by designing our forward primer to include ATG, our 5mer, and the first half of the reporter protein up to a restriction site of our choice.
We wanted 1 fluorescence gene and 1 antibiotic resistance gene on each campus. After careful consideration of which reporters had the most ""hardy"" restriction sites, we decided upon RFP and tetracycline resistance protein on the Davidson campus; and GFP and chloramphenicol resistance on the Missouri campus.
Week 3 (June 8-June 12)
tRNA Project
After editing the first draft of 4 oligos, we devised a tRNA constructed of  7 oligos of shorter lengths to reduce the chance of mutations. We assembled our tRNA from these oligos and ligated/transformed the assembly. By the end of the week, we had obtained colonies from these transformations.
5mer Reporter Project
We chose NcoI as the restriction site in the RFP and BamHI as the site in Tet Resistance. We ordered the oligos of our primers. The forward primer was different for each of the 5 different 5mers on Davidson's campus and 6 different 5mer's on"

Degradation was suspected for our fusion protein. Results seem to suggest that the fusion protein is being cleaved at the linker, resulting in both the dxCas9 and the fusion protein being present in our sample. The heparin chromatography was relatively successful at separating the two populations. The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt (lane 2-10). As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (lane 6-10). At high levels of salt the mostly fusion elutes (lane 11-13). Only these last three elution fractions are pooled (lane 11-13). Thus losses are tolerated, to obtain a relatively pure fusion fraction which can be further purified by MonoQ.

Protein Purification - MonoQ Chromatography
The fusion protein was further purified with MonoQ chromatography. The 1mL MonoQ 5/50 GL column was connected to the AKTA pure in the cold room at 4 ℃.  6mL of sample (4x diluted heparin chromatography elution fraction 10-12 of fusion protein) was injected into the injection loop and the chromatography was followed according to the Purification Protocol.

In order to analyse monoQ of the fusion protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 8% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol. The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:

WashU_StLouis,2016,Team:WashU StLouis#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," idea of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations.
Intrexon, another sponsor of the WashU-PSU iGEM team, allowed us to speak with one of their lead microbiologists. He offered insight into some of our unusual results. The reddish coloration of our cultures overproducing ferredoxin was likely the result of reduced cytochromes in our cells. In future work, we think a cytochrome assay could prove more indicative of reduced electron donor concentration than a biotin assay. In addition, he suggested new applications for our super cells. Sulfur-containing polypeptide chains would benefit from higher ATP concentrations, so our cells could potentially be utilized for specialized recombinant protein production. From his advice, we recognized that our strain had varied applications in industry as well as agriculture.
Engagement
Throughout the course of our project, we sought to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology through education wherever possible:
We led two synthetic biology workshops for Washington University’s  pre-engineering institute. This summer program allows a group of approximately 30 students to do an experiment in each of the engineering school’s main divisions.
We discussed our project with local teachers participating in a BioBuilder workshop. We found that the teachers were enthusiastic about including synthetic biology in their curriculums.
We helped run a “Building with Biology” event at the iGEM heartland regional meetup with our buddies over at UNL and Missouri S&T.

We chose to focus on the diseases cholera and Shigellosis - two of the main culprits contributing to unclean drinking water related fatalities - due to the sheer scale of deaths they cause per year and as neither has an affordable, readily available cure for affected people in developing countries. Their respective bacteria (Vibrio cholerae for Cholera, Shigella for Shigellosis) are also similar both to each other and to the bacterium we chose as a model, E. coli, meaning they were a perfect fit for our project.
Ultimately, our final product developed into what is mainly a preventative method; it stops Vibrio cholerae and Shigella from becoming virulent, and so renders them harmless.
We have achieved this by utilising the natural process of RNA interference (RNAi). For this, we have designed, constructed and/or characterised a number of different basic and composite parts which would work together to effectively inhibit the virulence of our target bacteria.
More about our target conditions...
Cholera
Cholera is a bacterial infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which enters the body via ingestion of contaminated food or water. Without proper treatment, severe dehydration and even death can occur within hours due to the infection's three main symptoms of vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea.
Cholera infects around 3-5 million people worldwide and causes around 58,000-130,000 deaths per year.
Shigellosis
Shigellosis is caused by the bacteria belonging to the genus Shigella. It is another food and waterborne illness, which rarely occurs in any animals apart from humans. It is frequently found in water sources that are contaminated with human faeces, and is a major"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  An SDS-PAGE gel will be ran to analyze the results of yesterday’s purification.
Procedures:
All samples were obtained and put on ice.
Using 2x loading dye, 5% BME was added.  142.5uL of 2x dye to 7.5uL of BME.
15uL of each sample was mixed with 15uL of dye.  10uL of dual color ladder was mixed with 10uL of loading dye.  Aggregation was observed in the whole cell lysate and in the elution fractions. All samples were boiled for 10 minutes, and centrifuged for 10 seconds to collect at the bottom.  The aggregates were noticeably gone.
The SDS-PAGE apparatus was assembled, and 1L of running buffer was made from a 10x solution.
20uL of each sample was added to the wells. The gel was ran at 100V for 30 minutes to ensure even running, then at 120V until the dye front was near the bottom.  ~1.5 hours.
The gel was cut out, and stained with coomassie for 1 hour.  Destaining took place for 2 hours, with changing the destain buffer every hour.
Conclusions:  Since the destain wasn’t completely done, the gel was left in destain on the bench overnight.
Results:
Below is the gel.  From left to right:  Ladder, ladder, whole cell lysate, unbound proteins, wash 1-3, elution 1-3.
Media:2015-08-12_SDSPAGE_Yeates_PCquad.jpg
It appears that a preliminary purification worked, though more washes can make it cleaner.  To avoid the observed aggregation, more lysis buffer may be used next time.

UT-Tokyo,2016,Team:UT-Tokyo#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," not change after three generations and it is a necessary condition for gene expression loop of three generations. Xs satisfying condition A are called fixed points. While condition B means fluctuated states (concentration of each factor) from a fixed point will go back to the fixed point as time passed, it is a condition for the loop to maintain stably regardless of the initial state and fluctuation in E. coli. Therefore, the task of our developed tool is judging the existence of fixed point X satisfying both condition A and B.
The analysis tool first finds X satisfying condition A, subsequently check if the fixed point X satisfies condition B or not. The process of searching for X satisfying condition A is performed with an arranged algorithm “differential evolution”. In this aranged algorithm, cost function is norm of P(X)-X and the population are composed of candidates of X. P(X) is calculated by numerical integral, Euler method.
The process of judging condition B is done in this way. First, Jacobian matrix $\frac{\partial (P - X)}{\partial X}$ is calculated with numerical approximation. Second, eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are calculated with LU decomposition method. Then whether each eigenvalue is plus or minus is judged. For convenience’ sake, numerical integrals calculation are all performed ignoring Gaussian noise, delay of transcription and translation, and influence of arabinose. We wrote a code which implements this process with an inputted parameter set and return the result of stability judging. The code is below.
File:T--UT-Tokyo--Modeling--Stability.zip
Result and Discussion
The code above (Stability.java) judged that the expression loop is stable when we inputted a certain parameter set which made a positive result when simulated ( Parameter Set A in the Section 4 ). This judgement mathematically supports our expectation that the genetic circuit generates stable expression loops under valid parameter sets. Now this code enables us to judge whether the circuit generates stable expression loops under various sets of parameters obtained from literature or experiment.
Parameters Fitting with the Results of Experiment
Aim
The tool explained in chapter 1 and 2 enabled us to examine in advance whether the gene expression loop would be stable with a parameter set of the expression,  decomposition rates, etc. Therefore, we experimented with real E. coli strain, growth environment and other factors to find  parameters which are suited to the simulation with the tool.
Method
We did two experiments. First one is putting GFP gene in downstream of Pnrd and measuring the time shift of fluorescent strength of GFP. Second one is putting GFP in downstream of Pconst"

Dalhousie_Halifax_NS,2016,Team:Dalhousie Halifax NS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," in which they can swim. More about the Wildlife Park can be found here.
The wildlife park has been an invaluable resource. The animals are fed a supplemented diet, which consists mainly of natural diets with added food like fruits/veggies for the herbivores and protein supplements for the carnivores. Because they eat a supplemented diet, and diet does affect microbiome content, there is potential error associated with the use of samples obtained from the Park. However, we considered this error to be minimized as the mammals eat many of the same things they would in nature. The Park was also the safest way for us to obtain fecal samples, so associated error was acknowledged as part of this process.
DNA Extraction:
We obtained fecal samples from 21 mammals at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park. These fecal samples contain millions of each animal’s gut microbes, which make up the microbiomes of their gut. The DNA extraction step allows us to identify these bacteria through the bacterial DNA found in each fecal sample. DNA extraction was done using MoBio’s PowerFECAL kit which uses both alkaline lysis and mechanical lysis. Alkaline lysis works through a detergent, which disrupts the membranes of the bacterial cells. Mechanical lysis works through small ceramic beads shaken in the tube at high speeds to mechanically break up bacterial membranes and release the bacterial cell contents. The broken bacterial cell debris is discarded and a supernate is passed through a column, where DNA binds but all other cell material flows through. The columns were washed with ethanol and DNA is eluted using a buffer provided by MoBio. We are left with clean, pure genomic DNA from all the cells in the fecal sample.
Polymerase Chain Reaction:
To prepare our genomic DNA sample for illumina sequencing, we first had to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create many copies of a specific region of the genomes. The specific region we require for microbial identification is the 16S rRNA gene. This gene is used widely as a molecular phylogeny taxonomic identifier: analysis of the obtained data will provide us with a good idea of what bacteria are present in each sample.
PCR works by using small oligonucleotides that are called primers, and a heat-stable DNA polymerase. These oligonucleotides anneal to a template and provide a free 5’-OH group, essentially priming the DNA synthesis reaction; the heat-stable polymerase then amplifies DNA from that template strand. A machine called a thermocycler works to cycle the temperature at which samples are incubated. The cycle has"
Vanderbilt,2014,Team:Vanderbilt#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the santalene synthase gene.
In the spring concurrent to work by the terpene groups, work began on plasmid construction. This was preformed by the president, wetware director, and a handful of others rather than in group format. Each gene cassette for our final plasmid was first identified in an existing, readily available plasmid. All of these cassettes were extracted by PCR using those plasmids as templates. Overlap extension PCR was then done on the gel-purified product to add restriction sites and homology regions for the purposes of eventually combining all of the cassettes together into a single plasmid. By the end of the summer, only one final fragment remained to be inserted to complete the intermediate plasmid pVU14004. Upon the successful creation of pVU14004, several restriction enzyme sites had to be removed by site directed mutagensis in order to make the plasmid RFC10 compatible.
Results and Directions
Several factors contributed to the difficulty we experienced during the final phase of the project. First, member engagement suffered a significant decline between the spring and fall semesters, to the point where only a small handful of people were left to preform all experiments. Second, the late realization that we had to change our cloning strategy to modified cDNA inserts effectively meant we had to start anew in late August despite having what was a good head start when we began in early March. Third, the RFC10 requirements added a substantial dimension of difficulty to the project since all of our starting material (both the extracted gene cassettes for plasmid construction and the synthase genes) contained multiple sites that made them incompatible with the biobrick standard. Nevertheless, our team accomplished an enormous amount during our first year in competition.

Synthetic Biology Open language Visual: SBOL-V
Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv) is a graphical notation that supports biological device development.  It provides a formal notation for describing the physical composition of basic parts into composite parts during the development of biological devices.  It is targeted for use by biological engineers in forward engineering projects.  It encourages and supports model-driven engineering.
SBOLv is an open standard that balances the benefits of top-down control with the bottom-up needs to communicate.  The notation is flourishing in an environment of open communication while rigorously defining symbols, syntax, and grammar.  SBOLv is an abstract tool for solving concrete problems.  It has a rigorous and consistent structure and is being used in concrete software tools while working on concrete Synthetic Biology projects.
SBOLv is a component of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), an emerging open standard for structuring and exchanging information between members of the Synthetic Biology Community.  SBOL has four components; a relational model (Core Data Model), a semantic model (SBOL Semantic), a scripting language (SBOL Script), and a graphical notation (SBOL Visual).  SBOL promises to offer biological engineers with a comprehensive set of standards and tools in support of data exchange and communication.

We were lucky enough to visit Richard Ballard and Steve Dring, the owners of Growing Underground . This innovative company gave us lots of inspiration for our Human Practices. They are an indoor farm operating 33 meters below the streets of Clapham in London. They grow in tunnels that were formerly used as bunkers during the Second World War. We got the chance to tour their facilities, taste their produce, learn more about the equipment they use, the processes they had to go through to legally grow in the tunnels and finally we were able to pitch our project to them. Richard mentioned that they are currently in the process of establishing a research and development department, they are planning on conducting research into farming with the aid of biological processes. We both saw parallels between the work we were doing, and Richard was passionate about future collaboration.
Nafferton Farm - 29/08/2018
Newcastle University have two farms where they conduct agricultural studies (Nafferton & Cockle Park Farm). We thought visiting the farms would be an excellent opportunity for us to understand more about the context our product would be used in. Touring the farm we were shown different research sites on both conventional and organic farm land. Dr Ankush Prashar is our main contact at Nafferton. We have also spoken to the Newcastle University Farm's Director, James Standen, he was able to provide very useful statistics relating to the farms operations, specifically data on fertiliser usage. We were also given feedback on our project from a grower's / farmer's perspective. All in all, everyone at the farm seemed excited about the prospect of our project.
GrowUp Urban Farms - 29/08/2018
Tom Webster, CTO at GrowUp Urban Farms gave us a Skype call. GrowUp Urban Farms use hydroponics to provide fresh produce within urban environments. They are committed to sustainable agriculture and providing fresh food year round in ways which are positive for both communities and the environment. During our Skype call we introduced our project and asked Tom about the control and containment parameters they use in their systems. GrowUp used to use Aquaponics, a method of growing that uses fish and their waste to provide nutrients in a conventional hydroponic system. We asked him about how consumers respond to this method of growing. He mentioned that many demographics were adverse"

BactoGrip: Our Platform
This summer we dedicated ourselves to building a modular, durable, biomimetic platform for                 synthetic biologists who need to control bacterial adhesion. We developed a set of assays to                 reliably determine how our system is functioning and selected relevant positive and negative                 control strains to differentiate real from imaginary results. Using the tools of synthetic biology,                 we created BioBricks which can be                 integrated into complex biological circuits where specific interaction with the physical environment is a must. Furthermore, we created a workflow                 that can be used to integrate any desired binding specificity into our system, and modified the native                 protein so that it is easy to work with and measure under diverse experimental conditions. We call our                 system BactoGrip, and we hope you will find it as gripping as we do.
How do you use BactoGrip, you ask?

Strains and Assays
Before we could begin engineering the Fim system we needed to establish a positive and negative baseline for the experiments we'd use to categorize our constructs. We selected two strains from the Yale's Keio collection of nonessential gene knockouts which are each missing one of the recombinases that comprises the fim “switch”. We hypothesized based on the literature that a knockout for the fimB recombinase (Keio strain name JW4276) will not produce pili because fimE is biased to switch in the direction of “on” to “off”. When fimB is absent, fimE would switch the operon “off”. Contrarily, a knockout for fim E (Keio name- JW4276) will overproduce pili because fimB switches both “on” to “off” and “off” to “on”, so the operon will be “on” more than it would if both were present.
To confirm this hypothesis we used an agglutination assay from the literature which is standard for measuring the expression of Type 1 Pili.
This protocol tests whether a culture of E. coli cells can agglutinate--clump together--a substrate which contains the binding partner of fimH, mannose sugar. We chose to try to clump together S. cervisiae (baker's yeast) because it expresses mannose on its cell"

The samples analysed were HA+ (top left), HA- (top centre), CSGA+ (top right), CSGA- (bottom left), PSB+ (bottom centre) and PSB- (bottom right).
The results of this experiment showed a strong background from the samples, meaning that probably the teeth display some kind of self-fluorescence. Consequently, the results of this test cannot be considered for proving the affinity to hydroxyapatite of our biofilms.
Then we performed the second measurement assay, using a 96-well plate and the plate reader. The results are displayed in figure 23, and the parameters were confirmed using the supernatant of the CsgA producing cells with no ethanol treatment.
Figure 23. Fluorescence read of the ethanol supernatant where the dental samples where incubated. The liquids were excited with 560 nm of wavelength and the emission length detected was 607, for RFP fluorescence detection. All the samples are measured in triplicates, and the error bars show their standard deviation.
From the results shown above, we could conclude that our affinity tag for hydroxyapatite gives an actual difference when compared with the control samples, for significance level of 5%. Also, the statistical analysis confirms that there is a significant change between cells with the affinity tag and without it (Table 11).
Table 11. Significance analysis of the samples analysed. All the samples but the empty plasmid control display a significant difference when compared to the blank. Thus, both CsgA and CsgA+HA tagged cells attach better to a dental surface than cells that do not express the amyloid curli. Furthermore, the difference of fluorescence between the cells expressing the tagged protein and the untagged is also significantly different, confirming the efficiency of the hydroxyapatite peptide tag.
SpyTag-SpyCatcher
Our initial plan was to, in addition to the His- and Hydroxyapatite-tag, also attach a SpyTag to the CsgA proteins. This idea was based on an article of the Joshi Lab on programmable biofilm-based materials (Nguyen, Botyanszki, Tay, & Joshi, 2014). This SpyTag can spontaneously form covalent bonds with a protein called SpyCatcher. The SpyCatcher protein can be attached to other proteins to form a fusion protein. This way the fusion protein can be immobilized on the SpyTag. By attaching the"

    Then we start our model to find key anti-acid component.

heat map PDF
    We conduct a heat map analysis of the gene expression of mutant strain L.lactis WH101 and parent strain L.lactis NZ9000 in four cases. The heat map shows the degree of up-down-regulation of each gene, and 266 deferentially expressed genes are selected in the four cases according to the P value we set. Further analysis shows that there are 61 common deferential genes (Figure 3). We preliminarily concluded that the anti-acid mechanism of mutant L.lactis WH101 is related to these 61 common differential genes.
2. PCA analysis (Principle Component Analysis)
    We then perform PCA on the data of the 61 common deferential genes.
    Statistically, PCA is one of the most widely used data compression algorithms. In PCA, data is converted from the original coordinate system to the new coordinate system, which is determined by the data itself. When converting the coordinate system, the direction with the largest variance is taken as the direction of the coordinate axis, because the maximum variance of the data gives the most important information of the data. The first new axis selects the method with the largest variance in the original data, and the second new axis selects the direction orthogonal to the first new coordinate axis and the second largest variance. This process is repeated and the number of repetitions is the feature dimension of the original data.
    The specific code that converts the data into feature spaces that retain only the first N principal components is as follows:
from numpy import *
def loadDataSet(filename,delim='\t')
        fr=open(filename)

Sweden's Television, SVT, is the national public TV broadcaster of                     Sweden. They made a reportage about our project in particular, but we also                     informed about iGEM in general.
i First Gibson assembly
We made the first attempt to assemble our final DNA construct with the method Gibson Assembly, which was totally new for us.
Gibson assembly is an exonuclease-based method to assembly multiple DNA fragments in correct order. The method was invented in 2009 by Daniel G. Gibson, of the J. Craig Venter Institute. The assembly reaction is carried out in one single reaction-tube, all at once, at 50° Celsius for 15-60 minutes. The process involves three different enzymatic actions. A 5’ exonuclease creates overhangs, enabling matched fragments to anneal. Then a DNA polymerase fills gap between the annealed strands and the 5´ end. Finally, a DNA ligase seals the gaps between the filled in gap and the annealed strands.
For more information, see Gibson Assembly
Using this method, we constructed three different parts, see results .

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," by the map above, there are two common sections : the first part includes general questions, synthetic biology, and biofilms for all, and the second part to collect feedback and opinions. Then, a specific section about infections aimed at health professional in the field of prostheses. This choice enabled us to collect relevant information concerning the project NeuronArch and to achieve the third goal of this survey.   Besides the distinction between general public and medical professionals, we wanted to differentiate their various levels in biology . Therefore, we asked a question about their science education level. This question helped us to analyze answers about synthetic biology for example. After defining goals, different populations and framework of our survey, we had to think on how to analyze the results.
Approach through trial and error
This approach was adopted just after collecting our first answers. The last section of the survey is dedicated to public’s opinion and feedback about the survey. With this section, we can gather all criticism and advice to improve the survey (and the project too!).
Figure 2: Our survey methodology
As a consequence, we adapted our explanation section making it more readable.  We added some questions: for example, we decided to ask biology levels to improve our analysis and to better understand comments and feedback.  We also modified some questions: - About the age range - About the infection rate in prosthesis: we discussed among ourselves and took into account comments that mentioned that the question was too confusing.   Moreover, we received other comments about the project and the scientific part. Following a suggestion in the comments, we thought about developing a collaborative approach allowing the public to get an answer to their questions, and hence make it more interactive. This is an aspect that we will consider in the future.   This process through trial and error enabled us to improve the survey and obtain relevant answers.
Data analysis
See all our data in this Excel file.
Population
Our survey was launched on August 21st, 2018 on the platform Google Form and was destined to the French public. We received 205 answers from 80 men and 125 women.
Figure 3: Population gender of our study
We tried to diffuse our survey on the internet, trying to reach as many people as possible. At the beginning we noticed that most of the answers were from the younger people, between the ages of 16 and 25, almost all in the same age range as our team members ! We then tried to reach a wider population, from the ages of 26 and above 71.

Collecting and analyzing armpit smell samples: Volunteers should place cotton pads under their armpits for a specified amount of time and fill a form with information about their lifestyle, diet, gender, and age.
Developing an online game to analyze the samples and learn more about the microbiome : The participants use the online platform created to analyze samples that have been given by other participants. People will assess their personal impression of the fragrance of the different samples. The final aim is to give users the analysis of their personal odor provided by others participants.
Study how emotions can affect body odor: Take samples of volunteers before and after watching a horror movie and making a smell test to determine if there is a significant change in their body odor.
Figure 2a: Deodorant has no effect on smell intensity. We collected samples of 300 volunteers from iGEM teams and citizen scientists. Subjects smelled 6 samples and rated their intensity.No difference was found between these 2 types of samples.The confidence interval is equal to 95%. Figure 2b: Deodorant has a negative effect on body odor pleasantness.On the same samples, a better pleasantness has been found for people not spraying deodorant, (P=0,0235).
Figure 3a:Gender has no influence on body odor intensity.There is no measurable difference between male and female body odor intensity, (P=0,081). Figure 3b:Women don't smell better than men.No significant difference was found between male and female body odor pleasantness.
Figure 4: People aged between 20 and 35 have the strongest body odor.As expected,odor intensity was found to increase with the age. Surprisingly, teenagers are not the people with the strongest body odor. We limited our study to these four groups, to reflect the amount and age range of the participants.
Figure 5: The horror movie experiment. We collected samples of 17 volunteers before and after watching a scary movie. Differences in strength and pleasantness were not found significant overall (Wilcoxon test, difference in strength p=0.69; difference in pleasantness p=0.84) although some individuals did experience a significant change (volunteers number 3 and 9). Samples were tested by at least 4 people.The number of smell analyzes is too low to conclude anything.

Notes:
Kenneth et al. estimated the change in free Gibbs energy in this reaction (with wildtype CI) as -11.1 kcal/mol,10 which leads to an equilibrium constant of 8.32186E16 molecules-1.  This implies that the forward rate constant should be at least sixteen orders of magnitude greater than the reverse rate constant, which means a constant repression of RcnA even with the constitutive CI synthesis.  A parameter scan was run to determine the range of values that gives the desired behavior and the rate constants were chosen arbitrarily  within this range. These values are comparable to others typical biochemical parameters. It has been shown that kinetic parameters can be modified by changing amino acid sequences (for example, CI half life is reduced by adding a LVA tail in the C-terminal), it’s proposed that  it’s possible to engineer the protein to reach an acceptable dissociation constant.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," in Gootenberg et al. 2017 (find the Cas13a purification protocol here ). During purification, SDS-PAGE analysis was done to check for presence and purity of Cas13a (Figure 7).
Figure 7: The difference in expression between the bacteria cultures before and after induction with IPTG (BI and AI). The intensity of the bands around 140 kDa show a clear difference before and after induction, which mean that the induction was successful and that the size of the translated protein is right.
B: The presence of proteins in the different purification samples. This gels shows the presence of proteins in the supernatant (SN), the first two washing steps (W1 and W2) and the five elution steps (E1-5). It can be seen that clear bands around 140 kDa are present in the elution steps. Also, some fainter bands at different heights can be seen in the elution steps.
From these results we can conclude that Cas13a is expressed in significantly higher quantities after induction with IPTG (although there is some leaky expression). Furthermore we can conclude that purity of the product is increased using the different purification steps that were done.
Proof of Cas13a collateral cleavage activity
To assess the collateral cleavage activity of the purified Cas13a, we first made use of the fluorescence assay as described by Gootenberg et al. 2017 . For a description of the RNase alert assay ( Thermo Fischer Scientific, 2017 ), see the Cas13a design page. Reactions with Cas13a were performed with and without target and crRNA (Figure 8).
Figure 8: The fluorescence of RNase alert over time. Fluorescence indicates for Cas13a activity. It is shown here that there is only activity when both crRNA and target RNA is added to the solution. Values reported here are the measured values of which the blank (only RNase alert) is subtracted.
From this figure we can conclude that Cas13a indeed gets activated by finding its target and shows collateral cleavage. There is relatively more fluorescence when Cas13a is present with crRNA and target, than without them.
Production and testing of different crRNAs
We employed our crRNA design to design 5 crRNAs that have been successfully synthesized following the crRNA synthesis protocol . The synthesis of crRNA is achieved by annealing two complementary DNA oligos ( oligos IG0057 - IG0063 ) that serve as templates. In vitro transcription was conducted on these DNA oligos. As indicated in Figure 9,"

Our assembly strategy involved assembling 4 fragments together (see design page). Over the course of the project, we made these 4 fragments but were unable to assemble them together into one plasmid. We managed to biobrick one of these fragments, the tracrRNA fragment ( BBa_K1559000 ) before the parts submission deadline.
We have also documented and added the sequences of the rest of the parts we designed to the parts registry in the hopes that future iGEM teams may find them useful.

What is CRISPR?
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a long name for a characteristic DNA locus that is responsible for the adaptive immunity in most bacteria and in many species of archaea. CRISPRs have been divided into three types (I-III), of which type II is the best understood. A CRISPR type II locus consists of three components: tracrRNA, the Cas genes, and the ""array"".
Cas gene(s): The core of a type II CRISPR system is Cas9, an endonuclease. Its"

Kinderuniversiteit workshops!
On the 17th of October Kinderuniversiteit asked us to organize 2 workshops of 30 minutes for approximately 300 kids, aged from 8 till 13. We sat together and brainstormed fun ideas of scientific experiments we could perform for these children. These experiments had to be fun and educational at the same time, that is why we wanted to use the human body as central part. During two workshops we showed that the human body is the easiest way to perform scientific experiments, which they could repeat at home and impress their friends and family. In this way every kid can be a scientist at home, with these experiments we hoped to get them excited about science and get them engaged in the future. How did we do this? We started with showing some cool features and life hacks of the human body, like the patellar reflex and the center of gravity difference between boys and girls. Once we got their attention we explained why all of this is happening, you had to see their amazed faces. I should add that we were very surprised by the knowledge these kids already obtained, they knew things we just learned in university. But by showing this knowledge in practice and show them how fun science can be we got lots of happy faces and raised hands to ask more and more questions. Both workshops only lasted for 30 minutes but it felt like 30 hours of intensive labor, afterwards we were so tired but also so grateful of the enthusiasm of these children. These kids are the future of our country and to see them so full energy and knowledge regarding science filled our hearts with joy. This has been an amazing experience and left us amazed regarding these kids, we couldn’t be more thankful for getting this opportunity to engage with these children and spread the science-bug.

Practice Presentation
The date is the 23rd of October 2017. We are now two weeks away from Boston! At this point, we’re focusing on our presentation, countless hours have been put into the preparation of the presentation and the powerpoint! However, we couldn’t give an objective and fair opinion regarding the presentation, after all, we were the ones that worked on it! We invited our personal instructors, a number of professors, and members of last year’s iGEM edition to come observe, analyze, and give us their feedback. All presenters were nervous, as this was the moment of truth when it comes to checking whether or not our efforts were up to standards! We pushed through the stress"

Collaboration was also performed between the engineers to improve the modeling for both the teams. Several Skype conferences were held between the team from Imperial College London and the Wits CSIR team to discuss the design and theory behind our own chemotaxis models. The collaborative effort resulted in the Imperial College London kindly providing us with a model for our theophylline riboswitches. Their modelling results are as follows:
The Wits CSIR iGEM team intend to use a riboswitch to reprogram the chemotactic behavior of E.coli. The project includes engineering the attraction of the bacteria to theophylline[1]. CheZ is an important protein controlling the chemotaxis of bacteria. They used a theophylline riboswitch to control the expression of CheZ in CheZ deletion mutants in order to engineer the bacteria's movement towards theophylline[1]. We're using a riboswitch sensitive to theophylline to control the expression of CheZ. In the absence of theophylline, the start codon is covered so the translation of the strand cannot occur. In the presence of theophylline, the conformation of the riboswitch changes and the ribosome binding site is exposed[1]. Thus, the higher the concentration of the theophylline, the more will enter the cell resulting in the up regulation of CheZ expression. This will increase the frequency of directed movement[1].
The theophylline riboswitch can be modeled in three differential equations [2].
M ?= a?(T)-?M
(CheZ) ?= ßMT(P)-?CheZ
T ?= ?(P_ext )CheZ-dT
M, CheZ and T respectively stands for the concentration of CheZ mRNA, the concentration of protein CheZ and the concentration of theophylline. The constants a,ß,?,? and d are all positive, and respectively denote the CheZ-promoter transcription rate, the CheZ-mRNA translation rate and the mRNA, CheZ and theophylline degradation-plus-dilution-rates. ?(Text) is the theophylline transport rate per unit CheZ concentration. It is a function of number of theophylline receptors and external theophylline concentration. The function ?(T) and T"
Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," for our assays since it was shows to degrade anthocyanins, but unfortunately we did not manage to express it correctly in E. coli.
Bacillus pumilus’ BpuI laccase caught our attention, as laccases have been shown to degrade anthocyanins (Rodriguez Couto 2006). Notably, its corresponding gene was available as BioBrick BBa_K863000 in the iGEM Part Registry.
Next, we wanted to test two Catechol-dioxygenases: XylE from Pseudonomas putida and CatA from Acinetobacter pittii. We hypothesized that these enzymes would be strong candidates for removal of red-wine stains because catechol shares important structural similarities with anthocyanin (Cerdan 1995, Kobayasi 1995 and Lin 2015).
Finally, we decided to work with Lactobacillus plantarum’s tannin acyl hydrolase TanLpI. Although the red wine colour is associated with anthocyanins, tannins are important colour stabilizers. Tannins molecules form covalent bonds with anthocyanins to provide molecular stability of the anthocyanins over time. By targeting the tannin molecules, we wanted to destabilize the anthocyanins and thereby indirectly remove the wine stain (Curiel 2009).
Figure 1 Targets of our enzymes within the malvidin molecule. This figure shows the place in which each of the enzymes attack the malvidin molecule. The different coloured lightbolts represent the different enzymes.
Design of our expression system
We constructed recombinant E. coli strains carrying the selected candidate enzymes using the following strategy. First, all the genes corresponding to the enzymes described above were codon optimized for expression in E. coli and equipped with an histidine tag at their C-terminus to facilitate protein purification. We adopted the pCOLA plasmid from the pDUET system to overexpress each enzyme (Novagen). In order to make the pCOLA plasmid compatible with the Golden Gate assembly method, we deleted all BsaI restriction sites and replaced the original multiple cloning site downstream of the T7 promoter for a LacZ cassette. Two BsaI restriction sites were added to allow the insertion of any gene of interest between the T7 promoter and T7 terminator while removing LacZ.
This way, we had a simple and standardised workflow for the construction of our expression plasmids. Golden gate reactions were transformed to"

Lastly, we wanted to utilize an engineered fimH type-one pillus derived cancer binding protein. FimH, if correctly expressed, will attach at the pili and will allow bacterial cells to naturally bind to the sugar mannose on epithelial cells. However, in order to make our bacteria bind specifically to colon cancer cells, we chose the RPMrel colon cancer specific binding peptide part already designed by Harvard BioDesign iGEM 2015 (BBa_K1850010). It is to be inserted under control of its included promoter, downstream of the butyrate operon terminator. This will then be added to the edited E. coli Nissle 1917.
