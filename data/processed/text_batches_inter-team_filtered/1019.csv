Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CI"

Introduction
Timeline
Integration
Ethics
Synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field, with a bright future perspective. Synthetic biology-based systems are sustainable, innovative and have many possibilities. While developing systems it is important to look for the most suitable, safe and widely accepted application. To determine what problem would be most relevant and best suitable for our system, it was essential to acquire information of both experts and stakeholders. This shaped the focus of our social relevance, which started as a detection method for botulism and shifted towards a system aiding detection of oestrogens and oestrogen-like compounds. Furthermore, the extensive feedback aided the design of a device that is convenient to use, low-cost, safe and meets all other stakeholder requirements. To give an impression of the evolution of our project, the project timeline is illustrated below. A summary of the most influential insights is provided in the last section, underneath the infographic.

14/05/18 About RIVM
The RIVM is the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. They conduct research and provide advice to government authorities to improve policy relating to environmental and public health and safety. One of their core focusses is on policy surrounding safe use of GMO.
Insights
The development of a general lab tool is less interesting and powerful than an applied solution.
Contacting relevant organizations and businesses to figure out their needs is a good way to determine if problems in their field could benefit from our project.
Fields of interest could be food safety, environmental pollution, water quality, and chemical compounds.
It is likely unfeasible to engineer our GMO biosensor in such a way that introduction in the environment could legally be allowed.
Applied
Changed the aim of our project from a general lab tool to a specified sensor-solution.
Established contact with relevant organizations to catalogue interesting applications of our biosensor platform.

Jos van der Vosse is a senior scientist, currently working for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), where he develops detection systems to improve food quality and to ensure microbiological quality and safety.
Insights
Measuring specific contaminant concentration is crucial for application in food industry.
When using our biosensor for detecting contaminants, such as hormones and medicines in surface water, a less specific concentration might be sufficient.
A method using quantitative measurement is preferred"

Experimental Strategy
We designed a bring DNA closer tool (BDC tool) and a visualization tool, as mentioned perviously . In order to characterize our tools, we set up the experimental strategy explained bellow.
Contents
1 Characterization strategy
1.1 Tripartite Split-GFP and FRB*-FKBP12 dimerization systems
1.2 Assessment of the minimal distance to have fluorescence
1.3 Assessment of the DNA regions brought closer
2 Gene expression tests
Characterization strategy
Tripartite Split-GFP and FRB*-FKBP12 dimerization systems
First, we designed two biobricks to test the FRB*/FKBP12 interaction and the tripartite GFP system. FRB* was fused with one subunit of the gene encoding the GFP (GFP 11) and FKBP12 was fused with another subunit (GFP10) [Fig1]. Then, we also put the gene encoding the last subunit (GFP 1-9) in the plasmid pSB1C3 to form the tripartite GFP [Fig2].
Figure 1: Tripartite split-GFP and FRB*/FKBP12 functional assessment. Biobricks corresponding to intermediate characterization. FRB* is fused with GFP11 and FKBP12 is fused with GFP10.
In order to test the system, we built a plasmid containing three biobricks to express the full system [Fig2]. Then we transformed it in E. coli to assess the system. The system would be tested by measuring GFP fluorescence level under two different conditions [Fig1]: a growth medium containing rapalog (rapamycin analog) and a growth medium without it. We also planed to test it in bacteria containing just two parts (FRB-GFP11 and FKBP12-GFP10) instead of three (so without GFP1-9).

Safe Project Design
Our team decided to use non-pathogenic chassis, E. coli DH5α and Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100, to be transformed and produce non harmful products.
In order to properly assess the function of our project and device, we would need to show that a signal is produced in the presence of Pgt. However, after consulting the Office of Biological Safety, we decided we would be unable to use Pgt since a BSL3 lab is needed, and even in those conditions, the fungus would still pose a threat to the large amount of wheat crops grown in the St. Louis area. We substituted Pgt with the specific substances in Pgt, which are non harmful, in our proof-of-concept experimental design. In the detection portion of our project, we used ribitol, which is found in the infectious hyphae of Pgt, and in the profiling portion, we synthesized the avirulence factors, which are secreted by Pgt and recognized by resistance genes, in yeast.
Safe Lab Work
Every member on our team has completed both online and in-lab safety training. Common safety practices used daily in lab include gloves, lab coats, safety goggles, closed toed shoes, long pants, and the use of materials in a biosafety hood."

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!

JUDGING FORM ⇗
Our overall project can be broken down into four sub-projects. These are characterized as the following: Mycelium Material & Habitat Development, Mycelium Glue Project, Mycelium Filter Project, and finally the Mission Architecture that ties everything together. Below we summarize the demonstrations corresponding to each subproject.
Introduction
From large scale mycelium growth and modeling, to functionalizing proteins bound to mycelium, our team was able to achieve many of our largest goals for the project. We were also able to coordinate a comprehensive mission architecture that accounts for the harsh and complex task of space travel with mycelium. Below we have demonstrated how we achieved some of our project’s greatest feats.
Mycelium Material & Habitat Development
In growing mycelium, we were able to grow bricks, plates, and stools in only a number of weeks (Figures 1 and 2). We were also able to grow many of these structures using a variety of interesting substrates, like wood chips, yard waste, and sawdust. We also managed to grow Mycelium on Martian regolith, using supplemental nutrients, an idea we believe is novel. Further, we were able to model the growth rate of mycelium in different conditions in order to determine the optimal growth parameters for mycelium (Figures 3 and 4). This information helped inform us as to how the mycelium would fair in Martian conditions. This turn influenced our mission architecture and the design of the habitat itself (finding ways of providing sufficient heat and moisture, etc).

Model Your Project
We had three separate approaches to model various parts of our project. First , we attempted to verify the functionality of our fusion protein with different linker sequences using a protein threading server, following by optimization with molecular dynamics. Second , an algorithm known as Ensemble Kalman Filter was coded to infer difficult-to-measure concentrations, such as gRNAs, for our kinetics model through fluorescence reading. Lastly , Least-Squares Regression algorithm was adopted for our kinetics model, which could potentially be used in the future to predict mRNA editing efficiency given different input based on changes to the spacer region of the gRNA.
Demonstration of Your Work
The RESCUE Reporter system was tested in HEK293T mammalian cell lines transfected with base editor 3 and 4 made up of rAPOBEC1 and dCas9. It could successfully report DNA editing events under realistic conditions. Take a look at our results for more information on the demonstration.
Silver Medal
Validated Part
We have submitted three parts for this category, namely The EGFP-GLB1 WT ( BBa_K2807014 ), EGFP-GLB1 CCG mutant, ( BBa_K2807015 ), and dPspCas13b ( BBa_K2807001 ). All these constructs can successfully express proteins of the expected size when transfected in HEK293T cells.
Collaboration
We hosted the very first Singapore iGEM team meeting to discuss potential collaborations. We have also collaborated with Team Washington, Team IIT-Madras, and Team OUC-China in translations of outreach materials and survey and lastly, Team EPFL for human practices.

However, miRNAs present in saliva are less well documented. Saliva may also be less accurate as its composition can change depending on what was recently eaten so we didn’t look much more into this, but it could be a good area for further research.
Another cost involved in the test is the upfront equipment costs - see how we made a combined densitometer and fluorometer for less than £4 on our hardware page !
Screening cost-effectiveness model
To demonstrate that our test would be cost effective as part of a screening programme we built this cost effectiveness model. To do this it combines cancer prevelance data, the sensitivity and specificity values of our test, our cost analysis data and treament cost data.
We used Tammemägi et al.’s model to calculate the probability of someone getting lung cancer in the next 6 years. It is more sensitive than the simplistic criteria used by the National Lung Screening Trial, and thus a better way of selecting individuals for screening. Tammemägi et al. showed their model would be more cost effective method as more cancers were detected per number screened as it missed fewer cases of cancer. [16]
Although Tammemägi’s model was for lung cancer as a whole, we assume the risk factors put you at equal risk of non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer. As the miRNAs on which our test  is based do not indicate small cell lung cancer, we have built the model around NSCLC. All other figures are NSCLC specific.
A quality adjusted life year (QALY) represents one year in perfect health. The ‘quality adjusted’ part accounts for the quality of life for that year, for example 2 years with a 0.6 quality of life score would be 1.2 QALYs. QALYs can be used to measure the benefit a treatment provides (if any). Treatments costing less than £20,000 per QALY are deemed cost effective by NICE. Treaments between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY may be decided to be cost effective by NICE if there is a high degree of certainty in the cost per QALY or when there are substantial benefits not captured in the cost per QALY figure.

Always satisfied to be a menial reseacher(Not exactly).
Yi is a sophomore majoring in physics in UCAS.
During a couple of months spent on IGEM competition. She came across many outstanding teammates, from whom she harvested many new pieces of knowledge and experience. Though she may not continue the research work in the biological field, the precious experience thought she what ""scientific research"" really is.
Her summer vacation was spent in the laboratory where she served as an assistant. Out of lab she also did some paperwork such as translation and collecting some materials. She did some trivial works in HP and Hardware.
Although most of the time she acted as a ""manual worker"", she is willing to contribute to the team.
Xiaohan HU
More detail please!
Xiaohan is a junior majoring in mathematics and applied mathematics at UCAS.
Taking apart in iGEM and working with so many outstanding teammates were some interesting attempts for her. At least she knows how to keep calm now.
She was responsible for the artistic design of the project.
She has a bunch of seemingly unrelated hobbies in her daily life, such as debating, painting and literature. What she wants to do further is to make all these hobbies be related.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html," for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created in the sub-container of compartment in Part.
:: Part: This container contains definitions of parts. Part includes the basic units that can be inserted in an abstract chain. The container of Part has five sub-containers which are: compartment, biobrick, compound, plasmidBackbone, and substituent. Biobrick contains biobricks"

Figure 5: Example of model from modelling database. Click the picture for the full page. When the chosen enzyme has been selected, a list of all the teams that have modeled that specific enzyme will be presented. Furthermore the list will contain three columns: Validated, inhibitor and reversible. The idea behind validation is that other teams will be able to validate each other’s modeling. The next column shows whether inhibition has been included in the model, while the last column specifies if the reaction modeled is reversible and whether it has been included.
After choosing the desired team it should then be possible to open a page like this and find the needed information, i. e. name, reaction, differential equation, constants and notes about the differential equation regarding what aspects are included and what aspects are excluded (for example inhibition and the amount of substrates and products). Lastly it should be possible to copy the differential equation with the constants inserted to be able to insert it in the wanted model.
Figure 6: Uploading a model. Click the picture for the full page. Standardization is a very important part of any database and this one is no exception – all uploaded models should include all necessary elements and look the same. This is why it is important to have a specific uploading procedure and why we have made this example of how a team could upload a model to the iGEM modelling part registry.

Introduction
iGEM is a multi disciplinary competition and the participants have different scientific backgrounds. The TU Delft iGEM 2009 team has six members, 5 Life Scinece & Technology students and 1 Nanoscience student. During the iGEM competition communication is crucial. Participants have to communicate with different audiences in order to gain sponsorship, media attention, or convince the judges during the iGEM Jamboree etc. Communication with different audiences is crucial in order to complete the competition successfully.
During the recruiting period for TU Delft iGEM 2009, only 10 students were involved. In our opinion the reason for this was that not many students were aware of the iGEM competition. This is an nice example to show why communication is so important.
We set up this communication plan in order to:
Give an overview of the different audiences who we should communicate with.
Give an overview of the inputs we can use in order to address these audiences.
Create a chronological planning of our PR activities during and after the iGEM competition.
Provide the next (TU Delft) iGEM teams an overview and insights about the way we tried to communicate with the outside world.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," efficiency of solar cells as chemically produced microlenses, we have called for help in the department Photovoltaic Materials and Devices at the TU Delft. Here, prof. Dr. Arno Smets, had introduced us to Stefaan Heirman, a technician at the same research group. Stefaan helped us in our solar cell experiments.
Since the to be used solar simulator and all other necessary equipment were at another faculty of the TU Delft, our cells had to leave the ML-1 lab. Here, safety regulations from the executed practices were incorporated in the labwork, since the biolenses should be outside the lab – into the environment as well as soon as they could be used on solar panels. Even though the growth study of our in polysilicate covered E. coli cells did not show any growth anymore after 1 hour, due to safety regulations we have decided to used an additional method to sterilize our biolenses.
To sterilize, different options are available. For example alcohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds are used within healthcare and autoclaving is a much-used method in laboratory settings. Besides that, UV sterilization is a much-used method in water treatment (Chang et al., 1985; Hijnen et al., 2006; O’Flaherty et al., 2016) . This is used to remove among others E. coli. Since we do not want any chemicals to potentially interfere with our biolenses, we have chosen not to use any of these chemicals and to test whether autoclaving or UV sterilization would be a good option.
Methods
Autoclaving biolenses
Aliquots of E. colicells transformed with OmpA-silicatein were induced and complemented with silicic acid and subsequently autoclaved for 20 minutes at 121 ºC before imaged with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
UV sterilization
For this experiment, E. coli cells transformed with BolA pBbA5c were used, as the results of the growth experiments just showed that cells covered in polysilicate were not viable and we want a positive (absolutely living) control.
A volume of 30 µL E. coli BL21 cells that were transformed with BolA in pBbA5c was plated on LB plates complemented with chloramphenicol. As controls for sterilization aliquots of 500 µL of the same cells were either heated at 95 °C for 10 minutes or washed with 500 µL 70% ethanol for"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#27 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," was not long enough.
In today's lab session the team will conduct a second attempt of the digests and hopefully analyse them by DNA gel electrophoresis today also. As well as this the team needs to begin acting on the cloning strategy for the cadmium-sensing AND gate (i.e. placing the cadA promoter region next to the arsR binding site) by excising the BBa_J33206 + pSB1A2 backbone (which will have it's original promoter removed) out of gel and purifying the fragment.
Practical Outline
Mathew preparing to load digested DNA into the gel
Here are the tasks the Metal Sensing Team hope to complete by today's lab session
Carry out a second attempt at digesting the BBa_J33206 in pSB1A2 BioBrick with EcoRI alone, PstI alone and then with EcoRI+PstI and running the fragments on gel.
For the cadmium-sensing AND gate, digest 10ul of BBa_J33206 (in plasmid pSB1A2) and excise the backbone fragment out of gel.
Procedure
Second Attempt at digesting BBa_J33206 in plasmid pSB1A2
For the second attempt at digesting the pSB1A2 plasmid the Metal Sensing team decided to still use the FastDigest enzymes EcoRI and PstI as well as the FastDigest enzyme buffer in the procedure. However this time round, the team took the decision to digest less DNA and to also allow the digests to run for about 1 hour under 37C incubation. Below is a table showing all of the contents of the various digests:

Introduction
We are a bunch of teenagers who have profound dreams. When facing the recent food safety issues in Taiwan, we will never allow such problems  from happening again. We will think of some biological engineering ways to ease all the unstableness. Cooperating with 6 univeristies and 11 laboratories, we wish to proclaim our philosophies and achievements while presenting and exchanging ideas during the Asian Confernece, letting people to eventually know our profound dreams and carefully listen to our inner voices.
Preparation
In order to show our decent performances during the conference, we went early to the school to practice. We also invited our parents to listen to us presenting the project and then gave us some suggestions and encouragements.
The First Day
[17:00] Drizzles tickle down today, yet they cannot throw cold water on our passions. We arrives at NTCU to attend a special carnival.
[18:00~19:00] Dinner time~ At first, people don’t know well about each other. Probabaly through having dinner together, we can get to know other groups as well.
[20:00~ ] Meeting each other~ Every groups has to introduce their own schools on the stage. Some even give out talent shows. We HSNU-TAIPEI choose to sing a Chinese song called “100 suns and moons”with guitars, hoping everyone can feel our “sunlike”passions.
The Second Day
[8:00~9:00] Breakfast time~ During the breakfast time, we can look at others’ posters and also ask some questions regrading to their unique projects.
[9:00~9:10] Opening Ceremony
[9:10~9:40] Professors deliver speeches
[9:40~12:00] Introdung time~Every groups has to go upstage"

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
I Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
More information is transmitted when both parts of the split protein are inducible.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering:
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.

MIT,2013,Team:MIT#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," implement a new technology. We considered three potential application spaces for our system: Research, Model Development, and Clinical Application. The exosome mediated protein export system could one day be used in a clinical setting as a therapeutic. We believe, however, that the system must first be implemented in less regulated application spaces prior to engineering and testing a clinical application. After narrowing our focused and identifying the appropriate application space for our work, we searched for a specific market that would benefit from our technology.
Identifying a Market
Within a broader application space there are specific markets. We needed to find a market that had a need for our technology and would be accepting of synthetic biology and exosome-based technologies. Because the biology of exosomes is not well understood, it may be difficult to market our project. While looking for a future collaborator, we found that the group most receptive to the project was already familiar with exosomes. Other groups that we contacted were not able to see an immediate application of our technology and were less interested in hearing about our work. Although marketing our technology was initially challenging, we were able to find a specific group that could use our exosome mediated protein export system as an enabling technology for basic research and mouse model development.
To bring our research into practice we first needed to choose our application space. Then we determined which systems would benefit from our exosome mediated protein export system. We found that our research can serve as an enabling technology for basic research and the creation of improved humanized mouse models. Although there are potential clinical applications, we believe it is best to target our new technology to less regulated application spaces, so we market our technology in the near future.

To gain a better understanding of the role our research could play in the tissue engineering field, we contacted Sangeeta Bahtia’s lab at MIT. Dr. Bahtia hopes to create cell-based therapies for liver diseases and design humanized animal models for drug trials.
Hepatocyte Tissue Engineering Research: Role of Exosomes
Hepatoytes are extremely difficult to maintain in vitro. However hepatocytes that are co-cultured with mouse fibroblast cells can successfully survive in culture (Bhatia, 1998). Knockdown of an exosome secretion regulator in the mouse fibroblast cells, leaves the mouse cells incapable of supporting the hepatocytes.
Therefore, some factor in mouse cell exosomes helps support hepatocytes in vitro.

Coloring book
Scientific research is not always a dull work, it can also an interesting experience that everyone could share. In order to spread the fun and attractiveness of synthetic biology, we designed a coloring book. In this way, synthetic biology drew more attention by showing its fun part, following the idea of combining science and art. To our delight, the public were in favor of color painting and they praised our activity for being a good chance to broaden their horizons. Finally, we collected more than 200 painting works. Most surprisingly, kids loved our coloring book very much. With their creative imagination, they developed interests in synthetic biology and at the same time, gave us much courage and inspiration.
We were inspired by the recently popular coloring book Secret Garden, and we learnt from its design. In our coloring book, we simplified several important scientific items into simple stick figures, including DNA chains, viruses, bacteriophages, bacteria, so that people would understand some basic concepts of synthetic biology by painting them. Drawing itself is relaxing and thought-inspiring, and in the form of drawing, we presented our work and popularized iGEM. Hopefully, this coloring book will be a carrier of the spirit of scientific research and our wish to bring benefits to the world.
We have brought our coloring book to the Giant Jamboree, hoping that all of you could have fun with it and know more about us. We also want to discuss with the organizers of iGEM abut the perspective of publishing the coloring book, so that the spirit of iGEM could be spread out and keep encouraging more iGEMers to devote their talent and passion.

Forming the Glee
To be a good glee, first it needs a good song. The most intriguing song on earth is called OSCILLATION. If you look about, you will find it ubiquitous and extremely useful. After we taught each member this song, we need to help them sing it together, so oscillation became SYNCHRONIZED OSCILLATION. Thus how we form a glee!
Oscillation: The Magic Song of World
Once upon the time, there was a magic song called oscillation, it permeated every corner of the world. It regulated nearly everything on the earth. The interaction of moon and ocean generated the magnificent tide oscillation, and the biological process that displays a 24-hour oscillation inside human body.
Fig. 1-1 The Tides depend on several factors, including where the sun and moon are relative to the Earth
Fig. 1-2 The circadian clock inside human body
Besides, oscillation also plays an important part in signal transition. Take lasers for example, which are known for their intensity and can be focused to a tight spot over long distance. These characteristics all owe to their spatial coherent in the frequency of the light source.
Fig. 1-3 Helium-Neon laser demonstration at the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory at Paris VI: Pierre et Marie
Oscillation in Bacteria
Synthetic biologists have done a lot of work to teach bacteria to sing this oscillation song by building artificial genetic circuit inside them, since oscillations can lead to fantastic applications and benefit our everyday life. Besides regulation and signal transmission, oscillations in living organisms can also react to its growing environment, which probably will activate the trigger of oscillation inside cells and generate oscillation signals. From collected signals we can tell how an environment factor influences the cells behavior, and in turn the environment factor can be indicated by the signals. Furthermore, if we interpret these kinds of oscillation signals like 1010 in binary system, then we could even make an electronic environmental factor detector, using signals from environment as an input, and numbers on computer screen as output (Fig. 1-4).

IONIS_Paris,2015,Team:IONIS Paris#Project#Optogenetics_-_-_TEXT.html," concerned about BioSafety.        It is important for us to avoid any possibility of escaping from our microfluidic chip.       The Kill switch would allow to contain our genetically modified bacteria into the chip through lethality.
A photosensible system: the pDawn and pDusk plasmids
How do they work?
After reading many papers to select an appropriate light-sensing system to use for the kill switch, our team came across the pDawn and pDusk plasmids.        Those plasmids employ bluelight photoreceptors to confer light-repressed or light-induced gene expression in with up to 460-fold induction upon illumination.        Controlled by this system, we thought to add toxins in it to kill our bacteria whenever we want(Ohlendorf, Vidavski, Eldar, Moffat, & Möglich, 2012).
They are not dependent on nonnative chromophores that are often supplied exogenously and do not need any introduction of cofactor-synthesis genes.        Moreover, they are practical to use since current optogenetic tools require multiple plasmid components.
Finally, they deal with many limitations in a one-plasmid system which is based on the YF1/FixJ system.
The plasmids pDusk for light repressed and pDawn for light-activated gene expression.        In pDusk, the YF1/FixJ drives gene expression from the pFixK2 promoter in a blue-light repressed manner.        When we insert the λ phage repressor cI and the λ promoter pR in pDawn, this will invert the signal polarity and lead to the gene expression.
The histidine kinase YF1 employs a light oxygen voltage blue light photosensor domain.        In the absence of blue light, YF1 phosphorylate the regulator FixJ which induces gene expression from the FixK2 promoter.        The opposite happens with pDawn.       We obtained the plasmids from the Centre for Biological Signalling Studies and the University of Freiburg. As soon as we received them, we observed that the multiple cloning site as well as the λ promoter pR were located upstream the YF1/FixY system.
pDawn & pDusk - Toxin systems
So we aim to construct an efficient kill-switch triggered by light. In this way we will construct two different parts. The first one will be composed of pDawn system and toxin. Toxins will be produced after light stimulation and induce death. The second part will be composed of pDusk system and toxin"

Holding such an event in September could be much more crowded if it was announced from the beginning of the summer and allowed the rest of the teams to organize around it.

BGIC-Union,2017,Team:BGIC-Union#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," form a completed active T7 polymerase and start transcription in the presence of T7 promotor in cell free environment.
Figure 6. The schematic illustration of paired dCas9 system(2). With the presence of target DNA, each complex will bind with pre-designed sgRNA-binding site on the sequence. When the split T7 polymerase approach each other close enough, they will become active and start transcription by adding report gene with T7 promotor in cell free system. After transcription, the mRNA will be translated into report protein like GFP and RFP which generate signal output.
Our design has two major advantages over Peking University’s project. First, we made various types of output possible. Because the reassembled protein is an RNA polymerase, it can convert ctDNA into different types of signals, including GFP, RFP, luciferase or LacZ. Besides, with the presence of Target sequence, reunion T7 polymerase can transcribe DNA into mRNA which will be further translated into protein consistently. Therefore, the signal can be magnified over time even if the initial ctDNA concentration is undesirable. Target sequence and sgRNA binding site After we confirmed on our theoretical detection process, we started looking for a suitable gene locus. We decided at last that the fused gene EML4-ALK is our ideal sequence. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) is a fusion gene resulting from chromosome inversion and was identified in nonsmall cell lung cancer(NSCLC). (Wong DW) [4] The specific medicine, ALK inhibitor Crizotinib, has been reported to have curative effect on repression of the tumor and remission of relative symptom.[5]
Figure 7. Schematic representation of a fusion gene.
We decide to detect EML4-ALK because 1) it has effective specific drug. 2) fusion gene can effectively avoid off-target effect of Cas9 system. First, many types of ctDNA have already been detected but doctors only have drugs for few of them. Thus, detecting EML4-ALK whose specific drug, crizotinib, has been found, is more beneficial to patients than detecting other ctDNA. Patients can have precise treatment as soon as possible when the detection result is positive. Second, false-positive result can be evaded by detecting fusion gene. Sometimes dCas9 protein may recognize a very similar site as its target and it generates false positive result in this case. For example, the sgRNA may bind with complementary sequence with one or two incompatible"

The team leader and the other 6 members of  iGEM2013-HUST attended this meeting， sharing their designing ideas and their following plans。And after that, the team leader of iGEM2013-HZAU with his huge team composed of 10 members, also presented their experimental programs and the favorable conditions provided by their school, which indeed let us envy. Then Zhaoren HE, as the team leader of iGEM2013-WHU, gave a speech about our thoughts of experiments and our appreciation to them for coming the meeting. Finally everybody talked of own thoughts in a cheerful voice, the meeting ended happily.
Display during Scientific Fair
In order to raise the profile of the IGEM, especially to the public who are interested in science, we publicized the IGEM competition and our 2013-IGEM projects (including our final project and our alternative projects) to the whole students of Wuhan University and the citizens living around, in the Scientific Fair of Wuhan University. In this Scientific Fair, we designed display panels and posters to promote IGEM and introduce our project. And thus, made the public feel the fantastic charm of the synthetic biology. We mainly introduced the following topics to the public: (1). Introduced the synthetic biology, including the research propose, research contents, research methods and application of the synthetic biology to the public. (2). Introduced the IGEM, including the organizers, the ideas and significance of this competition. (3). Introduced our IGEM final project: precise gene expression regulation system based on CRISPR-Cas9 and tandem promoter. (4). Introduced our alternative project of raising the content of zinc ion in rice by Escherichia coli, and the project of controlling the protein yield in a properly high level in E.coli by N-starvation system. In addition, we explained how we determined our final project, including the feasibility analysis and value assessment. After this practice, we felt that there were numerous people becoming more interested in the amazing and fantastic synthetic biology. And we do hope that there will be more individuals giving attention to the synthetic biology and the IGEM so that they can develop stronger.
Communication
1.Communication with USTC team member
Our contacts with USTC(University of Science and Technology of China) started in June 3rd, when Sitao Zhang, the team leader of 2013 USTC iGEM team visited our lab. We shared ideas about synthetic biology and informations for iGEM. Later in July, They asked us whether we had any suggestion"
Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," from raw sequence data. GAIA, in turn, converts the DeeProtein analysis into a genetic fitness score and applies a threshold to select the surviving sequence variants
Reproduction is then simply achieved by starting a new computational cycle with the evolved sequence variants from the previous in silico evolution round.
Importantly, as part of our integrated human practices activities, we added a fourth step to our in silico evolution software, which does not have a counterpart in the in vivo directed evolution world:
We created SafetyNet , a DeeProtein based web application to infer “sleeping” hazardous any parental (and evolved) sequence. Thus, SafetyNet safeguard the directed evolution process and monitors and avoids the unintentional evolution of hazardous or dangerous protein sequences
To validate our in silico evolution software, we designed two complementary wet lab experiments , both of which were successfully performed.
We aimed at demonstrating (and eventually successfully showed), that DeeProtein can infer the impact of GAIA-induced mutations on protein function (i.e. the degree of activity). To this end, we designed ~30 beta-lactamase mutants using GAIA and correlated the DeeProtein-based “activity” scores with the in vivo measured minimum inhibitory antibiotics concentration (MIC).
We aimed at demonstrating (and eventually successfully showed) that we can evolve novel functions in silico, practically from scratch. To this end, we used GAIA transfer beta- galactosidase activity onto a beta-glucoronidase parental sequence by in silico evolution.
Improved, finalized Design – Learn, Evolve, PREDCEL!
While setting up the PACE apparatus and protocols, we ran into a serious of recurrent problems, most importantly phage washout (i.e. complete phage loss after few hours of continuous evolution) and phage contamination (due to the complex flow setup, contaminations are difficult to avoid). We also realized, that the PACE apparatus was very static, strongly limiting its applications scope. For evolution of proteins inducible by chemical for instance, one would ideally want to instantly alternate between evolution in presence of the chemical inducer and as well as corresponding selection strains. This is impossible in a continuous flow setup. Therefore, we sought out to create a more simple and more flexible PACE alternative, which can be quickly implemented by any trained biologist without the need for special equipment or knowledge. Inspired by a recent publication on phage-mediated selection of gene libraries
RN160
, we created a simple protocol named PREDCEL (for phage-related discontinuous evolution), which uses simple batch-wise, manual transfer of the evolving phage gene pool ("
UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Notebook#MeetingNotes_-_-_TEXT.html,": we have an mRNA that is never meant to be translated, it is merely a scaffold for tons of PUFs. It has various PUF sequences that are all linked to different enzymes that are part of the tyrosine  picetannol pathway. That way all of the enzymes end up close together, increasing the efficiency and speed of picetannol production. o Discussion with Bhalerao: He REALLY wants us to get an application for PUF. This would be a great concrete application to sell. Because the RNA enzyme cascade doesn’t just have to be with PHAT, it could also be with any other pathway. And then we can also control when the mRNA is expressed. o Concerns: We need at least 3 different PUF binding sites and PUF enzymes. And then we need to tether things to PUF. How possible is this? o Pan Silver has done this. Check up on it. (Slovenia 2010). o We need to do a simple proof of concept: Make 2 PUFs. One that inhibits GFP and one that inhibits YFP. And then after that make the cascade. o OR: we could do a simple 2 enzyme cascade. Ethanol is 2 enzymes. Is there one that’s a color change? We can even use Slovenia’s reporter. (Go find it).  Will fusion kill the binding activity of PUF? o How do we figure out the spacing? It’s already figured out by Slovenia. o We may want to add an artificial loop so it’s stiffer and the spacing is easier. o How difficult is it to tether onto PUF?  First get the Slovenia system, then address this. Figure out the enzymes and then go from there.  Slovenia published a paper with Matthew Delisa (Cornell) to produce resveratrol in E. coli via a DNA scaffold.  Also need to read the Pam Silver paper and Harvard paper. - Should PHAT project keep looking into modeling how to make picetannol more soluble? o It would be difficult because it comes down to water molecules, which aren’t great and are complicated because of the hydrogen bonding networks. o The calculations will be difficult. o Not worth the time investment. o Everyone should really be looking into the RNA scaffolding. Characterizing - Needed for silver medal - Will be replicating Washington’s winning design (biodiesel) with the help of Dr. Jin’s lab equipment. - Look at different temps, different sugar concentrations, etc. Moving forward - Still need to prove"

Liu Runze, is a junior in Physics, USTC. He has a lot of interests like reading, listening music and watching movies as well. Besides, he has a great interest in computer programming and team management. In USTC-Software team, he is the vice  captain and he is responsible for  Human Practice and Collaboration with USTC team. He is an out-goning guy and he's willing to make friends with others.
Steven is from Nanjing and his major is physics.He has great desire to explore a new field and iGEM enables him to meet different people. He likes playing handball and table tennis. With strong desire to do interdisciplinary study, he is willing to discuss with every iGEMer!
Zhi Li, or Nate, is currently a junior student from School for the Gifted Young (SCGY), USTC.  He has many hobbies，especially music and reading, and sports like soccer as well. In this summer,  he spent a lot time playing chess with others in the intervals of iGEM project. Besides, he is open-minded,  helpful and considered to be interesting when the team members work together. The persistence and optimism  are quite the shining points on him.
CHEN XINAN, or Nancy Chan, is manager of our team as well as a junior majoring Mathematics. She loves Sciences but unfortunately understanding them has always been a tough problem for her. She can undoubtedly be described as an interesting and humorous girl. You just never get bored with her around. Anyone can tell that she ‘hates’ our captain because, as she said, they are not in the same dimensionality. LOL! Nancy develops a lot of hobbies such as swimming, badminton, travelling, skiing, photographing, etc. But not table tennis! You will regret playing with her.

Mind the Gut: Effectors
Started the day with mini preps of GADX4, KATX4,FldHC-TPH1X4,Pyear-TPH1X4 using thermoscientific kit. Nanodrop showed better concentrations of nucleic acids for FldHC-TPH1X4,Pyear-TPH1X4 ranging from 78.4-180 ng/ul whereas KAT and GAD only had 20-30 ng/ul.
We ran the digestion of effectors namely KAT,GAD and FldHC-TPH1/Pyear-TPH1. Promoter Ptac in the backbone PSBIC3 plasmid was also digested.
The double digestion when ran on gel yielded inconsistent results and needed repetition.We also thought best to do single digestion with this repeat.
We had also been looking for alternative restriction sites in CHAT and found couple of them. We used PstI and BglI. The gel confirmed RBS-CHAT biobrick.

Human Practices
Over the past year, members of our team engaged in a variety of human practices endeavors. These ranged from educational activities involving the community, such as a parent-teacher night, where we introduced parents from our community to iGEM and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) initiatives; moreover, our team held a forum at City Hall to create awareness of the great upsides to iGEM. In addition, we conducted interviews with experts in the ink industry and environmental fields, such as Dave Warwick of Warwick Printing Co. and Greg Vilk from the University of Lethbridge Liaison Office. We have also explored the possibility of integrating synthetic biology and STEAM initiatives into our public school system, beginning with an interview with Sheanne Cox, a local elementary school teacher.
Overall, the criteria for silver and gold medal requirements in human practices was met (as can be seen by exploring the wiki pages).

Cells were then visualized with a fluorescent microscope for GFP expression and with Nile Blue staining for PHB production.  Results from these experiments are shown in Figure 5. NMR was also used to confirm PHB production of BBa_K1418061 (using methods outlined above). PHB peaks were observed in BBa_K1418061 similar to that seen in BBa_K1418050 , this demonstrates that by fusing GFP to PhaC PHB can still be produced by E. coli. Additionally, these results demonstrated that by using Biobrick part BBa_K1418061 , PHB granules can be produced with GFP activity. This finding suggests that by using a similar procedure, we should be able to functionalize PHB with chlorophyllase, cellulase, and amylase.

After the 24 hours the desiccated spores were resuspended in distilled water,  100 uL, before 50 uL was pipetted onto LB media petri dishes to allow for growth for 24  hours.  These plates were placed in a 37 °C incubator and allowed to grow for the  full 24 hours.  Lastly, these plates were removed and analysed for B. subtilis growth.
There was either an excess of colonies seen on the plates, or no growth at all, as seen  in only two plates, long term storage spores at both temperature treatments.  The excess growth seen was likely due to the highly concentrated resuspended mixture of distilled water and spores that was used for plating, or it could be due to the presence of xylose during sporulation.   The most growth was seen under long term storage where xylose was added when bacteria was added  during sporulation.  The remaining treatments had similar growth seen.  This may mean that  providing xylose to the bacteria before sporulation and storage may enable the bacteria to be  able to survive the storage treatment and regenerate better.

What is the problem?
Annually, over 400,000 US residents fall ill due to infections caused by foodborne antibiotic resistant bacteria. The antibiotic resistance in these bacteria typically originate from the misuse of antibiotics in agriculture. Unfortunately, in the animal sector antibiotics are still overused, accelerating the further development of antibiotic resistance ( Physicians Committee 2017 ).
How is it regulated now?
Currently, there are 3 strategies to combat antibiotic resistance: prevention, treatment and new therapeutics ( Netherlands Center for One Heath 2016 ). The problem with prevention strategies and new therapeutics is that they depend on very extensive clinical trials."
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFuture_-_-_TEXT.html," development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear picture of the interconnections between species.
User-friendly input with fun
Powered by MoDeL, iGaME has already relieved users from inputting massive amount of data. However, we are still looking forward to make the input process more fun. Besides providing a graphical scene, we are planning to have more elements like story telling and character selecting. Moreover, result grading and multi-user interacting are to be added to make our software a real game.
Database Development Kit
Though we have presented the detail document of RFC 55 for MoDeL, modelers may still found it a tough job to construct a usable database. The Database Development Kit aims at aiding modelers with easy-to-use development tools. To achieve this, graphical tools for creating, removing, modifying data in database are needed. Parameter estimation tools and MoDeL syntax checking tools are also wanted. We are planning to have this kit in our future version, which will greatly reduce the difficulties for users to construct their own databases.
We believe the future of iGaME is bright !

Plasmid transformation
Performed transformation on the Zif268 plasmid into the ECNR2 culture
Used 3 µL in a 50 µL dilution (49+1) of 1 ul of 55 ng/µL concentration of plasmids
1.82 V for 5.00 ms according to the electroporator
Team ZF
Checking on Pos Con 77, OZs, and Zif 268 plates
Unfortunately, nothing grew on our plates from yesterday. Our time constants from the electroporation were rather low (~3.8), so 50 ul may not be enough to see growth. We decided to spin down the cells, resuspend them in 50 ul of LB, and re-plated this solution. We also re-did the transformation using ChemComp cells, and made 100 ul plates. Both sets of plates were left overnight at 37*.
Designing the reporter strain
Instead of placing the GFP reporter on a separate plasmid, we decided to insert it on our expression plasmid, immediately after our zinc fingers, and before the transcription terminator. We placed a ribosome binding site (Shine Dalgarno sequence: AGGAGGTT before the GFP. We will only add the GFP to Zif 268 (whole) because if we can show through GFP that the selection system works for Zif 268, we can assume it also works for the other zinc fingers. This is easier and more cost effective than ordering 12 different primers for each of our plasmids.
We will construct the reporter strain by performing a PCR to get the plasmid in linear form. We will also perform a second PCR to get out GFP and add homology regions to our Zif 268 plasmid, as well as adding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The primers for these PCRs were ordered today. We'll then assemble these pieces to construct a whole plasmid, and transform our bacteria.
PCR with Practice Plate
We performed a PCR to amplify our F1s from the practice plate. We used our primers for CB bottom (primer index: 66 and 67) for the 18 targets and our primers for the controls (primer index: 72 and 73) for the "

In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for assessing chitin binding) was first titrated into 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD and no isotherm was calculated because binding sites were not saturated by the ligand. Cu was then titrated into the 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg complex and this resulted in a Cu affinity at Ka= 7.61 +/- 1.49x 106 M-1 that is largely comparable to 2x-HHTC-Re (no CBD) and lowerby an order of magnitude than 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD without bound NaDg. Data show 20 1 µL injections. 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD was selected as the candidate for testing because it displayed the most consistent and strong results during protein purification procedures, and seemed most promising for downstream applications (such as our filter). Work is in progress on optimizing the 3x and 6x fusion proteins and creating prototypes (thus far, protein production as been successful).

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#Basic Flip Flop_-_-_TEXT.html," I needed to quantify the changes in the fluorescence in both proteins. First, we set the conditions where the measures didn’t interfere with each other. For that, I used two E.coli carrying expression plasmids with GFP and RFP.  As easy as it may seem, I noticed that the RFP is also excited by the wavelenght we use for GFP, lowering the accuracy of this data. However, the plasmids we use for testing had very strong promoters compared to the ones used in the tested toggle switch, then the interference will be disminished when using the actual construction. Following the same protocol, I measured fluorescence and optical density in a microtiter reader each hour during a maximun of four hours. I divide the absolute fluorescence data between the optical density, then the values would not reflect the amount of bacteria in a particular moment.
Week 5
Our team is developing a system to integrate BioBricks in the bacterial genome, so I’m going to check this device using the basic toggle switch. I have to purify the fragment that contains the toggle switch, and introduce it in the appropriate vector, and then look for differences in the performance of the new construction. At first, I planned to have everything done by Friday but the restriction cuts didn’t work, so I will try it again next week.
Week 6
After our arrival from the European Jamboree, we set a meeting to organise the work in the following weeks. My duty is keep on testing the basic toggle switch, repeating the experiments I made before the Jamboree.
Week (3th-7th October)
This week I tried to do a double switch experiment, by makin two consecutives changes of state. The experiment takes two days, making dilutions to keep the bacteria in the exponential phase of growing. Sadly, due to some problems of organization, only one switch could be made.
Also we took samples for flow cytometry, a technique that allows the differenciation of the different populations of fluorescent bacteria that may appear in our culture. This way, we can asses wheter the induced population are expressing just one protein or not.
Week (17th-21th)
As the construct of the improved toggle switch is now completed, we decided to make both characterisation experiments at the same time, so now I’m part of the V’s subteam!. We used the same experimental methodology.
Week (24th-28th)
This week we made a 24-hours experiment with both toggle switches. A long long day, but it was worth it because of the data we obtained"

Fudan,2018,Team:Fudan-CHINA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," as their basic knowledge of modern biology, experience in laboratory, the understanding of iGEM and their current ideas. To our surprise, some had attended the John Hopkins Summer Camp and had the experience of PCR, Western Blot and etc. And some had learned pharmacodynamic evaluation, mice emergency immunization, flow cytometry, labeling fluorescent antibody and so on. And their ideas were also innovative concerning Chinese traditional herb, malaria, controlling blood pressure, and regulation of K+. As for the division of labor, they also have their considerations. Some prefer wet laboratory, and others would like to major in modeling or visual designing…… We not only shared basic knowledge of synthetic biology, lab skills and safety rules with them in our mini-class, but also achieved a lot from them- discussing ethic and law issues in regard to advanced technology. What impressed us most is their passion on practice with their own hands. The knowledge they’ve learnt in class inspired fantastic ideas, while we provide a stage to help them realize. Welcome, new iGEMers!
It’s a really successful try, and we did help our next generation not only know about iGEM and synthetic biology but assist them to become one of us, to make them enjoy the interest of it. Now, a promising iGEM team is coming into formation and we will also support them theoretically and practically. The world is changing.   Except this, we were also invited to Shanghai Shixi High School, a famous high school to deliver a lecture named Synthesis + Biology = Synthetic Biology to expand their view. University: iGEM club During our summer vacation, we attended a sharing meeting with BIOS (Biology Intensive Orientation Summer) students who were learning basic biological technique to discuss our project and absorb positive opinion to polish our STEP system. Despite their relatively poor experience in research, but their fancy thoughts did inspire us and make our project more charming.
In Fudan University, iGEM exists as a club. In this semester’s giant meeting of all clubs, iGEM has attracted much attention from students of all majors and some showed great interest in iGEM. Through our introduction, they had a deeper understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology and got deeply fascinated by the idea. It’s predictable that next year, there will be more students fond of synthetic biology taking part in iGEM to share the fun.

One of the greatest achievements of Synbio is to be broadly present in diverse backgrounds: from high tech institutes to local communities all around the world. We stand proudly as the first iGEM team to work with CRISPR in Latin America and the first research group to work with it in the Amazon. Therefore, we felt the urge to implement the first building block of Synbio (and CRISPR) in our community, through educational engagement.
On our community, we raised awareness for Synbio and the significance of building foundational advances to standardize CRISPR, through broadcasted interviews and social media, highlighting CRISPR as a revolutionary technique that has plenty of potentials to solve real-world problems. To the academic community, we kept promoting Synbio principles, by giving lectures and workshops introducing concepts such as biological parts and standardization. We also mobilized all spheres of society into discussing the importance of science and its role as powerful and transforming tool to improve human life and the world, by organizing the March for Science at our city, in partnership with Brazilian Society For Science’s Progress (SBPC in portuguese).
Our team and  everyone who engaged at the March For Science in Manaus, capital of Amazonas state.
In addition, we tried not to stick only to our regional community, but in showing the world what the Amazon has to offer in terms of Synbio and cutting-edge technologies. By lecturing at Campus Party - the biggest event of technology in the world - we’ve got the chance to reach a more distinct audience than that we were used to since Campus Party is more appealing to a public which has a technologic background but not necessarily a biotech one. For the first time, many of these people from different scenarios heard about CRISPR and its outstanding perspectives, and that all of this revolution in genome editing is not strictly happening in the biggest institutes of research in the world, but in the Brazilian Amazon as well."

As a future plan, or a perspective for our project, he said that the bacteriocins could be used as a local treatment. The ones we have researched, could probably be integrated in an ointment for the nose to treat MRSA carriers.
Statement from Frank Møller Aarestrup
We received a statement from Frank Møller Aarestrup, because we were interested in hearing an expert’s opinion about the use of bacteriocins as an alternative for treating wounds. Mr. Aarestrup is a professor at the Technical University of Denmark and is the head of a research group for genomic epidemiology. His laboratory is appointed as a reference laboratory for antimicrobial resistance by WHO and EU. He believes that there are great future prospects in the use of bacteriocins because it seems that resistance is rarely developed against them. However, Mr. Aarestrup points out that if we choose to inject the proteins into the body, we should be aware of the fact that they easily can be decomposed. This is not a problem since we keep the proteins on the surface of the body. Mr. Aarestrup agreed with our choice of testing S. Aureus strains and also suggested that we tested our bacteriocins in relation to Streptococcus. If we had any time left, we would have been interested in testing Mr. Aarestrup's suggestion.
Interviewing plastic companies
We sent out question forms and made phone calls to 14 different plastic companies, in order to evaluate the sustainability and future perspectives of our biodegradable plastic. Their opinions are very important to us, because they would be future customers of our plastic. The companies were very positive towards using plastic produced by bacteria. However, there were some concerns if the plastic was going to be used for foodpackaging. Likewise, the plastic should be approved by UL and FDA, before being used.
The use of bacteria for the production of plastic, would also open the doors for a product, which would be capable of competing in costs with the current forms of plastic. The companies were very interested in using biodegradable plastic, but not with today’s prices. Several companies have already investigated some biodegradable plastics, but due to its much higher cost they did not end up using it. If a cheaper alternative could be offered, then they would be very interested. This will make them able to offer more options to their customers and provide them with a more environmental friendly solution. We will therefore keep trying to optimize the production of our plastic from bacteria, so that one day we end up with a competitive product.

Background
On our online questionnaire, participants were asked if they were willing to be contacted with some further      questions about their iGEM experience and their careers. We were pleasantly surprised to see a high proportion or respondents agree to be contacted.
Shuna Gould and Justin Pahara were working in Cambridge and were willing  to drop by the lab for a recorded interview. Kim de Mora was in Edinburgh and recorded via skype.
The impact of iGEM – an interview with Justin Pahara
Justin Pahara was first involved in iGEM shortly after finishing his first degree in Immunology and Infection. He met Andrew Hessle, who he describes as an evangelist for Synthetic Biology. Through this meeting Justin was introduced to synthetic biology which not only changed his views, but lead him to cross the globe, pursue a PHD in biotechnology and found several start up companies including one orientated towards catalysing interdisciplinary work in synthetic biology.
In 2007, Justin was part of Andrew Hessle’s Alberta University team as iGEM was brought to Canada for the first time. The team focussed on engineering biobutanol production, as they believed it could be a biofuel superior to bioethanol, hence their slogan “save the ethanol for drinking”. In 2008 Justin was also an iGEM advisor on the 2008 team.
We asked Justin if iGEM changed the kind of people you expected to work with. With some conviction he told us the iGEM most definitely had; he is now a strong advocate of interdisciplinary work having seen the benefits that can come from bringing expertise from artists,"

During my time as a member of the UCSD Software  iGEM team, I learned many different coding languages including  html, JavaScript, Python,  and Java.  Throughout the entire development process I got a chance to work with the front-end and the back-end parts of the application development, with my primary focus being web development, as well as the user interface portion of the application. This was an enriching experience as I learned many different techniques as time went on, and now feel more comfortable as ever with the ability to design web applications in the future.  The project taught me many skills and bonded me with all my teammates, and as a result we were able to develop an application that we believe could possibly change data mining.

Lauren Crudup is a bioengineering student at the University of California, San Diego. Lauren works in Dr. Coleman's Neural Interactions Laboratory where the purpose of her current research is to contribute to this expanding body of work related to neurological signal processing by developing a reliable testing mechanism for measuring the physiological and neurological changes associated with empathetic behavioral patterns in rats. She is also currently leading an engineering project team through Engineers Without Borders focused on determining an effective and efficient way to automate a large-scale algal media testing system. Lauren hopes to continue to develop the programming skills she has learned through the iGEM program and her other research experiences in her future career.
Bioengineering, 2015
When I applied to become part of the UCSD iGEM team, I understood that it would be a substantial challenge given my lack of knowledge about synthetic biology. As the Spring quarter progressed and we were introduced to a plethora of programming concepts, what was being asked of us as members of the iGEM team became clear. Instead of shirking at the responsibility that lay before us, everyone started the project with the enthusiasm about the task we had been given.
As we moved into summer, I had the opportunity to work on code for the search algorithm, JSON file creation, and generation of the Pigeon images as well as work on the complexity analysis. Each project has enabled me to build a strong background in programming and synthetic biology, and I hope to continue to pursue both in the future.
We have had a great opportunity to build a complex, novel application that has the ability to change the landscape of synthetic biology by allowing community collaboration. We have enabled the"

Extreme genetic engineering: an introduction to synthetic biology by the ETC Group
There seems to be so many different areas of research that are considered synthetic biology.  Which areas apply to iGEM and which area(s) will the VCU team be involved in? - GMcArthurIV 16:44, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
The New Synthetic Energy Agenda section on page 27 reflected the type of work the VCU team will be doing.  The cellulose to biofuel and bio remediation to biofuel projects would fall well under this area of syn bio.  Obviously our projects will pertain to biofuel production but the section regarding synbiosafety cannot be ignored - Bussingkm 21:34, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
What you've mentioned certainly fits within the scope of the research currently going on in the Systems Biological Engineering Lab, but let's talk a bit more broadly.  This paper lists five major research areas in synthetic biology: minimal cells, assembly-line DNA, artifical cells, pathway engineering and novel genetics.  Which areas do you think we could or will be involved in? - GMcArthurIV 00:08, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
As you could guess from my comment below, I think the effects of the cellular ""environment"" on the functions of individual genetic parts is fascinating and of critical importance, in the same way that your boundaries must be defined for any engineered system.  To this end, I think the minimal genome work is very interesting.  In what situations is it better (or not) to pay attention to all the varied species nature provides us rather than engineering rational systems in the carefully designed, minimal environment provided by a minimal or artificial cell?  My work with thermocellum and the lab's work in general with T. fusca and others tends to rely on existing systems.  At what point do we scrap all that and build the pathways we want into a blank or"

Background
Splicing
Alternative splicing occurs naturally in most eukaryotes as a way to produce many different variations. Two notable examples are the avian cochlear cells and the human Fas receptor protein involved in regulating cell death.
In the inner ear of baby chicks, hair cells are lined along the length of the basilar papilla, a structure within the cochlea. These hair cells are tuned to respond most strongly to a certain frequency of sound, with the ones at the apical end responding to low frequency sounds and those at the basal end responding to high frequency sounds. One element in tuning these hair cells is the oscillation of the membrane potential during cell stimulation, which occurs at the same frequency as the frequency that the cell most strongly responds to. The mechanical stimulation of these cells results in an influx of calcium into the cell, which triggers the calcium-activated potassium channels to open. The influx of calcium followed by the outflux of potassium causes the oscillation in membrane potential. The timing of the calcium-activated potassium channels determine the rate at which the cell can repolarize and subsequently the frequency of oscillation. These calcium-activated channels are encoded by the chicken homolog of the Drosophila Slowpoke gene, which are alternatively spliced to produce many different variants. Each variant result in a different sensitivity of the protein to calcium, hence the variations in membrane potential oscillation frequencies (Black).
The same phenomenon occurs with the Fas gene in humans. The Fas gene encodes for either a membrane bound receptor or a soluble isoform that prevents programmed cell death. When a Fas ligand binds onto a Fas receptor on the cell, it mediates apoptosis or programmed cell death. One of the mechanisms that regulate whether the transmembrane or the insoluble form results is alternative splicing the Fas pre-mRNA. Fas mRNA transcripts with exon 6 spliced out result in the soluble form of the receptor and those including exon 6 result in the membrane bound receptor. Recent studies show that multiple splicing factors are involved in alternatively splicing this transcript (Izquierdo).
Alternative Splicing
One of the more interesting aspects of splicing is a process called alternative splicing.  In alternative splicing, a single RNA transcript can be spliced in alternative ways depending on the cellular environment, resulting in different mRNAs that can form"

Part name: Keratinase US Expression Cassette (BBa_K1717173)
Creator: Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Academy 2016
Short description: Coding sequence for Keratinase US (KerUS)
Long description: Keratinases are proteolytic enzymes that are capable of breaking the disulfide bonds in many different keratin substrates, such as hair and feathers. Kerus is a basic part comprised of a synthesized Kerus protein coding sequence, optimized for expression in E. coli and is most active in breaking down alpha-keratin, more commonly found in hair.
Design considerations: Keratinases are isolated from a number of bacteria and fungi species, most notably those in the Bacillus genera. The bacterial chassis we use is a strain of E. coli called K-12. Like all E. coli, this strain is gram-negative. Building off of the work of previous teams, such as Chicago, Sheffield, we deduced that the signal peptides that originated from gram-positive organisms could be causing the poor enzyme secretion in these teams projects. These teams either left these gram-positive signals in their sequence, or removed it entirely. However, our team decided to replace the native signal peptide sequence and replaced it with one specifically optimized for secretion in gram-negative E. coli (pelB, with the sequence taken from part Part BBa_J32015). This part would hopefully secrete our enzyme into the periplasm, where it could escape into the media extracellularly once the promoter was induced.  DNA sequences were compared using Clustal to ensure protein coding sequences were not altered, as well as to ensure that start and stop codons were correct. NEBCutter V2.0 was used to check for illegal cut sites.  The gene contained no illegal cut sites.

Because the pulic have a poor understanding on astaxanthin, so a lot of cosmetics production enterprises is unnecessary to use astaxanthin which has the fantastic effect, but add the collagen protein which has no effct actually.
So, before we promote our products, we must make the public know about their misunderstandings of cosmetic and make them really know the effect of astaxanthin by using scientific data, and, finally, make the public believe astaxanthin truly has antioxidant and health care function. As a result, cosmetics manufacturers are willing to buy astaxanthin as raw materials.
In our research, we also found that the public have very big concern about genetically modified products. Influenced by social rumors, especially in recent years, part of netizens who lack of professional knowledge hype gm products up with misunderstandings. So, the public irrational fear of genetically modified technology has been extended to the genetically modified products of national approval. Therefore, we must stress out that we have used Markfree to dispose the resistance genes, and make an effort the transparency of genetically modified technology, putting more efforts into popular science advertisement of genetically modified technology.
Competitor Analysis
Our main competitors are those previous producers of axtaxanthin. However, compared with them, the new technology we have will bring us oceans of financial support from society or government. At the same time, with the optimization of our technology, our production cost will reduce and we will finally obtain competitive superiority in the competition against those axtaxanthin producers which depend on natural materials.
Departments
Our enterprise will be regarded the technical personnel as basis and core, divided into four sections: marketing, internal management department, finance department as well as research and development department (R&D). Marketing department is responsible for the publicity, expanding market, including customer manager and sales consultant, etc. Internal management department is responsible for the instrument, the daily operation of the hr management, etc. The financial department, led by chief financial officer ,is responsible for providing the financial statements, tracking the assets of company's financial status, monitoring the crisis,atracting the external financing. R&D department serve as the core,led by the chief scientist directly, followed by project manager, research engineers at all levels and other laboratory technician, etc., directly linked with the company's overall strategy. Research and development department, market department and internal management department should set up the financial commissioner, docking with the finance department, timely reflect budgets, usage, and submit the related material for auditting.

Plasmids and controls
Control construction
The improved flip-flop was designed to make the control construction an easier task. By digesting the devices with the correct enzymes, we could remove or add any part anywhere within the improve flip-flop module I. The necessary control for the improved flip-flop requires two changes in the device structure: (a) removing the SspB gene from the module I to achieve a flip flop without protease activity, and (b) using an empty plasmid which provide the antibiotic resistance cassette and its possibly secondary effects instead of the plasmid with the improved flip-flop module II. The control (a) was constructed (figure 2), but analytic digestions to verify the new device are still in progress. In contrast, the control (b) was transformed with the basic flip flop in the X90 strain which was used for the experimental procedure.
Figure 2: SspB control can be obtained by digesting with Nhe I (R5) and Sal II (R6). The SspB gene would be released and the vector religated.
Vectors for improved flip-flop expression
The copy number of plasmids results to be an important factor for the function of regulatory circuits as flip-flops. Thus, we performed our fluorometry measurements with the improved flip-flop module II (asRNA) in high and low copy number plasmids. The asRNA module was cloned in a high copy number pSB1T3 vector and in a low copy pSB4A5 vector. The improved flip-flop module I was used in a medium copy number pUC commercial vector. When the improved flip-flop module II is expressed in a high copy number plasmid, the system loses its bistable behaviour,"

About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million. It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905). Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ically and structurally organized microorganisms which synthesize an extracellular polysaccharide matrix (EPS) enabling them to adhere to the surface of the teeth and assemble in matrix-embedded biofilms. Progressing biofilm accumulation puts the bacteria under increasing metabolic stress, which leads to localized metabolite and acid accumulation and a shift in the dynamic homeostasis towards acid-tolerating species such as Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans (3). A resultant decrease in pH causes tooth demineralization and constitutes a mechanism of dental caries.
In our project, we designed a biosynthetic device to serve as an alternative in preventative dental care for the elderly. We decided to target pH and an indicator of deteriorating oral health and use it as an system to regulate the relate of antimicrobial peptide known as mutacin III, is effective against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental caries, e.g. other strains of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces naeslundii, while Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to inhibition (5).
An existing BioBrick in the iGEM registry ( BBa_K239001 ), designed to detect misfolding of proteins in the periplasm or shear stress has been further characterised to demonstrate the BioBrick functions as a pH inverter.
Compared to the control, as pH increases from 3.97 to 6.78, GFP expression gradually increases for E. coliwith BBa_K239009 . The maximum GFP expression is observed at 6.78. GFP expression increases from 13,556.25 at pH 3.97 to 35,569 at pH 6.78. Beyond this maximum, there is a sharp decline in GFP expression as the starting LB broth increases in alkalinity, falling to 7,394 at pH 7,394. Conversely, for the control, a sharp increase is observed from pH 5393.5 at 3.97 to 38854.5 at pH 5.08. After this, the general trend is one of increasing fluorescence as pH increases, but the increase is more gradual.
From this experiment, we have established that BBa_K239009 (Spy Promoter) previously used to characterise protein misfolding can be used as a pH-sensitive promoter, as well. Thus, we have improved the function and characterization of an existing BioBrick Part.

To Rebuild or Not To Rebuild
15.06.2012
Guzz
Among the problems caused by environmental aggression to statues and buildings there is the acidic rain-driven marble solubilization:
Besides metals and bacteria-containing gypsum reprecipitation, which results in black crusts, another issue is the melting of the statue. Our early-stage project included the engineering of a light-controlled bacteria able to precipitate Ca2+ ions in the media to drive structural rebuilding of the heritage.
The proposed strategy was to couple photoreception and urease secretion, in a fashion similar to what team Newcastle 2010 did with its Bacillafilla.
In our most wild dreams, we imagined a technological apparatus, something like a 3D calcium carbonate laser printer. As a more feasible thing, we hypothesized a photoreceptor-coupled transcription factor (most likely a fusion protein) able to drive urease expression and secretion upon light stimulation. To give the system spatial control, we proposed a two-component logical gate, in which the system would have been triggered only by simultaneous stimulation with two wavelengths.
But then, we asked to ourselves: is it ethically correct to rebuild a statue? wouldn't it be some kind of falsification? And a whole new world of ethical debates opened to us. We found out that this is one of the main topics of discussion among restorers.
On one hand, to rebuild, for example, a melted statue would allow its perpetuation, so that not only our generation could appreciate it, but the generations to come too.
Not rebuilding would mean to eventually lose many of our works of art. Many of them are already missing some of their features, hairs, faces, lesser (finer) details.
On the other hand, while chemical composition and structural aspect would be the same, a rebuilt statue would lack, at least in part, the creative process of the author. His or her feelings, inspiration, ability. It would be the author's work no more, just a false.
For this, and other reasons, the project was set aside.

Each team of 6 to 7 students had to sit for 30 minutes and to pitch their ideas about a project they would present if they were participating in iGEM. They had a list of biobricks and they could invent their own. A different team member was helping each group of students. At the end, we had 12 mini-projects, each more imaginative than the next, which each team presented to the others. We played the role of judges and graded their ideas based on the originality, the utiliy, the feasability and the security of the project. The winners of the game had the opportunity to visit the clean rooms and the EPFL microfluidic lab (Maerkl Lab). Here you can download the results of the game.
Quiz results BEFORE
For the Swiss-German group, the mean score obtained for the quiz was 46 %. For the local group, it was 55 %. As the students from Bern were younger, it is not suprizing that they knew less than the second group.
As for the GMOs' question, most of the students thought that GMO only concern agriculture. We asked them the question : « What do GMOs make you think of? », and these are some of the answers we received:
« An extraordinary discovery for medicine but an agricultural poison for thousands of people and lands. »
« For me, GMOs are an invention that aims to get money without worrying about the planet. »
« These are plants that are more resistant to bacteria and diseases. For example, these plants can be bigger than normal ones. But it doesn't mean that it's always good for humans and animals. »
« It is when we change the DNA of something. This word reminds me of an experiment that has been done years ago that was at the origin of the sheep « Dolly » »
High school students doing the quiz at the end of the day

Quiz results AFTER
At the end of the day, we made them fill the same quiz as they had before coming. We compared the results before and after the day and the improvement was spectacular.
The mean score obtained for the test at the end of the day was 86 % (global improvement of 31%). We can then consider that we really had an impact on the students that came to visit us.

Sporobeads - What Protein Do You Want to Display?
Sporobeads are the first generation of Bacillus subtilis endospores displaying a protein of our choice on their outermost layer, the spore crust. In future Sporobeads could serve as a platform for protein display and thus be used for numerous versatile applications . Our goal was to show that B. subtilis spores have the ability to do so. As a proof of principle we successfully fused GFP to the spore crust and obtained fluorescence with microscopy.

In addition to that, Eduardo kept our entire group organized and focused on our end goal. Eduardo really had a hand in everything - he attended meetings on behalf of our team, he conducted research and assisted in literature review, filled out our lab log books with David (with extreme neatness), and somehow, he was always willing to do more. Eduardo never missed a day coming into lab, and even came in on the weekends.
Eduardo has truly been an indispensable asset to the team and an even better friend. We could always count on him to listen, advise and provide the emotional support in this chapter of our lives. Friends are the siblings that we were not originally given. It is an honor for us to be your ""siblings"" - to be your iGEM family. Thank you, Eduardo, oh Captain, our captain.
David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with spectrophotometer. As seen from data showed in 7 Fig., the result of DNA circularization is ~ 3 times faster substrate nucleotide hydrolysis. As the screening conditions were the same (identical enzyme and substrate concentrations), the difference in catalysis speed arises only due to difference in enzyme  expression. This means that there is 3 fold increase in enzyme amount when the RCT is employed. These results conclude, that highly processive T7 RNA polymerase produces more RNA and thus increases the protein yield if the DNA template used in transcription is circular and contains no terminating sequences.
Figure 7. The effect of rolling cycle transcription. The effect of DNA circularization on transcription and thus translation rate was measured by employing In vitro transcription and translation kit with two different DNA templates: circulated with no terminator sequences and linear. The hydrolysis rate of substrate nucleotide was tracked by measuring the decay of absorbance with at 310 nm.
5. Information recording (merging, amplification, reference nucleotides)
Before the catalytic activity of biomolecule could be recorded into DNA sequence as a ratio of incorporated product and reference nucleotides, suitable conditions for multiple displacement amplification (MDA) reaction and droplet merging had to be determined.
However, first we choose to create a mathematical phi29 DNA amplification model that imitates the amplification of the CAT-Seq Esterase DNA template with random hexamers (https://2018.igem.org/Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG/Model). The data generated by using the mathematical phi29 model informed us about a potential inhibitory effects of substrate nucleotides and the effect it might have on amplified DNA fragment size distribution. Based on the output of the model we set out to investigate the inhibitory effects caused by substrate nucleotides.
Figure 8. Amplified DNA correlation to substrate nucleotide concentration in the reaction. DNA, amplified using multiple displacement amplification was synthesised using 750µM dNTP concentration with varied substrate nucleotide concentration. Decreasing the concentration of substrate nucleotides the amount of DNA amplified increases as seen by the increased intensity of the DNA band and smear.
The first checkpoint in the journey for determining experimental conditions for CAT-seq workflow was to investigate the working concentrations of dNTP and substrate nucleotides and and their potential inhibitory effect. MDA reactions were performed with different dNTP and substrate-dCTP concentrations and the amplified DNA was analyzed on agarose gel. Results shown on Fig."
Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Methodology_-_-_TEXT.html," to understand some of the common safety precautions and lab managerial techniques biologists use while carrying out experiments.
We set out on developing applications for the MS Surface , and looked at various previous applications dealing with organizing scientific data and visualizing abstract scientific processes, such as modular cloning .  We also looked at different powerful Internet search engines and biology databases, and analyzed the benefits and detriments of each design before we creating SynBio Search . In preparation for our outreach program, we also looked at different educational games and interactive techniques that can be both MS Surface reliant but also kinesthetically interactive in nature.
Throughout the analysis phase we created user profiles and made preliminary plans as to an analytical task for the users to test our designs.
Design
In the design phase we sit down with the users and brainstorm concepts for the design of the software, then create low-fidelity prototypes of the software.   Collaborating with potential users then we start testing the usability of a higher-fidelity prototype for the design.
We took the first week of our summer research program to brainstorm design concepts at Wellesley, and invited several collaborators to the brainstorming sessions .  Students presented their findings for relevant works to the group, we brainstormed design concepts, and developed walkthroughs of design concepts through the creation of paper prototypes.  After creating design sketches for our projects, we created low-fidelity prototypes , the first iterations, of our programs.
During the design phase, we also conducted usability testing of MoClo Planner on our low-fidelity prototype with biology students at Wellesley College.  Their feedback allowed us to quickly iterate on the design of our program.  After testing SynFlo with students from Upward Bound, we were also able to iterate on our design.   As SynBio Search was created towards the end of the summer session, we are still in the design and preliminary test stage for this program.
Implementation
With feedback from our users then we start the implementation stage, where we conduct further usability tests with synthetic biologists, and evaluate the visual design, performance, and efficiency of our tools.
During this phase, we conducted ongoing heuristic evaluations by testing our software with BU and MIT’s iGEM teams.  We iterated on the visual design of our MoClo Planner program as well as improved performance by making the search option more efficient, among many other small program changes that improved subject satisfaction with our software.
We continued to interview experts in the areas of synthetic biology, and started considering questions about safety , collaboration, information sharing, and safety.
Evaluation
Finally, in the evaluation stage we deploy our refined software tools for use in the wet-lab"

Color Model
Description
The eye's ability to separate two distinct colors depends of the hue, saturation and brightness of the observed color.
In this model, we want to design a procedures that take the desired image as input and the image needed to be project on the bacteria as output.
Approach
RGB is a convenient color model for computer graphics because the human visual system works in a way that is similar — though not quite identical — to an RGB color space.
First, we find the image coordinates in RGB color space and extract three matrices for primary color red, green and blue. secondly, simply assume the RGB value is linearly related to fluorescent protein quantity. Gene expression output is closely related to light intensity input.Then, Hill function was used to describe this relationship. finally, three transfered matrices were compound to one picuture as output.
Assumptions
Emission peaks of fluorescent proteins are close to primary wavelengths which form the three axes for RGB color space respectively.
In the CcaS-CcaR system, red light competitively inhibits activation by green light. So growing under red light reduce the sensitivity of CcaS-CcaR to green light while preserving the full output range.
The Cph8-OmpR and YF1-Fixj system are both light–intensity sensors.
Steady-state response with respect to light intensity of these light sensors can be described by Hill function.         Fluorescent protein quantity is perceptually uniform thus can be obtained from the RGB coordinates through linear transformation.         H=b+(aI^n)/(I^n+k^n )
RGB components
Here we works with The CIE 1931 color space standard which consisted of monochromatic primaries red, green and blue.
The tristimulus value extracted from sample image can be associated with a RGB color space where axes range for 0 to 255.
We use Matlab to perform this color-protein-color transformation.
By importing the sample image into Matlab, we obtain its RGB matrix from which we extract each primaries separately so that we have three two-dimensional matrices for red, green and blue. Labeled as r,g,b.
Protein expression output
As mentioned in assumption, we assume that two colors that are"

After the completion of MerR-based mercury decontamination kit, we decided to take another example to verify the validness of our design for metal binding peptide. Based on the previous homology study of MerR family proteins, we took a lead-sensing protein, PbrR, as the second research target.
Lead contamination is a serious threat to human health and the environment. Lead poisoning is still one of the most common environmentally caused diseases in the world today.[1] As the concentration of such toxic ions is generally low, which present a huge challenge for environmental engineers to both detect and to absorb the pollutant with traditional chemical methods. A revolutionary strategy was taken into consideration, which took the advantage of metalloregulatory proteins with capability of sensing and absorbing the Pb(II) ions.

On Puritication gel, 4 biobricks were not correctly digested: CinI, LuxI, LuxR, RBS-LuxR. All the other were apparently well purified. Ligations were performed as usual.
Results on Petri Dishes were unsatifying: we obtained an agglomerate of colonies. And this in all Petri Dishes. Does the issue come from too old Petri Dishes? Or LB pre culture ? So, we tried a 2nd-spreding on Petri Dishes and the result was the same. We also checked by PCR if we could work anyway with those colonies. But the results were not conclusive.

UGA-Georgia,2016,Team:UGA-Georgia#Interlab_-_-_TEXT.html,"The transformed cells were first grown to a specific absorbance, the cells were centrifuged and the cell pellets were re- suspended in a suspension buffer. The cells were then placed on a shaker overnight for oxygen exposure which allows for the activation of fluorophore and is critical for the expression of the mCherry protein. Afterwards, the cells were then distributed into aliquots and 5% formaldehyde was added to each cell sample for cell fixation. Fixing the cells allowed us to ship the cells at room temperature and made shipping to other iGEM teams go a lot smoother.
Like last year, we used plate reader to measure the fluorescence of our cells. In addition, this year we also decided to use flow cytometry to separate our population of cells based on the fluorescence of our mCherry protein. This method of measurement is a better representation of the fluorescence since it is a more sensitive instrument than a plate reader. With this technology, we are able to measure multiple characteristics of single cells as they pass through a beam of light. The relative size, internal complexity and fluorescence intensity can be measured. To measure the fluorescence intensity, we analyzed a Log mCherry vs. Log SSC plot (side- scatter light) to determine positive expression of mCherry. We used our Wild Type sample for determining the regions for positive vs. negative mCherry regions. We found that using the median of the mCherry values among the positive region of the side- scatter plot would be best to represent the fluorescence intensity of the mCherry for each sample.
The Collaboration Study
After finalizing our proposal, contacting the biosafety office, creating a data input form, and creating a universal protocol for measuring mCherry protein fluorescence using plate reader and flow cytometry, we were ready to contact an assortment of iGEM research teams across the United States gauging general interest in our collaboration study. We contacted teams with our proposal and an invitation to join our study asking teams to measure the fluorescence of our formaldehyde fixed cell samples either using flow cytometry or plate reader, which does not require anaerobic chambers or any additional experimentation. We were able to built up a network of 6 participating teams: Columbia University, Georgia State University, University of Tennessee Knoxville, University of Pittsburgh, University of Nebraska and Genspace. We greatly appreciate our participating teams for their support and efforts toward our study.

BostonU,2017,Team:BostonU HW#LearnMARS_-_-_TEXT.html," is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and testing microfluidic devices was experienced first-hand by the BostonU HW Team. While replicating chips from journal articles, similarly to our synthetic biologist, we noted three repeated issues:
Lack of thorough documentation of experimental procedures
High level of design specificity and a lack accessibility of design files
Lack of standard evaluation system to grade devices against
As a result, the final chip manufactured cannot be run correctly due to lack of protocol documentation. Additionally, it is not possible to use a quantitative system of evaluation to ensure the device is working as intended. We have classified these limitations as barriers in the “implementation” stage of the microfluidics workflow.
Our Project
The CIDAR Lab at Boston University has tackled many of these design and manufacture shortcomings with an easy to use software workflow, including last year's iGEM Hardware project Neptune , and a low-cost rapid prototyping manufacturing system Makerfluidics . However, this system does not address the barriers we had identified under “Implementation” which limits the accessibility of microfluidics to everyday synthetic biology labs.
This year’s iGEM Team, decided to focus on removing these barriers in the implementation stage of the workflow which led to the creation of our project MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio).
MARS aims to increase the accessibility and relevance of microfluidics to synthetic biology through three defined goals:
Increase the ease of access of microfluidics to synbiologists
Design chips relevant for day to day use in synthetic biology
Create a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These goals have been built on and expanded to create the three branches of MARS which are:
Microfluidics 101

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of Tropical Medicine. We set out to learn the main global problems associated with the epidemiology and management of the disease.
We learned that as Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease with the ability to adapt to changing environments. This is particularly worrying as Leishmaniasis is now able to spread further from the equator due to global warming. Therefore it is imperative that effective and lasting vector control systems are introduced to reduce its diffusion into new regions. The control system currently in place in many countries is indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, the usage of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) spray is harmful to the environment as it has insecticidal properties. Many types of spray used are also very ineffective during the summertime when temperatures are high and there is strong radiation and accumulation of dust.

The second topic we focused on was current therapies available for treatment of Leishmaniasis, which have severe problems associated with them. Such a problem is seen widely in Honduras, where pentavalent antimonial such as, Glucantime is the choice of drug for treatment. It is intravenously injected, and the course lasts for 20 days. Due to the painful treatment a culture of poor compliance among the patients has been seen at a high rate.
Next, we went onto discuss the possible issues that might arise at the distribution of vaccine if the vaccine was made. In conflict zones such as the Middle-East, the vaccine might be difficult to administer. Voluntary organisations such as MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières) who work with different developing countries in order to treat Leishmaniasis might not go if the area is seriously war ridden. A recent example of this would be Syria where the risk associated with volunteering at the capital city, Aleppo is considerably high.
The government of developing countries cannot afford expensive treatment methods, hence, there is a strong need for cost-effective therapy. Dr Acosta emphasised that we have to put ourselves in the situations of the countries we will possibly be dealing with. This helped us to divert our focus to factors that matter to a developing country. As Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease and occurs in hot climate countries, the drug needs to be stable at high temperatures. For this, a cold chain is required i.e. during the process of transferring the vaccines from one place"
