As a participating team, we also got very interesting insights during this workshop. We learned for example that some main concerns might be robustness of the system in tropical areas, the ease of usage of the tool, and assuring the authenticity and fair distribution of the product. We incorporated this advice in our ethics analysis and application design .  All in all, this workshop was a success for all teams!
The day was concluded with a BBQ, where the teams could discuss their applications further but, more importantly, relax and socialize some more. Plans for collaborations were made and ideas for next meetups were exchanged. Thanks to all experts, supervisors and teams who participated in this first edition of the Benelux Meetup!

Week 8
As 12 strangers we met for the first time on the 22nd of February. We cooked and ate a lovely meal together, and hereby had our first team building experience.
Week 10
We went to the DTU-Denmark BioBrick tutorial event, where we had an unforgettable experience. Here, we met some of the other Scandinavian teams, with whom we had a wonderful time.
Week 11
A group contract was discussed and the first version was written.
As part of the promotion of the team and iGEM, a banner was created for the information screens at our university, the University of Southern Denmark.
Week 12
Excursion to a cabin on Langeland. At this idyllic spot, different ideas for our project were discussed and narrowed down to only a handful of ideas. It was a fun weekend and friendships among the team members began to sprout.
Week 14
Through an iterative process, the list of project ideas was cut down. Ultimately, the PowerLeaf - A Bacterial Solar Battery was chosen as our project.
Week 16
The team had a weekend of lab training with the supervisor Patrick, where we learned about all the basic applications for cloning. The work on the dormancy system had begun!
Week 17
We had a lab safety course with Lab Technician Simon Rose. Thereby, we became qualified for unsupervised laboratory work. Now we were properly equipped to start the work!
During the Danish Science Festival, we presented our iGEM team. Here, we talked to a lot of people about GMO, especially with children. We had prepared several activities for the children to participate in, one being a drawing competition. In this competition, the most innovative and creative idea of a bacteria won. From this activity, the team received a lot of fantastic drawings, with endless creative ideas, that the team took into consideration and used to further shape our project.
Week 18
The team had a course in innovation with Ann Zahle Andersen, from the patent office of the University of Southern Denmark. Here, we gained a better understanding of our project from a business point of view.
Bastian and Magnus, 6. grade students from a local public elementary school, interviewed us on the topic of GMO. After the interview, the boys received a guided tour around the iGEM lab. The boys used the obtained information about GMO to write an assignment at their school.
Week 19

Hi, I'm Zhen Wang, I mainly work on MoDeL and Database of iGAME. As a member of Lixin He's research group, I focus mainly on calculation of quantum information, quantum correlation and entanglement.
You might have noticed that my address is same as Liao's. Yes, we are from the same Research Group, and the same department, too. It will be boring if I repeat all the information again, so I am going to write some experience of myself participating iGEM2010.
As a student majoring physics, it is hard for me to believe that I can participate in a biology project. Luckily, to my great surprise, these two areas are not so far apart. Modeling and analyzing skills of physics can also be used in biology, and dry project always means a lot of coding task, I can handle that, too. Of course, there is plenty of biology I need to learn, but with the help of our instructor and wet team members, I learn it fast. So I want to tell everyone that there's no limit in iGEM, join in and unleash your power!

This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

In the cuvette holder the LEDs should be laid out as they were in the Aachen design; the fluorescence LED in the bottom, the optical density LED on one side and the light sensor opposite the optical density LED.
Once it’s all soldered, you’ll need to upload the code to the Digispark (you can actually do this before you solder, it doesn’t matter when). Follow the instructions on the Digistump wiki to get set up. We didn’t write them here too as it’s likely to go out of date quickly. In the unlikely event that the wiki does go down, we’ve made a save on the Wayback Machine here .
Do make sure you follow the steps exactly, don’t just skim them and assume it’ll be alright! Although Digisparks are generally pretty hardy, messing up could still fry them, making it harder to troubleshoot and wasting your time and money.
Once you’ve got your environment set up, simply copy our code into the Arduino window, click upload and plug in the Digispark when prompted. It’s just a one time set up, if you’re uploading to multiple chips at once it’s very quick - just repeat the upload step for each Digispark.
Now you should be able to use it on any device. Simply open the hardware interpreter page on your computer, laptop or phone and plug the Digispark in. It will take at least 5 seconds to start - up to 15 seconds on some devices.
Some devices might require adapters to connect to the Digispark, especially phones and tablets. If you’re not sure where to start, try searching for an 'OTG' (on the go) female USB adapter for the port"
Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," a ribosome binding region from clostridia which was intended to allow them to function in C. difficile. Of the two toxin promoters native to C. difficile only PCdi_tcdA showed any detectable activity and this was approximately seven times lower than the activity of PCsp_fdx. This could be due to the assay being performed in BHIS medium which contains compounds which suppress the promoter. A research paper suggests that these toxin promoters are subject to catabolite repression (Dupuy et al., 2011). The strongest promoter in C. difficile was clearly shown to be PCsp_fdx.
Figure 2. Relative expression of GusA from each of the six promoter constructs in C. difficile from a 16 hour mid-exponential culture. The negative control used was a C. difficile strain containing a modular vector pMTL84151 which contained no promoter. The results represent the mean of four technical replicates with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. Culture samples were harvested by centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μL of a suitable buffer, lysed by sonication, and 75 μL of the cell suspension was reacted with 28.4 μM of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide. Fluorescence intensity was monitored over a period of 30 min at 440-460 nm using an excitation wavelength of 355-375 nm, and the rate of change in intensity per minute was calculated as a measure of β-Glucuronidase activity, encoded by the protein GusA.

EF-1alpha Promoter ( BBa_K1119010 )
Introduction
The constitutive human Elongation Factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) Promoter regulates gene expression in mammalian cells. It is known that the CMV promoter is commonly used for constitutive expression, and here we introduce EF-1alpha promoter as an alternative mammalian promoter, which works in a wide range of cell types. The origin of this part is from Homo sapiens chromosome 6 genomic contig, GRCh37. p13.
In our characterization, the sequence of EF-1alpha Promoter was assembled in front of a GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 )and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 )using Freiburg’s RFC25 format. The EF-1alpha promoter-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under fluorescence microscope. The positive control was iDUET101a plasmid ( Addgene Plasmid Number 17629 ) that contains EGFP reporter driven by an EF-1alpha promoter. A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contain the EF-1alpha promoter. As a side by side comparison, a CMV promoter driven GFP reporter was also transfected, though a quantitative comparison between the two was not conducted in our characterization. Detailed protocols for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Result
Figure 1: GFP signal of EF-1alpha observed. HEK293FT cells were transfected with iDUET101a (positive control), pEF-1alpha-GFP, pCMV-GFP (alternative mammalian constitutive promoter), and GFP without promoter. Cells transfected with pEF-1alpha-GFP showed weaker green signal compared to those with iDUET101a and pCMV-GFP. This result agreed with the result reported by Qin et al., that the EF-1alpha promoter gives weaker activity than CMV promoter in HEK293T cells. Our negative control, GFP without promoter did not give any GFP signal. Scale bar = 0.1mm
At the time of regional jamboree, no GFP signal could be observed in cells transfected with GFP reporter driven by EF-1alpha promoter. Originally, we thought that the sequence of"

However, the genetic tools used for constructing mammalian cells vectors are based on outworn methods, and since 60-70% of all recombinant protein pharmaceuticals are produced in mammalian cells, there is a desperate need for simpler and more efficient cloning techniques (5).
The U-2 OS cell line
The U-2 OS cell line, originally known as the 2T line, is an immortalized human-derived cell line that was established in 1964. An immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely through either random mutation or modifications such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene. Several cell lines are well established as representatives of certain cell types. U-2 OS cells show epithelial adherent morphology, and no viruses have been detected in the cell line (17). In comparison, the HeLa cell line contains the well known HPV virus. U-2 OS cells are also very good-looking in the microscope, and therefore this cell line was chosen for the proof of concept of the Plug 'n’ Play assembly standard for mammalian cells.
Transient transfection
Transient expression is the ability to express heterologous DNA during a short period of time, which allows fast production of a desired protein. A high copy number of plasmids are introduced into the cells, and expression may be transitory over a period of time until the DNA is lost from the population. This allows for protein characterization or to verify the integrity, functionality, and the efficiency of different recombinant vectors. Production of a large amount of recombinant protein has been reported for transient expression systems at large scale. A small number of the transfected cells may incorporate the exogenous DNA into their genome by recombination leading to a stable transfection of a gene (6).
1. the transfectability and physiology of the cell line
2. the type of expression desired
3. the genetic marker of the expression vector
4. the size of the expression cassette and the quality of the DNA introduced
5. the compatibility of the transfection method and the cell line
6. the use of assay for detection of recombinant protein
7. the presence of serum and/or antibiotics in the culture medium
Typically mammalian expression vectors have a multiple cloning site (MCS). The gene of interest (GOI) to be inserted into the MCS is therefore required to hold restriction sites compatible with the expression vector. The insertion of the GOI"

Nordic iGEM Conference
iGEM meetups are a big aspect of the iGEM competition hosted all over the world. They are important as teams get to meet other iGEM competitors to exchange ideas and knowledge, discuss potential collaborations and of course having lots of fun. The number of iGEM meetups have increased dramatically between 2016 and 2018 from 20 to 38. We are proud to be a part of this growth by hosting the 4th annual Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC).
“The Nordic iGEM Conference was one of highlights of my year as European Ambassador. The event was both professional l and a lot of fun! Showcasing not only the high quality of the Nordic iGEM projects but also the strong culture of collaboration and support among the teams - it definitely captured the ambition and optimism of the giant jamboree and iGEM spirit. I look forward to Participating in next years NiC and to following up with this years iGEMer as they graduate into the after iGEM community”

Being a city of big historical value and a strong university culture, our fellow guests were taken on a city treasure hunt upon their arrival. The treasure hunt consisted of different photo-challenges scattered all over the city. This was a great opportunity for the participants to get to know each other and to finally get a break from working with iGEM.

XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#collaboration_-_-_TEXT.html," to prepare for the meeting with 2012 SYSU-iGEM team. Fortunately, she had a communication with the previous team leader Qiang Kou through making telephone calls, sending messages and Internet, and they decided July 16th, 2012 when Thumbelina arrived in Guangzhou City as the day she would have the first chance to be invited to the wet laboratory in SYSU.
   
As everyone knows that the history and experience in iGEM team of SYSU and XMU are familiar, so the purpose of communicating with each other is sharing the information and close our relationship. When July 16th, 2012 came, Thumbelina was guided by Qiang Kou to visit the wet lab of SYSU. At the same time Thumbelina got acquainted with Chang Ye, the current captain of SYSU iGEM 2012 team. After face-to-face contacts, Thumbelina knew much details of the project designed by SYSU such as the information of their task, constitution of their team, their process and so on. The majority of SYSU iGEM 2012 team members are junior and senior students which is similar with XMU. They communicated with each other through deeply topic such as disadvantages of their task and future plans. Finally Thumbelina took a photo together with the members of SYSU iGEM 2012 team as a memory and ended the meaningful day shared by each other.
Actually besides the day Thumbelina visited the laboratory, there were two dinners with Chang Ye which made Thumbelina gain a deeply knowledge of SYSU iGEM 2012 team as well. As we all know, it was not only a method to socialize but also a way to broaden our horizons and extend our outlook. What's the most significant, our friendship is strengthened.

Started planning Ice survival assays (need to do serial dilutions instead of changing the volume. After speaking to Fikrig lab, they told us this is better. If OD600 = 1, this is approximately 1e9 CFU/ml. If you do a dilution to 10^-5 and plate 100ul, you get 1000 colonies. 10^-6 you get 100 colonies, 10^-7 you get 10 colonies. You plate all these dilutions. No IPTG is needed on plates because after freezing you are done with the experiment. Media should be left overnight but better 2 days to cool at room temperature. Then store in fridge upside down. No fractures or moisture. Do to serial dilution use large volume,s 900ul diluant and 100ul of stuff. Can resuspend in media, or water, or PBS, or 0.9% NaCl solution, dpenending on how much want to stress. Repeat dilution series 2-3 times. Use new dilution series after frozen to replate dilution series).

Experiment: 3A assembly of NTC resistance gene
The plasmids containing a promoter and the Nat1 gene were PCR amplified using verification primers and run on a gel to ensure a correct ligation.
These results look promising and we will continue with these plasmids. We are using the first of the four plasmids from each promoter construct.
The digestions were ligated and will be ready for transformation tomorrow.

The PCR amplified gene fragments  for gibson from yesterday (18/9) were run on a gel. The resulting gel:
Given this result, samples 3, 4 & 5 (The three pTrpCs with the right prefix) were isolated for gel extraction (performed 21/9).
Experiment: Preparation of amilCP for mycolab
For the transformaiton mycolab needs a steady supply of amilCP. We will provide that by producing multiple O/N cultures and puryfing the plasmids. We are also interested in discovering if the transformation is easier with linear DNA or with plasmids, so we will provide both. Multiple O/N cultures of C3 and G3 (See week 35) have been made from a glycerol stock.

Gel  extraction (For  Fermentas Gel Extraction Kit)
Excise  gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade. Cut  as close to the DNA as possible to minimize the gel volume. Place the gel slice  into a pre-weighed 1.5 ml tube and weigh. Record the weight of the gel slice.
Note: If the purified fragment will be used for cloning reactions, avoid damaging the DNA through UV light exposure. Minimize UV exposure to a few seconds or keep the gel slice on a glass or plastic plate during UV illumination.
Add 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to the gel slice (volume: weight) (e.g., add 100 µl of Binding Buffer for every 100 mg of agarose gel)
p>Note. For gels with an agarose content greater than 2%, add 2:1 volumes of Binding Buffer to the gel slice.
Incubate the gel mixture at 50-60°C for 10 min or until the gel slice is completely dissolved. Mix the tube by inversion every few minutes to facilitate the melting process. Ensure that the gel is completely dissolved. Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA  binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow
Optional:  use this step only when DNA fragment is <500 bp or >10 kb long.
If the DNA fragment is <500 bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol to the solubilized gel solution (e.g. 100 µl of isopropanol should be added to 100 mg gel slice solubilized in 100 µl of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly
- If the  DNA fragment is >10 kb, add a 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution  (e.g. 100 µl of water should be added to 100 mg gel slice solubilized in 100 µl  of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly.

A. If you use GMMs in an open system (e.g. agriculture use, bioremediation use)
In the use of open system, first, you have to apply for the approval of use regulations with the evaluation sheet of biodiversity influence to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment. Once you got approval, you can start using GMMs. At the same time, you have to report the results of the information collected after using GMMs. And you will also get site inspections by Ministries written above as well as independent administrative institutions (FAMIC, NARO, NLBC, FRA). As a result, you will get administrative orders and you have to follow these order by re-submitting information or change/annulment of the use regulations.
B. If you use GMMs in closed system (e.g. using GMMs for production of enzymes/catalysts, using GMMs for production of reagents/ industrial materials)
If you use GMMs inside faculties and prevent GMMs to diffuse, first you have to check if the GMM you're using is on the GILSP list. If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then, you have to report using situations and you will get inspections and orders. If the GMM is not on the GILSP list, you have to fill in a diffusion prevention measures sheet and send it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Once those measures are approved, you will follow the same steps above.
For the usage of the GMOs, an individual has to submit the examination application form for Biosafety, with 4000 dollars of examination fee, to the Ministry that is in charge of the usage. Which means, if you are willing to use the GMOs related to agriculture, it is the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs that you have to submit the application to. The examination of the GMO is done in two different aspects. One is the human body risks and the other is the environmental risks.

SCUT
South China University of Technology (SCUT) is one of China's key universities operating under the direct leadership of the State Ministry of Education. The university, which has a total area of 294 hectares, is situated in Guangzhou, a southern metropolitan in China. The university has two campuses: The Wushan Campus and Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Campus.
South China University of Technology (SCUT), formerly known as the South China Institute of Technology, was established in 1952. In 1960, SCUT was awarded ranked among the key universities of China. In 1981, it was authorized by the State Council to confer doctor degrees and master degrees, and was among the first universities in the country to do so. In 1995, it was selected as one of the universities into which China will make significant investment in the 21st century. In 1999, it wasrated ""excellent"" during the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment, and was among the first ""Excellent Universities of Undergraduate Education"" in the country. In the same year, a national science park was established with the authorization of State Ministry of Technology and State Ministry of Education. In 2000, Graduate School was authorized to be established. In 2001, the new cooperative construction of State Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province was implemented in SCUTand it was listed among the top universities in the country. After 60 years of development, SCUT has become a multidisciplinary university focusing on engineering, combined with science, also promoting well coordinated development of management, economics,humanities and law.

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," solution?
Not yet. PHB secretion may make the process more user-friendly, but the costs of sterilization and maintaining a pure culture will be too high. Thus, a small-scale PHB production and wastewater treatment plant will not be able to profit from the current process.
LANDFILL LEACHATE TREATMENT
Demand
According to PolyFerm, bioplastics are not in very high demand due to high cost of production. If they were produced at a cost and efficiency similar to petroleum-based plastics, demand would increase. Treatment of landfill leachate is also a very niche field; we have only identified one project dealing with this issue (the Calgary Leachate Pilot Project). The integration of PHB production in leachate treatment would likely be unfeasible due to low volumes of leachate that are usually produced at landfills (see ""Cost"" section for a detailed breakdown of the calculations which led us to make this statement). Since the environmental problem and the manufacturing problem are both not urgent in this application, the overall demand for our E. coli in leachate treatment is very low.
Cost
In Calgary, a single landfill generates about 100,000 L of leachate per day. Although COD content in leachate is higher than in wastewater, the estimated amount of PHB produced in Calgary was about 8000 kg/year, based on COD content of 1977 mg/L in Calgary leachate (Kashef & Lungue, 2016). In addition, a new system will need to be implemented to collect VFAs in fermenters and process them in bioreactors. The estimated cost of such a system is $140-215 million. If done on-site at the Calgary Pilot Leachate Treatment Plant, there would be reduced transportation costs, as leachate would not need to be transferred from landfills to treatment plants. Our system must compete economically with deep-well injections. Potential revenues for estimated amounts of PHB that can be produced per year in various locations are as follows:
Calgary: $40,000
Hong Kong: $4.5-15 million
Vancouver: $16 million
Based on our calculations, it would be more feasible to implement our system in cities like Hong Kong and Vancouver.
Impact
By using landfill leachate, we could reduce leachate holding times, which could reduce the chance of leachate leaking into groundwater and prevent toxins (e.g. ammonia) from forming. Less toxins reduces overall leachate treatment costs while mitigating negative impacts it may have on nearby groundwater and the surrounding environment"

How do You evaluate the complexity of the iGEM competition (financial support, organisation, and public relations)?
Again very positive. Students have the chance to integrate their different interests and talents into the competition and into the project. Moreover it is great that students can work several months together on the same topic and work with students who are interested in very different subjects. Additionally, this is a good practice for their professional life.
Attracting funds and raising public awareness for the project is central to iGEM. Without the initiative of the students the presence of iGEM in Aachen and the special iGEM spirit would not be the same. The RWTH Aachen University and the FZJ support the iGEM team every year. The supporters of the iGEM team think that the “Bottom up” strategy, i.e., students first, fits best to Aachen. Because the students have the chance to develop their OWN project, obviously with support from the experts and institutes.
What do You think about this year’s iGEM team Aachen and its project ideas?
Super, you can talk about the topic with many different people, who are unfamiliar with synthetic biology and biotechnology. Everybody uses liquid washing detergents because of the absence of dusts and allergenic substances. Moreover, it is possible to explain the environmental problem caused by boric acid to the public and still present a very interesting topic in the field of synthetic biology. Photocaging is still a very new and innovative strategy to work with. So it is possible to break down the topic of synthetic biology into a problematic aspect of our daily life. Do the test: can you explain the project to your family in a few sentences? I think you can do this.
Please name tree terms that describe the iGEM teams in Aachen and their work?

Could You please tell us something about the previous work of the iGEM teams in Aachen?
The success of the iGEM team 2014 was very unexpected and a great experience for all involved. This success motivated many and raised the attention for the iGEM team Aachen. The iGEM team 2015 repeated the success in a very similar way, showing how ambitious the members of the iGEM team Aachen are.
How do You feel to be a part of the iGEM team Aachen 2016?
Great! When the chance evolved to start an iGEM team in Aachen I was directly very positive. The interests of students and the idea of teaching are"

Harvard iGEM and Human Practices
Where does our project stand in this complex and contentious history?
The objective of our project was to provide an open-source, ""reduced-to-practice"" method for zinc finger production through the novel application and integration of technologies. This method allows for the rapid creation of custom zinc fingers in a high-volume fashion for targeting novel binding sequences. This, in turn, has enabled us to fill gaps of undiscovered zinc finger binders in the OPEN and CoDA [4] database and other open-source zinc finger databases. Most importantly, our open-source BioBrick materials , detailed protocols , and software tools greatly increase the accessibility of zinc finger technology and help to overcome the prohibitively high price tags of the present market.
We aim to increase the accessibility of our method, which can in turn be applied by others to the generation of novel biological interactions beyond zinc fingers. We wish to share our data and results with the community, highlighting our successes and failures to collectively advance our knowledge of designing novel biological interactions. In addition, we seek to openly address pertinent ethical and legal concerns surrounding the impact of intellectual property in synthetic biology, and to open a dialogue to raise awareness about these issues.
No ""Finger"" Pointing
A Case Study in Intellectual Property and Open Source Alternatives
The Harvard iGEM team aims to open discussion and raise awareness of the future impacts of intellectual property rights on synthetic biology research. We seek to provide an objective view of the existing relationships between intellectual property and open-source content. Our concern is particularly for the necessity of balance in intellectual property rights and the promotion of open-source technology for optimal benefit to all.
iGEM & IP
The questions raised by this case study are of particular importance for synthetic biology, which has historically placed great emphasis on an open-source nature. iGEM in particular has placed great value on this history. The Registry of Standard Biological parts and the concept of BioBricks are fundamental examples: characterized, standardized parts are available to on the registry website to anyone with Internet access. In fact, IP questions are relevant for many of the technologies developed and used in the competition.
Playing Monopoly
Zinc finger intellectual property is held predominantly by a single commercial research institution, unlike many other areas of research where intellectual property is distributed across a wide variety of interested parties. This institution, Sangamo Biosciences Inc. , is a clinical stage bioph"

How to Categorize regulatory RNAs
The HKUST iGEM 2014 team has three main components for human practice: start-up kit, outreach, as well as safety and ethics. Our goal is to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to wide range of audience in the society. We targeted groups of audience consisting of college freshmen, secondary school students and members within the iGEM society. Each group of audience has potential to contribute to the field of synthetic biology in different ways, and we believe that putting equal amount of effort and paying attention to them all should be the best approach to ensure healthy growth and development of the field of synthetic biology.

Origin of Our Project
✔ In today’s modern world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a major global issue that needs to be addressed. These oxides also increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which are responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects. Sulfur Oxides (SOx) are the main precursors of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem as well. Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing loss of millions of dollars every year.
✔ Both these gases also have detrimental effects on the environment and  our team plans to combat this catastrophic effect by reducing the amount of the NOx and SOx gases ejected through the exhaust vents. For this we have engineered nrfA gene (codes for nitrite reductase) in E.Coli to convert NOx to NH3 (Clarke et al;2008) and for SOx reduction we will incorporate cysI(sulfite reductase) that converts SO2 to H2S (Growth Yields and Growth Rates of. Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Marburg) growing on Hydrogen plus Sulfate and Hydrogen plus Thiosulfate as the Sole Energy Sources, Arch. Microbiol. 117, 209-214 [1978]) and sqr (sulfide quinone reductase) to convert H2S to S. In order to realize the whole sulfur metabolism pathway, we use several bioinformatics web sites such as KEGG and NCBI. We anticipate that the use of genetically engineered bacterium would subside the efficiency of existing chemical methods.
Milestones of the project
✔ We engineered E.Coli for Nitric Oxide (NOx) and Sulfur Oxides (SOx, SO2 ) reduction.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Introduction
To obtain regulated promoters we synthesized four libraries of operator sequences, respectively for LacI, TetR, cI and LexA repressor proteins. Here is explained how we designed the operator libraries and isolated single operators to clone them in the standard format. Moreover, we built and tested: a LacI regulated promoter to tune promoter activation and a lexA based promoter to study the SOS activation (UV and peroxidase).
Up
At last... Operator sites as BioBricks!
Even though transcriptional regulation still plays a pivotal role in synthetic biology, a modular assembly of regulated promoters and the characterization of their properties has not been formalized, yet. At present state, each promoter in the Registry, though complex, is treated as a “standalone” monolithic element. Thus, the choice of a regulated promoter implies a prefixed sigmoid regulation curve. The only option, using the current BioBricks, is to choose a discretional scaling factor in the transfer of the transcription function to the protein through an appropriate RBS. Critically, the choice of one specific transcription factor limits the choice to just one possible promoter. The assembly of regulated promoters as the combination of modular parts, i. e. unregulated promoters and operators, could permit the rapid design of regulatory elements with fixed  characteristics. In fact, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity could be independently chosen.
A first step in the rationalization of promoter design was done in the iGEM 2007 with the introduction in the Registry of a family of constitutive promoters. Each family element differs from the others just for few base pairs in -35 and -10 regions, keeping constant the rest of the sequence and giving rise to a different level of transcription strength. We decided to use this valuable work as a platform for a deeper and more general promoter design strategy. To obtain regulated promoters we decided to combine these parts with short regulatory sequences that operate as a binding site for the transcription factor"
NUS_Singapore-A,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-A#shadow#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," (reddish-brown) were our original candidates as many enzymes are shared across their biosynthetic pathways. A range of colours could then theoretically be produced from a mixture of these compounds, whose relative concentrations could be varied by controlling the expression of key enzymes (Figure 6). However, the promiscuity of the enzymes and inherent leakiness of the pathway necessitate extremely tight control of gene expression which was technically challenging to accomplish.
The major turning point occurred when we interviewed designers and synthetic dye companies and learned that such colours were not commercially viable. Primary colours are preferred, as they could be mixed to produce the desired hue. Following this, we opted to focus our efforts on the synthesis of luteolin, a yellow flavone located downstream of naringenin too (Figure 6).
Notwithstanding the warmth and optimism that it evokes, the colour yellow has a murky history. The vivid Indian Yellow dye was derived from the urine of cows which had been fed only mango leaves and were thus kept in a perpetual state of near-starvation, yellow to be dubbed the “cruellest” colour [10]. Presently, the synthetic yellow compound PCB-11, which possesses a plethora of toxic effects, is found ubiquitously in textiles and other consumer products [11]. Luteolin, which is perhaps the oldest European dye, enjoys a much better reputation. It is deemed to possess the best light fastness amongst natural yellow dyes, and is still used to dye silk, wool, cotton, and leather [12]. A bright future for yellow seemed to be in the cards with luteolin.
Once we confirmed that we would be producing luteolin, we expressed the two enzymes required to produce it from naringenin in E. coli: flavone synthase (FNS) from Petroselinum crispum and flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase (F3’H) from Gerbera hybrida (Figure 6) [13] [14]. E. coli BL21* was selected to be our chassis as it is an RNase knockout strain, which enhances protein expression and dye production [15]. It was also shown to be a suitable host for flavonoid synthesis [16]. The expression of the enzymes FNS and F3’H are optogenetically controlled (see: Blue Light Repressible System ).
Through multiple rounds of biosynthesis, we were able to successfully demonstrate the production of luteolin via HPLC. The levels of mRNA and protein expression were also investigated using qPCR and SDS-PAGE respectively.

NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," symptoms at early stage. Therefore, rate of patients who are able to be performed surgery also take a minor part. To make matters worse, cancer generally has a risk of recurrence and metastasis.
The most commonly used two means, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were developed only after World War II.
Chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. To some extent, chemotherapy is of certain specificity, but it still terribly influences normal cells;
Now there are some drugs for chemotherapy with less side effects.
● In 2004 after the listing of the molecular targeted drugs iressa (also known as  Gefitnib), situation has been greatly changed.
Targeting drugs have a lot of advantages:
Firstly, targeted drugs can be taken orally, removing troublesomeness of hospitalization, providing more convenience;
Secondly, the side effects are relatively small;
Thirdly, it concerned with genes associated with the disease, offering efficacy for specific populations.
● Most of our chemotherapy drugs perform by intravenous infusion, so patients need to be hospitalized. Yet lots of molecular targeted drugs are kinase inhibitors of small molecules, which can be made into oral dosage, providing patients with great convenience. Also, compared to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs with more specifically design, cause far less side effects. Life quality during treatment can be greatly improved from the patient's perspective.
● An important significance of molecular targeted drugs is that, in the past, most drugs are searched and then acquired by human from the nature, but the molecular targeted drugs is a re-creation of human with certain purposes, thus a great revolutionary breakthrough.
● The emergence of targeted drugs allow the basic research apply into clinical cases, leading a revolution in the field of oncology.
● Now, for those who can take targeted drugs, that is patients with sensitive mutations, we can practice molecular targeted drugs combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the same time, enabling patients to survive up to three years --- such a survival period is pretty remarkable. (In fact, clinically 2 to 3 months of survival extension could be viewed as miracle.) The emergence of molecular targeted drugs, combined with a reasonable quantity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has promoted a huge progress compared to a dozen years ago.
● One or two decades ago, doctors would have thought it irrelevant to his treatment if they heard about a mutation in a patient's genetic site. With the emergence of targeted drugs, the clinical treatment of tumors upswing to a molecular level.

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html,"ogalactopyranoside). We prepared three overnight cultures of our BL21<DE3> with the pT7-GFP reporter strain, then diluted the overnight culture into 30 ml of fresh L-Broth with chloramphenicol antibiotic, and grew the cultures at 37°C (shaking 225 rpm) until their OD600 = 0.5. At this point a 1 ml sample of each culture was removed, then IPTG was added to each flask for a 1 mM final induction concentration. The flasks were returned to 37°C shaker overnight for 20 hours, with 1 ml samples taken at 3 hours post-induction, and 20 hours post-induction. These cell samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis as discussed in the methods section Figure 6.
Figure 6:  SDS-PAGE analysis shows expression of GFP (E0040) induced from a pT7 promoter. SDS-PAGE sample preparation and gel conditions explained in methods section. Three biological replicates of the pT7-GFP expression construct in BL21<DE3> E. coli, with samples taken pre-induction, 3 hours post-induction with 1 mM IPTG, and 20 hours post-induction.
It was possible to verify that the expression construct functioned due to the colour of the E. coli cell culture, which became progressively more green over the incubation. However, the SDS-PAGE shows definitively that there has been strong expression of a protein with a molecular weight of roughly 25 kDa, which correlates to the predicted ~27 kDa of the E0040 GFP. In addition, the gel shows that maximum expression of the reporter was reached within 3 hours, with a negligible visible increase beyond that at the 20-hour time-point.   To finalise our pT7-GFP expression construct, we moved the BioBrick construct from pSB1C3 into another vector – pSB3K3, a kanamycin resistance plasmid with a different origin of replication. This vector move was necessary to allow for both the split T7 RNAP AND-gate and pT7-GFP reporter constructs to be maintained on separate plasmids within a single E. coli cell.
AND-gate testing
Split GFP
For testing the final split-GFP AND-gate construct K2442408 was moved from E. coli DH5α to the strain DH5α-Z1. As described in the Methods section strains table, DH5α-Z1"

What is Synthetic Biology?
Synthetic biology is an exciting new field that applies engineering principles to biological systems in order to create novel organisms that are beneficial to human beings.  Synthetic biology had its inception in 1978, when the discovery of restriction enzymes gave scientists the basic tools necessary to cut DNA into discrete segments, the first step in harnessing their engineering potential. Since then, this toolkit has expanded rapidly, to the point where now even a team of undergraduate students can create a synthetic organism in as little as a couple months of the summer!
Synthetic biology allows the construction of genetic circuits that have the potential to change the world. Despite its infancy, this synthetic biology field has already found many practical applications for its products. Insulin for diabetics is currently produced in massive quantities by synthetic bacteria. Before this, insulin had to be harvested from pig or cow pancreases in a process which is both cruel and inefficient. Synthetic biology has also been instrumental in fighting famine across the globe by producing genetically robust crop lines that are much more durable than their natural counterparts. As we move into the future it will be fascinating to see what change this genetic revolution inspires.
About iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition was started in 2004 at MIT as a way to get students actively involved in the fledgling field of synthetic biology.  More than a hundred teams from around the globe enter each year, making it one of the world’s largest undergraduate conferences.  The objective is to create a biological ‘machine’ that can perform a real-world task through genetic engineering.  Projects are judged based on the new genetic parts they contribute, characterization of these parts, collaboration with other teams, and development"

For the PCquad mutant 10, 20uL of solution was loaded since the gel was thinner.  10uL of ladder was used for both.  Electrophoresis ran at 100V for 20 minutes.
Results: The PCquad prime 3.0 seems to have amplified fine.  66C showed the brightest band for the product size ~1.5kb.  The PCquad mutant 10 shows one clean band, however, it is at a size ~400bp greater than expected.

The bands from PCquad prime 3.0 were cut out and put in a tube in the -20C.
Conclusions:  It appears as if the new primers and construct work quite cleanly.  The next step would be to either rerun the reaction in larger scale (after consultation) or to gel purify the excised band.  The PSB1C3 vector will need to be obtained, and then digestion and transformation can be done."

We also wanted to grow three of the consortia together to see what sort of final OD they reach, and have been monitoring it sporadically for the past 24 hours.

Having harvested the supernatant of the various cultures at various ODs, we filter sterilized it with a 0.2 uM filter to remove any cells that may have still remained. Now that we have the sterilized supernatant, we are going to follow the protocol in Kerner et al 2012, and add 1/5 5X M9 media, and grow different auxotrophic cultures, noting the OD and growth rate. From this, we will try to calculate, or at least approximate, the amino acid export rate of the cells.
There were colonies on the MinC Intein plate, the ArgE BB plate, and the GFP construct LB plate, but nothing on the GFP construct M9 plate. This may have been because there was no lactose or IPTG to induce the metA gene. Interestingly, there was a green fluorescent patch, but it was rather weak and had no distinct colonies. We plan to pick several colonies from the LB plate and try growing them in M9 culture with and without IPTG overnight. We also plan to do a cPCR on the MinC plate using the intein primers. There were no colonies on the DszA or yddg plate. We have had no luck with electroporating cells with ligation mixtures, although we have had some success with heat shock competent cells. We think there may be something in the ligation mixture that is interfering with the electroporation, and could probably be fixed by purifying the ligation mix.
The data that we collected regarding the growth curves of the auxotrophs and the mixture are very different from what the plate reader previously showed. We think this may be because of a lack of correction for path length by the plate reader, but aren't entirely sure.
We also did a PCR on the TyrA BB product, the previous failed YFP plasmid, and several other previously failed PCRs.

After two days of shaking at 37° in 1 mM IPTG, the supposed IPTG inducible metA constructs in the metA auxotrophs were unable to grow.
The gels of the PCR products that we have been getting lately have not been working properly. We think that there is a"

Determining concentration of nitrogen compounds
Experiment 1a: Verify nitrite stability in anaerobic, untransformed E. coli
Characterization of the behavior of E. coli wild type while growing in the presence of nitrite in an anaerobic reaction chamber by measuring the conversion of nitrite to ammonium.
In this anaerobic experiment three different concentrations of nitrite are added to a medium where a native strain of E. coli is growing, in order to test the rate at which nitrite is converted to ammonium.  The hypothesis is that nitrite will be converted into ammonium. We want to determine how readily, and at what concentrations this happens. The anaerobic experiments will be performed in a sealed flask.  The concentrations of NH4+ and NO2- will be measured every 20 minutes and the experiment will last for 3 hours. The literature states that 10mmol of NO2- is converted into NH4+ per mg cell biomass per hour. There will be also a magnetic stirrer on 250 rpm. Each sample with different concentrations of nitrite will be measured separately, as well as the controls.  There will be three controls. One will be with only anaerobic biomass to check the behavior of cells without nitrite. A second one will be anaerobic abiotic with nitrite and medium to check that there is not any conversion of nitrite in the medium. A third anaerobic with killed biomass to confirm that reaction is catalyzed only by microbial activity.
EQUIPMENT NEEDED
6 bottle flasks of 100 ml with lids
1 magnetic stirrer
Syringes with long needles and small needles
Syringe filters with pore size 0.2μm

The first step of experiments of protein section was to extract the genome of bacillus thuringiensis. Israelensis. Lane 1 and lane 2 were both the genome of Bt.i, and the gel showed that the length of the genome was correct.
After gene segment of Cry11Aa was linked to pEASY-Blunt E1, we checked whether the plasmid was constructed correctly. The gel showed that the length of the plasmid was correct, and the sequencing results showed that the gene segment was successfully linked to the expression vector.
The plasmid was transformed into E.coli and cultured for 4-24 hours. Our targeted protein was expressed successfully based on the picture of gel.
For the virus experiments, we first inserted BmK IT into the plasmid p7NS1-GFP and constructed p7NS1-BIT-GFP. The sequencing results showed that the gene was correctly inserted into the plasmid.  Then, we cultured C6/36 cells to do the cotransfection experiment, but we failed."

Collaboration with HUST-China
When we submitted our parts, we got the help of HUST-China. HUST-China                     helped us freeze the plasmid into dry powder in 96 well plate format, label our plate with our team name and                     submission number, and eventually send it by express to the agency in China. We are extremely grateful for their help.
EurAisan Meetup
We also took part in the iGEM EurAisan Meetup, where we shared our ideas and learned a lot. At the                     meeting, we had friendly communications with many iGEMers and gained a lot of advice during this                     meetup. They suggested more possible delivery vehicles to our project and a more logical poster                     design. We took part in a quiz competition and were awarded the prize for best collaboration quiz                     with our buddy team SFLS_Shenzhen. After the meetup, we're still talking on WeChat.
CCiC meeting
In August, we participated in the biggest iGEMer communication conference in China——Conference of                     China iGEMer Community (CCiC). During this meeting, we communicated with teams tracking on therapy and reflected more about our project. For further collaboration，we met the captain of WHU-China and                     talked about the experience of our optogenetic tool.

What is Biohub 2.0?
Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval and more convenient biological ideas sharing. It is constructed on the basis of iGEM's official database. The parts inside are filtered and ordered intelligently, and presented to users in a friendly way. Users can grade the parts they've used, or post critical articles under them and exchange ideas with other users. All the data collected in the community will be used for more accurate ordering.
More than a community, Biohub 2.0 is also a flexible plugin system, which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Plugins will have full access to the community's data, so plugin developers can make further analysis of the parts. It's also welcome to deploy plugins that implement useful synthetic biological algorithms. With this mechanism, new tools and algorithms can be acquainted by other scientists more quickly.
BioSearch
BioSearch is a powerful search engine against Biobricks, with high performance and great accuracy. It's one of the core part of Biohub 2.0. You can access it via the search box on th top:
Just type anything you want to learn about a part and press Enter, in less than one second you will get the results:
The bricks are ordered by their qualities and creation date, which means you are always able to get the best and latest one to meet your need. The quality of bricks are ranked by several factors, including frequency of use, sample status, and assessments from users in forum, and so on. Each brick is displayed with a progress bar at the right bottom corner, which represents the relative ranking.
BioSearch supports multi-dimensional filtering. You can use `t:<type>` to limit the type of bricks:
or use `n:<part name>` to precisely locate a brick using its name:
or add an `h:` filter to mark out the matched words:
Multiple filters can also be combined to make complex query:
For each brick, Biohub will automatically fetch its relevant data from iGEM's offical website, and keep them updated. Biohub owns the same data as iGEM Parts Registry, but organizes and displays them"

InterLab
The goal of the iGEM InterLab Study is to identify and correct the sources of systematic variability                     in synthetic biology measurements, so that eventually, measurements that are taken in different labs                     will be no more variable than measurements taken within the same lab. 
This year, we use two orthogonal approaches to compute the cell count in our samples.
Converting between absorbance of cells to absorbance of a known concentration of beads.
Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample.
Plate reader and CFU
Calibration protocol
Before we started the plate reader measurement, we obtained the OD600 reference point, the                         fluorescein fluorescence curve and the particle standard curve in the microplate reader to                         standardize the absorbance reading, cell-based fluorescence reading and the number of                         cells.
Our model was a SpectraMax M2e Plate Reader. For the plate reader our excitation and emission                         settings were 485 nm and 525 nm respectively (Same setting was used for all experiments                         below).
Cell measurement protocol
Transformation
We transformed the plasmids (listed below) resuspended from the Distribution Kit into E. coli                         DH5-alpha cells. Colonies were given 16 hours to grow.
2 colonies of each device were inoculated over night into 5 ml Luria-Bertani media with 25 μg/mL                         Chloramphenicol in a 37°C, 220 rpm shaking incubator. Cell cultures were diluted to a target                         OD600 of 0.02 into same LB medium in 50 mL falcon tube covered with foil before use Diluted                         cultures were further grown at 37°C and 220 rpm. At 0, and 6 hours of incubation, 500 μL aliquot                         was taken from each two colonies of the 8 devices and were placed immediately on ice to prevent                         further growth. At the end of sampling point, 4 replicates 100 μl of each sample was pipetted                         into a 96-well microplate with the arrangement. Data was imported into the Excel Sheet for                         submission.
Protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1OD600 E.coli cultures
This protocol can be calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit(CFU) counts, which are                         directly relatable to the cell concentration of the culture. At this protocol, we first Dilute                         our overnight culture to OD600 =0.1in 1ml of LB+Cam media. We further diluted the                         culture according"

It was calculated that:
      •Number of amino acids: 198
      •Molecular weight: 21803.5
      •Theoretical pI: 4.65
It was also found that EtnR2 has an instability index of 21.05, classifying the protein as stable.
EtnR2: BLAST analysis – Are there any known close homologues?
The NCBI BLAST tool was used to conduct a protein BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to identify proteins with close sequence similarity to the EtnR2 sequence. The SmartBLAST feature selects ‘the three best matches in the sequence database together with the two best matches from well-studied reference species, showing phylogenetic relationships based on multiple sequence alignment and conserved protein domains.’ In the case of EtnR1, there were no matches from well-studied reference species. The top matches were all hypothetical Mycobacterium proteins. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree constructed based on sequence similarities and conserved domains. The individual alignments can be found at the bottom of the page.
Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree produced by SmartBLAST with query: hypothetical protein [Mycobacterium chubuense] (accession: WP_014805816.1, GI: 504618714).

The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,     as explained in Figure 2.
Connectivity
The nodes forming their own sub-graphs disconnected from the rest     of the nodes have been recognized, which showed us the presence of incompatibility     between few regulators and promoters of the devices. We have observed     this disconnection in all four of our graphs. The basis of the disconnection     has been shown in Figure 3, where the two sub-graphs without any edge     that connects them to the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].
Fig. 3: A zoomed in screenshot showing two sub-graphs within     the disconnected graph.
""Semi-Simplicity""
A simple graph is a graph in which no more than one edge contains     the same set of nodes. So, in a simple graph it is not possible to find     more than one edge with the same source and the same target. Additionally,     an edge with the same source and target, forming a loop is not allowed.     But, in synthetic biology it is possible to construct a device consisting     of devices or bio bricks of the same species or type. Accordingly, our     graphs are simple graphs with an exception of possible self-containing     loops, where the edge starts from and ends on the same node. Our graphs     have an exception of having loops and due to this permitted flexibility     our graphs are ""semi-simple"".

The cultures were diluted 1:100 in 2 ml of selective M9 and let grow for about 4-6 hours under the same conditions as before. Three 200 ul aliquots for each culture were transferred to a 96-well microplate and assayed in the Infinite F200 microplate reader (Tecan) for about 20 hours with the following kinetic cycle: 37°C, 5 min sampling time, linear shaking 15 sec (amplitude=3), wait 5 sec, measure absorbance at 600nm, measure fluorescence with the proper filter (EX:nm/EM:540nm for GFP or EX:535nm/EM:620nm for RFP) with gain=70. The same protocol was followed for the MC1061 and the MG1655 non-integrant strains, which were grown in M9 without antibiotic.
Data analysis: the absorbance measurements were normalized by subtracting the absorbance of the M9, while the fluorescence measurements were normalized by subtracting the fluorescence of the non-integrant strains over time. For each well, the Scell signal (proportional to the reporter protein synthesis rate per cell) was computed as (1/OD600*dXFP/dt), where OD600 is the normalized absorbance and XFP is the normalized fluorescence. The Scell signal was then averaged over time to obtain a single value for each well. Results are presented as the average Scell with their 95% confidence intervals of the mean.

Casting the gel
1. Select and cast the appropriate base (separating) gel. The amounts of reagents required for two gels with dimensions 0.07 × 14 × 14 cm and containing 10% and 16% acrylamide are given in the table that follows. Do not degas the gel mixtures, because the gel buffer contains SDS. Overlay the poured gels with several drops of water. Leave the gels for about 30 min to polymerize. (Alternatively, precast gels can be purchased from vendors, and the protocol can be started from Step 3.)The freshly prepared ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and TEMED should be added last, immediately before pouring the gels, because these polymerize the gels.
2. Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel prepared as indicated in the table in Step 1, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired. If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel, made up as described in the table. The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% ‘spacer gel’ can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious"

Our team put a lot of effort to broaden the views on how public people see GMOs in our society. We did not only discussed this quite sensitive issue, we also visited high schools and talked it over with the students, made them understand what exactly GMOs are. You can find more information about our trips to schools below.
But our educational goals did not stop here. We thought that knowing what people think might help us understand them, and we were right. According to the talks and discussions with the people around, we picked a few most popular myths about GMOs. You can find them here, below.
Furthermore, we made did a few more steps to introduce lithuanian people with the GMOs. We met a lot of young, curious and promising people at the Cafe Scientifique we organized, also we visited many startup, science meetups, Innovation Fair. You can find more about these steps in events page.
High school visits
Being the first iGEM team coming from Lithuania, we strongly agreed that it is our interest and responsibility to broaden the prospects of synthetic biology in our country. Most of the people in Lithuania are still afraid of genetically modified organisms and think of it as 'playing God' and experimenting with people. We wanted to introduce our society with the fact that synthetic biology and genetical engineering is not necessarily bad things and that they are mainly used for scientific purposes. Part of this plan was visiting high school students, who might even become interested in the field of synthetic biology or at least trigger some discussions amongst themselves or the parents.
Our team went to see nine different schools (and we plan on visiting another few in the autumn) and talked about what is synthetic biology, what it is used for, what we could do with it to make world a better place and, finally, what is iGEM competition. We visited high schools when we were in a brainstorming phase. Discussion with young people sometimes can suggest crazy ideas or applications of already known processes. Usually professors, scientists, students are stamped into the frames of what is possible and what is not. Visits in schools were a great opportunity to step"
Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial_-_-_TEXT.html," with the above, the challenge was then to design and characterise luciferases compatible with the sensors. In this, we decided to build on previous work by Ljubljana 2007 and Edinburgh 2009 . The firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis deposited as a BioBrick by the former formed the base of our red and green light producing proteins, while the bacterial luciferase LuxAB from Xenorhabdus luminescens BioBricked by last year's Edinburgh team was our blue light protein.
The emission peak of the wildtype firefly luciferase is roughly 557nm at pH 7.8 according to Branchini et al. (2005) . We needed to mutate this towards the red spectrum in order to activate the Cph8-based red light sensor, and also proposed to introduce a mutation towards the green spectrum so as to better match it with our hypothetical green light sensor. The LuxAB-LumP fusion already available in the Registry was theoretically already of the correct wavelength to activate the blue light sensor, although further characterisation was necessary. The theoretical spectra of the luciferases we sought to create are displayed in Figure 2 .
Difficulties were foreseen in making the various light producing proteins bright enough to activate their corresponding sensors, as well as in providing the substrates necessary for the bacteria to constantly emit light. However, once we received word that this year's Cambridge team was working to alleviate these problems, we decided to focus our efforts on the process of creating and characterising the various light producing and light sensing proteins.
During the course of the project, we collaborated closely with the UNAM-Genomics team from Mexico, since it was apparent from an early stage that we were pursuing very closely related ideas.

1.Overview
Recent researches show that 4S pathway（a four-step enzymatic pathway that converts DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) and sulfate） has a great significance in biological desulfurization. Mechanisms related to the 4S pathway have been broadly studied. In our project, we tried to study the pathway with mathematical theories and modeling. Based on the model of E.coli lac operon system in which lactose is used as an inducer, we derived the optimal proportions of Dsz-enzymes and the most accurate induced concentration of IPTG. Also, we calculated the best proportion between water and oil in the reactors, which effectively optimizes the system.
We analyzed the major parts of this pathway respectively, such as using Michaelis-Menten equation and substrate inhibition equation to analyze catalytic process of enzymes, as well as using differential equations(ODE) to analyze the concentration variations of different components in the system during the catalysis. We also established relevant models to fit images, building up a three-dimensional sense of understanding.
2. Enzymes’ proportional model in 4S Pathway
The procedure of 4S Pathway:
2.1 Theory Part
As the picture above illustrates, there are totally 4 enzymes participating in the 4S pathway. Through the pathway the C-S bonds in the DBTs are cleaved. After 4 steps of oxidation, the sulfur elements are converted into sulfate or sulfite, thereby dissolving in water and being removed. Meanwhile DBT is oxidized to HBP and remains in the oil phase, without degrading the hydrocarbons, which means the calorific value won’t be reduced. This is the process of 4s pathway biodesulfurization.
However, the lacking in durability of catalytic activity in the 4S pathway has become a major obstacle to BDS. Studies have found that HBP and HBPS in 4S pathway have majot inhibition effect"
SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Hoax_-_-_TEXT.html," Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by Dan Curtis Johnson ; partly as a foil on the Coalition page, claiming to oppose its ""subversive agenda"". The site points out that hydrogen hydroxide is ""environmentally safe"" and ""enhances the functionality, growth, and health of many forms of life"". [16]
In 1997, Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in Idaho Falls, Idaho , gathered 43 votes to ban the chemical, out of 50 ninth-graders surveyed. Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls Science Fair for analysis of the results of his survey. [2] In recognition of his experiment, journalist James K. Glassman coined the term ""Zohnerism"" to refer to ""the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion"". [17]
In 1998, drawing inspiration from Jackson's web page and Zohner's research, Tom Way created a website at DHMO.org, including links to some legitimate sites such as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Institutes of Health .
On April 1, 1998 ( April Fools' Day ), a member of the Australian Parliament announced a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide internationally. [18]
In Template:Visible anchor a staffer in New Zealand Green Party MP Sue Kedgley 's office responded to a request for support for a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide by saying she was ""absolutely supportive of the campaign to ban this toxic substance"". This was criticized in a press release by the National Party, [19] one of whose MPs fell for the very same hoax six years later. [20]
In 2002, radio talk show host Neal Boortz mentioned on the air that the Atlanta water system had been checked and found to be contaminated with dihydrogen monoxide, and set about relating the hazards associated with that ""dangerous"" chemical. A local TV station even covered the 'scandal'. A spokesperson for the city's water system told the reporter that there was no more dihydrogen monoxide in the system than what was allowed under the law. [21]
The idea was used for a segment of an episode of the Penn & Teller show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! , in which actress Kris McGaha and a camera crew gathered signatures from people considering themselves ""concerned environmentalists"" to sign a petition to ban DHMO. [22]

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," WT strain. This would lead to the GMO quickly being outcompeted by the WT in a natural setting.  In fact, contamination of the fermentation culture, by wild bacteria, in an industrial reactor is a constant issue for biotech industry. In such a case, it could be argued that the product itself (the enzyme) is where the focus of concern should be. Though most products produced by industrial bacteria may be considered safe in small amounts, large scale fermentation does produce them in large amounts and high concentration. This raises the question that maybe the products are what should be the focus of a discussion of safety GMO, rather than the organism itself.
This is not to say that there is not a safety concern regarding the use of GMOs, but the concern needs to be focused on each case and not on GMOs in general. In cases where the effects of the modifications are not well studied or when many modifications are made, the organism needs to be evaluated and safeguards put in place. Such safeguards can be put in place as part of the modifications. Examples of this are making the microorganisms reliant on a certain kind of medium (food), requiring specific signaling to proliferate or incorporating a kind of suicide switch by inserting a lethal gene that can be activated on command etc.
The intentional misuse of genetically engineered microorganisms is a separate issue that may be more difficult to handle. Especially since the technology for performing genetic modifications is becoming more and more readily available. However, this did not have a huge impact in the formulation of our project idea, since we would consider misuse of genetic engineering to be more of a regulatory issue. Due to this it was outside the scope of our integrated human practices.
Environmental vs social sustainability
Safety issues are not the only problem that needs to be addressed if large scale biosynthesis is to replace the current petroleum based chemical production. Industrial fermentation requires large amounts of substrate, mainly in the form of sugars. These are currently derived mainly from plant-based sources such as corn, sugarcane and sugar beets [2].
The use of these crops as industrial substrate raises concerns regarding competition for these feedstocks as food or industrial substrate. In countries like Brazil, where large-scale bioethanol production has started to replace conventional fuel production, this has already been shown to have negative social consequences. The competition for farmland has led to an increase in the prices of raw feedstocks [3]. This example of biosynthesis can teach us what effects large-scale implementation of this type of production can have. The price difference in developed countries is relatively small, since the value of the raw ingredients comprise a small part of the total cost of processed food"

The three proteins mentioned above were isolated separately from S. bisphenolicum AO1 ( Sasaki et al., 2005 ), so the CYPbisd electron transport system is a bacterial class I system.
The three gene products responsible for hydroxylating BPA act together to reduce BPA while oxidizing NADH. The cytochrome P450 (BisdB) reduces the BPA and is oxidized during this reaction. BisdB in its oxidized status is reduced by the ferredoxin (BisdA) so it can reduce BPA again. The oxidized BisdA is reduced by a ferredoxin-NAD+ oxidoreductase consuming NADH so that the BPA degradation can continue ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ). The bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were isolated, transformed into and expressed in E. coli and by this enabled E. coli to degrade BPA ( Sasaki et al., 2008 ). In addition, the BisdAB proteins from S. bisphenolicum AO1 were used to degrade BPA in a cell-free system (enzyme assay) in which spinach reductase ( EC 1.18.1.2 ) was added ( Sasaki et al., 2005b ).
In 2008, the iGEM team from the University of Alberta submitted the bisdAB genes from S. bisphenolicum AO1 to the registry of standard biological parts in the so-called Freiburg BioBrick assembly standard (<partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo>). In order to degrade BPA in a cell-free system, also a FNR BioBrick is needed. As demonstrated, the BisdA and BisdB work together in a cell-free system with spinach reductase and they work intracellular in E. coli. Thus, it can be assumed that it is possible to produce all components necessary to degrade BPA in a cell-free system in E. coli. To achieve this, a ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase BioBrick, isolated from E. coli, is provided by the Bielefeld-Germany 2011 iGEM team (<partinfo>K525499</partinfo>). We were also able to construct the fusion protein"

The protocol of the panel discussion. Download it here!
On 7th of September at 4 pm the lecture hall in the central lecture hall building of the University of Göttingen was filled with interested visitors. They came to listen to our informative event about Synthetic Biology ""Legoland for Scientists"".
Several weeks before, we were very busy organizing the information event. The first idea was to evaluate the survey. But to complete the planned event, we decided to invite some experts from different categories like politics, economy, ethics, journalism and science to discuss the survey results together. To win some experts over was more difficult than expected. First of all, it was holiday time in Germany and most people we invited had been on vacations. The second point was that we wanted to invite the experts by our own without any help of our advisors. Because we are actually not well known, it was difficult to contact them. In the end, we were happy to welcome four experts:"

Improving the Carotenoid Pathway
In 2009 the Cambridge iGEM team submitted a number of biobricks associated with the carotenoid pathway. These included the biobrick BBa_K274100 that converts FPP to to the red coloured lycopene. Lycopene is usually converted to the orange colour carotenoid β-carotene although the enzyme, crtY, although the gene for this enzyme not included in the BBa_K274100 biobrick so only lycopene is produced. The team also created the BBa_K274200 biobrick which includes the whole enzymatic pathway resulting in β-carotene.
We have been working with these carotenoid biobricks to prove the principle of light controlled manufacturing. We used BBa_K274100 to produce lycopene under control of a light dependant promoter. Using another light dependant promoter it would be possible trigger the expression of just the CrtY gene to selectively convert the lycopene into β-carotene. The 2009 Cambridge iGEM team did not include a biobrick of just this step in the pathway so we amplified it using PCR and added biobrick ends. This pathway could now be controlled by light, to determine which product is synthesised.

The running of the study
To analyse the timing of plasmid expression in the DU-145 cell line, we realized a kinetic monitoring of the apoptosis induction by making an annexin V assay every 6 hours for 48 hours after the plasmid electroporation. By coupling apoptosis rate of the population control (blank electroporation) and the population assay (electroporation with plasmid) with their respective growth rate, we will be able to determine the p53wt impact on apoptosis induction. We use a control without the plasmid pcDNA3 CMV+p53wt to quatify the level of death cells causes by the electroporation and by the culture transfert.
Because we had not a continuous access to the cytometer, we grouped the all 48h analyses in 2 cytometry runs. Each time slot of the study is represented by a distinct cell population. So, we realized 14 electroporations corresponding to the 7 time slots: +6h, +12h, +18h, +24h, +30h, +36h and +48h (two by slot: population assay+ population control).
Here is the allocation planning of electroporations:
Three cell populations were respectively electropored 12h, 24h et 36h before the first cytometry run (in red, at 9 a.m, day 3), four others 6h, 18h, 30h and 48h before the second run (in green, at 4 p.m, day 3).
The first cytometric analyze allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +12h, +24h and +36h, while the second one, allowed us to obtain data for the monitoring at +6h, 18h, +30h and +48h.
By coupling all these data, we obtain a monitoring on 48h of the apoptosis induction after p53wt electroporation.

iGEM at UNBC, Team Training and Project Startup
iGEM at UNBC is still in its infancy, this being our schools second year participating. To help promote iGEM, we offer a Special Topics in Biology course for team members. This course began in June and runs alongside the iGEM project, giving our students course credit for their contribution to the team. The course combines short lessons on applicable synthetic biology and lab techniques as well as a discussional classroom environment to share ideas, learn, and problem solve. Because the course changes by the project, the syllabus is designed accordingly and not published online. This year, hour contribution (a total of 100 hours throughout the summer) made up a significant amount of the course grade with the remainder split between presentations, annotated bibliographies, and a final lab report. iGEM brainstorming, however, did precede the course and began in January with the Synthetic Biology Club, while project work began in May and lab work began in July."

Protein synthesis inhibiting antibiotics include aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and lincosamides. These antibiotics exclusively interrupt bacterial translation by taking advantage of the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Aminoglycosides such as kanamycin and gentamicin are trisaccharides with amino groups. They bind to sites of the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome thus preventing its union with the 50S subunit to create a fully functional ribosome. Tetracyclines similarly bind to the 30S subunit of the ribosome, but they distort the A site such that aminoacylated tRNA cannot interact properly with the mRNA transcript. The macrolides, such as erythromycin, impede translation by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit such that the E site is blocked. The lincosamides which include lincomycin and clindamycin function similarly to the macrolides but have different structures. Inhibition of protein synthesis tends to be bactericidal.[1]
DNA synthesis inhibitors include the quinolones such as nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. These antibiotics interfere with DNA gyrase which is essential for relaxing the positive supercoils that results during DNA replication, recombination, and transcription. Without functioning DNA gyrase, DNA becomes irreparably broken and dysfunctional. Another antibiotic, metronidazole, requires activation by flavodoxin but can then causes damage directly by nicking DNA. Intact DNA is essential for continued growth and life of an organism.[1,3]
Rifampin exemplifies antibiotics that inhibit RNA synthesis. It inhibits transcription by binding to the β subunit of RNA polymerase. It is analogous to macrolides in that rifampin sterically blocks the exit of the RNA polymerase as macrolides block the exit site of the ribosome during translation. RNA is the essential intermediate in the central dogma of molecular biology; without it proteins cannot be synthesized and the organism will die.[1]
The antibiotics trimethoprim and sulfonamides inhibit the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis pathway in bacteria which is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids including fMet. These antibiotics inhibit the enzymes required to produce tetrahydrofolic acid which is necessary for the reactions that result in the formation of nucleic acids"
ASIJ_Tokyo,2018,Team:ASIJ Tokyo#Activities_-_-_TEXT.html," this meetup, we were able to get helpful suggestions on ways to modify our constructs. Specifically, we told them about how we were struggling with protein purification process using column chromatography and in response, the members of the Tokyo Tech and Gifu team suggested that we could incorporate Histidine tag into our construct so that A1AT proteins would be secreted with Histidine attached and afterwards run it in a nickel lined column to purify the His-tagged proteins. By incorporating this suggestion, the protein purification process became more precise, smoother, and faster allowing us to get a result in our fluorescent analysis of purified proteins that showed His tag construct was our best construct in secretion of proteins. Because we got this advice and because we went to this meetup, we were able to create a construct that worked the best amongst the two other ones that we tested.

We NEED BLOOD.
In a car accident, one victim can require as many as 100 pints of blood.
For every 7 people entering a hospital, about 1 of them needs blood.
Patients with severe sickle cell anemia need to receive blood transfusions every month to survive.
Every 2 seconds, someone in the United States needs a blood transfusion to save his/her life.
We are SHORT OF BLOOD.
Among the 500,000 women who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth, hemorrhage, a condition that invariably requires blood transfusion, is the most common cause.
Although 38% of the United States population is eligible to donate blood, less than 10% of that group actually does.
Current BLOOD DONATION is UNSAFE.
Globally, up to 4 million people have been infected with HIV by the transfusion of unsafe blood.
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis in donated blood is still extremely high in many developing countries; the prevalence of Chagas disease in donated blood is a major problem in South and Central American countries.
ARTIFICIAL BLOOD is a POSSIBLE SOLUTION to ALL THESE ISSUES.
Artificial blood is a product made to act as a substitute for red blood cells.
Though there currently exist issues, such as short circulation in human body, immune response, and increased probability in stroke, artificial blood still presents a promising future.
The MAJORITY SUPPORTS research and related development in this field, according to our survey.
YET… Very FEW people actually KNOW ABOUT IT.  (Data collected through our survey.)
In our opinion, raising public knowledge on this issue is crucial in the development of artificial blood. To achieve the goal, we believe in the power of education and engagement at social and personal levels.
How we educate & engage?

Online survey allows us to know the public’s existing knowledge or opinion on the topic of artificial blood and helps us better educate and engage. We released an online survey which received over 500 responses from"

Careers/Ethics
The overall effort of this outreach was to address the general public’s concerns about the risk and benefits of synthetic biology. As a team we wanted to reach out and show that synthetic biology is a science that is helping to improve global quality of life not endanger it.
Assemble your Biobrick!
In an effort to bring synthetic biology/iGEM awareness to the public, the GSU-iGEM team, along with the GSU Synthetic Biology Club, developed a game that we could play with children and adults alike using Legos to demonstrate a standard, working iGEM construct.  This involved lots of hours developing a game that was simple yet informative.  We also spent a good chunk of time sorting upwards of 12000 Lego Bricks!
Legos were the obvious choice because, well, who doesn’t love Legos?  It also mimics the iGEM standardized cloning sites in physical form.  We created a key to help our new friends build their own BioBrick construct for a yeast or a bacterial cell.  We had a lot of fun.  It generated lots of questions from the kids and their parents.  I think we really helped them understand how we work in the lab better with this demonstration.  The hands-on aspect of it really aided in cementing the process into their heads (and ours too).
Six Flags White Water Education Day
Six Flags!
Six Flags White Water Education Day is an event in which the park celebrates the academic outreach of several organizations such as iGEM, Synthetic Biology Club (SBC), and the CDC. Each year, Six Flags White Water welcomes thousands of students grades K-12 to engage in fun educational activities. GSU iGEM viewed this as an opportunity to collaborate with SBC in order to present key aspects of the team while gaining broad exposure to those who wished to understand more about the ever growing field of synthetic biology. About 40 children ages 5-12 years old showed up at the event. Safety posters were setup to answer questions that adults may have about the synthetic aspect of biology and a  game consisting of legos was organized for children so that they may better understand the organizational work that goes into creating a biobrick.

Based on the equations we provided, they added some modification.
Fig.2 The equations improved by JLU
After discussion, we found it’s hard to measure some parameters. They suggested us to simplify the equations, making it more close to the linear relationship.
The picture has two parts, one is about the equations replaced by other symbols (Fig.3), the other is about the linear equations to avoid measuring the parameter (Fig. 4).

BostonU,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,", lower-cost, and allows for quick prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate parts, we realized the cost of manufacturing parts in a machine shop were high. In fact, many of these parts only include clearance holes, which will serve its purpose as long as they meet a minimum dimension.
Material: Since our team chose to manufacture our system with 3D-printing, we chose to create our parts with ABS. The typical material for 3D-printing is resin, as it is inexpensive, but resin lacks the resolution needed to create the negative features on certain parts. ABS is stiffer and allows for more accurate parts and is more durable than resin.
Motors: We chose to incorporate stepper motors to the XY-plane as it allowed for a minimum step resolution of 1.8 degrees, which translates to 0.20 mm per step. Stepper motors also allow for microstepping, which allows us to further improve the resolution to 1/16 of a step, or 0.0125 mm.

Cloning
Digestion
- A restriction digestion of the parts gained by MiniPrep was conducted using EcoRI and PstI in NEB-Buffer 4. Afterwards, they were applied onto an agarose gel.
- Properties of the gel run with the digested samples: 100 V, 1 h 10 Min, 1 % agarose.
- SYBR Gold staining: 2 µl on shaking plate for 30 mins at room temperature (RT).
Transformation
Transformation of DH5 alpha with:
iGEM I15010 (R3) (see above) on ampicilin (A, Amp), chloramphenicol (C, Cm) and kanamycin (K, Kan) containing resistance plates;
iGEM High Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 1G, psB1A3 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: A;
iGEM Low Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 3C, psB3C5 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: C.
They were plated on agar plates carrying the appropriate antibiotic resistances and incubated at 37 °C over night.
03-06-2011
Results
Another SDS-PAGE gel run again inconclusive. Furthermore during the run, there was a loss of electrical power because of some blackout in the building.
Transformed cells grew very well over night, with a few clones of iGEM I15010 (R3) on kanamycin resistance plate found. This is evidence for a contamination, because the incubator did not cool down to 4 °C over thursday.
The transformed plasmid-cells grew also very good - now featured in red.
Cloning
Digestion
An agarose gel was run with digestions from yesterday, using the following settings: 90 V, 1 h 30 Min, 1 % agarose.
SYBR Gold staining: 2 µl on shaking plate for 30 mins at RT.
06-06-2011
Results
The agarose gel was again inconclusive. There may be too less material, since no bands around 100 bp could be detected at all.
Cloning
Digestion
Another digestion was conducted and analyzed on an agaorse gel. It ran with newly digested and undigested plasmid as control: 100 V, 1 h 30 Min, 1 % agarose.

1. glucose + ATP --Hx-> G-6-P + ADP
2. G-6-P + NAD+ --G-6-PDeH-> G-6-P + NADH
Reaction used Glucose assay kit (Genzyme) containing 2000U/L Hexokinase reagent and 4000U/L G-6-P DeH and measured glucose concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm. Results: Final NADH concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficient and were proportionate to initial glucose concentrations.

Northwestern,2014,Team:Northwestern#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Sharon and Kristi did PCR and made a gel of RBSs to extract the correct bands.
Week 13
8/31 Sharon, Tiffany, and Mitch cut, dephosphoralated, ligated, and plated the 20 RBSs using DH5-alpha competent cells.
9/2 We checked on the growth of the RBS which looked promising.  Sharon ran a colony PCR on all of the ligated product from Sunday and then ran a diagnostic gel on the PCR product. Mitch and Abdullah dephosphoralated, ligated, and transformed six promoters using DH5-alpha.
9/4 We ran 6 gels today to see if the RBS’s showed up in the cell/ligated with the cell. Only 1 band from the 6 gels confirmed that since it was in the 300 bp range. Adam and Abdullah meanwhile miniprepped RBS’s with plasmids so there would be genomic interference with them. After miniprepping, Sharon prepared them for PCR.
9/5 We made Cam plates.  David plated a plasmid from the iGEM kit with a standard biobrick backbone. Ran a gel of the RBSs.
Week 14
9/10 We all inoculated colonies from the RBS ligated plates into LB, picking 5 colonies from each plate. Since there were 16 plates of various RBS’s, we had 80 tubes of inoculated colonies.
9/11 We all miniprepped RBS ligated cells and prepared it for sequencing which we expect to finish the next day. Sharon and Abdullah also ran two gels with RBS ligated cells to see if a 300 band shows up for them, and 5/16 RBS’s did show a band there.
9/12 Adam and Mitch completed the sequencing reactions for submission.  6 tubes of BBBB A15 were inoculated by Tiffany and Sharon.  Sharon ran all of the lysates (three strains of E. coli, S. rimosus, P. fluorescens, and two environmental samples) in a cell-free protein synthesis reaction with RBS X5.  Mitch mini-prepped BBBB-A15-1 through BBBB-A15-6.
9/13 Adam cut the mini-prepped backbone and gel extracted the product.  Sharon ligated in 16 of the RBS’s and Tiffany transformed.
