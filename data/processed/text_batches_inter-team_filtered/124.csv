UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," of Free Growth
To describe growth of bacteria, many growth curves have been proposed. Under substrate-sufficient conditions, the Logistic curve, Gompertz equation, polynomial fitting, Stannard model, and their modifications[1] are widely applied. Meanwhile, Monod equation[2], Baranyi & Roberts model and many computational models[3][4] are more suitable in substrate-limited conditions.
As the promoter used in our project only functions in conditions with low concentration of ammonium, we adopt Baranyi & Roberts model which is suitable to explain substrate-limited condition. Its general form performs as below:
Parameter v(t) reflects the physiological state of the cells, which is determined by initial conditions and is independent of the history of bacteria and previous environments [6]. It can be assumed that the derivative of v is a constant under invariant conditions. Therefore v(t) can be solved:
Optical density(OD) we measure in experiments is proportional to the cell density. Then the growth rate equation can be expressed as followings.
The parameters of equation (3) cannot be fitted by simple regression, so we develop another approach. For any given parameters, we use Runge-Kutta method [7] to calculate how OD evolve with time after the initial value, and use Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm [8] to find the suitable parameters that minimize the standard deviation between evolution and measurement.
The fitting results are shown in Fig. 1. Dots are experimental values, and the curve is the fitted results. As is shown by the graph, this model performs well in predicting the bacteria growth in our program.
It is fair to consider the ammonium consuming velocity is roughly in proportion to the bacteria’s amount. Thus, the growth model could roughly predict the ammonium quantity change of the system.
Mechanism of Promotors
The promotors we used in our project, like glnAp2, glnHp and astC, have the same feature that it does not start the transcription process until the environmental ammonium concentration reaches a low threshold. Researchers have proposed the biological mechanism of these promotors [9]. The general process is shown in the graph below.
As is shown in the graph, the promoters are singularly activated by NtrC. Thus, it is fair to assume the promoter strength is proportion to the concentration of NtrC. Previous research indicates that factors from cellular amino acid metabolism like PII would bind to NtrB’s active site and prohibit the further reaction.[11] Researchers also found lower environmental ammonium concentration will result in an increase of NtrC-Pi."

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html," was subsequently proofed by performing a Western Blot.
The Western Blot (figure 23) performed with the same samples verified these results, since only bands around ~28 kDa could be observed for all samples except for PtNTT2(TAT)-cMyc-GFP and not for the negative controls. These bands can again be associated with the cMyc-GFP tag, providing further evidence that the tag can be cleaved of from the transporter. Again, no band could be observed for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP, indicating that PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide is weakly integrated into the membrane, which would explain the lacking function of this variant. The weak growth characteristics of the strain producing PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide would therefore most likely be caused by accumulation of the protein within the cell.
Figure 23: Western Blot of the isolated membrane fractions of the strains expressing the cMyc-GFP fusion proteins.
Thick bands can be observed around 28 kDa for all samples except for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide. The negative controls do not show the same band, but some unspecific binding of the anti-GFP antibody could be observed. Compared to the previous Western Blot, unspecific binding was substantially reduced. These results indicate, that the linker is most likely separated from the transporter either during the isolation process or already within the cell. This would be no surprise, given that the transporter is highly hydrophobic while the linker is hydrophilic.
To investigate if the transporter can be visualized on a gel using an anti-cMyc antibody, the same experiment was repeated, and the Western Blot performed using an anti-cMyc antibody. In case that the cMyc epitope tag remains attached to the transporter during possible cleavage events, it should be possible to visualize the transporter on a gel using the cMyc antibody.
Figure 24: Western Blot of the isolated membrane fraction using an anti-cMyc antibody.
Again, fragments can be observed around 35 kDa for all samples except for PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide. No bands can be observed for the full construct, but a very weak band can be seen between 55 and 70 kDa for the fusion protein of the native transporter.
Once again, bands could be observed for all transporter variants except for the TAT signal peptide variants around 35 kDa. One very weak can be observed for the fusion protein of the native transporter between 55 and "

There should be more time for the iGEM project. Between January and October, you have to 1) establish an idea 2) make it work and 3) get funding and resources. There is just too little time to consider a business or patents.
The next steps for future research should involve determining how these suggestions can be realized. For example, it would be useful to investigate VCs and accelerators interested in SynBio and incorporate them into the iGEM environment. Perhaps partnerships with established companies could be made to increase knowledge and technology exchange. Entrepreneurship consultants could provide training and advising for iGEM teams. Additionally, scientists need to be inspired and aware of the possibilities of founding companies from their research. These initiatives could be simultaneously progressed as the interest and knowledge in SynBio grows and innovation clusters are formed.
Helmut Schönenberger, CEO of UnternehmerTUM center of Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Munich, is an expert on building a clusters of innovation and believes it would highly benefit SynBio initiatives. According to the seasoned entrepreneur, building an ecosystem of partnerships, mentorships and inspiration for startups creates synergies that push startup potential. Today, clusters of entrepreneurship for Synbio are just at their beginnings, therefore these ecosystems need to be fostered by connecting large companies, startups, VCs and every interested party to build an effective support system for SynBio innovation. Furthermore, teaching entrepreneurship already has established methods - the problem is reaching scientists and showing them the possibilities in entrepreneurship. By creating a SynBio entrepreneurial ecosystem, which iGEM is partially doing, you create a wealth of synergies that promote SynBio startup creation and the SynBio industry overall (Schönenberger 2016).
Promoting these enabling factors and webbing a supportive ecosystem for Synbio is key to entrepreneurship and the SynBio community. Many improvements need to be made to provide scientists with the tools, mentorship, encouragement and business opportunities. The possibilities are there and growing, iGEM and scientists around the globe need only to seize the opportunity.

FucO/ L-1,2-Propanediol Oxidoreductase
FucO is the gene that codes for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase which is a NADH-linked, homodimer enzyme having the role of                  acting on furfural which is a toxic inhibitor of microbial fermentations causing cell wall and membrane damage, DNA breakdowns                  and reduced enzymatic activities (Zheng, 2013; Liu, Ma & Song, 2009).
The enzyme catalyzes L-lactaldehyde and L-1,2- propanediol while dissimilating fucose in which acetaldehyde, ethylene glycerol,                  L-lactaldehyde and some more substances are used as substrates. Despite these, it takes an important role in furan reduction                  to its alcohol derivative (Wang et al., 2011).
Our circuit design for FucO gene
Our circuit consists of prefix, a strong promoter (J23100), RBS (B0034), FucO as protein coding region, double terminator (B0015)                  and suffix. This part enables our E."

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Metals_-_-_TEXT.html,"is cell is then rendered bio-unavailable by incorporating it into smtA metallothionein.
SmtA metallothionein protein from E. coli can bind to heavy metals [1,2,3]. They have a tendency to bind to cationic metal ions such as cadmium, copper, arsenic, mercury, silver.
It has been shown that in B. subtilis, in order to express a specific protein in the spore coat, it is possible to make a fusion protein with a spore coat protein called CotC, and a group have successfully expressed antigen proteins which are about the same size as our smtA metallothionein in order to make a vaccine[4]. By fusing CotC spore coat protein from Bacillus subtilis, our smtA metallothionein can be localized to the spore coat, hence we hoped to successfully trap most of the metals ions into the bacterial spores.
CotC was also fused with GFP reporter gene in order to detect the expression of the fusion protein into the spores using a fluorescence microscopy.
Because we want most of the metals to go into the spore rather than the vegetative cell, we designed our fusion protein so that it is controlled by the native cotC promoter sigK which is activated in sporulation conditions. Therefore, our smtA metal sequester would only be expressed once the cell have made the decision to become a metal container and sporulate, and only be expressed in the spore.
Finally, our construct integrated the B. subtilis genome through homologous recombination at the native CotC gene. However, as we will be using pMutin4 integration vector, there will be two different copies of the cotC gene in our engineered B.subtilis genome: a native copy of cotC and our engineered CotC-GFP-smtA fusion copy. We chose not to knock-out the native CotC gene because the lack of native CotC might lead to defects in spore coat formation.

The efficiency of this energy transfer decays with the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor. This makes FRET an ideal tool to measure or verify very short distances, like the ones between interacting proteins in vivo. A common application would be tagging two supposedely interacting proteins with the FRET couple and measuring acceptor fluorescence. Obviously this technique lends itself well to the evaluation of linkers.
Design
mTurquoise (donor) and mNeonGreen (acceptor) were used as FRET-couple for this study. Translational fusion constructs were created according to a modified RFC25 standard. From the registry we took the linkers BBa_K243004 , BBa_K243005 , BBa_K243006 , BBa_K157009 , BBa_K157013 , BBa_K243029 and BBa_K243030 . We also used this method to characterize our own linkers BBa_K1351009 and BBa_K1351035 . For each linker a construct with mTurquise fused to it N-terminally and mNeonGreen C-terminally was created, as well as a construct where the FPs were oriented the other way around.
Results
The constructs have been created, and fluorescence has been observed. Due to time concerns, the FRET-assay has not yet been performed.
Bacillus RBS collection
Ribosome Binding Sites (RBS) are essential for gene expression, since they are required for translation initiation. Much to our dismay, there used to be no Bacillus RBS in the registry. So we designed a broad-range RBS library for B. subtilis, aiming for maximum translation initiation rate space coverage.
Background
RBS are short nucleotide sequences that are complemetary to the 3' end of 16S rRNA, and thus are bound by the ribosome during translation initiation. The RBS is usually found ~8 nucleotides upstream of the start codon in procaryotes. In B. subtilis the perfect consensus RBS is AAGGAGGGATA ( Bba_K1351028 ).
Design
Using the Salis lab's RBS calculator
we calculated our RBS library with the sequence  ARRRRRRGATA. The 7 RBS from this collection that were submitted as BioBricks ( BBa_K1351028 - BBa_K1351034 ) are the ones that offer the best"

Overview
""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" — Peter Carr, Director of Judging. What’s Human practice? It is not just a work  to confirm and strengthen what we think is right. Instead, we should learn to share our knowledge with the world. We can’t just instill our personal cognition into others, nor can we blindly believe in whatever others say. All in all, human practice is all about “gain, give and mutual interaction”.
First, we build up a system constructed by the three topics below: Project, Us and the World. What we found is that our activities can actually made up a comprehensive interaction (refer to the following picture beside) For example, we “gain” professional suggestions from experts in various fields, which have made us think of repositioning our project; To conduct educating, we “give” what we know to those who are laymen in synthetic biology and sugar controlling. Other examples of give and gain also includes marketing and sponsorships. It is also necessary that we set up mutual pathways for knowledges, which are also known as meetups, collaborations and cross-domain communications. Totaling up all of them, we’ve excellently completed human practice.
To achieve our goal, we consult experts in different areas of study

Taiwan has the reputation of “the kingdom of Hem dialysis”. Yes, this is apparently not a thing we should be proud of. A huge sum of money is spent on this problem every year. But, you probably don’t know that a huge ratio of these cases are caused by neither drug abuse nor consuming too much salty food. Instead, diabetes is what may leads to kidney diseases. So, we invited Dr. Wu from the division of nephrology to tell us about the negative effects of diabetes. 
 In the interview, he mentioned that due to hyperglycemia, HHNK and DKA, which may cause headache, nausea, or even drive people into coma, is often found in people with diabetes. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also cause the filtration"

RHIT,2012,Team:RHIT#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,": Synthetic Biology
Overview
With goal of education in mind, the RHIT team developed a board game that teaches its participants as they play it. The game is called BioPioneer: Synthetic Biology. Players try to solve major world problems by selecting one of five laboratories, each having a special laboratory technique. Every player has to meet the world problem’s requirements while obtaining the correct DNA sequence that will code for the solution to the problem. Players take turns hiring people, buying equipment, and producing papers to help grow the knowledge pool and capabilities of the lab. The game was designed to incorporate actual procedures, resources, and equipment that are used in synthetic biology, creating a realistic laboratory experience.
Educational Ties
The main focus of the board game is education through fun.  The game was designed to be intriguing and interactive, but still involve a large portion of strategy. Through the wide array of techniques, equipment, and paper combinations, players can find a play style that fits their personality. This will link to players to the game and will lead players not familiar with synthetic biology to search deeper about what it is. To help facilitate this, an educational pamphlet with simple descriptions will be included with the board game that has simple descriptions of terms and processes and how they apply to synthetic biology.
What makes this game different from many other games out there is how realistic the gameplay is to the actual science. The creation of sequence is analogous to the actual process that biologists use for plasmid design. The shapes signify different DNA sequences that code for different functional units, whereas the colors represent the different choices between the available units with similar function. For example, there are many different types of restriction sites that can be used, but in order to follow certain protocols a specialized site is selected for use.
In addition, the idea of limited resources plays a vital role in teaching players about how research is done. Actions are determined by the number of people in your lab, but become useless when there is nothing to spend the actions on. Following the same lines, a player can have all of the pieces of equipment with no one in the lab to work them. These both show the importance of keeping the size of laboratories manageable to optimize production of advancements. Finally, papers in the game help players to obtain pieces of equipment and lab members, showing that the knowledge pool of the laboratory must be kept up to date in order to be successful.
Gameplay
The goal of Bio-Pioneer is to solve the World Problem through the use of synthetic biology. To do so, your lab must achieve all prerequisites of the World Problem, synthesize your DNA sequence, and"

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for predetermined     parameters.
Most of the parts are composed of functional and nonfunctional constructs     which are formed by atomic parts. And every part should carry the information     for all of its atomic parts within itself. The “input” heading actually     stands for promoters. Parts with one or more promoters can be found     at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Along with the information on which and how     many promoters a part might have, the activity level of promoters are     also important to distinguish between a constitutively active promoter     or a promoter activated by specific physiological processes or states     etc. This information was crucial for us to dissect in order to run     our algorithm as it directly affects which inputs can activate the devices     or the systems.
Throughout our investigations on the Parts Registry, we found out     that much of the terminology was being used ambiguously. Although this     might not be vital for synthetic biologists, it is still endeavoring     to understand the function of certain regulatory elements which also     becomes a time consuming task for the researcher. Thus, we recommend     that the explanations of certain regulatory elements should be redefined     and fixed especially for synthetic biology for easy communication, sharing     and searching of information.
Common misuses of the terminology can guide us to figure out how     to construct a standard nomenclature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all, synthetic biology is an emerging     research discipline and an industrial application area which is highly     promising. Secondly, redefinition of the terminology to build a standard     nomenclature is needed as some of the terms are prone to be used instead     of another causing problems related to misuse for the global communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which serves for the information exhibition and exchange globally.     For instance, there are obvious misunderstandings about the words which     are predominantly used for regulation process. We have noticed that,     the terms “inhibitor” and “repressor” are being used as equivocally     in the part information pages. Like the lactose inhibitor protein, a     widely used DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, that have been labeled     both as “inhibitor” and “repressor” at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory"

This would then be pasted into one of the recommended vectors and could be submitted to the registry.
Input and Processing systems
We split into groups to plan and discuss the following possible ideas for input systems:
Mike and Shuna = Amplifier
Siming and Alan = Bistable switch
Crispian and Megan = Population control and growth
Viv = Coloured spores (Idea discarded due to high levels of complexity involved in understanding, designing and working with the spore system. It also required the use of a chassis that was not E-Coli.)
Plans for Friday
Meeting at 10am to discuss ideas Meeting with faculty at 2.30pm to further discuss ideas and present work done so far
Wet work = colony PCR (to be explained by James) and observation of (hopefully!) coloured plates
Friday
Results of Wet Work
All transformations were completed sucessfully. Single cononies were observed on the 1/10 dilution plates and could easily be picked out for plasmid propagation procedure (to be started on Monday). However no colours were observed.
Reasons:
Melanin plasmid = plasmid required the addition of IPTG
pPSX plasmid (violet) = the pigment is on a low copy number plasmid
The melanin plates were left out on the bench to see if the brown pigment developed over time. The rest of the plates were stored in the fridge for making plasmid stocks (procedure starting next week).
BioBrick Construction
Used ApE to examine the melanin plasmid:
This contains only two forbidden restriction sites within the actual gene. These could be removed by PCR.
Also looked at the vio operon:
As this contains a large number of the forbidden biobrick restriction sites, it would be impossible to prepare the biobrick using PCR alone. The operon would have to be synthesised with these sites removed to be feasible as a biobrick.
The other possible pigments are the orange biobrick system and the pseudomonas red/green pigment.

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," think this could be due to the fact that it had “bio” in its name, and this was easier to sort with the category that shared part of its name.
Overall, we’ve learned a fair amount of information already, but there is lots more to be done. We can use different words, and we can make improvements on the structure of the test. Soon enough, we’ll know for sure which words we should use to better relate our project and synthetic biology to the general public!
Next Steps
A next step for this project would include extending the sample size to make it as representative as possible. This year, a large proportion of the participants were students associated with the University of Waterloo. In the future, we would like to expand this to not only other universities and colleges nationally and internationally, but also to workplaces and schools outside of the university spheres. With more diverse participants, we can better recognize the general public’s reactions to synthetic biology, as well as how different places may perceive the field. The more we know about people’s thoughts and biases towards synthetic biology, the better equipped we’ll be when relating to the public and introducing new scientific concepts.
As well, we’ve found some of the words used in the control categories “pleasant” and “unpleasant” may not be the same for everybody. Words such as family, accident, or friends could sometimes be sorted much slower than average in the pleasant versus unpleasant block, and this could be because these words are not universally positively or negatively associated for everybody. Any of these words need to be identified to avoid making the test more difficult for participants as well as preventing a less robust control baseline if they do not associate a categorically pleasant word with positive bias. As well, some words and acronyms are not well known. For instance, HVAC was sorted incorrectly more than any other word, suggesting that most participants did not know that HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Words or acronyms like this should be avoided to ensure the test is as rigorous as possible.
We would also like to extend the project and our results such that other iGEM teams can use it. Once we collect more data we intend to create a thesaurus of synthetic biology terms. This way, iGEM teams could use the more “public friendly” version of the concepts used in their projects, which could foster a more positive response to their projects and the field of synthetic biology.
Overall, there is still a lot of work to be done, but this could be a great tool for educating and introducing the public to synthetic biology. As support grows, so does research"

Data For Pre-existing Parts:
BBa_M30109 Experience:
BBa_M30109 seems not as available as mentioned on the website. We tried PCR and extraction of plasmids successively but both of them failed. It might be the size that resulted in the instability of those test procedures since BBa_M30109 has an astonishing size of 4333bp: with such a giant fragment it may lead to multiple mistakes in replication.
BBa_R0051 Experience:
BBa_R0051 does not work well due to its rather small size. We transformed it for three times, and none of them succeed. We designed primers to PCR it out from K091230 successfully, but failed to perform the digestion since it is too small to extract from gel. It may work better if adding some nonsense sequence before the promoter.
BBa_J5526 Experience:
We tried to transform BBa_J5526 several times. It grows well, but never turns red.
BBa_S03419 Experience:
BBa_S03419 is available and the sequence is proved to be correct.
BBa_B0015 Experience:
BBa_B0015 is available and the sequence is proved to be correct.
BBa_K081024 Experience:
BBa_K081024 is available and the sequence is proved to be correct.
BBa_I13507 Experience:
BBa_I13507 is available and the sequence is proved to be correct.
BBa_I15008 Experience:
Unfortunately, the inversion of BBa_I15008 succeeded but we lost the correct seed due to an accident.
BBa_J13002 Experience:
Both PCR and Extraction of plasmids suggest a correct size of J13002, but we failed to get the available and reliable sequencing report. So we cannot confirm that J13002 is sequencing-correct or not.

Figure 2: Mycelia growing on Martian regolith simulant. They also grew on lunar regolith simulant. (special thanks to Solar System Exploration Virtual Institute-SSERVI for supplying us with the simulants!)
II. Launch, Travel, and Landing
Once the habitat is designed, built and loaded with mycelial starter filaments and dried cyanobacteria or spores (akinetes), we need a way to get the structures from Earth to another destination (e.g., the Moon or Mars). There are a few rockets we can choose from: the Falcon Heavy6 from SpaceX, and the newly developed Space Launch System from NASA are potential options. The launch site will likely be NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
In talking to Engineering Prof. Rick Fleeter from Brown University (an industry-veteran and consultant to the Italian Space Agency), he suggested allocating at maximum 80% of the actual rocket payload to the weight of our structures - providing us with a ballpark estimate of how much material we can carry. As other infrastructure is needed for a human settlement, we aimed to be substantially lower in mass.
Once in space, estimated travel time to Mars is approximately 6-7 months, in the closest approach between Earth and Mars (which occurs no less than ~1.5 years apart)2.
Numerous factors need to be considered when choosing a Martian landing site. These include equatorial proximity (to reduce temperature fluctuations on the order of hundreds of degrees between day/night), low altitude (thicker atmosphere allows for easier spacecraft deceleration, and meaningful quantities of useful gases), and availability of shallow sub-surface water (for use by astronauts).
We first spoke to Dr. Lisa Pratt, NASA's Planetary Protection Officer, to better understand the regulations regarding which types of landing sites are off-limits, or may require additional precautions. Then, based on consideration of these factors, and in talking to Planetary Geoscience Professor Jim Head (an interplanetary mission expert, focusing on Mars, from Brown University), we chose as our landing site Deuteronilus Mensae7,8,9; this site (Figure X) was among the very top sites in NASA’s First Landing Site (LS)/Exploration Zone (EZ) Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars"

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#PEK_-_-_TEXT.html," idea if it is presented in a more familiar scene for them.  So we integrated our activities into local activities that people choose to participate in the weekends. We want to convey a concept that “science can be a part of their life, and their engagement do matters”.    In that way, we need to prepare some funny things to attract people’s attention. Various creative educational tools are designed by team members. We think about using a stall that integrates these tools to introduce synthetic biology and our project to the public. The stalls were put up in different places, such as the exhibition hall of STEM festival and the information hall of a science & technology museum. And we adjusted the types of the tools and the way to communicate with people in the process of activities conducting.
Video about synthetic biology for kids
Applicable age range: 5-15
    Kids like stories, and it always a good way to convey some basic concept in stories. So we made a video about synthetic biology, in which a story of a bacterium changing itself by means of synthetic biology was told. It conceals some proper nouns, and focus on sparking new curiosity of the kids.
Room escape game
Applicable age range: 15-35
    Speech filled with proper nouns will make people unwilling to recept the information. But game can always fascinates people. Have you ever feel learning motivation is extremely high during the game time?    Taking that phenomenon into consideration, we think about designing a room escape computer game for the public. The background of the game is set in the lab, you are unable to escape the room until you collect all the clues. In order to get the clues, you have to know basic knowledge of synthetic biology and our project. If not, it is easy to get the wrong clue, and fail the game! The player will find it difficult at first, and be eager to know the knowledge about synthetic biology behind the game, which meets our original intention.
Mechanical cipher machine
Applicable age range: 15 and above
    In consideration of biosafety, it is not possible to bring our biological cipher machine outside the lab. However, we can change the way to present it! Then a mechanical cipher machine came out. It used the same principle of our biological enigma machine, but it is much faster, which enables it to show how our biological enigma machine works to the public.
Software Enigma
Applicable age range: 15 and above
    Since the mechanical cipher machine is not convenient when it comes to vast input. We designed a software enigma, which has"

Figure 7: Characterisation of hHBB. Single colonies of M15[pREP4] E.coli containing pQE80-L encoding hHBB were used to inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB growth medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. Once cultures reached an OD600 of 0.6, they were induced with a range of IPTG concentrations. They were left to grow for a further three hours, after which a 1 ml sample was taken and the cells pelleted. The cells were resuspended in 100 µl of Laemmli buffer, 20 µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE. The cells were resuspended in 100 µl of Laemmli buffer, 20 µl of which was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody.

Brasil-SP,2014,Team:Brasil-SP#Project#Device_-_-_TEXT.html," and this is why glass wasn't treated as the more appropriate option [9], at least for microchannels construction . Hybrid material layers are important to give more rigidity to the chip structure based on PDMS, and we plan to use a single layer of glass to support the other PDMS layers. Hydrid LTCC and PDMS layers were considered given the reports on literature [10], but this possibility was discarted taking account our expertise and time avaliable for prototyping.
Chambers, Valves and Exhaustion Channel
Four different chambers were designed to accommodate the four liquids involved on the biodetection process. The construction will need five layers of PDMS and one of glass, using a area of 5cmx5cm and having a height less than 1 cm.
Figure 2: Device dimensions.
Figure 3: Device PDMS layers.
The reagent chambers and reaction chamber (see Fig. 4) are of an arbitrary volume of 522,2 microL and 3,8 mL, respectivelly. We assume that these volumes are more than enough to contain the volumes needed for flexibility in the volume proportions testing during the experiments for standarization of the chip usage.
Figure 4: Top view of the channel layer. More information abou the channel linking the Virkon Chamber to the Spores Chamber on the ""Fluid Dynamics"" subsection.
Thes connexion between the Spores and Virkon chambers (Figure 2) was necessary because of the residual spores solution that certainly will stay on the spores chamber. More information about the fluid dynamics between those chambers are below on the next subtopic at this page. To avoid the fluid flowing back to the reagent chambers, it was choosen a elegant valve that biomimics heart valves. The dimensions used are proportional from the literature data [12], in a scale of 1:4.
Figure 5: Biomimic valve used on the concept device being decribed. More information in reference [12].
Because of the low pressure on the reagent chambers after the release of the membrane , the biomimic valves are supposed to close. Eventual high pressures on reaction chamber also contributes for its closing, forcing the valve corners to close the ""doorway"". When pressed, the PDMS ""buttons"" are expected to successfully expell the reagent chamber liquids to the reaction chamber. A central chamber of surplus volume is needed to hold the mixing solutions and the sample, also leaving space for a air bubble formation on the top in contact with the exhaustion channel.  The reaction chamber is also a mixing chamber, where the"

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," than threshold and not a fringe if else. Each change from black to white represents a fringe.
Hence, we get the fringe number.
Fringe Spacing
Store the fringes as undirected graph: By travelling all elements in the matrix, we add a edge in the graph for all fringe (represented as 0)
For example, a matrix like this:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
We can obtain the table of edges:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
((4,0),(4,1)) \\
((2,1),(3,1)) \\
((3,1),(4,1)) \\
((0,2),(0,3)) \\
((0,3),(0,4)) \\
((0,4),(1,4)) \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Do the depth-first-search for the users’ input ending pixel: We obtain the DFS spanning tree, which records the fringe the ending pixel is in.
Calculate the distance of consecutive pixels in the fringe that users choose by the starting and ending pixels to obtain the fringe order: Users choose a pixel, and we find the corresponding fringe, then calculate the distance of these pixels. We set the minimum distance as the fringe spacing.
Fringe Order
We suppose the fringes are concentric circles by the theory in optics(Team USTC used Michelson Interferometer in the SPRING hardware).Meanwhile, the relationship of fringe order and fringe radius is as follows:
$$r=\alpha\sqrt{n}$$
$r$ is the fringe radius, $n$ is the fringe order, and $\alpha$ is a constant set by users.By this equation, we can get the fringe order from the fringe radius.In the experiment of Team USTC, the relationship is $\alpha=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda r^2}{2h}}$,where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of laser, $r$ is half the thickness of thin-film, and $h$ is the distance from film moved by bacterium to the film’s original place.
Now, we derive uncertainty formula: supposed that the first point's fringe series which users select is $n$, the fringe radius is $r_n$, the second point's"

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," economic burdens associated with HIV in a country with a relatively developed healthcare system and a relatively high growth rate. This is a very best-case scenario.
Estimated costs to a person across they’re entire lifetime vary based on the initial CD4 count. With a high initial CD4 count (greater than 500 cells/uL), one may expect a lifetime cost of $361,944 and a life expectancy of 24.4 years. Without receiving ARVs both cost and life expectancy drop to $145,218 and 12.4 years respectively. The cost of treatment will go down with a decreased CD4 count, however as will life expectancy will drop precipitously.
Table 1. Courtesy of source 6 (Direct cost of ART in USD within the united states)
However, the direct cost to the individual are only the tip of the iceberg. Rather, much of the cost is concentrated in the productivity loss. Across all ethnic groups, the loss of productivity has a consistent price tag greater than $500,000 with blacks and Hispanics nearing $1,000,000. The overall cost of these factors, however, exceeds these simple values. The indirect burden from HIV/AIDS is underestimated as it is the potential of the future that HIV kills. Even in the United States, the effect of HIV is something great and unfathomable. One can only imagine the effects of this on those countries not as well off. (6)
What We Do
This project primarily concerns itself with the creation of an RDT capable of detecting HIV infection within as little as a week after infection. Furthermore, this test will have a specificity that exceeds 95%. As a result, not only is it able to identify the presence of HIV quickly but also accurately. As a result, individuals who identify the viral presence earlier will have a necessarily higher CD4 count. As a result, life expectancy can be expected to improve.
Moreover, the cost with which this test can be produced would allow for widespread use within the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Combined with the provision of ARVs by foreign NGOs, the indirect costs associated with HIV can be staved off without these countries shouldering too much of the direct medical costs. This can mitigate much of the costs associated with the proliferation of HIV within these countries and facilitate. Thus the combination of these factors allows for a greater degree of economic growth across all countries within the affected regions.
This, however, is only the tip of the iceberg. The specific RDT designed by our team is not only cheaper than current options but can also diagnose HIV earlier. As a result, the test designed by our team is not only an"

Applying the data analysis method described above, the absorption at 590 nm has been corrected subtracting the fraction due to the absorption of the cells and the media. The remaining OD590 only refers to the amount of indigoidine in the liquid culture. Note, that the amount of indigoidine over time shows a sigmoidal behaviour. After a maximal level, the indigoidine level drops again. In parallel, the absorption at 430 nm rises, due to the reduction of the pigment keto-indigoidine to its fluorescent leuco-form (data not shown).

The patch of chromproteins to the right of scOrange is from the cell culture that the scOrange (in the top center) was orginally taken from. The patches of chromoproteins to the left of the center row are also from their respective original cultures. This was done in order to compare the loss of color the chromoproteins experience after heating and rehydrating. As it is clear to see, AE blue is now purple/pink.

In order to explore other applications for these chromoproteins, I wanted to test if their color was UV sensitve. In order to do this, I plated Prancer Purple and dsPink in 6 wells in a 96 well plate then placed that plate in a UV light box. After twenty minutes, there was no detectable change in response to UV. An additional ten minutes also yielded the same result. Futher tests will be conducted with longer time scales, but it seems safe to conclude that these chromoproteins do not have a short term response to UV light.

Decisions made to use restriction site cloning to introduce synthetic GFPs into pFTV. Also, determined that best method of obtaining the genes is ordering them as gblocks from IDT. Problem of RBS library anticipated, synthetic leader sequence developed in order to work around the problem of the coding sequences being different.

The 4-Part Gibson CBA was sequenced and determined to have all the correct junctions - our Plasmid 1 is complete. Attempts were made to insert the dCas9 system into the Plasmid 1 construct via ligation.
Project Plan updated extensively as mistake in design of gblocks realized (truncation) as well as the addition of a fifth gblock (slow insertion time). Programs written to optimize for insertion time as well as total the insertion time for existing genes. Restriction enzymes re-chosen and gblocks ordered. Project plan modified to include a gene first, RBS later strategy.

However, the ligation from the previous week was not successful. We believe this was due to recently expired ClaI restriction enzyme or expired DNA ligase buffer. Both were replaced. We attempted to insert the dCas9 system and Lambda Red Recombinase system simultaneously (bypassing the need for ClaI) by performing a 2-part Gibson CBA. Upon PCR amplifying and running on a gel, the CBA also failed.

Since ButCoAT was tagged with RFP, to test whether it is functional or not, we have used fluoresence microscopy technique to show its expression is properly done or not.However, because ButCoAT doesn’t have a stop codon it fused  with RFP and they both become unfunctional from this fusion.Therefore,  we couldn’t see any peak.
Experimentally Validation of Previous Device
CAD1 (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) enzyme that we were interested previous year was characterized with Fehling colorimetric assay. This year we wanted to show construct work with pSB1C3 vector on protein gel. After growing and obtaining colonies in Overnight culture, we have got optical density at 1.0 and using several techniques we have extracted protein and loaded on a SDS gel. Without induction, constitutive promoter that we have ligated previous year worked perfectly and give us a lane at 38kDA. The control group was the e. coli dh5a untransformed colonies. Here you can see image;
First well is ladder.
3rd lane of ladder from bottom stands for 25.
4th lane from bottom stands for 55kDa.
First well is loaded with empty dh5a and its lysate is just right next to it
3rd well is our first colony that we have successfully completed ligated into psb1c3
Here you can see 4 lane in-between 25 and 55kDa
Extra lane is our CAD1 enzyme denatured protein
To conclude, as you can see, the enzyme was not released in environment and we proved it in wells that we have loaded lysates next to precipitated ones.
Future Plans
After Pet28a expression vector clonning fail, we have tried to show characterization on iGEM cloning backbone with the use of reporters(GFP and RFP) and we couldnot prevent the formation of fusion proteins. However, we succesfully characterized the compatibility of those protein of interests when they expressied together with RFP and GFP.
Those finding show us that we need to seperate proteins with the use of RBS, for instance, to expressed proteins with their reporter properly and get expected results. Our first aim seperate these proteins from each other by constructing our biobricks depend on what we have found.
In parallel to these, as expression vector, we want to clone our constructs into PBlueScript to show the activity of bacteria when they properly induced.

Figure 10: Number of SAHS 33020 proteins at different distances from Cas13a over 300000 iterations. Data was extracted from a Simulation of Cas13a with SAHS 33020 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
To determine which TDP would preserve Cas13a activity best, we analyzed two parameters: the coverage of Cas13a during the lattice model simulation (see Figure 11) and the development of the energy over time (see Figure 12).
The coverage of Cas13a is measured by counting the number of immediate neighbours to all units in the Cas13a protein. If the protein is covered with TDPs more quickly, they can form the glass-like matrix supporting its structure earlier, preventing degradation of the protein. In Figure 11, the number of immediate neighbours of Cas13a is plotted against the number of iterations per chain. All TDPs display similar development of coverage, but SAHS 33020 and CAHS 94205 display a steeper slope than the other proteins in their respective families and a higher coverage at 800 iterations per chain. This suggests that they are better suited for drying Cas13a.
Figure 11: Number of immediate neighbours to Cas13a against the number of iterations per chain for TDPs CAHS 94205, CAHS 106094, SAHS 33020 and SAHS 68234 at a concentration of 1 g/L and in a volume fraction of 0.1.
This result is partly reflected in the interaction energies calculated in the different TDP simulations. A steeper slope of the energy graph indicates that the phase separation occurs faster and that the steady state is reached at an earlier stage. Thus, Figure 12 implies that the two SAHS proteins and out of these SAHS 33020 would confer the highest desiccation tolerance to Cas13a. However, when comparing within the protein families, CAHS  904205 and SAHS 33020 show the best results again.

The term governance, however, usually denotes how politics became less about governmental mechanisms of 'command and control', and more about procedures of 'consultation and deliberation', which sometimes favours an increasing presence of market mechanisms (Heywood 2002: 6).
Ignorance: Knowing that the knowledge is limited in a certain area. It increases with every state of new knowledge.
Interdisciplinarity: Combining two or more academic disciplines into one activity, which implies thinking and working across disciplinary boundaries.
Late modernity: The continuation of modernity as it is today, which is characterised by the way we have strongly developed into a global society. This is in contrast with the idea that we instead live in postmodern times and therefore have left modernity. Authors of the risk society theory and reflexive modernisation rather believe that modernity still aptly describes the times we currently live in, despite various technological and social changes that have emerged in late modernity.
Modernity and modernisation: Modernity refers to the contemporary historical period that is characterised by a rejection of tradition, the emergence of individualism, freedom and formal equality; an optimisitic belief in progress on social, scientific and technological levels; rationalisation and professionalization. The period is preceded by medieval feudalism and makes a transition to capitalism and the market economy, accompanied by industrialisation, urbanisation and secularisation; the development of the nation state and its institutions.
Modularity in synthetic biology: The premise that, at the level of nucleic acids, proteins and biochemical pathways, biology can be understood as made out of components that can be functionally separated ans recombined as they possess their own properties regardless of the context that they are put in, much like Lego bricks. In synthetic biology, these modules are made synthetically to fit into a range of different biological circumstances. The principle of modularity helps biological parts to be predictable in their function, making them prone to blackboxing, i.e. not requiring knowledge about how a particular module or biological part has been constructed.

Taking our sample as representative of the whole teaching community (regardless of curriculum, years of experience or academic background), it is clear that engineering and design concepts are not being taught at a high frequency in classes. 42% of respondents said they “rarely” used Engineering and Design when teaching their main biology class (i.e. the class they labelled as their first choice science class), while 16% said they never used these concepts. 35% said they incorporated engineering and design in there classes “sometimes” with only 7% applying them “often and whenever they can”.
As expected, we found that the low frequency of implementation of topics within classes is not down to any moral objections or opposition to the pedagogical approach. We found that respondents viewed engineering and design in biology education favorably. Out of 87 respondents, 84% indicated that they either agree (56%) or strongly agree (28%) with the statement “Teaching biology with embedded Engineering & Design ideas is effective for enhancing student understanding of biological concepts and principles”. Similarly most respondents agreed (55%) or strongly agreed (28%) that Engineering & Design should be integrated into the secondary school biology curricula (n = 87) and in response to the question “I would like to be able to teach my students to understand the use and impact of Design & Engineering in the field of Biology” 54% agreed and 33% strongly agreed. Our findings suggested that educators were experiencing barriers in their professional lives.
We make the tentative conclusions both that teacher training and in-job training is not wholly equipping teachers for the implementation such concepts into their curriculum. For these life science educators who took our survey, 77% of them had never experienced “teaching biology with Engineering & Design” in their formal professional education degree attainment while 81% had never attended any workshop relating to this topic. Interesting, but not surprisingly, out of 88 respondents, well over half either disagreed (42%) or strongly disagreed (17%) about being “confident” in their “abilities to implement engineering and design concepts” into their biology classes. Our survey also more directly seeked to find out what teachers feel inhibits their ability to incorporate more biodesign and engineering into their classes. in agreement with both what Dr. Natalie Kuldell suggested, and with our earlier conclusions, a lack of training opportunities and/ore resources lie at the root of the problem. An overwhelming amount of respondents indicated that there was insufficient training opportunities in biodesign and engineering concepts in biology (37% strongly agreed and 56% agreed that there is a lack of"

The TU Delft IGEM 2015 team aims to offer a reproducible and automated way of forming bacterial biofilms with their 3D Micro(be) Printer. They also want to obtain a cheap and customizable method of creating biofilms for testing purposes. Therefore they engineered bacteria that can be linked to each other through nanowires generating a well-defined biofilm structure.
The similarity between our projects is the formation of a certain structure with bacteria. It is particularly interesting how bacteria can be engineered to form a pattern on their own in a controllable way. If our strains are deposited by the TU Delft Printer, a pattern in three dimensions can be formed.
A wide range of applications could result out of this collaboration, for example artificial bone formation. Recently, people are using a 3D printed implant made of titanium for hip transplantations. Here, the patient’s CT scan is used to design an exact replica of the femoral head. Our project could optimize this design by using bacteria who could form and precipitate calcium. In this way a porous structure similar to bones can be formed. The advantages will be that this could improve “goodness of fit” resulting in less wear effects which makes the risk of having a second hip surgery smaller. If a part of the pattern is formed spontaneously by engineered bacteria, the material costs will be lower and an even more refined structure can be formed.
The TU Delft's 3D Micro(be) Printer could also support the development of other possible applications of our project, e.g. the production of miniature electrical circuits. While being 3D printed, the bacteria deposit conducting materials so that the result is an electrical conducting micro wire.
In our project, cell-cell communication is used to form a certain network. Hereby our cell-cell communication could form an alternative or addition of the formation of specific biofilms with nanowires by the TU Delft team. For example, it could be possible that our cells B are adapted to produce nanowires in a predicted pattern.
So, after comparing our projects, we can conclude that a future collaboration could be beneficial for the both of us, leading to the development of new and more advanced innovations. This proves the need of fundamental research in combination with practical engineering.

Dr. Punyasloke Bhadury
Associate Professor, Biological Sciences, IISER Kolkata
Dr. Punyasloke Bhadury is a scientist who predominantly works on using biological systems to tackle               ocean acidification. We reached out to him as his area of interest was in par with our problem                  statement. It was an amazing opportunity for us to speak to someone with such expertise. He gave us a                   deeper insight into our model. He was enthusiastic about the project and was in favour of using indigenous strains as they have a                  good doubling time and carbon dioxide capture capacity.
He suggested that we also need to look into how the engineered strain will behave at different parts of                   the oceans, like at the coasts and further into the ocean. He also proposed a parallel mechanism that                  can work complementary to our existing system, of using Carbonic Anhydrase. He suggested that              express enzymes that are inherent to micro algae that can increase the efficiency of the whole                construct.
Choosing the suitable system
Jabez Osborne
Assistant professor(senior) - Dept of Biosciences VIT, Vellore
In our initial proposal, we had planned to use PhoBox promoter for sensing the external pH. This                 works using a periplasmic protein PhoR which phosphorylates PhoB that acts as the activator of the                PhoBox promoter leading to translation and expression of the necessary proteins to control the pH.
In our discussion with Dr. Jabez , he asked us to check the activity range of the different proteins                   and promoter system involved in our project at varying factors like pH and temperature. When we did check for it, we found that the promoter is active at pH below 7. But the oceanic pH is around 8.So                      the PhoBox promoter wouldn’t work at that pH. This led to the modification of the idea into its current form.

His insights on safety regulations related to GMOs gave us a clearer picture on why regulation of our                  organism’s mechanism is of high importance. His suggestions led us to think of incorporating our               RecA-LexA system.

Third, cost of handling, 37.6 RMB(CNY) per ton. Fourth, cost of marketing, 25 RNB(CNY) per ton. Fifth, interest of broker, 15.9 RMB(CNY) per ton. Total 368.1 RMB(CNY) per ton.
National policy and related units
Nowadays, one of the main problem is that fund investment from the government is in serious shortage. Currently private investment has excelled 2 billion RMB(CNY) but governmental investment is less than 0.2 billion RMB(CNY). It takes about 10 years to breed potato varieties; yet as the governmental investment in science and technology is rather scarce, this section seems more like a nonprofit research. China launched a subsidy program in 2009, 500 RMB(CNY) for stock seed per 1/15 hectare, 100 RMB(CNY) for first grade stock seed.
The money subsided is less than 1/3 of the cost. What is more, potato varieties degenerates quickly and should be renewed in time. It makes more money using virus-free seeds, about 150-200 RMB(CNY)per 1/15 hectare. Without the subsidy of government, peasantry would not like to buy the virus-free seeds.

Dry Work
Practise Presentation
We prepared an iGEM-style presentation for the afternoon, and presented it for the faculty. The following comments and suggestions were made regarding it:
Pictures need to be close-up of the coloured colonies, with no satilites and with a control for comparison
Slide design should be looked at - in particular the coloured sidebar, which created dead space
Forward rather than a backward explanation (Sensor - threshold - colour) and with a navigation bar (perhaps at the side?) to show the audience where we are in the talk
Ways to characterise the different strains and their effects were discussed, such as using a bar graph with coloured pictures of the cells in the boxes - an effective way to show a large amount of information on one slide.
Testing the threshold. It was suggested that as well as attaching the different threshold levels to different colours, we first attach them all to the same colour as proof they respond to different input levels
The actual physical product should be constructed in a prototype form, such as by using 5-well microscope slides. We were also encouraged to think more about this final product and how we would practically produce it.
BioBrick numbers need to be included
The pigment production requires a little more science background
We also decided not too concentrate on the phzS and phzM pigments, as these have already been made into Biobricks. Instead, we will just concentrate on the proper characterisation of the carotenoid pigments, creating the MelA and Violacein biobricks, and attaching them too the threshold level amplifiers.

We first consulted Dr. Milton Wainwright on his opinions concerning our project. We then interviewed a politics lecturer to gain better understanding of how many stakeholders were involved in this complex matter. Moreover, during the early steps of designing a device prototype, the different end users were explored by approaching hospitals, doctors, patients, and government bodies.

Biobrick assembly and sequence
We succesfully assembled the biobrick K343007 , which consists of the TetR repressible promoter R0040 followed by the ribosome binding site B0034, the coding sequence K343003 and the terminators B0010 and B0012.
This was achieved through ""standard"" silver assembly and confirmed via sequencing with biobrick verification forward 2 (VF2) and verification reverse (VR) primers.
Sequencing results K343007
The sequence obtained from sequencing is identical with the theoretical sequence of the part, except for a silent mutation in the coding sequence, which does not change the amino acid sequence.
Effect
Our results from the experiments with semi-solid agar confirms that the bacteria carrying a plasmid with the biobrick have a altered motility, most likely by an alteration in tumbling frequency, when exposed to blue light compared to the wild type MG1655.
The videomicroscopy indicates that bacteria carrying a plasmid with the biobrick travel father and in a more straight path than the wild type MG1655 when exposed to blue light with a wavelength around 500nm, Thereby suggesting a lowered tubling frequency.
Computeranalysis of videos recorded of swimming baceria containing this part, indicate that these bacteria have a tendency to swim towards the source of light, when exposed to a light gradient. A trackdiagram was constructed from the gathered data, and swimming bacteria tended to orientate their movement in the direction of the light source. This could mean that blue light acts as an attractant stimulus on the SopII-HtrII-Tar complex.
The stability of pSB1C3-K343007 is most likely <20 generations, however the stability of pSB3T5-K343007 was not determined.
Plasmids expressing K343007 does not seem to hinder the bacterial growth in any way.
For further information, raw data and background of the assay see characterization of K343007 .

This year's National iGEM Meet was organized in and by IISER Pune on 15th and 16th July 2017. All the teams presented their work, shared views and looked forward for healthy suggestions and collaborations. Ten teams from India participated physically in the meet and one team (iGEM Peshawar from Pakistan) participated via video conference.
iBEM1.0
This year we also took part in iBEM1.0 (International Biological Engineered Machine) organized by JNU and NIPER Kolkata on March 26th to 28th. There were introductory talks on building standards and inventory of biological components, developing genome engineering tools, technologies and applications, for the neonates. Talks also focused on genome editing applications, logic gates, cell factory and synthetic life. Further, there were discussions on the core concepts, applications, future initiatives, training and employment opportunities, for the best benefit of the emerging synthetic biology community in India."
ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," through greenhouse gases and deforestation, all for the sake of ease of life and financial profit, to cite only one example. While synthetic biology affects a more profound basis of life, the leaders of any scientific revolution must always reflect on the impact that it will leave on the world before declaring that we are living in a brave new world.
Economic Aspects towards Synthetic Biology (NUS)
For some, genetic engineering is akin to playing God. However, to many synthetic biologists and life science researchers, genetic engineering is a key pathway to exploring a plethora of new applications and technologies. Unfortunately, few of such technologies have been successfully commercialised. Yet, for these select few, they are largely disruptive in their own fields.
To illustrate this point is the development of the antimalarial drug, artemisinin. Artemisinin was first extracted from Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, in the 1970s[6]. Since then, global demand for artemisinin has only increased, especially after 2001, when the World Health Organisation identified artemisinin-combination therapies as the recommended first-line treatment for malaria[7]. Yet, the supply of artemisinin remained variable due to the limited cultivation of sweet wormwood, which in turn translated to fluctuating and volatile costs of artemisinin-combination therapies. The vagaries of the artemisinin supply inspired several companies and researchers to set about developing novel alternative methods for the synthetic production of artemisinin to complement plant-derived sources. Sanofi, a Paris-based pharmaceutical company, for example, employed the use of a genetically-engineered yeast that used glucose as a feedstock, to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin[8]. This genetically-engineered yeast was also simultaneously “engineered” by Jay Keasling, a researcher at the University of California (Berkeley), who also developed the chemical pathways necessary for the successful bioproduction of artemisinic acid[9].
The advantage a synthetic biology-approach of artemisinin production provides, such as cheaper and more stable source of artemisinin, is clear. However, the concerns arising over synthetically-produced artemisinin (which manifests as market resistance), such as the monopolistic behaviour of pharmaceutical companies, and the loss of livelihood of the Artemisia farmers, must not be ignored. The balance between novel technologies, and its social and ethical implications must be carefully considered - is synthetic artemisinin really cheaper? How can synthetic biology help the farmers whose livelihoods have been disrupted by a"

iGEM 2010 Notebook
The lab notebook chronicles our journey in the creation of the Genomikon kit.  Many paths were woven together in space and time to reach this finished masterpiece.  To help you navigate through these trials with us we have laid out our notebook in a layered fashion.  This page gives a sketch of each project and how it interacts with each other.  Then follow the links to a projects page for time line of the major landmarks and accomplishments.  If you require more details on the project the links within that page will take you to our day-by-day work log.
Building Parts
The Building Parts project was responsible to first build a plasmid (plasmid 01)that contained our own specialized prefix and suffix nested inside of the standard BioBrick prefix and suffix.  After plasmid 01 existed we inserted the CcdB gene (the ""death"" gene) between our prefix and suffix removing the gene for Kanamycin resistance (plasmid 02).  Plasmid 02 is fantastic base plasmid from which we are able to amplify any part at all because it provides a positive selection marker when transformed into DH5α. At this point we were able to make parts en masse to put in our kit. After obtaining a particular part in a plasmid we PCRed the part and digested it ready to use in Assembly or to Test the plasmid.
Testing Parts
Before we were able to test parts we created 2 base testing plasmids (vector 01 and vector 02).  Vector 01 is designed to test Open Reading Frame parts, or parts that code for proteins.   The part is fl"

Amalia Ephrat – MSc student in Educational studies
Amalia Ephrat is a MSc student in Educational studies at Leiden, she did a short stage/internship focused on collaborative learning activities between students with an international background within the learning context of the university.
When students of diverse backgrounds participate in a project where collaborative learning is important, the individual differences can pose a series of challenges to the group processes. This is a well- known challenge for many Dutch universities, which makes it a relevant topic for educational research to investigate the means for intervention and the effects of those interventions on collaborative learning processes and outcomes.  Her plan is to improve collaborative learning amongst students of different backgrounds, by designing research and conduct measurement during the brainstorming phase of the project. Research shall consist of qualitative exploratory methods using observational methods and interviews and quantitative research using several questionnaires, including collaborative skills, empathy and intercultural conflict management.  The main focus of her research is the collaborative process in the iGem group and the efficacy of the interventions of the supervisors to support the collaborative process in a culturally diverse group of students.

Kent
For our Interlab studies, we asked the Kent iGEM team to help us out because we do not have the equipment to accurately obtain the necessary readings. Laulwa Al Salloum, Dan Brunkow and Laurens Heling from the Kent team offered us a lab to work in as well helping and mentoring Mateo Hoare and Nikita Shukan from the Judd_UK iGEM team with the new equipment including using Gilson Pipettes and a plate reader. The Kent team were unsuccessful in transforming the DNA provided by iGEM into competent E. coli DH5 alpha and, so, as part of a collaborations effort, we offered our Interlab DNA (Distribution Kit Plate 6) for them to work with.

We met with CLSB to discuss wiki development and modelling. They gave us a lot of help and advice for the wiki, including what languages it would be useful to learn, and some general advice about iGEM, such as the standard page names, uploading files, and how much time we should expect to spend on the wiki. For the modelling, they introduced the team to ordinary differential equations and how they can be used to represent a series of reactions. They also gave advice during the process, checking over our analytical solutions, as well as our numerical methods in Matlab.
The CLSB team came to us to test their software. Their software was a lab assistant with voice commands to read out part information and protocols. We tested their software, and suggested adding a team lookup feature, the ability to repeat a step (as opposed to just next and back) and a skip command to jump to a particular step in a protocol. They implemented the first two we suggested, but found the last one wouldn't be feasible, as it caused conflicts with their part lookup feature.
We also tested their hardware- a combined densitometer and fluorometer and suggested a few improvements. Firstly, we noticed that their readings were being slightly skewed by additional light entering the device from the environment because their light sensor was being secured by electrical tape so we suggested blue tac, which overcame this problem."

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html," ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is to indicate that its child is the last binding site in this tree, and it binds to nothing any more.
In the reactions of promoter repression and activation, the promoter is repressed or activated after binding with repressor or inducer. So its properties are changed, and it is not the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Developing a Project Idea
After assembling our team, we spent the first two months in brainstorming sessions, researching potential topics for this year’s competition. A team member presented us the field of bionic prosthesis, and we were all shocked by the number of people who were suffering from an amputation. His first idea was to use the capacity of bacteria to drive an electrical current to amplify the signal between the patient’s nerves and electrical sensors linked to a prosthesis. This way, redirection of nerves wouldn’t be necessary and the patient would be able to accomplish more natural actions.
When we started to look more in details the field of prosthesis and implant, we realized that along with device loosening or malfunctions and foreign-material reactions, infection remains the most serious problems encountered with surgical implants. We quickly learned that biofilm formation is common to all types of implanted foreign-body infections. Indeed, the high susceptibility of implanted devices to infection is due to a locally acquired host defense deficiency. Thus, this persistence at a specific site is mainly because of the rapid formation of a biofilm, which is resistant to host defense and antimicrobial agents as a result of reduced access and diffusion characteristics within it. We then decided to integrate this aspect inside our project: while favoring the growth of the nerve and the conduction of a signal through a bacterial interface, we could also diminish the risk of infection. At first, we wanted to find a system to directly kill the S. aureus, but after talking with Dr. Jean-Marc Ghigo (Genetics of Biofilm Unit, Institut Pasteur), we realized that the biofilm configuration would give us some hard time and require extra steps to manipulate. We decided to shift our goal, and rather than killing S. aureus, we would limit the vir"

Harvard,2017,Team:Harvard#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," protein aggregation, we expected that increasing the expression level of csgC would decrease the concentration of intracellular fibers, and in turn, increase the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fibers. However, the model predicts that relatively low and high expression levels are optimal for curli production. Further experiments must be conducted to determine the accuracy with which the model predicts cellular behavior when the expression level of csgC is varied.
csgE
As the role of csgE in the curli pathway has not been fully elucidated, we were not able to make any intuitive predictions about the effect of varying csgE on the accumulation of fibers, the model predicts that the optimal expression level is slightly above midlevel expression levels. Further experiments must be conducted to determine the accuracy with which the model predicts cellular behavior when the expression level of csgE is varied.
csgF
Like with csgE, the role of csgF in the curli pathway has not been fully investigated, so we were not able to make any intuitive predictions about the effect of varying csgF on the accumulation of fibers. The model also does not predict any noticeable pattern in the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fibers when the expression level of csgF is modulated. This may be a result of the incomplete information that we incorporated into the model, so further experiments must be conducted to determine the true relationship between expression level of csgF and curli production.
csgG
The model again does not predict any noticeable pattern in the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fibers when the expression level of csgG is modified. Since csgG is a membrane protein responsible for exporting csgA monomers out of the cell, we intuitively expected that increasing the expression level of csgG would increase the concentration of extracellular fibers and decrease the concentration of intracellular fibers, resulting in a net increase in the ratio between the two. This is the protein that we chose to investigate further in the genetic engineering aspect of our project. Check out our results to learn more!
You can also explore the code we used to simulate our model here .
Discussion
As with any model, it is important for us to reassess the assumptions upon which our model is founded, analyze how they could affect the results predicted by our model, and explore ways in which the predictive accuracy of the model could be improved. One such area is the kinetic parameters used in our model. Many of the parameters used to specify the rate constants of the various molecular interactions were drawn from analogous systems or interactions, as parameters specific to interactions between curli proteins are currently unavailable"
Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#Synergy_-_-_TEXT.html," even at low concentrations to completely abolish growth.
As identified by the growth assay, the glycine knockout is not capable of completely preventing growth of the strain even at very low concentrations of glycine.  This identifies that it is important to continue to use our kill switch mechanism in combination with the auxotroph to control the cells.  Now, with the concentrations ideal for glycine growth determined, we transformed our rhamnose inducible killswitch construct containing S7 ( BBa_K902084 ) into our glycine knockout strain and attempted to characterize cell death over a variety of conditions.
Testing the Auxotrophic Marker as a Kill Switch
To test if using the glyA knockout strain in conjunction with our kill switch was effective, we transformed our Prha-S7 construct into the knockout strain as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: pRHA-S7 construct demonstrating our kill switch in TOP10 wild type cells and glyA knockout cells.  This demonstrates that our system is capable of being induced by the sugar rhamnose and repressed in the presence of glucose.  There is no growth in rhamnose with our system as the RhaBAD operon has been deleted in the knockout strain we are using.
This data suggests that our killswitch system can act synergistically with the glycine auxotroph.  In the prescence of glucose you see growth of both TOP10 and glyA knockout cells showing that our system is repressed.  There is less growth in our glycine knockout as there was not a significant amount of glycine used in the media.  The TOP10 control cell line did not show growth over 24 hours which was likely due to error in the read.  In the presence of rhamnose, the kill switch is capable of being induced in both TOP10 and glycine knockout strains as shown by the decrease in CFU counts.  This demonstrates a functional kill switch mechanism with the Prha promoter and auxotroph.
Putting FRED together
Can we sense toxins?
Now that we’ve been able to show that we can indeed sense three compounds electrochemically and simultaneously using our hydrolase system, and characterized genetic circuits for two of these outputs, our next goal was to actually try to sense toxins. Despite the fact that we have encountered significant difficulty in trying to sequence our transposon clones, given that we designed our transposon library to use lacZ, we could actually use our transposon directly in our electrochemical reporter system without actually knowing the identity of the sensory element.  Although we do plan to BioBrick"

The lane with primers only did not yield any band, which suggests the non-specific band is not a primer-dimer.  Upon referring back to the hetero-dimer analysis from IDT, there are a few candidate hetero-dimers that fit the observed size, but nothing conclusively indicates what it is.
Gel Extraction: Danny suggested to try a gel extraction since only a small amount will be needed.  This was done with Nithin (see his notes).
Conclusions:
Tomorrow will be used to PCR the iGEM suffix into the construct, as well as plan for the downstream ligation reactions, and transformation.

Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR P39K mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM).

Procedure:
4-Iodo-1-nitrobenzene (4,06 g; 16,3 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL 2-methoxyethanol. Zn           dust (2,53 g; 35,7 mmol) and NH4Cl (1,43 g; 26,7 mmol) was added and the reaction           mixture was stirred at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by TLC (5:1           hexanes/EtOAc). After 30 minutes the solution was cooled to 0°C. FeCl3 × 6 H2O (12,98 g;           48,0 mmol) was solved in 72 mL H2O/EtOH (5:1) and added to the reaction mixture which           then was stirred 3 hours at 0°C. Following the reaction mixture was extracted with EtOAc,           washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The yielded solution was concentrated under           reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc, 50:1).           The solvent was removed and the product 4-iodo-1-nitrosobenzene (1,2 g; 5,2 mmol; 32%)           was received as a green solid.

The RhlI with amilGFP reporter cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015-J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015) was derived from the RhlI expression cassette (B0032-C0070-B0015) and the amilGFP cassette (J23100-B0032-K592010-B0015) as the blue chromoprotein was not usable for fluorescence detection.

Assessing our project
Risk Assessment
We promise:
Our database is based on the IGEM official database which is opened for everyone, and our own database doesn’t come down to the tort.
The idea and software are original works, we never copy others work.
Feasibility Assessment
Why our software so competitive:
Our project reforms the database which is provided by the IGEM official website.
The algorithm is associated with the latest paper and the former experience. And it has been associated with lots of lab testification.
We did the User Survey (From the amateurs to the Professors)for three times to make sure the satisfaction and convenience of our project.
All the icon on UI is designed by ourselves from a researcher view, thus our project is more competitive than others.
End-User Considerations
Our software is aimed to the IGEMers and all the researchers who are interested in the synthetic biology.
It’s free
Web application
UI is designed user-friendly
Social Justice
We considered the underlying risk our project will have on the society. Especially the social justice.
Helping the Practice of Science and Engineering
Law and Regulation
During the scientific research  and normal life, we all need to follow the law which ensure our safety and human rights.  As a new field in science and tecnology, Synthetic Biology is full of challenage not only in academic research, but also for law and regulation.
Safety and Security
People in China started to realize the importance of the safety of bioengineering and synthetic biology these years.
Moreover, people mostly concern that synthetic biology could create artifical life which will break down moral principles and ethics. The terrorists could use scientific researching results to develop biology weapons or destory the environment. In a interview, the Professor Pei gave his answer to it, he says,because the current research is in the early stages of development, scientists didn't have a lot of freedom to follow their ideas to manipulate the genome. Though small, potential biological safety problems cannot be ruled out.
I think the management of synthetic biology should keep a constant update. What’s more, the supervisory authority shall regulate their management and monitoring standards timely according to the technical development in this field. We need to absorb the lessons of GM research, timely communicate with the public so that they can better understand the techniques used in this research.
User survey
We did the User Survey to ensure our UI to be more user-freindly, our algorithm to be  more veracity; our software to be more comlepeted.
