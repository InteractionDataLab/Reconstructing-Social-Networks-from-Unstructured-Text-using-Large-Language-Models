Finally, high purity Chitosan is ideal for wound healing and hemostasis, bio surgery and ophthalmology, scaffold and cell therapy, and drug delivery and vaccines (Global Industry Analysts , 2012).
According to Global Industry Analysts in “Chitin & Chitosan: A Global Strategic Business Report,” the market size in US is 17% for high purity Chitosan and 75% for low and medium purity Chitosan (Global Industry Analysts , 2012).
Economic of production
Production of Chitosan is almost 30 years old. Professor George A.F. Roberts, in his article: Thirty years of progress in chitin and chitosan, exposes an analysis of how the production process of this natural fiber has been changing and improving as years go by. The conventional industrial process that has been used for 3 decades consists in using particular chemical substances to treat chitin (Roberts, 2008).
Traditionally, HCl and NaOH are important supplies for the demineralization and the deproteinization processes that chitin undergoes to become Chitosan. Each liter of these substances has an average cost of 5 MXN (.38 USD) and 200 MXN (15 USD) respectively. According to Professor Roberts, industrial plants usually produce close to 500 tons of Chitosan at an average cost of 11.50 USD (149.5 MXN), assuming raw material (shellfish waste) is available at a very low or even cero cost. This calculation does not include transportation costs and it is suggested by the author that considering them would double the price (23 USD/300 MXN). Additionally, eliminating HCL and NaOH decreases production costs in any plant, given that regulations in many countries require companies to treat the water derived from its operations (Roberts, 2008).
Taking chemicals out of the equation would lower costs of production considerably. Biophrame proposed biological process requires molasses and whey (milk serum), which are both wastes from other industrial processes and sold for 2.5 MXN/0.19 USD per Kg and 0.39 MXN/0.03 USD per Lt, respectively. The industrial waste produced from this biological process would be high amounts of protein, biomase and calcium, which are both biodegradable and can even be treated and sold. Developing an enzyme-based method for converting chitin in Chitosan has obvious attractions such as environmental friend"

The digested fragment was ligated into pBSIIK and transformed into DH5α. Positive white colonies growing on Xgal-LB agar plates were checked for the presence of TraI with the following colony PCR protocol (PTraI oligo on parts page): 93° 5' | 25x(95° 30"" | 65° 30"" | 72° 40"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ The PCR amplification was checked on gel electrophoresis, and the positive colonies selected for sequencing. When the sequencing was completed, we analyzed and selected the mutation-free samples.
TraI was digested with EcoRI/SpeI in order to ligate it in ahead of the terminator, previously digested with EcoRI/XbaI. The ligated product was transformed into cells and the resulting colonies were checked with a colony PCR (prmers: vf2 and vr): 93° 5' | 25x(95° 30"" | 50° 30"" | 72° 60"") | 72° 7' | 4° ∞ The positive colonies were expanded and their plasmids extracted.
The TraI-Terminator fragment was isolated with a XbaI/PstI digestion, and then ligated into the previously linearized plasmid containing the PromLasI-RBS. We thus transformed DH5α and subsequently performed a colony PCR with the same protocol used before, in order to expand the positive colonies and extract the plasmids. The completed BioBrick was checked through an EcoRI/PstI digestion and sequencing. The digested fragment of B3 was of the appropriate length (937 bp), as confirmed with gel electrophoresis (see figure below).

This plasmid hosts an OC12 AHL inducible promoter: LasI (BBa_R0079). Once OC8 AHL binds the LasR trans-activator (BBa_C0179) the cellobiosidase transcription is activated thus the bacteria itself can transform the cellobiose in glucose and use it as a source of energy.

This system makes it possible to amplify the measurement for this particular action potential. Whereas, for another action potential having a different speed or direction of propagation, the amplification will not take place because the delay implemented in the system does not correspond to the delay due to the propagation of the action potential. This system is therefore selective for a given propagation speed.

3. Spatial selectivity [8]:
Methods aim to increase the spatial selectivity of extra-neural electrodes to discriminate active fascicles, in order to determine the activity of each nerve branch.
One way to increase the spatial selectivity is to increase the number of measurement points. The issue is to separate the sources. In this context, in order to increase the spatial selectivity of the extra-neural electrodes, the multipolar cuffs or FINE electrode have been designed. These structures make it possible to increase the number of contacts, thus the number of measured signals.
Another way is to use algorithms. Blind source separation techniques are able to decompose fascicular signals from FINE electrodes. Several other methods have been described in the literature. They aim to localize or separate nerve trunk signals. For instance, Neurofuzzy algorithms use an artificial neural network.
We can also mention the method based on antenna array beamforming. This seems to be one of the most advanced methods to distinguish fascicular activity inside a nerve. It would be possible to distinguish up to five active fascicles at the same time.
IV. An example of the development of a multi-channel acquisition device [9]
Olivier Rossel, in his thesis, chose to work on improving the selectivity of the cuff electrodes. He chose this type of electrode because they respect the integrity of the nerve and its fascicles membranes and that they make it possible to limit both the number of implants and the complexity surgical gesture. The electrode need reject the EMG signals and to measure local ENGs at multiple sites around the nerve.
In this part, all the results use the electrical models of the nerve developed in the previous part.
1. Tripolar electrode
As we saw previously, it is possible to reject the EMG signal by using a tripolar cuff electrode (Cf. Figure 6). A tripolar cuff and the adapted electrical treatment is used.

This week we aimed to improve our HPLC methods further in order to separate peaks of L-DOPA and Dopamine as well as L-Tyrosine and L-Tyramine. To achieve this we used 95% H2O and 5% ACN which unfortunately did now allow for more refined separation of our compounds
We developed a method using methanol as a solvent instead of ACN with a 95/5 ratio which lead to clear separation of L-DOPA from Dopamine as well as L-Tyrosine from L-Tyramine
Analysis of AADC cell pellets was conducted using SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of the enzyme in the sample. Cells were spun down at 13.2 rpm for 15 minutes and denatured with Laemmli buffer and then boiled for 5 minutes. Samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer (1:10, 1:8, 1:6, 1:4, 1:2 respectively) to allow for improved visualisation. The SDS-PAGE was run at 250 volts for 30 minutes.
As the band could not be clearly identified it was decided to perform a western blot to confirm the presence of AADC in the sample (Fig. 2).

Due to some delay in the gene fragment synthesis, finally our last gBlock cepI arrived. We cloned it into the pJET vector with blunt-end ligation. It was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 for plasmid amplification.
The two resulting clones (M1 and M2) were plated for plasmid preparations. The obtained DNA was cut for an analyzing gel using PstI and NotI. The bands fit the expected size of around 900 bp (Fig. 1) and were sent for sequencing.
The sequencing results showed that one of the clones (M1) contained no mutations.
The remaining plasmid preparation of M1 was cut with NotI and SpeI for overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) and purified on a preparative gel.

ADOPE
The aim of ADOPE is to develop a complete method for gene doping detection. The final method consists of four main steps: sample preparation, prescreening, targeted library preparation and DNA sequencing and analysis.
Figure 1. A flow diagram of our detection method ADOPE. With the four steps sample preparation, prescreening, library preparation and sequencing.
1. Sample Preparation
In the sample preparation module we developed a workflow to extract the target DNA from blood. As a proof of concept, we verified the extraction of the cell free DNA (cfDNA) from bovine serum. Finally, we successfully extracted gene doping DNA that we spiked to the serum, guided by the concentration value generated by the gene doping model.
1.1 Gene Doping Model: Understanding Gene Doping
Design: We modeled the process of infection and degradation of gene doping DNA in blood to determine its concentration overtime. We use this model to provide approximate sensitivity requirement for DNA extraction.
Results and interpretation: Based on our model , we determined microdosing was the best doping method for doping athletes, as it avoids high EPO fluctuation, and hence avoids detection through the biological passport. Figure 2 displays the predicted amount of doping DNA fragments in the blood over time as a result of intramuscular (IM) injection every 20 days. Based"

√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

Animal Model and Human Study (2000s)
Gradually. people realized the defects of the chemical methods, and began to detect                         antioxidants through animal model and human study which has higher biological relevance and                         credibility, after all the 21st century is a century for life science. Unfortunately, animal                         model and human study are time-consuming and expensive so that the initial antioxidants detect                         is not suitable. There's no doubt that cell-based detect is faster and cost-effective.
That's also the reason why we design cell-based detect system.
Cell-Based Method (CAA) (2007)
In 2007, Cell-based detection was first reported in the literature (CAA assay), which was a                         breakthrough in the history of antioxidants detection methods and was referenced widely. CAA                         assay characterizes the consumption of antioxidants on synthetic ROS (ABAP for Peroxyl                         Radicals) after entering cells by the fluorescence intensity of DCFH-DA fluorescent probes.                         Regretfully, it also has some shortcoming.
● On the one hand, both fluorescent probes and free radicals are artificially added from                             the external environment, which means introducing exogenous interference and it is not a                             completely endogenous cell detection.
● On the other hand, the credibility of the DCFH-DA probe has been criticized in the                             literature and it is also a question whether the synthesized radicals (ABAP for Peroxyl                             Radicals) can represent the endogenous ROS accumulated in cells.
To address these problems,
we need to consider the                     following things:
● On the one hand, in the system we designed the detection process needs to be completely                             intracellular without introducing exogenous interference.
● On the other hand, the signal we detect need to be representative of intracellular ROS.                             And we choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal.
Why do we choose intracellular H2O2?
We choose intracellular H2O2 as the final signal to represent all kinds                         of ROS in cell and for                         this case our output component roGFP2-Orp1 has high H2O2-specificity.                         Why?
● Most intracellular ROS comes from mitochondria respiratory chain and all kinds of ROS                             will convert into H2O2 under the intracellular antioxidant enzyme                             system. Once H2O2 accumulated, it will transfer to the cytoplasm.
● H2O2 is the final form of all kinds of ROS.
● roGFP2-Orp1 exists in"

The fluorescence scan proves the successful labeling of Sup35 with Cy3 and Cy5. However, in the SDS page a second higher band appears, that seemed to be labeled too. One explanation would be that Sup35 forms aggregates in the labeling reaction. If the test protein is changed to its prionic form it would not be suitable for a prion detection assay. To investigate if Sup35 forms aggregates after the labeling reaction we wanted to check, if there are any aggregates through atomic force microscopy (AFM). If there are any prion forming ability, the proteins should form big aggregates like reported by iGEM Kent 2015 , who wanted to form nanowires out of Sup35. The AFM images were generated in the Experimental Biophysics & Applied Nanosciences research group from Bielefeld university, Department of Physics with a MultiMode® AFM (Bruker) in tapping mode. The images from the unlabeled and labeled Sup35 are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the unlabeled Sup35 (left) and the labeled Sup35 (right). The AFM images were generated in the Experimental Biophysics & Applied Nanosciences research group from Bielefeld university, Department of Physics with an MultiMode® AFM (Bruker) in tapping mode.
The AFM pictures of Sup35 (Figure 6) show no form of aggregated or denaturized proteins, thus our labeling tool is suitable for the specific labeling of protein without changing their conformation. For the further development of the assay, the labeling and washing method needs to be improved regarding the remaining free dye in the samples after the labeling reactions to get an evaluable FRET signal.

Green Survey
We conducted a green survey via a set of questions and collated data from the responses we got   from various countries. The countries that participated include India, France, Sweden, Costa Rica,   Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Taiwan, Slovenia, Hong Kong, Brazil, Panama, Honduras, Mexico,   Spain, Egypt, Chile and Bulgaria. The total number of responses came out to be 119.   This survey highlighted many aspects that need to be taken care of if we wish to make people   participate in mitigating the effects or controlling further pollution:
58.8 % of the population does experience the effects of pollution in their everyday life. This   includes problems becoming very common like respiratory problems and affects in vision   to be counted as a few among them. This points towards the fact that people do realize   the problems associated with pollution and this would help in motivating them to work   towards it.
32.8 % responses were received for either they do not know about ""Reduce, Reuse and   Recycle"" or they know but do not practice. This calls for requirement of awareness!
Among all the people that participated in the survey, 39.8 % never make use of the public   transport. This is due to many reasons including poor transport facilities, using personal   vehicles as a symbol of status, lack of awareness about advantages of car pool system etc.   The number of personal vehicles increase the carbon-footprint many folds contributing   heavily to not only pollution but also to the"

Dr. John Parkinson aka The Dragon in the Dragon's Den
Graduated from the University of Bath with a bachelor of science in Applied Biology in 1990. After receiving a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Manchester in 1995, I completed a NATO fellowship at the University of Manitoba. From 1997 to 2000, I was awarded a fellowship at the Edinburgh Centre for Protein Technology, University of Edinburgh and from 2000 to 2003 completed another fellowship at the University of Edinburgh on Nematode genomics. I am currently a scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.  The research in our laboratory is aimed at understanding how molecular information can give rise to complex biological behaviour. Using computational methods, we study the organization and dynamics of cellular components within the context of integrated biological systems. Comparative genomics methods are also being applied to provide insights into how these systems may have evolved from the remote origins of life.
Graham Cromar
Graham Cromar aka The Wizard of Id
I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  At various times in the past I have studied cell and molecular biology (B.Sc. Toronto), molecular biology and genetics (M.Sc. Guelph), computer programming and systems analysis (dip. Inst. Computer Studies, Toronto), bioinformatics (cert. Canadian Genetic Disease Network) and, systems and matrix biology (present).  I have worked as a lab technician, teaching assistant, computer programmer/systems analyst and IS manager.  But, what I would most like to do is what I wrote in my high school yearbook about 20 years ago... Design organisms for export to far away galaxies. "

Second experiment
The printer still had the same speed of 1 rpm. The rate of the syringe pump was equal to 0.5 mL/min and a volume of 0.5 mL. This results in the formation of an interconnected strut, that was much larger than droplet (0.3-5 cm in length, 0.2-0.5 cm in height).
Preparation of new CaCl2 (0.1M) solution
CaCl2 has a molecular weight of 110.984 g/mole. So, for the preparation of 50 mL, 0.555 grams of CaCl2 was required.
Recommendation: try to put CaCl2 in a petri dish and print the alginate on top. Problem with this: the K’NEX hole is too big, which results in large droplets. Solution for this could be to put the needle closer to the petri dish.
August

IT turns out that the tubes are just as useful to extrude alginate as needles, but more flexible when actually touching the surface. The thinnest tubing does not pose too much resistance and can still extrude alginate. Paper soaked with CaCl2 seems to be a practical surface, as the alginate sticks to it rather than the needle and thus a continuous line rather than a blob is formed. The extrusion so far has been performed by hand, but the relative rate was kept rather low.
Experiments in planning
Identify good flow rate for the new tubing system on agar plates covered with a thin layer of CaCl2.
An agar plate was soaked with 1 mL of 0.1 M CaCl2 and it was nicely spread using a plating hockey stick.
- 0.2 mL/min is of good order of magnitude for extrusion
- gelatinization was found to be sufficient to create a stable gel
- a second layer was printed and formed a gel, a bit wider than the first layer however
- Four layers still formed one stable gel without any further addition of CaCl2 than the initial one.

File:TabbedGif.gif
PS GUI as of 6/20/2011
Major tabbedpane-GUI design changes implemented. Opening, running, saving are now fully-functional and successfully tested. The only feature missing at this point is the ever-so-important close tab and close tab button; these will be implemented shortly.
The new GUI now features functional tabs.  Each tab has its own Python-editor, but every tab currently shares the same status window.  The tabs feature generic names sporting descriptive text that highlights how they were created, etc.  They also will reflect the name of their associated file if it was a tab generated from the opening of a file or the saving of a tab.
All of the running-functions have been modified to support the new tabbedpane features, as well as the Puppeteer code-generation.  When a user imports a collection, the status window reflects the text-based version of the import and stores the string in an internal field.  When they choose to generate Puppeteer code, it opens a new tab with the parsed Puppeteer code already generated.  Ideally this should allow a user to freely edit code and multiple files as well as freely manage Puppeteer code.

PS GUI as of 6/21/2011
Rather lengthy inter-team meeting with both Computational and Wetlab components discussed, so there wasn't too much time to work on features and improve on them.  However, I was able to get the ""close"" feature working for the tabbedpane view.  Therefore anyone can freely create and close out new tabs.  The run/save features should still be functional for each respective tab; only the open and new features were modified/implemented correctly.

BU Collaborative Meeting #1
Give a summary of what I am doing
I am currently working on the development of a tool called PuppetShow.  Initially, it was designed to be a simple Python-editing tool that would assist those working with Puppeteer scripts (which are produced through Python scripts).  Since then, it has evolved into a tool that combines several features into one application.  For now, it allows the user to freely create/open/save Python scripts and execute them with the appropriate output and error streams.  It also allows the user to import a database"

This second visit gave timelapse evidence that the HEK293 cells were surviving and beginning to multiply in the chip as highlighted below. The visit again sparked new approaches to trapping cells to be tested at a later date. Unfortunately, this visit occurred towards the end of iGEM, and further experiments will be conducted outside of iGEM. However, this visit provided definitive proof of mammalians cells surviving and dividing inside our low-cost, facilitated design microfluidic workflow.

Designing a Device to Characterize Starvation-Based Genetic Part
AUG - SEPT 2016 | A collaboration with the Northeastern 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team
We designed a microfluidic device for Northeastern University's iGEM team to help characterize their starvation-induced genetic part, by flowing cells through a set of cell traps placed after a gradient generator, then flowing two variable amounts of nutrients through the inputs of the gradient generator, causing a variable amount of nutrients to hit each cell trap, and cause a variable expression level of the starvation-linked fluorescence. Unfortunately, due to difficulties on both sides, the device and the cells to put through it were never realized. The preliminary sketches and designs are shown here, however.
Open Source Materials and Synthetic Biology
Open source materials encourage a cooperative and connected community in any field of research. It allows individuals and labs to easily share their ideas for others to build off of and can inspire even greater creations. So we teamed up with the BU 2016 iGEM Wetlab Team to investigate the current place of open source materials in Synthetic biology and how, moving forward, open source materials could impact the direction of the field. We recorded our findings biweekly through posts in a collaborative blog entitled ""Who Owns What"".

Teaching
Giving students an insight to the controversial questions within synthetic biology and its many perks as well as creating a platform to connect all sorts of students in an international setting
In May 2016 we first reached out to a group of high school students ranging between the ages of 15 and 18, who had all undertaken biology as part of their A level education. The concept of iGEM had already been introduced into their curriculum through an extended exam question based on a scientific article discussing synthetic biology, iGEM and the use of standard biological parts, so we took the opportunity to expand on these principles and help students apply them to a host of real life situations.
The overall aim was to inspire students with an innate interest in biology (just like us) to pursue these new ideas in more depth and possibly be influenced into studying these even further as they progress through their education. Naturally we also aimed to make the project interesting, thought provoking, collaborative and fun!
Following a positive response from both teachers and pupils about becoming involved in our project, we developed an online educational programme composed of case studies , which was accessible through our main website.
Details regarding the construction of this programme and interaction with the students can be found on our Public Engagement and Education page.

Evolving - Stockholm Makerspace
To be a part of a bigger movement amongst the Biohacker community
Our initial interaction with Biohackers was during the first Bio-Makers conference in Sweden; an event hosted by and for bio-makers, bio-hackers and DIY-biologists with the aim to share inspirational stories and practical hacks and protocols from the international biohacker movement. These were the themes of the conference: Lab, health, cyborg and community, which coincided with our project, providing a great occasion with an enthusiastic crowd for presenting our work. We seized this opportunity and enrolled the team to participate, by submitting an abstract of our project plan for the iGEM Competition. We were granted a space for our poster workshop presentation in their conference, to convey our ideas and discuss the critical health issue we proposed to tackle.
What is a Makerspace?
A Makerspace (also called hackspace / fab lab) is a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

How did we choose our reporter gene?
To achieve the best measurement of our oscillating system, we chose two different kinds of reporter gene as our downstream reporter, fluorescent protein gene and luciferase gene,  which are both widely used in the biotechnological labs.
Fluorescent protein
In search for the part kit provided by the iGEM headquarter, we found several available fluorescent proteins. Under the instruction of our fluorescent protein judging model , we finally chose mCherry and EYFP as our fluorescent protein reporter.

Luciferase
Luciferase is a popular choice as a reporter for gene expression because functional enzyme is created immediately upon translation and the assay is rapid, reliable and easy to perform. [1,2] The fluorescent output of luciferase gene is due to the chemical reaction between luciferase and corresponding substrate, which can be easily detected by the luminoskan microplate reader.
We used firefly luciferase(Fluc) gene purchased from Promega and Nanoluc luciferase(Nluc)  gene submitted by Team Tuebingen 2015 as another two reporters for our KaiABC system.

ChromAutoGrapher Team „VCS Practice“ has designed an application which automatically processes documents including the data of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This application automatically generates standardised protocols for given HPLC assays by converting selected files from pdf to text format, as well as calculating Average value, Standard Deviation and Covariation (COV).
Data labelling game
While creating this application, an idea of designing a game was chosen intentionally by team BPTI_import_TeamName. Scientists (“gamers”) can choose to open, for example, blood sample images and analyse blood cells there. As a result, the more certain findings they label there, the higher level is reached in this game. Also, all information about labelled findings is saved and used in order to enable the programme identify them itself.

Snake Bites
The CDC has reported that about 8,000 snake bites occur in the U.S. every year. Many of the snakes are known to not be harmless. The snake bites can cause an allergic reaction or an infection. Both are known to cause serious problems for patients. It is imperative for victims to get to the nearest emergency as soon as possible. Unfortunately, many snake bites happen during activites like, camping, hiking or woodsy areas.  For many residents who are not inside of the metropolitan area, have to get transported to facilities that are not very close in proximity. Sometimes victims may have to travel 45 minutes to an hour to get to a hospital. This can cause"

BGIC-Union,2017,Team:BGIC-Union#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 is equal to negative infinity, revealed as no signal emitted even if EML4-ALK fusion gene exists.   Based on the modeling, in order to gain valid result of the presence and concentration of EML4-ALK fusion gene, amplifying the concentration of EML4-ALK fusion gene is necessary. By employing the Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA) (Figure 1), the concentration of EML4-ALK fusion gene increases at an exponential rate (Figure 2) . Within eight rounds, the concentration of EML4-ALK approaches to a detectable value. Therefore, it is proved that NASBA is a necessary and effective signal amplification approach before detection.
Determining the upper limit of target DNA concentration:
We decide to determine whether there is an upper limit of the target DNA concentration for split-T7-dcas9 system, since it is hypothesized that the effective concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 will decrease after the concentration of the target DNA reaches an upper limit; since the increase in potential binding sites increases the probability of one DNA molecule bears only one protein (Figure 3). The upper limit is the optimal point for the highest activity of the detection device.
To determine the optimal point for detection, the concentration of NT7-dcas9, the concentration of CT7-dcas9, and their fraction of binding with DNA are considered. The formula for the optimal point is established as:
2 × [DNAoptimal] = [NT7 total] × θN + [CT7 total] × θC,
where [DNAoptimal] represents the optimal concentration of DNA for detection system.    In the situation that the concentration of DNA is lower than the optimal concentration, the concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 binding with the DNA increases linearly as the concentration of target DNA increases. The change in effective concentration of NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 are represented in the formula below:
When the concentration of target DNA is really low, the dissociation between the DNA and the proteins almost does not occur, therefore, the dissociation constant is negligible. However, after the concentration of DNA reaches a tipping point, the dissociation becomes prominent, thus, θ is considered and the value of the slope decreases by θ. After the concentration reaches the optimal concentration for detection, the probability of one DNA molecule bearing both NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 and enabling transcription of report gene decreases as the concentration continually increases"

1.1.1 Experimental purpose
 Our project aims to achieve fast detection of biomarks on the chip, and we need to use E.coil in the detection process.That means we need verify whether the affinity of E. coil with our chip can meet our requirements. And we designed an experiment to cultivate E. coil to verify this problem.
1.1.2 Method
 First, we selected E.coli that was imported into BBa_K876070 plasmid as the strain of the experiment.Second,we cleaned the chip with anhydrous ethanol and PBS as preprocessing, to make the chip environment more conducive to microbial growth.Third,we injected E. coli into chamber II, put the chip in 37 degree incubator, and measured its OD:600 every two hours, and last draw its growth curve.
1.1.3 Experimental results
 According to the growth curve (Figure 1.5.1)of E. Coli inside Microfluidic chip, the growth of E. coil was somewhat inhibited. But in the short time, the inhibition is weak. And our project aimed at detecting quickly, so the affinity of E. coil with our chip can meet our projects’ requirements.  By analyzing the process and principles of the experiment, we think maybe the hypoxic environment in the chip inhibits the growth of E. coil in the chip. So, we used the PCR tube filled with E. coli bacteria to simulate the chip inside environment and re-measured the growth curve of E. Coli inside Microfluidic chip(Figure 1.5.2). Comparing these two similarities growth curves, we basically confirm the hypoxic environment inhibits the growth of E. coil in the chip.
 
1.1.4Discussion
 To improve the hypoxic environment in the chip, let the strain of the experiment grow better, we have some ideas. And we are still studying it, here to discuss with you.
  ①: Transform microchip structure
Leave some vent hole on one side of the chamber, adhere a pellicle which has good air permeability and waterproofness. This will help chamber take gas exchange with air, and solve the hypoxic problem.
  ②: Add oxygen carrier
Process microchip with some oxygen carrier like hemoglobin, some of them will remain in the inner surface of chamber. They will release some oxgyen when the environment is hypoic. But we don’t know how much oxgyen they will release and whether oxygen carrier will influence E. coil. So, there still"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," to use in both the CRISPRi and asRNA approaches. Another key finding of the promoter work was that one of the new parts we added to the registry exhibited expression levels three times higher than the positive control which was supplied to teams participating in the 2018 iGEM InterLab studies. This result surprised us since this promoter is native to
Clostridium acetobutylicum where it controls the expression of a gene encoding thiolase. The promoter was named PCac_thl and has the part number Bba_K2715010. To further confirm this result we sent our promoter series to collaborators from Imperial College London and University of Warwick asking them to repeat the experiments we did. To ensure there was no researcher bias to gain the same results as us we did not name the promoters. The results obtained from these collaborations were pleasing in that both teams produced similar results to ours with PCac_thl being the strongest promoter of the set.
Both the CRISPRi and asRNA approach subsequently used promoters selected from within the assessed promoter series. One aspect of optimisation of the CRISPRi approach was the selection of an appropriate guide RNA. Six guide RNAs designed against the promoter region of TcdA were assessed by placing the TcdA promoter upstream of a reporter gene. The degree to which reporter activity was reduced correlated with the effectiveness of the guide RNA. This assay was able to show that guide RNA six was the most reliably effective and as such would be selected in future CRISPRi work.
Using antisense RNA to suppress toxin production in C. difficile progressed further. The necessary constructs were simpler to clone allowing us to directly measure the ability of our construct to reduce the toxicity of C. difficile supernatant. Two different constructs were made, both of which targeted the two C. difficile toxin genes tcdA and tcdB. We were interested in the effect of varying the length of the antisense RNA and as such made ‘asRNA Construct Two’ to contain 26bp more complementarily to the toxin gene mRNA than ‘asRNA Construct One’. The characterisation of these two constructs proceeded using African green monkey kidney epithelial ‘Vero’ cells. Sterile supernatants from C. difficilecultures were applied to the Vero cells and cytotoxicity was estimated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Our results suggest that asRNA Construct One reduces the rate of toxin production by 80% whilst the slightly longer asRNA Construct Two reduces it by 85% over wild type. This demonstrates the validity of this approach for engineering a toxin"

York,2017,Team:York#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," took pictures of Chlamydomonas. Currently we are devising growth experiments for algae and bacteria.
Microscopy Division
Received NoIR camera. Leaves shape pattern solved. We were trying to observe diffraction from single slit experiment with a laser. Intensity of a laser was lowered with polarisation filter to avoid overexposure of camera. We used converging lens available in the lab to focus diffraction pattern on CMOS. Unfortunately, it was hard to setup to capture clear image. We are thinking to acquire lens with small focal distance to make setup as compact as possible.
Week 5 (17 July - 23 July)
Biology Division
Obtaied bacteria growth curve in 96 well plate. Ethanol toxicity growth test should be run next week for E.coli. Some new plates were made. Performed Alkaline lysis,
Microscopy Division
Removed lens from camera which was done easily. Now, light is shinning directly on CMOS. Still we have problems with alignment of laser, slits and camera. Moreover, single slit was too bright for naked CMOS. Now, we are using double slit experiment to observe interference in best tradition of Thomas Young.
Week 6 (24 July - 30 July)
Biology Division
Growth tests are continuing. We are getting curve for bacteria. Repeating PCR using Polymerase Q5 for MEX1.
Microscopy Division
After imaging double slit interference pattern we are moving to object imaging comperable with microorganisms size - microbeads. In parallel, we are translating software code for image reconstruction from LabVIEW to MATLAB. We received laser from TU Darmstadt team which is iterested in building DIHM, too.
Week 7 (31 July - 6 August)
Biology Division
Started E.coli transformation. Designing growth test with 24 well plate for algae. 96 wels plate well's are too small for algae. Set-up co-culture with untransformed microorganisms.
Microscopy Division
We were able to see single microbeads with our setup. Now, we have to be technical and measure precisely distances need for fully working DIHM. Also, we met with Dr Wilson to discuss our progress so far.
Week 8 (7 August - 13 August)
Biology Division
Performed PCR for MEX1, again. Experimenting on our 'frankenstein' media for a co-culture. Co-culture testing in traditional media.
Microscopy Division
Looks like we will have to make image analysis in Python for a beginning. We still see the noise on captured images.

Measurement
It wouldn’t matter if our hardware was cheap, portable and easy to build if it didn’t actually work. We characterized it with LUDOX and fluorescein to ensure it wasn’t just making up the readings.
We used the interpreter to record the data from device. These readings were then exported and analysed to plot the graphs.
Optical density
Optical density measurements were taken using different concentrations of LUDOX. We made up a dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time. We used 6 dilutions. We used the same cuvette (washed with distilled water between readings) to avoid random error introduced by the differences between our cuvettes. We characterized our densitometer using Lee Filters’ - Fire (019) and Medium yellow (010) - and without a filter.
The readings for optical density are consistent with little variation between readings, except for LUDOX concentrations above 12.5µM. Above 12.5µM the readings began to decrease. We are unsure as to why this would happen, but this is clearly not caused by random error as it happened with all the filters.
Fluorescence
For the fluorometer function of our device, we used fluorescein to take measurements. We made up the same dilution series, with initial concentration 50µM and diluting by half each time but with fluorescein instead of LUDOX. We characterized our fluorometer using LEE Filters’ Twickenham Green (736) and without a filter.
The results are consistent and demonstrate the linearity of our fluorometer. The pipetting error in the dilutions is visible on the graph, as the distances betwen the points and the lines of best fit are similar both with the green filter and"
Sheffield,2017,Team:Sheffield#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," (figure 2); with positive charge collecting on one plate and the negative charge collecting on the other (Miller and Simon, 2008).
Figure 2: shows how an electric field is produced across the two plates after a current has been applied to them.
When a pair of electrodes are placed into an electrolyte solution a charge separation occurs across the interface of the electrodes, which is analogous to that of a capacitor. This is where charge separation, and therefore capacitance is developed in the solution. As the bacteria grow, an increase of electrolytes are released into the solution, and this causes the capacitance to increase as the bacteria grow (Zourob, Elwary and Turner, 2008).
However as with the impedance design, due to the very small size of a well in a 96 well-plate, the change of capacitance across the solution will be minuscule and therefore would require very expensive, sensitive equipment with a very precise set-up to be able to read the capacitance changes. For this reason, other detection methods were investigated to find one that would be suitable for a low budget, open-source project design.
Opacity:
One other method of measurement that was looked at was opacity, or rather, the transmittance of light through a sample. As bacteria grow, the turbidity of the solution increases. This change can be observed by measuring the transmittance of light through the solution. This principle is used in both plate readers and spectrophotometers.
The device was being designed to make measurements from our well plate, and as such, the focus was on the discussion of a standard well plate reader vs. the device. Plate readers have an automated x,y stage which moves a plate, well-by-well, over a single sensor, usually a silicon photodiode. This is placed directly underneath a light source, which is usually a tungsten halogen lamp or a xenon flash lamp, as both these light sources are able to produce a high-quality range of wavelengths.
For the device, it was decided that an automated x,y stage as this can be time-consuming, costly, and confusing to build from for a simple open-source project. Instead, an array of photodiodes was created, that could align with each well of the well plate. An array of white LEDs was placed directly above the well plate, so that light from each LED could shine through a well directly beneath it and onto a sensor located under the well.
This set-up of the photodiode array are described in more detail in the sensors section below.

(*)  Note that since we could not measure DHT and \(3\alpha-diol\), we neglected them in the simulation for the sake of simplicity.
(**)  The degradation rates we measured for NADPH varied too much between measurements, probably due to the different concentration of lysates. Since the purpose of this model is to emulate the behavior of our system, small degradation constants were chosen arbitrarily for NADPH and NADP. By giving both cofactors small degradation constants, we are able to mimic the behavior of the reaction while looking at the dynamics of the enzyme's reaction.
(***) We chose to use the constants measured at [5] , although they are probably not the correct constants for the environment of the experiment. For that reason, these constants sometime differ from simulation to simulation by orders of magnitude in order to get the simulation result that best fit our system's behavior.
(****) Since the values of \({{K_1}}\) and \({{K_2}}\) are unknown, and since we demonstrated how the relation between them can effect the reaction rate (inhibition of direction), we chose an arbitrary values for most simulations that are identical to \({{K_s}}\) and \({{K_P}}\). That being said, we experimented a lot with these values in order to test different behaviors of this system.
Simulations:
Activity check simulation
We simulated the system in time domain under the initial conditions:
\[\left( {\left[ {DHT} \right],\,\left[ {NADPH} \right],\,\left[ {3\alpha  - diol} \right],\,\left[ {NADP} \right]} \right) = \left( {{{40}_{\left[ {\mu M} \right]}},\,{{150}_{\left[ {\mu M} \right]}},\,0,\,0} \right)\]
which are the same initial conditions for the avctivity check experiment

Expression of Red Fluorescence Protein in High Salt Media
As part of our experiments to determine if genetically modified E. coli can grow and thrive in salt water, we plated dilutions of E. coli exposed to different media on agar to obtain CFU/mL counts. We plated them not only on LB + chloramphenicol, but also LB with 3% NaCl (mimicking seawater conditions) to recover any other microorganisms that might be present in the local water mixtures we used. Surprisingly, the E. coli that grew on these plates seemed to not only grow slower, but express less RFP (a as evidenced by decreased fluorescence that was not recovered when given a longer incubation time).
We repeated this experiment by restreaking these bacteria, in addition to other variants of RFP (primarily to test another hypothesis, described below) that are degraded faster, on plates with 3% NaCl. We also tested these on plates that either did, or did not, contain IPTG - normally, no IPTG is necessary to observe fluorescence with construct BBa_J04450, since expression is apparently leaky enough.
To summarize our results thus far, we have found that there is less fluorescence when grown in the presence of 3% NaCl with RFP and all the RFP variants we tested. In addition, expression appears to be controlled in a tighter fashion - whereas IPTG is not necessary to observe fluorescence under normal conditions, in the presence of high salt the expression is less 'leaky' and only observed when the gene is actually induced.
We argue that this is an important result for the iGEM community, as it brings with it a word of caution. Your gene circuit and design may work as intended under laboratory conditions, but how robust is it? Will something as simple as a shift in salt concentration change the"

This year, we completed the 2017 Interlab to qualify for the bronze medal! Below you can find our data including our completion of the competent cell test kit, our reference points to determine background fluorescence, our standard curve, and our raw data. We collaborated alongside Cadets2Vets to determine a conclusion from each other’s data and the variation of results from team to team.
Note: We used a Molecular Device SpectraMax M5 Plate Reader to perform the Interlab
Competent Cell Test Kit:
First, the students performed the Competent Cell Test Kit following the protocol provided by iGEM. The students used E. Coli DH5a as the competent cells being tested. The competent cells were grown on Chloramphenicol plates and left over night. In the morning, the plates showed a significant amount of growth, in the form of distinct pink colonies that the students believed would be easy to count without assistance. Luckily, Dr. Harbaugh suggested an easier method for counting: using a sharpie to dot each colony and then a clicker so we wouldn’t lose our place. After the students counted, the results were:

The most commonly used two means, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, were developed only after World War II.
Chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. To some extent, chemotherapy is of certain specificity, but it still terribly influences normal cells;
Now there are some drugs for chemotherapy with less side effects.
● In 2004 after the listing of the molecular targeted drugs iressa (also known as  Gefitnib), situation has been greatly changed.
Targeting drugs have a lot of advantages:
Firstly, targeted drugs can be taken orally, removing troublesomeness of hospitalization, providing more convenience;
Secondly, the side effects are relatively small;
Thirdly, it concerned with genes associated with the disease, offering efficacy for specific populations.
● Most of our chemotherapy drugs perform by intravenous infusion, so patients need to be hospitalized. Yet lots of molecular targeted drugs are kinase inhibitors of small molecules, which can be made into oral dosage, providing patients with great convenience. Also, compared to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs with more specifically design, cause far less side effects. Life quality during treatment can be greatly improved from the patient's perspective.
● An important significance of molecular targeted drugs is that, in the past, most drugs are searched and then acquired by human from the nature, but the molecular targeted drugs is a re-creation of human with certain purposes, thus a great revolutionary breakthrough.
● The emergence of targeted drugs allow the basic research apply into clinical cases, leading a revolution in the field of oncology.
● Now, for those who can take targeted drugs, that is patients with sensitive mutations, we can practice molecular targeted drugs combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the same time, enabling patients to survive up to three years --- such a survival period is pretty remarkable. (In fact, clinically 2 to 3 months of survival extension could be viewed as miracle.) The emergence of molecular targeted drugs, combined with a reasonable quantity of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has promoted a huge progress compared to a dozen years ago.
● One or two decades ago, doctors would have thought it irrelevant to his treatment if they heard about a mutation in a patient's genetic site. With the emergence of targeted drugs, the clinical treatment of tumors upswing to a molecular level.

Nina: This is good, allowing us to work in lactobacillus with this vitamin.
""The constitutive overexpression of the folate biosynthesis genes of L. plantarum WCFS1 in cultures of L. reuteri JCM1112/pNZ7026 resulted in an almost 100-fold increase in folate levels, while the control (L.reuteri JCM1112/pNZ7021) did not show any change in folate and B12 production. The overproduction of folate was found to have a very small effect on B12 production (10% reduction), resulting in a folate/B12 ratio of approximately 100:1 (wt/wt)"" - High-Level Folate Production in Fermented Foods by the B12 Producer Lactobacillus reuteri JCM1112
Nina: This means and the following two citations show that we can have our lactobacillus producing both vitamin B without disturbing each others pathways.

To test this, a                       PCR for the transformed colonies was carried out and then ran inside an                       electrophoresis gel, which can be observed in Figure 10.
Figure 10. Electrophoresis gel corresponding to the PCR performed to                       transformed colonies transformed with both the Plan A and Plan B strategy.
As we mentioned, we had a second strategy for Lactobachill to block the                       trans signaling IL-6 pathway, which we decided to call Plan B. Plan B consists                       on the secretion of a mutated soluble IL-6 receptor, Mutgp80, that will bind to                       IL-6 forming a complex that cannot attach to the membrane-bound transducer                       and this way is not able to continue with the inflammation pathway. The                       genetic construct that will make Plan B possible in E. coli is shown in Figure 11.                       However, since the genetic design was rather big to be synthesized in a single                       piece of DNA and we could not afford customized DNA synthesis, we had it                       split into two parts.
Figure 11. Plan B genetic construct optimized for E. coli.
Both parts were inserted into our model organism using the same                       strategy that was used for Plan A. The electrophoresis gel corresponding to the                       colonies PCR containing both parts are also shown in Figure 10.
Unfortunately we had neither time nor enough resources to characterize these                       parts and actually test their functionality. Still, both parts were submitted to                       the registry and we are still working on the project to bring Lactobachill close                       to those who need it the most.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#SiruiNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," practice with iMovie is always good!
Friday, 7/20: Today, I interviewed Professor Tamara Hendrickson, of Wayne State University about her opinions on the development of the ELN, using the BEAST as a tool for collaboration in the lab, and also in general about organization in the wet lab.  I'm amazed that even after brainstorming, interviewing students, talking to professors, PIs, and graduate students that there are still innovative features to be added to the ELN.  I think it might be wise if the next step we talk to less engineers, and more scientists about troubleshooting, and also talk to people who are in a related field to synthetic biology, just so we can understand better many different aspects of human practice and ethical concerns that we haven't covered before.  For example, if we talked to a wet lab instructor and then talked to a lecturer about features to include in our design, their perspectives- including their concerns, expertise, and what they think are ""necessities"" in the design- are so different that they both serve to enrich our designs further.
Also, today we started recruiting for the initial stages of testing for next week.  I was amazed than in half an hour we were able to schedule 3 pairs of participants for Tuesday, all whom have taken either AP biology or BISC 110!  The summer research program at Wellesley, and the enthusiasm of the students, amaze me.
To do for next week: Demo, Demo, Demo...Design usability test first to be used for lab interns not directly involved with MoClo Planner on Monday, then for Wellesley students usability test on Tuesday, then talk to Traci on Wednesday to get her feedback when we demo to BU, and finally test out the MoClo planner with MIT students on Friday.  While all of this is happening, also talk to a variety of experts related to the field of synthetic biology, and start refining questions for interviews!
Week of July 23rd: Demo Week @ Wellesley, MIT, and BU
Monday, 7/23: Over the weekend I wrote a detailed user scenario to be used for the round of initial testing at Wellesley.  Because not a lot of students are familiar with the modular cloning process nor about synthetic biology as a field, I had to give a summary of both before writing the task.  Summarizing synthetic biology as a field in a paragraph is no easy feat, and I definitely struggled a lot with writing this, but it's made me realize that this could help us later when we are pulling together everything for"

As already mentioned we will follow two different strategies to create the T7 integration. For the first strategy, we will fuse the T7 cassette. Amplified from the BL21 genome to a chloramphenicol resistance cassette and to 1000-bp up- and downstream homologous regions to dns. Since it is possible to create two or more genomic modifications, using only one selected product in natural co-transformation of linear fragments (Hayes et al. 2017) , we will use another fragment with homologous up- and downstream regions of lon but without a selection marker in between, to delete lon.
For the second strategy, we will integrate the T7 cassette to one of our characterized integration sites. For this reason, we will fuse the T7 cassette to 1000 bp long up- and downstream homologous regions to integration site 19 (int19). For the deletion of lon, we will use the same linear fragment as in strategy one. As a selected product with an antibiotics marker in between we will utilize the deletion cassette as for Δdns in VibriClone.
Figure 2: The two strategies of T7 integration. On the left side of the picture Strategy I is shown. Here we will integrate the T7 cassette into the endogenous locus of the nuclease dns. On the right side of the picture strategy II is shown. In this strategy we will integrate the T7 cassette at the integration site 19.
As we will attach FRT sites to the antibiotic cassette by PCR, we will be able to remove the selection marker after integration of the selected product, using a plasmid that encodes a Flip recombinase. After the genomic modifications are proved by PCRs, the T7 system needs to be tested and VibriExpress to be characterized. First of all a growth curve of this new strain has to be measured in comparison to E. coli BL21 to show you, that V. antigens is still faster than E. coli. Next, we will prove, that the cells are healthy after several genomic modifications by microscopic analysis. To show you, that changing from E. coli to V. natriegens will be easy and to prove, that tools like the T7 system are transferable without much effort, we will test a construct containing a T7 promoter in both organisms and compare the results to each other. We are convinced that the T7 system in VibriXpress will deliver a much higher amount of protein in a shorter time. This way we would like to speed up your scientific progress"

After integrating DNA segment of Landing pad into the genome of E coli, we completed the genetic engineering of the genome of E coli. All the five parts of landing pad are designed for subsequent recombination.
Besides, in order to achieve different recombination goals, we designed several landing pads of different sequences.
PLEASE refer to 'Landing Pad Construction and Insertion' to learn about the details of Landing Pad design.
PLEASE refer to this 'link' to learn more about ATT recombination.
After the integration of landing pad, we have to insert another DNA fragment called Helper Plasmid(HP), which provides necessary tools for in vivo recombination.
In this plasmid(Helper Plasmid), there are two genes used for recombination.
The first one encodes restriction enzyme I-scel after induction of L-arabinose. I-scel is able to recognize the 15bp-length sequence flanking a target DNA fragment and cut out the fragment, therefore providing DNA segments for recombination mediated by other components.
The second one encodes the enzyme responsible for recombination called Lamda-Red. With the presence of IPTG, Lamda-Red will recombine DNA fragments flanked by the same DNA sequence recognized by Lamda-Red.
In addition, Helper Plasmid contains a specific temperature-sensitive replicon, which is used to control the replication via temperature changes. We can remove the replicon when necessary.
PLEASE refer to 'HP insertion' to learn more about Helper Plasmid.
Up till now, we successfully engineered a ‘recepient strain’. Then we have to transform the ‘recepient strain’ with the Donor Plasmid(DP) containing recombination fragments. Donor Plasmid contains several Insertion Fragments and each Insertion Fragment contains following five parts:
1) one 15bp-long restriction enzyme I-scel recognition site
2) one 25bp-long random sequence
3) one fragment for insertion and recombination
4) one 25bp-long random sequence
5) one 15bp-long restriction enzyme I-scel recognition site(in correspondence with 1)
(Note: the order of the five parts differ from that of landing pad)
As we previously mentioned, Donor plasmid contains several Insertion Fragments. Based on the flanking landing pad sequence, we can ascribe Insertion Fragments to the same group as long as the flanking landing pad sequences of those Insertion Fragments are the same.
In order to achieve different goals, we design different Donor Plasmids, different Donor Pl"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," In the Downloads section of this page, a structured collection of the circuit diagram can be downloaded as a PDF file.
Circuitry overview. A compact representation of all circuitry that is underlying the circuit board design. The circuit layout was created with the Autodesk EAGLE CAD Software package. Electrical connections are represented by green lines or by labels for distant connection points. A detailed and structured version of the circuit diagram can be downloaded in our Downloads section.
After we created the circuit diagram based on our experiences from prototyping, we began designing the PCB. A PCB is basically a supporting material with one or several conductive layers, into which the ""conductive paths"", e.g. the electrical connections between two pins, are etched. In our case, we decided for a two‑layer design with one conductive layer on the two surfaces of the PCB. Every electrical component in the circuit diagram has a ""device"" object that stores information about its external dimensions and the ""footprint"", the sizes and locations of solder pads that are needed for soldering the component onto the surface of the PCB. The PCB design process starts by positioning all components onto the surfaces of the PCB. In the time lapse of the design process in the figure beneath, conductive paths on the top and bottom layer can be differentiated by their respective color: Red indicates the top layer and blue the bottom layer. After the components have been roughly positioned, the connections between component pins were routed individually by hand, trying to minimize the length of important connections. In our design, we decided to assign the whole top layer as a ground plane, and the bottom layer as a V+ plane. This has several advantages: Due to the large copper areas surrounding data lines, induction of interfering noise is greatly reduced. Additionally, the voltage drop across the LED panel is reduced as the resistance is lowered to a minimum. Most importantly, the heat that is produced at the LEDs and at the PWM controllers is more efficiently dissipated.
Evolution of circuit board design. This animated graphic shows a few snapshots of the design process that led to our final PCB layout. The design was created with the Autodesk EAGLE CAD Software package. Every color represents a different layer that needs to be considered in the manufacturing process. For instance, red and blue indicate copper on the upper and lower side of the board respectively, green stands for pads and vias and gray lines represent outer dimensions of parts as well as their names and values.
In accordance with the aforementioned design criteria , the PCB design possesses some special features that are especially interesting. One example is the LED"

Tik-Tok
Tik-Tok is a small video sharing app that is popular all over the world. Now people from all professions are keen to share their daily life and funny moments through this app, so that different people can understand the true story of their own industry. Our team decided to create a personal CSU_CHINA Tik-Tok account to record small videos, not only to share and record the daily life of the lab and the team's preparation process, but more importantly, to promote the concept to the public: love, persistence, creation. We are not just wearing a lab coat with goggles. We are not just a rigorous nerd in the public impression. We are a group of young people with ideals and convictions. We hope that through the platform of Tik Tok , everyone will be interested in understanding our projects, so that more people know what we are doing and how to do it which means that more people can acquire our hard work and happiness.
This is our video which recording the daily routine that we leave laboratory has received 1800 LIKE in Tik-Tok.
Bilibili
Bilibili is Chinese largest barrage sharing site. There are a variety of video hosts on this site, from humorous entertainment to popular science. In the early stage, we did some related work, produced the team's first short video, selected Akejiang’s ""Please call me"" as a melody, adapting words on our own, asking people to cover, edit, and make the team song ""Interlab"" Song"", then shared on the Bilibili,. Our video has now achieved a high click-through rate and coin-operated. Netizens said that the laboratory life was so interesting, and even the schoolmates expressed their wish to participate in the next year's iGEM contest. The promotion has obviously yielded a very good result. The comments in the video gave us great confidence to do a better job. We will continue to share our labs in the future, and I believe that more and more people will be able to see them.

BIT,2018,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," And the blue curve indicates the fluorescence ratio at 488 nm                         (reduced state) and 405 nm (oxidized state) of engineered yeast which only overexpressed Yno1.                         The red curve decline over time but not the blue one, which means roGFP2-Orp1 protein is able                         to show the accumulation of ROS in our yeast.
Since we have proved the feasibility that the antioxidative ability of antioxidant can be                         measured by fluorescence probes. We can easily set up the relationship between our system and                         real antioxidative ability of antioxidant.
Detect antioxidants by engineering strain
After the whole system construction, we need to test the function of our system and then                         evaluate the effect of antioxidants through our system.
To detect the antioxidant capacity of antioxidants, we have selected three antioxidants,                         Vitamin C, Quercetin and Catechol, as our samples, and cultured engineered strain                         (Δyca1-yno1-roGFP2-Orp1) until the period with high ROS accumulation (24-36 h). Then the                         antioxidants were added into yeast culture and incubated for 30 minutes. The control group was                         treated with aseptic water and ethanol. The fluorescence intensity ratio (I488/I408 or                         I405/I488) of the reduction peak (488nm) and oxidation peak (405nm) was measured by Microplate                         Reader, and the antioxidant activity of antioxidants was characterized by that ratio change                         rate. And the emission wavelength is 510nm. The results are showed in Fig. 2.
Fig.2 Detect the Antioxidant Capability of Antioxidants (I405/I488)
Low                             fluorescence ratio (I488/405) means low intracellular ROS level.
Fig.3 Detect the Antioxidant Capability of Antioxidants (I488/I405)
High                             fluorescence ratio (I488/405) means high antioxidant capacity.
As Fig.2~3 shown, in 30 mins, group Catechol and group Quercetin both show a decreasing in                         I405/I488 ratio (Fig.2), which means that Quercetin and Catechol have antioxidant activity.                         Besides, the Quercetin treated group shows a faster decreasing in I405/I488 ratio than Catechol                         under the same condition of time. According to our modeling, this indicates that the Quercetin                         have more antioxidant activity than Catechol, which is consistent with CAA assay result.

\
This graph shows the absorbance of our colonies versus time.
It is clear that several strains exceed the rest.
The strongest strains did not bear the highest TIR ribosome binding sites.
Unexpectedly, the most prolific strains did not contain the strongest ribosome binding sites. It is possible that at very high TIR the cells experienced toxicity or too much metabolic strain from the production of GFP. With further characterization of the GFPs it will be possible to compare the expression of strains containing the same RBS but different variant GFPs. Through this analysis we will be able to determine the strength of our optimization criteria and hopefully add to the ability of future engineers to optimize their genetic systems.

Split the team into 2 groups, wet team (Matthew, Bartosz, Albert) and dry team (Mia, Beth, Darryl).
Decided what each team had to do for that week
Started with general research on our chosen infections (Cholera and Shigellosis)
Darryl started and completed learning basic HTML and CSS via tutorials on the site Codecadamy, then began the initial stages of the wiki so as to get to grips with it.
Week 2 -
Began to contact various people/organisations:

BPUL: Fraction 50% 2 with a laccase concentration of 25,1 µg mL-1.
BHAL: Fraction  5% 3 with a laccase concentration of 10,9 µg mL-1.
TTHL: The best fraction of our TTHL laccase was fraction 50% 1 with a laccase concentration of 4,03 µg mL-1. In regard to Team Immobilization and Team Substrate Analysis we had to reach a higher amount of TTHL laccase. So we thought of combining two fractions. We chose the second best fraction of TTHL, which is 5% 3. To calculate the amount of contained laccase we had to compare the activity and reconsidered the slope. Since we stated the fraction with its highest activity as 90 % contained laccase, we calculated the amount of laccase regarding to that one. The following figure shows the slopes we got out of the activity from fraction 50% 1 and fraction 5% 3 (which is the second best). Accordingly to this, fraction 5% 3 contains 68,9% of laccase, which is 4,8 µg mL-1. In total, the composed fraction contains 4,4 µg mL-1.
Slope of the two most active fractions of purified TTHL laccase. By comparing them, the amount of contained laccase in the fractions had been calculated.

Team Substrate Analysis:
Creating  and measuring of estradiol and ethinyl estradiol degradation samples for the laccases TVEL0 and BPUL. The experimental setup changed. The laccase amount was adjusted to the highest possible amount of the lowest concentrated laccase. TTHL has a concentration of 4,03 µg mL-1 and sets the maximal laccase amount to 0.6 µg per 200 µL reaction volume. To compensate these worse conditions, the substrate amount was lowered to 1 µg and"

Gillespie algorithm
the reverse process of the gene between the two Loxp sites could not be well described by the DDE or ODE equations since after the reverse process, the gene will have chance to flip again. This process is a discrete, stochastic process instead of a continuous, deterministic process. To make the model more convincing, we use Gillespie algorithm, which is a kind of stochastic simulation algorithm to generate a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation. readmore
Our model
In our model , we use Gillespie algorithm to simulate the process of inversion. Here we use   Markov chain to describe the process of inversion. We assume that the state ‘A’ , ‘B’ , ‘C’ , ‘D’ , is the original state , the state after inversion , the  Intermediate state when A forms holiday junction, the Intermediate state when B forms holiday  junction respectively. readmore
A better model
1000 genes which are in state ‘A’ are seen as a whole in the above model. To make the simulation more convincing, we then simulate the trajectory of every single molecule. After that we synthesize all trajectories to get the final result. readmore

And we run some parameter scan to analysis how the model works under various parameter sets. And we focus on the affinity of the histamine receptor and the degradation rate of the activated histamine, which are both reckoned as highly sensitive parameters before.
The the affinity of histamine receptor and degradation rate of activating receptor scan results are showed below.
From the figures, we figure that the peak of the concentration of EGFP increases and the decline of it is delayed as the affinity goes higher or the degradation rate of receptor gets lower, which implied us that we can artificially tune these two parameters to adjust the output. Besides,it reminds us that the randomness of these should be further considered in the stochastic model.
Then, we did an input scan and get a figure of output time series of various input, which is demonstrated below. As to the system, the input is the activated histamine receptor in a cell and the output is the concentration of EGFP.
From this figure, it is obvious that the concentration of EGFP soars at the first time and reach a peak,then gradually decreases, since the activated histamine receptor degrade as the time goes by. In addition, the concentration of EGFP monotonously changes as that of RL (input) goes up , which is an evidence that it is possible to test the concentration of activated receptor by that of EGFP.
Diagnosis Model
Diagnosis Model is a model constructed to design, analyze and optimize the diagnostic criteria of histamine testing we developed. In this testing, our purpose is to test whether the histamine concentration in a sample reaches a certain level. If it does, we consider this kind of result as a positive result, which means allergy has possibly happened. However, if the histamine concentration maintains at a background level, we consider it as a negative result. So the diagnosis model is indeed a classification model which focuses on the strategy to determine how we announce the testing result and how much we can believe in it. And, to be emphasized, this model is on the basis of the models we constructed before -- 'Reaction in system' and 'Signal pathway in a yeast.
Diagnostic criteria design
Now we begin with the EGFP concentration in a yeast when certain amount of the histamine receptor activated, which is the output in the signal pathway model. From figure 14, it is clear that the output is dynamic. However, using the whole time"
