ZJU-China,2011,Team:ZJU-China#Brainstorm.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"sthma锛?a chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs, has been increasingly observed in developed countries. Its remarkable increase attributes to changes in the environment due to improved hygiene and fewer childhood infections. Researchers have found that asthma has close correlation with increased IgE level. Those who are prone to asthma are able to express complete Fc蔚RI in dendritic cell(DC). We planned to use synthetic biology to focus on dendritic cell to lower the level of IgE expression. This may lead to a new-era of asthma therapy and bring hope to those suffering from asthma.

NOTEBOOK
Scientific and Societal Thinking
During the project, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project. These aspects can be roughly divided into two problems: What impact will our project have on societal questions, and will our project promote or offer convenience to scientific and engineering practices?
Through the discussion and inspection, survey and practice, we had a better awareness of our project in the context of society and environment, scientific and engineering. These inspirations help us improve our project a lot.
(1) Practices in Science and Engineering
1. Studying the needs of wet-lab teams and open communication in iGEM
Motivation
Synbio needs software. As a software team we need to contact with wet-lab teams, to listen to their needs, and to put our efforts to where they are most in need. It is also very interesting and exciting to meet people who will be most likely to be affected by our project, and whose opinions will be most beneficial for us to develop the project.
Practices
A survey during the NCTU_Formosa meetup
Xiao Feng, Jinjin Lin, Liang Tang, Xiaoran Yang, Yi Shi and Xiangyue Hu
In late July, we attended the meetup held by 2015 NCTU_Formosa. We shared our idea and listened to suggestions from other teams.
Photo of team members in NCTU_Formosa meetups.
In the poster session, instructor of 2015 iGEM team NYMU-Taipei, Prof. Chang, Chuan-Hsiung, asked us a question.
“Whether synthetic biologists or iGEMers would think of your project as what they exactly need? Or whether they could find other software for a substitute?”
(During the project we always thought of Prof. Chang's question, and his words always motivate us to make our project meet the need of wet-lab synthetic biologists. He also gave us precious advice on how to find out the needs of"

CU-Boulder,2012,Team:CU-Boulder#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," inhibitors have gone a step further, and are being tested in their ability to keep bacteria from making biofilms in the first place.
We also identified and obtained a novel biofilm degradation enzyme, NucB.  NucB is a deoxyribonuclease synthesized by Bacillus subtilis, a sporulating gram-positive bacteria.  When B. subtilis goes through sporulation, it divides asymmetrically and generates two compartments of unequal size and different developmental fates.  The smaller compartment eventually develops into a mature spore, while the larger compartment serves to protect and nurture the developing spore (Eichenberger et al., 2003).  NucB is part of a large operon that responds to regulator molecules activated in the large compartment during sporulation.  Its task is to degrade nucleic acids present in surrounding biofilm in order for the spore to escape and travel to a new location.  DNA in biofilms is responsible for increased viscoelastic and adhesive properties.  Since our goal is to prevent biofilm formation, we wanted to express NucB as an additional method of prevention.
Project 2: Experiments
1. Test whether the SdiA pSrgE cassette is more sensitive to extracellular AHLs than the LuxR LuxpR cassette: This will be done by placing an RFP behind the cassette, and using the plate reader to determine the fluorescence at a given concentration of RFP.
2. Use the SdiA pSrgE cassette’s sensitivity to inhibit the LuxR LuxpR system:  Attach an AHLase and YFP to the more sensitive SdiA/pSrgE cassette. Co-culture the AHLase/YFP construct with a LuxR/LuxpR-RFP bacteria.  The culture should turn fluoresce yellow, and not turn red.
3. Test the SdiA pSrgE cassette’s inhibition effects with VF acting as a pathogen analogue: Co-culture the SdiA/pSrgE/YFP/Aiia cells with V. fisheri and use the plate reader to show that co-cultures will keep V. fisheri from emitting light at given ODs.
4. Isolate and submit NucB:  Isolate NucB and standardize it to biobrick format.

Kobe
Team kobe was founded last year and is a team of Kobe University who participated in this year's iGEM for the first time. Team Kobe has helped each other since we met iGEM Japan Kansai Forum. In order to hear the opinions of many people against their projects, we participated in a super-dissimilar field meeting. Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference was a conference where people from various fields such as biology, engineering, economics, etc. gathered. So I thought that it might be able to receive advice from various directions. We invited team Kobe to join us. So we contacted the organizers and made it possible for team kobe to participate. At Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference, we watched each other's poster sessions and gave some advices.
Even crowdfunding helped each other. By diffusing information on cloud funding by SNS and disseminating it to each other, many people got to know the activities.And the financing became smoother. Team kobe has earned funds with Crowd Funding before us, and has been collecting support above the target amount and making it succeed. When we started cloud funding, we referred to the team Kobe's cloud funding. We felt that this has led to support. Kobe Collaborations

Newsletter
This biweekly iGEM newsletter is cofounded by the Paris-Bettencourt team and the Xiamen University team in June. Through the three and half months, we had four regular issues, one special issue that includes interviews of past judge and iGEMer, and one student review session of the judging process.
There were more than 30 teams involved, from more than eight countries and regions. The regular issues have two major parts: project update and team member introduction.The teams wrote about one of the parts every two weeks, asked questions they want feedback on, and provided insights about other teams’ projects. We hope that through this activity, the teams are able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists. It is a system of real-time peer review. We also try to provide the iGEM organization interesting feedbacks of how students regard the judging standard.
French Meet up
In the beggining of August most of the French teams gathered in Paris area (Saclay) to present their project ideas. We meet representants from different teams and exchanged our experience with iGEM. Paris Saclay prepared a video from this meeting. Paris Bettencourt team in exchange prepared short introductory videos of other teams: Paris _Saclay , Bordeaux , Evry , Lyon . We also took a chance to collect more sweat samples and get some odor evaluations. The meeting was accompanied with a debate around bioethics.

It is not just Bielefeld we have worked with. In the beginning of September we went to a great Scandinavian iGEM convention in Uppsala. We met with the other teams from Scandinavia to present our projects for each other and talk about different aspects of iGEM. Here we also took part in workshops about human practices, funding, “working as a team” and laboratory experiences. Read more about it further down. The press is also a big part of our Human Practices. You can read all about it in the press section further down.
As another approach to outreach we have participated in collaboration with other iGEM teams about creating informative videos about GMO and ethics. The different videos are available at our iGEM youtube channel and our video can be seen further down. Apart from the GMO video, we were contacted by a former employee from the nation tv-station, who wanted to make a documentary about us, to tell the public about iGEM. Read more about this in the documentary section. In our business approach we have looked at the possibilities of introducing our product SLIM to the marked and how the laws would affect this introduction.
Outreach
Fair - At the Beginning of the Academic Year
The studies fair is a great exhibition with around 3000 visitors. It stretches over two days where both companies and unions from industry, associations and cultural life are represented.
The fair is a free service for students and other interested parties. We had the opportunity to create a great first impression of what we can offer students at the university interested in either joining next year's team or maybe even help us this year. We did this both to spread the word about iGEM and to raise awareness for students and staff at the university.
We got a great benefit from the fair, since we got a lot of attention from students from other faculties who also thought it would be exciting to be involved in iGEM for example, to help with the wiki, modeling, ethics, public relations and much more. In addition to this, there were of course many science students who were interested in being involved next year, to them we had made ​​a Facebook group where we update with information about registration, etc.

Plant growth influenced by heavy metal
Phytoremediation is a promising technology.However, the growth process of these plants are typically inhibited by high concentrations of heavy metals, It causes slow growth of plants and decelerates the phytoextraction process. So build this model.Better to explore the growth of plants. Verify that PSB can reduce the inhibition of heavy metal to plant growth.It can promote the growth of plants

The heavy metal ions in soil can affect the growth of plants, thus affecting the efficiency of phytoextraction process.The influence factor R is proportional to the concentration of metal ions in the soil.Namely, the greater the heavy metal concentration, the greater the influence effect and the obvious hindering of plant growth.The heavy metal ions in soil are a dynamic process in the process of repair and gradually decrease.The R value also changes.R=k(Si-q1(t)-q2(t)+q3(t))

Alongside creating a Cry toxin ourselves, we searched nature for existing Cry toxins. We gathered 800 dead Varroa mites and from them isolated B. thuringiensis or related species, which might have been the cause of death. Figure 4 shows the morphology of B. thuringiensis and two strains we discovered. Five out of 106 isolates were identified as Bacillus-like species. One strain, which turned out to be not B. thuringiensis, showed the presence of a large over-expressed protein and was sent for sequencing. We reduced the dataset to four candidate genes with the toxin scanner. This is a great starting point for future research.

The red arrow points to a Cry toxin, the green arrow to a spore, and the yellow arrow to a vegetative cell. (b) Isolate 62, a coccus. Most isolates had this morphology. (c) Isolate 82, showing Bacillus-like morphology.
A constant low level of Cry toxin can facilitate resistances 4 . This is why the toxin production should be regulated when BeeT spreads through the hive. We created two main systems that regulate the toxin production. One is a system designed with riboswitches that promote toxin production when Varroa mites are present. The other system, that works in parallel with the riboswitches, uses quorum sensing to start toxin production only when the density of BeeT is high.
Riboswitches are parts of mRNA that can regulate gene expression depending on whether a ligand is bound. The ligands we used are guanine and vitamin B12. Both substances indicate the presence of Varroa mites. 95% of the mite faeces consists of guanine. Vitamin B12 is present in the haemolymph of the honey bees, and can be expected to leak into the hive when Varroa mites damage the honeybees. Both riboswitches were constructed successfully so that when the ligand is present, toxin can be produced. They have been tested with RFP as reporter gene in the presence of different concentrations of their corresponding ligand. The results for the vitamin B12 riboswitch are shown in"
Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 10_-_-_TEXT.html," for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Project Abstract: Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field.
We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

GFP generator( BBa_K737068 ) is provided by MIT in 2012 plates for teams. But we couldn’t transfer it successfully. So we constructed it again and submitted it to registry.
OmpR( BBa_K737067 ) Positively regulated, OmpR-controlled promoter ligated with B0034 can be used to control genetic circuit by light with light-dependent control element. This promoter is taken from the upstream region of OmpC. Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the three operator sites and activates transcription.

1.BIT-China
We cooperated with BIT-China this year, a team from Beijing Institute of Technology in China and we helped them build a part. So, they can have a better way in testing the expression of membrane protein.
In their project, they mainly want to express C-type GPCR (T1R2＆T1R3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this process, they are concerned about whether protein can be successfully expressed in the cell membrane. So, they want to fuse BCP（Blue cytochrome protein）to the N-terminal of T1R2 and it could be observed the protein T1R2 on the membrane by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We synthesized the gene for them. Here's the result:

Gal1 is an inducible promoter which is induced by galactose. BCP is blue cytochrome protein, it can be observed by fluorescence confocal microscopy. T1R2 is a membrane proteins which can sense galactose. CYC1t is a terminator in yeast.
From these experiments, we help BIT-China to build the part to confirm that their membrane proteins can express. Here is the link to their wiki .
BIT-China helped us check whether our system could work to validate our design. They used plates with different kinds of inducer and detected the growth of bacteria with TA system.
The results show that, toxin can suppress the growth of bacteria and the expression of anti-toxin can get rid of the suppression of toxin in bacteria.

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Questionnaire_-_-_TEXT.html," between modeling and experimentation.
Expectations for modeling and its results
The expectations students have for modeling appear to rather well meet the results they are getting from it. Modeling aids in getting theoretical insight of the biological system, understanding factors that influence the system and predicting the outcome of an experiment. Models help experimentalists focus their efforts and reduce the amount of experiments required and sometimes predict whether an idea is possible or reasonable to realize at all.
Though the tight timeframe of iGEM makes it difficult to get practical benefits from modeling, the expectations were met rather well. Often the modeling team needs some time in the beginning to get familiar with biology and building the models itself takes a lot of time. Due to the tight schedule of the competition, the experiments also need to be started early on, so many decisions that modeling could have affected are already made when the modeling is able to catch up. When the models are ready, there can be little time left to adjust or validate the model using experimental data.
Approaches to organizing modeling
One person doing everything
In some iGEM teams the modeling challenges were approached by having the same person do both experimental work and modeling. This is an obvious way to avoid the difficulties in interdisciplinary communication. However, drawbacks to this approach were also recognised. It was mentioned that by having the same person do experimentation and modeling can more easily lead to errors due to the lack of discussion.
It was often very time-consuming for people with a biology background to learn even the basics of modeling and for modelers to learn basics of biology. Especially respondents doing mostly modeling reported the difficulty of learning other fields, perhaps pointing out that more often a person with a modeling background starts learning biology rather than biologists taking the time to learn modeling. If a person divides her or his time in learning and doing both, the level of understanding is inevitably lower than a specialized person could have. Therefore, having one person doing everything significantly limits what can be achieved within the project. Similar advantages and disadvantages of bimodal modelers have also been recognised in professional groups .
Cooperation
For more ambitious goals in applying modeling to synthetic biology and larger projects, it is necessary for more specialized people to work together. Rather than trying to do all the tasks themselves, people with a decent understanding of both biology and modeling could act as mediators between specialists of the two fields. However, as the responses indicate, this cooperation between specialists is often challenging.
Challenges in cooperation
The most significant challenge in cooperation appears to be communication, hindered by the knowledge gap, different vocabularies and different ways of thinking between modelers and experimentalists. Communication between modelers"

When we had just begun working on our project, team Korea_U_Seoul advised us about the specifications of the competition and gave us tips on time management and experimental procedure. Then both teams gave presentations on their project and had a discussion session afterwards.
iGEM Team BGU
Representative of BGU: Noa Weiss contacted us first on September 22nd when she first inquired about our project details on our official Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/koreasonyeodul/ and informed us about the variety of mutations they have been working on. Since they were working with the same protein chain as we were, we decided to exchange protocols for each other’s enzymes. When we sent them our PETase model, they were glad to practice mutations on it and sent them kindly back for our testing. The current testing, because of the late contact we had with BGU, is still under process. BGU also sent us a prototype TPA(Terephthalic acid) detection protocol that they had created, which we could use to possibly detect any signs of PET degradation."

LuxAB has been widely used as a reporter dependent on the addition of tetradecanal to the cultures. In 2010 Cambridge iGEM team engineered these genes to a biobrick format making them part of the toolkit available to all iGEM teams.
As a team we decided to work with this operon for the folowing reasons, first of all, the luminescence produced by this pathway is much more visually appealing than other systems from the registry (i.e XFPs), and moreover, the light production doesn´t depends on a single peptide but on a whole pathway, wich makes it more tunable, for instance, decoupling in time the substrate recovery from the luciferase reaction itself.

Protein Trafficking
Overview
In our project, we introduced bacterial glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells to create alternative metabolic pathway. However, unlike their native environment in bacteria, the two enzymes needed to find their way through the high compartmentalized system in order to reach the citric acid cycle where they could act on.
To guide the glyoxylate enzymes into the mitochondria where mammalian citric acid cycle resides, we produced recombinant glyoxylate enzymes by attaching the Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) to their N-termini.
We have also constructed the MLS in its own into standard BioBricks ( BBa_K1119000 & BBa_K1119001 ), and we quantitatively characterized their behavior using GFP reporter.
Biology of Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS)
In eukaryotes, the signal sequence guides the translocation of the newly synthesized peptide.
The story starts with the MLS attached to the N-terminus of the protein of interest. Once the protein of interest is synthesized, this preprotein would remain unfolded by associating with chaperons. The preprotein will stay in the cytosol until the MLS gets recognized by receptor of the TOM complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Binding of the MLS to the receptor will trigger the feeding of the peptide through the translocation channel. Afterwards, the MLS will then be handed over to a TIM complex which sits on the inner membrane, which will then open up the channels on the inner membrane and allow the peptide to pass through. Once the peptide is through the double membranes, mitochondrial chaperone will be involved in pulling the peptide into the mitochondria and refold the protein. Lastly, the MLS will be cleaved by signal peptidase and dissociate from the transported peptide. (Alberts, 2002)

This is our first regular meeting since we formed our iGEM team.  During this meeting, we introduced ourselves to each other, and learned more about our goal.  Our team consists of sophomore and junior students from different departments. The first section was given by Kevin about the general background of iGEM and the specific requirements of the competition.  The techniques that could be used in our experiments were also introduced, and it's lucky to know that we have already learned the fundamental knowledge of these techniques.  After our team leader gave a briefing about the early studies of the research, we had an analysis about the Salmonella we will use in our experiments that have been knocked out of two genes Given that we are the first team of our university to take part in the competition, it's essential that we should learn from other teams and use their experience for reference.  Therefore in our second section, we used the teams of Imperial College of London, Shanghai Jiaotong University, University of Washington, and Slovenia University as examples.  All these teams gave us some great ideas.  Firstly, we could innovate from the common phenomenon in daily life, like the team of Imperial College which had their research based on the water absorbency of root hair.  In addition, our ideas could be realized using up-to-date techniques and methods, like the team of Slovenia University which applied many advanced techniques like SRP, EMSA, and FRET to accomplish their goal.  Last but not least, creating a website that is unique and can reflect the process of our thinking and exploring is significant. In the last section, tasks of literature related reading were assigned to every member.  Although it might be a tough way to go, we are all looking forward to our work ahead.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," The His-Select Ni resin was washed with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 20mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8), and eluded with with 6* 500μL (6CV) of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1mM DTT, pH8) at 4 ℃, according to the Purification protocol.
Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel
In order to analyse the nickel affinty chromatography of the Tn5 protein, a precast Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel was run with a 6% stacking gel and 12% separation gel according to the SDS PAGE Tris-Glycine Polyacrylamide Gel protocol.The polyacrylamide gel ran for 90min at 50volt. After the was completed, the gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain and imaged using the GelDoc system. The result of the gel is shown below:
Figure Nickel Affinity Chromatography. 12% SDS of Tn5 (expected size 53.3kDa). Lane 1 molecular ladder (kDa), lane clarified lysate, lane 3 cell debris, lane 4 flow through, lane 5 wash1, lane 6 wash2, lane 7 Elution 1, lane 8 Elution 2, lane 9 Elution 3, lane 10 Elution 4.
No Tn5 was observed in the lysate or the elution fraction. At first, we thought an error occurred during expression, however after thorough analysis we identified our mistake. There was a miss communication between stain construction and bioprocess as a result the plasmid was in the incorrect host organism. The Tn5 plasmid was still in DH5 alpha. Going forward, all transformation into expression host will be covered by the bioprocess team, to avoid this mistake in the future.

The costs are based on the following assumptions:
Labor costs are based upon the conventional labor costs for the concerned groups, taking into account the number of fte’s. The salaries of the management are deliberately low in order to increase the growth potential of the company. The whole team agreed with this. Most of the consulting and supporting will be done by employees from the TU Delft. For example, within the TU Delft there are multiple experts in the field of solar panels that could help us to develop the prototype.
The costs for the business establishment are based on information provided by Delft Enterprises.
Costs for intellectual property are based on information provided by the Valorisation Centre. They can eventually also help us with the patenting process.
The costs for regulatory approval are an educated guess and are based on among other things the expected required time of external parties, traveling costs, etc.
The expenses for the consumables and chemicals are based on the real expenses during the iGEM project.
The rent concerns costs for a laboratory and production facilities of the TU Delft. The TU Delft can provide those facilities as in kind contribution in return for a larger share in the company.
Distribution costs are estimated based on maximal expected distribution distances.
Marketing/Sales costs are based on the opinion and expectations of an expert in this field.
The interest costs are based on the expected loan.
The overhead and unforeseen costs are equal to 10% of the total costs. This is common practice. Among these costs are administrative costs, telephone costs, but it is also a buffer for costs that in reality are larger than estimated.
Based on Table 4 it appears that the expected required budget for the first 4 years of the startup is equal to about €1.200.000. In the first phase we want to apply on grants and government loans such as STW: Take off 1 for feasibility studies (€40k subsidy) and Take off 2 for early stage financing (up to €250k loan). There are multiple funds that provide loans for promising startups. For example, funds such as UNIIQ,  a proof of concept fund that can offer up to €300k in convertible debt financing, and which is partially set up by TU Delft, Erasmus Medical Centre, the University of Leiden and the regional development agency. With these we hope"
Elan_Vital_Korea,2015,Team:Elan Vital Korea#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," facilitate the achievement of the task, the government will take the lead with the support of funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. When it is achieved researchers are taking advantage of new technologies to develop rapid “point-of-need” diagnostic tests that can be used during a healthcare visit to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections and identify bacterial drug susceptibilities — an innovation that could significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.  The availability of new rapid diagnostic tests, combined with ongoing use of culture-based assays to identify new resistance mechanisms, will advance the detection and control of resistant bacteria.
By 2020, significant outcomes in this area will include:
Development and dissemination of authorized point-of-need diagnostic tests that rapidly distinguish between  bacterial and viral infections.
Validation of diagnostic tests that rapidly determine the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria of public health concern.
As proved by these efforts, it is critical to detect antibiotic resistant bacteria as early as possible and eventually to develop “point-of-need” diagnostic test. Our project is to contribute to the early detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria by using quorum sensing. We have succeeded to create plasmids to detect antibiotic resistant bacteria though we are aware that it is rudimentary development of such kind but we believe it is used as a proof of concept and with advanced research efforts, it can be further developed to an extent that it can be used at the health care institutions and nursing homes. Our hope is to develop a simple kit just like diabetic test kit, so that anyone who needs detection of antibiotic resistance can use it.
Current detection methods require complicated procedure. As described in our background of project.(https://2015.igem.org/Team:elan_vital_korea/background#) Consequently, Antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable costs to the US healthcare system that can be avoided by devising ways to diagnose and treat those infections.  Generally, patients suffering from antibiotic-resistant infections require prolonged, more expensive treatments, stay at hospitals longer, demand additional doctor visits, attention and care, and result in greater disability and death than those who were infected but can be easily treated using antibiotics.  The total economic cost of antibiotic-resistance to the US economy is difficult to calculate, but is estimated to be as high as $20 billion of direct healthcare costs, plus additional burden to society for lost productivity of about $35 billion a year. (source: CDC). Unfortunately, information on unit cost for detecting antibiotic resistant bacteria is not available. We have tried to search the website of 100 largest hospitals in the U.S and called 50, but got responded by hospitals that they cannot release exact cost which may vary case by case.

Solid game
I Introduction
    In solid media,things are not so easy as it is in the fluid media. In this case, the bacteria are not mixed at once.Besides, we have to consider the influence of the initial position of each bacterium. Like the situation in fluid media, now for solid media, we still have three characters, the farmers, the warriors and the beggars. And the cute bacteria still face the severe war against another battalion. Now let us learn more about them.
    Farmers are aimed to produce resources for all the bacteria. In our experiment, the ‘farmer’ bacteria can generate invertase to break down glucose; while in our online game, they can produce food for others to make their living. Be careful, your farmer’s food can also be eaten by the enemies so you need to take care of where to initialize them.
    Warriors' skill is to kill enemies. No matter who the enemy is, your brave warriors can kill both farmers and beggars from the enemy troop and can fight against your enemy’s warriors as soon as they meet. But these little combatants can’t make a living without  food from farmers so you have to initialize them within the nutrition range around farmers.
    Beggars are so lazy that they just sit there doing nothing. They don’t produce food so they have to rely on farmers. Also, they are not part of the military force so they kill ‘nobody’.

DI-lambda, the open hardware spectrophotometer
Summary
DI-lambda is an open source spectrophotometer (video 1). In 2014, members of our team began working with high school students through the Open Science School association. Very soon, we were wishing for cheap and easy-to-understand lab equipment. We realized that a basic spectrophotometer, with open documentation, could teach both lab methods and the principles behind them, all at a price low enough for students to use, share and break as often as learning requires.
A spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of light at a certain wavelength. Our device achieves this with open hardware and source code freely available on github. DI-lamba features accuracy equalling top commercial models at a very low price, and is also capable of fluorescence measurements.

DIY spectrophotometers
There have been many attempts to build open source spectrophotometers, but most are not available to the public. Our work includes key features not found in earlier efforts: Extensive documentation about design and building. A troubleshooting guide. Accuracy comparable to existing devices or industry standards. Design for cheap assembly and mass production
1/ One mass production success is the desktop spectrometry kit 3.0 from PublicLab (Fig. 1). (It is actually a spectrometer, not a spectrophotometer!) It looks simple and elegant, produces quality results, and has attracted a  community of users.
Figure 1: Picture of the desktop spectrometry kit 3.0 from PublicLab.
2/ Instructables (Figure 2) gives example: “An Arduino powered microplate spectrophotometer”. This 96 well plate reader is another design inspiration for us.

Stefani also presented a possible design for our booklet.
Udhaya had an idea for a possible slogan we could use, fitting one of our possible logos: “Placing enzymes where they should be”.
2. ) Sponsors:
Sindhu will assign the companies we have so far, so everyone will have to contact 4 to 5.
3.) Equipment:
Verena and Udhaya went through the inherited things from last year’s iGEM-Group. They are now listed in our inventory.
4.) Meetings:
We decided to only hold meetings every two weeks, as every week seems a bit excessive, especially when we meet alternative on Mondays and Tuesdays. The     schedule is in our timetable.
5.) Task for next week:
Everybody should think about a fitting project title until our next meeting.
15.01.15
Present: Verena, Alaa, Udhaya, Julian, Daniel, Avril, Silja, Ela, Prof. Daniel, Heiko Liesegang
Supervisors will be met for monthly update
1.) Useful contacts:
Supervisors Ela (Sequencing) and Silja (Biotech), Head of Unit Prof. Daniel, Bioinformatics Heiko Liesegang, Secretary Daniela, Lab Technicians: Ute & Gabriele, Synthetic Bio Jun.-Prof. Neumann.
Prof. Daniel will meet with Prof. Braus to discuss grants, which will probably require writing a formal letter
Petra from Prof. Daniel's lab used to work as a webdesigner and can be asked for support on the webpage
Supervisors will check the current sponsor list for additional contacts
Silja will do the lab safety talk before we start the labwork
Heiko Liesegang is happy to support the team with Bioinformatics and Industrial appliance of the project (he is situated in the cellar).
Verena will add the supervisors to the dropbox, so they can have access to the list of sponsors, inventory, etc.
2.) Project:
The scaffold protein will be taken from Clostridium thermocellum, which is very well described and has been fully sequenced, as well as a known     structure. The host will be codon optimised E.coli, which can be used with a vector system and can have the structure expressed intra- or     extracellularly. -> Proof of principle on E.coli before large scale adaptation with B.subtilis

Additionally, if any accidental emergency were to happen, all members of the team knew where safety equipments such as fire extinguishers, emergency shut off valves, eye wash station, etc., were located and how to use them. Furthermore, to prevent confusion, all laboratory equipment, such as test tubes, and bottles, had labels with proper identification to ensure that accidental usage of the reagents and other media was prevented.
    3. Operational safety:
    When the experiments are operated in Clean Benches, we light the alcohol lamp in the first place, and then disinfect gloves with alcohol, preventing hands from burning. Gloves are replaced and hands are washed immediately after using ethidium bromide or any of the harmful solutions. There are taped off, designated areas for working with ethidium bromide. These areas are cleaned before and after work and are the only areas the solution may be touched.
Material:
-Bacteria
    We will use E.coli MC1061, Lactococcus lactis NZ3900, Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and its mutant strain L. lactis WH101. No viruses will be used. Our chassis organism is Lactococcus lactis. The strains (Lactococcus lactics NZ3900 and NZ9000) involved in this experiment do not produce any toxic substances or carry resistance marker genes. Lactococcus lactis do not multiply in the form of spores. All the genetic recombination operations are based on homologous gene recombination, therefore they are relatively safe. Even if they accidentally escape the lab, they will not cause large-scale proliferation or have adverse effects on the surrounding environment.

Lactococcus lactis NZ3900
Jiangnan University
Standard strain foe food grade selection
based on the ability to grow on lactose.
It is a progeny of NZ3000, a strain in
which the lactose operon, that is generally
present on plasmids, has been integrated
into the chromosome and the lacF gene
was deleted. Deletion of lacF gene makes
this strain unable to grow on lactose
unless lacF is provided on plasmid.
Lactococcus lactis NZ9000

A specific chassis for specific environments: Seas & Oceans
==
A duo from the sea
==
As seen in the
overview
our biosensors should work optimally in native marine conditions (approximately 24-30 g/L NaCl). Moreover it has to attach to sponges and stick with them without disturbing the microbiome for as long as possible. Therefore it is necessary to use a bacterium naturally present on sponges, may it be an epibiont or a symbiont.
Unfortunately it is a condition for which no current chassis in iGEM is ready for. It is still worth noticing that an interesting first effort toward a marine chassis was initiated by UCL 2012.
To be up to the task the bacterium should:
be massively present on the sponge surface / avoiding being in an unfavourable position for food competition.
be found mainly in sponges / avoid spreading to species in contact with sponges.
be the phenotypically closest possible  to a known bacterium / avoid cell cultures difficulties.
To be up to the task the sponge should:
be numerously present in the ocean / avoiding putting species in danger.
be a natural host of the bacterium / avoid adapting its microbiome to the new epibiont.
be easily grown in a laboratory / avoid sponge culture difficulties.
The closest combination sponge/bacterium that could fit these requirements is
Spongia Officinalis / Pseudovibrio denitrificans
==
Born to filter: Spongia officinalis
==
Spongia officinalis has been used for millennia and for various purposes: from the Greeks for bathing and lining their armours, to today's pharmaceutical attempts to produce anti-inflammatory and other therapeutics, not even mentioning the use by Arabic physicians as early as 932 A.D of soaked sponges with narcotic drugs to place over the patient’s nose to provide a state of anesthesia. In a nutshell everyone knows the ""bath sponge"".
Spongia officinalis is a leuconoid sponge. A leuconoid sponge has a thick body wall, and the ostia open into incurrent canals that draw water into the sponge’s body. These incurrent canals open into chambers that are lined with choanocytes. Water flows from these chambers into excurrent canals that empty into a relatively small spongocoel. From there, water"

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Implementation#realWorld_-_-_TEXT.html,". A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Cooper_Union,2015,Team:Cooper Union#DeNovoSynthesis_-_-_TEXT.html,".  The methodology was based on a paper by Rogers et al. at Johns Hopkins [3].  After the reaction is complete, the DNA should be bonded to the glass by a disulfide bond.  To test that our glass slides had DNA on them, we would use ethidium bromide since it is known to attach to DNA strands.
In parallel with the glass slides, our team designed three mutated TdT sequences based on a paper by Repasky et al.[4]   In order to characterize these forms of TdT, we would have to ligate them into a high copy expression vector and then transform them into a cell line optimized for expression.  Protein purification of these cells would then follow.  Finally, we would have to test this protein by treating oligonucleotides with the TdT and running them on a polyacrylamide gel.  This would reveal whether or not the TdT can add base pairs to the free three prime end of a DNA molecule.
The intein based TdT system was the last biological component of our project.  It is a useful addition if the synthesizer utilizes heat-labile nucleotides.  Ideally, the final system will utilize U.V.-labile nucleotides which would make this system superfluous.  Despite this, we still worked on this angle of the project since U.V.-labile nucleotides can be very expensive.  In order to circularize TdT, we would have to design a linker sequence between the N and C termini of the protein.  We decided to use the software developed by the 2014 Heidelberg team to design an optimized sequence of amino acids to link the N-terminus of TdT to its C-terminus.  Their program yielded an amino acid sequence that would circularize the TdT protein.  Using this sequence and Heidelberg’s intein system, we designed g-block DNA sequences that would allow for the synthesis and purification of various forms of heat stable TdT.

iGEM Stuttgart
In 2017, iGEM TU Darmstadt worked with chitosan-producing and chitosan-modifying enzymes. This year’s iGEM team from the university of Stuttgart is working with chitosan, as well. In this context, iGEM Stuttgart contacted us asking for help and advice. Since, we were excited to hear of another team seeing the potential in chitosan as an antimicrobial coating, we were happy to help.
In agreement with our team members from 2017, we sent them the most relevant parts of the 2017 iGEM TU Darmstadt project. Stuttgart planned to produce chitosan in one single cell, using our chitin synthase ( NodC ) and chitin deacetylase ( NodB ). Based on the work and progress of our last year’s team, we could provide Stuttgart with helpful information concerning chitosan research. In particular, discussions with experts such as Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher helped us to recognize and tackle problems coming up during lab work. We recommended the team to contact him and other researchers.
Before the European Meetup, we had agreed on meeting the team there and answer questions, which were still unanswered in a personal conversation. During the Meetup we talked about the chitindeacetylase NodB and pointed out which difficulties we had come across during expression, purification and the assays. Also, we recommended them the kit Prof. Dr. Moerschbacher had suggested. Due to the problems with NodB inclusion bodies, we recommended them to use COD from Vibrio cholerae instead. The team appreciated our recommendation and"
Groningen,2018,Team:Groningen#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," miscommunication these supposedly superior samples originated from cells that were not supported with Phenylalanine in their grow medium.
The GC-FID results of all three measurements were negative.
One potential explanation of this result is, that glass bead cell lysis is usually performed in 1 minute steps with 1 min ice cooling steps in between to prevent enzyme degradation. As enzymes are of no interest to our measurement this was skipped. During the 10 minutes of vortexing the movement of the glass beads could have risen the temperature of the contained liquid so much that styrene evaporated and left the Eppendorf immediately after opening.
The GC-FID runs therefore only give qualitative and not quantitative styrene measurement. The absence of styrene in the GC runs from 15 October cannot be interpreted as the yeast strain not working as the sample preparation was suboptimal and not validated with blanco cell material with exogenous styrene.

Aim Calculation of styrene production per amount of dry weight (DW) S. cerevisiae
Using peak area of the peak at the retention time of styrene (17,5min) and OD600 of cell cultures an estimate was made of the amount of styrene produced per DW.
Values:
- Kdw: 300mgDW/L/UnitOD600 is assumed as value obtained from the Molmic group.
- D: density of styrene: 0,909
- P: is peak area- peak area negative control
- Pref: is the peak area of 0,5% styrene
Formula:
styrene/DW(ug/mg)=((P/Pref)*0,5%*D*1.000.000)/(Kdw*OD600)

The Binding Partner CT33 and the Inducer Fusicoccin
Fusicoccin is a small molecule that is produced by the fungus Fusicoccum amygali. [9] It is an organic compound with varying ring structures and because of its size, able to diffuse through cell membranes. Fusicoccin is a phytotoxic molecule, meaning it has detrimental effects on plants.[10] It is unknown yet if fusicoccin could have any detrimental effects on the human body. However, Skwarczynska, Molzan, and Ottmann experienced no deleterious effects of fusicoccin in HEK293T or in HeLa cells up to a concentration of 60 µM.[11] One of the binding partners of 14-3-3 is plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase, this protein transports protons over the plasma membrane. This interaction is greatly stabilized by fusicoccin, which binds into a gap between 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase (see Figure 2 ).[12]
Thus the activity of the H+-ATPase is increased when fusicoccin is present, leading to an increase of the membrane potential and metabolic processes.[13-14]] Those C-terminal regions to which 14-3-3 proteins bind have been isolated and are called CT33 (the last 33 amino acids of the C-terminal region of the H+-ATPase. CT33 is thus a 33 amino acid long protein, which needs a free C-terminal end in order to achieve a"

Summary
The friendship between University of Science and Technology Beijing(USTB) and Tsinghua University began from the middle of last century. In 1952, Beijing iron and Steel Industry School (The predecessor of USTB) was found. It was under the support of the teachers and students in Tsinghua University that our academes could be able to set up and perfect gradually developed. Because of the deep friendship between two universities, we contacted the IGEM team of TSINGHUA University, Tsinghua-A. Thanks to the help of the members of Tsinghua-A for helping us solve some problem through our communication and learning with each other.
Project communication
We hoped to visit the laboratory TSINGHUA University, so being the host, they introduced their IGEM project to us firstly. Most members in their team are majored in automation, so we were not familiar with the Professional NOUNs like ‘noise reduction processing’ and information theory. But through a brief description, we could be able to get the point that they were interested in the problem of noise in the process of signal transmission, they hoping to methods of mathematical modeling to display how noise can have impacts on the process of signal transmission.
Considering most members in their team are not majored in biology, we used some simple words to explain our idea rather than biological professional nouns. We mainly introduced characteristics and application of traditional Chinese medicine, notoginseng. The idea that we use notoginseng as culture medium directly for fermenting E.coli caught their attention. Then we focused on explaining the process of our double plasmid system experiments, and talking about that the phenomena were contrary to our expectation. Their assistant were interested  in our experiments. He discussed about the feasibility of some experiments.

Modeling the Gene Regulatory Network
Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucB/A gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
Though the context of the model can extend back to the transcription of PrrA/B genes involved in integration oxygen and light signals, a preliminary testing model was developed using assumptions of certain initial conditions to isolate the light signal's effect.  Since Cph8 and OmpR are located on the same transcript downstream of the puc promoter region, it was assumed that their associated protein and mRNA had already reached steady state concentrations.  Moreover, the concentrations of the factors were assumed to be equal at this state.  The model whose diagram was constructed in the Simbiology Toolbox distributed by MathWorks details key reactions leading to the translation of the pucB/A genes.  The reaction rate equation used for the phosphorylation of OmpR as a consequence of the light signal reaching Cph8 bound to OmpR is capture in a modified form of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  A logic function that corresponds to light ON/OFF (1/0) multiplies the maximum reaction rate in the numerator.  Thus, the model assumes that no phosphorylation occurs by this mechanism in the absence of light.  The OmpC promoter binding equation was based on the Hill Equation for a Repressor (1).
Component characterization steps and literature searches are underway in order to obtain quantitative parameters for the reaction rates.  In order to simulate behavior of the system, putative values were included that exaggerate true concentrations and time scales.  OmpR was given an initial concentration normalized to one, and all other components were"

- Parameter: $d_l\Rightarrow $ Rate constant of degradation of lacI
25) Binding of IPTG to lacI
- Reaction: lacI+IPTG $\to$ inactivated lacI
- Property: Since lacI a homotetramer, IPTG can bind to any of the four subunits t inactivate it.
- Concentration of active lacI (presumably at steady state): $I_l(t)=I^*(t)(\frac{K_i}{K_i+IPTG})^4$
- Parameter: $K_i \Rightarrow$ Dissociation constant of lacI-IPTG
Based on all the reactions and events listed above, we are then able to explicitly describe how the concentration of each type of molecules of interest change over time. We will integrate the information we have so far and begin to write out the equations.
The first ODE describes the change of AHL concentration inside a cell. The time scale taken into consideration is relatively short, so we omit the impact of cell division and death. The change of AHL concentrations involves AHL synthesis, degradation, diffusion and binding to LuxR.
$$ \frac{d}{dt}H(t)=k_0I(t)-r(H(t)-H_{ex}(t))-2k_1(H(t))^2(R(t)-2C(t))^2+2k_2C(t)-d_1H(t) $$   The following equation describes how the concentration of luxR-AHL complex changes over time. $$ \frac{d}{dt}C(t)=k_1(H(t))^2(R(t)-2C(t))^2-k_2C(t) $$   The following equations define the inhibitory effects of CRISPRi and lacI protein on their target sequences, respectively. $$ c_{crispri}=\frac{C^*(t)}{K_m^*(t)+C^*(t)} $$   $$  c_{lac}=\frac{I_l(t)}{K_d^*(t)+I_l(t)} $$ LuxI protein concentration is supposed to change the way described by the ODE below. $$ \frac{d}{dt}I(t)=(1-c_{crispri})*[l_1+\frac{a_1(C(t))^{\beta_1}}{(K_m^{\beta_1}+(C(t))^{\beta_1})}]-b_1I(t) $$  The dynamics of luxR monomer is rather simple, as described below. $$ \frac{d}{dt}R(t"

Competition experiment
Intraspecies competition experiments are an appropriate tool to monitor how mutations of certain genes can affect the fitness of the respective bacterial population under certain conditions. Co-cultivation of two strains which differ in a single locus on the chromosome and which express the fluorophores YFP and CFP is an illustrative way to visualize the competition between those strains.
The Material
LB medium
SP agar plates
Minimal medium (or the desired medium)
Glycerol (50%)
NaCl (0.9%)
The Procedure
Use a fresh colony of the B. subtilis strains of interest, one strain should express YFP and the other strain CFP, to inoculate 4 ml LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics. Incubate the cultures overnight at 28°C and 220 rpm.
Prepare cryo cultures with an OD600 of 1.0 of the overnight cultures.
Prepare three pre-cultures of the cfp- and yfp-labeled strains. Inoculate 4 ml LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics with 1 µl of the cryo culture which have an OD600 of 1.0. Incubate the cultures overnight at 28°C and 220 rpm.
The next morning, measure the OD600 of the pre-cultures of each strain and use those cultures, which have a similar OD600 between 1.0 and 1.5.
In 100 ml shake flasks inoculate 20 ml of minimal medium (or the medium in which you will perform the competition experiment) to an OD600 of 0.05 with each of the two strains you want to analyze. This step ensures that your strains are mixed in a 1:1 ratio at the beginning of the experiment.
Harvest directly 10 ml of the culture (point of time t0) in a 15 ml falcon tube by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 g.

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Enzyme_-_-_TEXT.html," that fusion proteins are able to maintain both their enzymatic activity and their binding activity, we create fusion proteins with our polyphenol degrading enzymes and the FBDs. We test the activity of the resulting fusion proteins on the natural substrate of each of the original enzymes.
The last step is to test the original enzymes and the FBD-fusion versions on their ability to degrade Anthocyanins. We envision doing this in two ways: by testing them on Malvidin directly and by testing them on fabrics stained with wine.
Confirming expression of our proteins
After obtaining E. coli BL21(DE3) strains able to express our polyphenol degrading enzymes, we decided to focus our work on four of them, BpuI, CatA, XylE and BG1. We decided to postpone the experiments with PPO2, since it forms inclusion bodies that would demands a complicated setup to make the protein functional. We also decided to postpone the experiments on TanLpI due to the fact that its measurement required stopping the reaction and coupling a second reaction to measure the product. Therefore, the experimental setup was complex as well.
The first step was to check whether we were correctly expressing our proteins of choice. Figure 3 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the cell extracts performed with the cells in which expression of the proteins was induced. The cell extract protocol can be seen in the methods part of this project.
Figure 3 SDS-PAGE gels for expression of BpuI, CatA and XylE. Sample preparation: E.coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the proteins were induced for 5 hours with 0.5mM IPTG. After 5 hours, the OD(600nm) was measured, the cells centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in Laemmili sample buffer to a final OD of 10. The cells were cooked at 95ºC for  10 min, and 10uL of the resulting solution were loaded on the gel. Ladder used: Kaleidoskope. Staining: The gel was washed 3x with miliQ water to remove the SDS and staining was performed using BioRad Comassie for 30min. De-staining was performed by leaving the gel in miliQ water for 1 hour with gentle shaking.
As expected, no overexpression was observed in BL21(DE3), whether it was induced or not induced. BpuI was correctly overexpressed, with the observed size being the expected, around 59kDa. CatA overexpression was very mild, but"

Detect and Destroy: Building FRED and OSCAR
Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a group of recalcitrant carboxylic acid-containing compounds which are byproducts of the bitumen extraction process in the northern Alberta oil sands. These toxic and corrosive compounds are part of the solid and liquid wastes deposited into large holding areas called tailings ponds, which pose a potential environmental and economic concern to Alberta and to other areas. The University of Calgary 2012 iGEM team aims to develop a collection of NA-sensing and degrading organisms for their detection and bioremediation.
FRED and OSCAR are the two projects we are working on this year. Take a look at the description below to learn more!

Introduction and Motivation
In order to suppress transcription of the mecA gene, we need a way to deliver our silencing system to the antibiotic resistant cells. To accomplish this, the CRISPRi and sRNA genes are cloned into an engineered conjugative plasmid in closely related cells. The cells with the engineered plasmid are referred to as “donor” cells, and they are introduced to the target population, also known as the “recipients”. The plasmid will transfer from donors to recipients via conjugation, and we refer to these recipient cells with the conjugative plasmid as “transconjugants”. The transconjugants will, in time, be able to retransmit this plasmid. Thus, the system will propagate throughout the infection, thereby disarming the antibiotic resistant cells.
Bacterial conjugation
We model the propagation of our plasmid for a number of reasons. Most importantly, we want to determine the optimal time to apply antibiotics to the infection. To do so, we track the total number of donor, recipient, and transconjugant cells and define the “fall time” as the time it takes the number of recipients to reach 10% its initial value. In addition to determining when to apply methicillin, the model can be used to find how large of a conjugation rate is needed and what initial concentration of donor cells is needed to spread the plasmid at a fast enough rate.
Unfortunately, modeling such a system poses quite a bit of difficulty. The primary obstacle is that we consider S. aureus growth on a solid surface (e.g. a lab plate, or on your skin) and not in a well mixed environment. This forces us to abandon more traditional models of conjugation (such as from Levin, Stewart, and Rice) and develop a spatial model instead. We took two main approaches to developing such a model: an agent-based model (ABM), and a partial differential equation (PDE)"

Plate was prewarmed for 10 minutes to reach 37 degree Celsius before taking the initial reading (0 minute). Readings were taken per 5 minutes for 1 hour.
The unbinding of doxorubicin from DNA double helix results in the de-quenching of doxorubicin fluorescence signal. The increase in fluorescence signal hence proves the release of doxorubicin from NDC.
In the above figures, fluorescence ratios of sample to free dox are plotted against time for the first 1 hour (Fig.11 and Fig.12). As seen from dropping free doxorubicin fluorescence, doxorubicin could be photobleached[5].  This calibrates the effect of photobleaching in a short period of time. However, due to photo recovery of signal of doxorubicin at 16, 24, 48 hour, it is not favorable to calibrate the fluorescence signal to free dox since photo recovery of free dox leads to the underestimation of fluorescence signal.
Fluorescence of drug loaded NDC was divided by fluorescence of 6 μM doxorubicin in the same plate to calibrate the effect of fluorescence photobleaching. As shown, fluorescence signal of NDC in pH 5 increases significantly in the first 20 minutes of incubation whereas others remains relatively consistent. However, the fluorescence signal of drug loaded NDC at pH 5 doesn’t reach that of 6 μM doxorubicin, showing incomplete release, and an equilibrium is reached since the binding and release are reversible. The release of Tb and Td have similar trends with Td having slightly lower release ratio.
Strand displacement
We have shown in the above PAGE formation of desired displacement outputs using inputs DNA-21 and DNA-217. By fluorescence measurement, we hoped to better study the dissociation of Strand 5 and from the nanostructure upon binding to inputs. We assembled NDC and NDC-AS using FAM-conjugated Strand 1 and Iowa Black®-conjugated Strand 5. Displacement of Strand 5 away from Strand 1 could be detected by fluorescence of FAM, freed from the quenching by Iowa Black®.
Much higher fluorescence of FAM was detected in NDC displaced by DNA-21 compared to NDC without input. This confirmed effective displacement of Strand 5 by DNA-21. Displacement by DNA-217 was lower, since it was designed to bind distal to the toehold"

Enfin, un dernier élément, le système de « furtivité ». Pourquoi et par rapport à qui ?
Un vecteur, faisant généralement plus de 60nm et pouvant être chargé, est détecté par le système immunitaire. C’est l’une des principales problématiques de cette technologie. C’est pourquoi des systèmes de « furtivité » ont été élaborés.
Tous les vecteurs n’ont pas les mêmes composants, ni les mêmes possibilités. Chaque type de vecteur a donc des caractéristiques propres.
Haut de page
Les types de vecteurs [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
Il existe deux grandes classes de vecteurs, les vecteurs biologiques et les vecteurs chimiques.
Un premier type de vecteurs biologiques, les vecteurs viraux. Les vecteurs viraux sont des particules virales véhiculant un génome artificiellement modifié, au regard de celui de la souche virale dont le vecteur est dérivé.
Les virus représentent les vecteurs naturels les plus évolués pour le transfert d’une information génétique étrangère dans une cellule. De nombreux virus ont donc fait l’objet d’adaptation en vecteurs : les plus avancés sont les rétrovirus, les adénovirus et les virus adéno-associés (AAV).
Le cycle viral naturel se divise en deux phases distinctes : infection et réplication. L’infection consiste en l’introduction du génome viral dans la cellule. L’expression des gènes viraux aboutit dans un second temps à la formation de nouvelles particules virales, c’est la réplication.
Au cours de la production de virus recombinants, les particules virales encapsident un génome modifié contenant la cassette d’expression du gène d’intérêt"

Unfortunately, the agar plates from yesterday’s mixed culture didn’t show any colour which might be due to contamination. Therefore we did not evaluate these plates any further.  We also had some problems with the shaker and lost the culture containing the aeBlue construct. A test was run on how to dilute a mixed culture of the remaining eforRed and amilGFP constructs in order to be able to count colonies of each colour on large agar plates.
The transformation of the eforRed construct did not work (no colonies on agar plate) and has to be repeated.
The first continuous cultivations were carried out in order to get to know the routines and problems of a continuous cultivation. Due to problems with the regulation of pumps no valuable results were produced but the setting was improved based on these experiences.

60-Second Biology
In the view of the difficulties of biology, it’s quite hard for all the college students to understand the professional article, let alone the individuals in the society, besides, they even do not have time and effort to finish the literature. Our IGEM team set out a new approach of popularizes the synthetic biology—the 60 second biology science.
Our human practice this year took the different backgrounds and needs of the general public into consideration. We made extensive use of the Internet platform and tried our best to enlarge popularization of synthetic biology in China. To be more specific, we made audio to introduce IGEM and molecular biology which were limited in 60 seconds so that the message is efficiently sent to the audience, and draw the attention of the public. What’s more, all the audios of 60-Second Biology were recorded by our team members for promoting popular science. All the articles which came from the journal Nature or Science are carefully selected by us and we updated them regularly. Putting the video on line, we directly influence 500 people. Playing on the school radio, the people who get the news in our school reach to 20 000.
And above all, we translate some"
Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," rural development, general public that was interested in bees, and the iGEM team Tec-Chihuahua 2018.
Here we had the opportunity to introduce for the first time synthetic biology to regional beekeepers and important members of government associations. We made two posters to explain attendees this science branch, from which a lot of people got interested and got close to try to learn more about it. Here we show the two posters we made, the one which explained what is synthetic biology and the other where we explained our project, this in order to give an example of how we have used this technology.
We discovered we woke up people's curiosity and decided to open their panorama by giving an example of synthetic biology application in bees, so we presented our project. Thanks to this, everyone could find out about this new science approach by asking us questions, so they could give us their feedback after our presentation.
The public shared their opinions and their concerns about synthetic biology, but more than that, we solved people’s confusions and established conversation to spark new minds into synthetic biology.
“With synthetic biology, are you going to genetically modify the bees or the larvae?”
This was the question that was asked the most. We noticed that beekeepers were really concerned about this method, which gave us a chance to explain detail by detail the difference between genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
We were able to impact positively more than 300 hundred people including beekeepers, concerned citizens, and respected government authorities. Also, we could inspire beekeepers to try biotechnological products on their apiaries after getting well informed on how they would work in their beehives.
We know not everything stays in the lab or just in words for theoretical explanations, that's why we decided to make some field work. On the last day of the forum, beekeepers invited us to attend to different local apiaries, where we learned everything bees had to teach us and received great knowledge every beekeeper shared with us.

One  question of interest is whether  the increment observed in the ratio IF/OD is caused by an incement of fluorescence during the time elapsed, or it is caused by a varying dilution effect due to a decrease in the specific groth rate during that period [1].
To answer this question notice that the absolute growth rate can be obtained from the regression model OD(t)= p1+p2*t obtained above. Notice t is expressed in minutes in our model. Indeed, the specific growth rate at time instant t can be roughly estimated as mu(t)= [dOD(t)/dt]/OD(t). This gives mu(t) = p2*60/(p1+p2*t) if mu(t) expressed in h^(-1).
Therefore, we took our models and weighted them by mu(t60) and mu(t120) respectively. The result can be seen in figure 6. Indeed, the increment observed in fluorescence from t=60 to t=120 minutes could have been caused by a dillution effect. Of course, the main point to keep is that the ratio IF/OD (or, alternatively IF/OD*mu(t)) increases with temperature. So...our construction works!

Modeling Yeast
For our yeast construct: How long have you been fermenting? We propose a phenomenological model to explain the relationship between glucose concentration and fluorescent protein production. The following model was assumed:
where
x1 = yeast concentration
x2 = glucose concentration
x3 = fluorescent protein
γ3 = degradation/dilution rate for the fluorescent protein
k0 = basal production of fluorescent protein
kpn = Hill-like coefficient. Notice that the exponent n also appears associated to x2.
The graph below shows a simulated theoretical time evolution for the three variables.
As observed in the figure, once the glucose is depleted, the concentration of fluorescent protein increases from a basal value. Compare this results with Yeast fluorescence results

Batch Purification, continued
We continue troubleshooting our batch purification protocol, this time trying it out on another sample of lysate. We did notice that yesterday, when we first diluted our lysate in 1X Binding buffer in a 1:1 volume ratio, coagulation and precipitation appeared. As the contents of the tube came closer to room temperature, coagulation and precipitation lessened, but still present. We suspect that the lysate sample used yesterday had excess contaminants that led to this unexpected precipitation. Today, when diluting our lysate sample in 1X Binding buffer, again in a 1:1 volume ratio, the solution became a bit cloudy, but no evidence of precipitation or coagulation. We interpreted this as a good sign and continued on with our purification protocol.
Modification to Protocol : Instead of centrifugation after adding the Elution Buffer (250 mM Imidazole), we used gravity filtration to filter out the solvated Tamura proteins from the resin pellets. After checking this filtrate under a UV box, it glowed green, verifying the presence of solvated Tamura.
Resin Preparation
1. Add 4 mL of Histidine resin to a 50mL Falcon tube.
2. Add 8 mL of DI water.
3. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 700g at 4 degrees Celsius. Decant supernatant.

We generated new competent E.coli KRX cells.
For the extraction of genomic DNA we cultivated Xanthomonas campestris B100 and E. coli BL21(DE3). The bacterial strains we got from a working group at our University. After cultivation we isolated the genomic DNA. The DNA was needed as template for PCRs to purify the wanted laccase ORFs.
Primer design for the isolation of laccases from genomic DNA of Xanthomonas campestris B100 and E. coli BL21(DE3) and from plasmid pBpL6 Bacillus pumilus ATCC7061.
In a team meeting earlier in the project we decided that we want to express the laccases under control of an inducible T7 promoter so we can choose the time point of induction. Additionally we decided that we want to use a c-terminal His-tag. Therefore the forward primers were designed with T7 promoter, RBS and the first 20 bases of the wanted gene. The reverse primers were designed with the last 20 bases of the wanted gene without the stop codon, a His-Tag and two stop codons.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Best Blood Practices
Governing Guidelines
We looked into the guidelines reported in the Public Health Agency of Canada when looking at working with blood. Per the Canadian Biosafety Standards, there are no issues working with animal blood in a control level I lab since the blood is not being introduced to any human pathogens or any specimen that is at a higher risk level. Any work done in the lab should still be treated with good microbiological lab practices (Canada & Agency, 2016). The Canadian Food Inspection Agency does not have any stipulations about working with animal blood use in a lab or transportation within Canada (Branch, 2015). Guidelines may be different depending on the country you live in and should be looked into before working with blood in your lab.
Safety Considerations
When working with pigs blood and/or cells in the lab, we practiced extreme caution in order to ensure the safety of our fellow team members and advisors. The safety precautions that  we followed included, wearing all the proper personal protection equipment (lab coats, gloves, and safety glasses). We also ensured the proper disposal and cleaning of lab equipment that came in contact with the pigs blood: petri dishes, pipette tips, volumetric pipette tips, paper towels and glass containment vessels used to transport the blood, using biohazard bags as a primary means of storage until loaded into an autoclave. After using mechanical equipment and lab space, we take time to make sure the equipment and lab bench is properly cleaned and sterilized with a 12.5% bleach solution followed afterwards by a 70% Ethanol solution rinse of the surrounding area. Upon reception of the blood in the sealed glass vessel the containers were surrounded by plastic bags and then placed into either a styrofoam transport container or a cardboard container. Once in the lab the glass container was removed inside a fume hood along with pouring of the initial blood solution in the fume hood.
Blood Experiment Considerations

with the specific growth rate µ and the cell count X. The specific growth rate is dependent on the concentration of the growth limiting substrate (e.g. glucose) and can be described as
(7)
with the substrate concentration S, the Monod constant KS and the maximal specific growth rate µmax ( Monod, 1949 ). Because LB medium is a complex medium we cannot measure the substrate concentration so we have to assume an imaginary substrate concentration. Due to the diauxic growth two different substrates with different Monod constants and consumption rates are necessary to model the cell growth. The amount of a substrate S can be modeled as follows
(8)
with the specific substrate consumption rate per cell qS. The whole model for the diauxic growth of E. coli on LB medium with two not measurable (imaginary) substrates looks like:
(9)
The specific BPA degradation rate per cell qD is modeled with an equation like eq. (7). In the beginning of the cultivations, when E. coli growths on the ""good"" imaginary substrate S1, no BPA degradation is observed. When this substrate is consumed, the BPA degradation starts. The model for this diauxic behavior is as follows:
(10)
Figures 3 - 6 show a comparison between modeled and measured data for cultivations with BPA degrading E. coli. In Tab. 1 the parameters for the model are given, obtained by curve fitting the model to the data.
Model for the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB
The cultivations and BPA degradation of E. coli KRX carrying a fusion protein consisting of ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, ferredoxinbisd and cytochrome P450bisd differ from the cultivations with the other BPA degrading BioBricks. Thus, the model for these cultivations has to be adjusted to this behaviour. First of all, no diauxic growth is observed so the growth can be modeled more easily like
(11)
The BPA degradation starts when the imaginary substrate is depleted, like observed in the other cultivations with BPA degrading BioBricks. But it seems that the BPA degradation is getting slower with longer cultivation time. So it is modeled with a Monod-like term in which the specific BPA degradation rate is dependent from the BPA concentration:

with the maximal specific BPA degradation rate qD,max and the constant KD.

Results:    At 37 μl / min injection conditions, the chip does not produce bubbles and clogging, but there will be a small amount of beads being washed into the downstream chamber. How to eliminate this part of error led by these magnetic beads of is still need to considerate as the improvement of the project.
Ⅲ. Optical part:
   On the one hand, our chip is the carrier of biological reactions, on the other hand, the chip is also our optical detection platform.The object we are going to detect is GFP and RFP.    The detection principle is using a certain wavelength of light through the chip to stimulate the GFP and RFP in the chamber and detecting the light intensity emitted by GFP and RFP.In this way,we can characterize the amount of fluorescent protein produced by engineering bacteria.Thus the relationship between the reaction of engineering bacteria and the light intensity was established.    So the upper part of the chip will not only through the instrument from the excitation light, but also through the emission light from the engineering bacteria. If the chip has a poor transmittance, both the excitation light and light will be seriously attenuated.Thus it will affect the detection accuracy.
3.1Verify high clarity of our chip
We used NOA81 as the material of our chip. In order to characterize the light transmittance of this material, we used fluorescent microglobulin as the source of fluorescence and observed the fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy to characterize the chip transmittance.
Results:
  From A in Figure3.1.1,not only the fluorescence can we detect clearly,but also we can get the position of bubble easily,just like B,only dripping the solution on the glass slide.Compared with C,the blurred detection,We can get that it is high clarity that our chip has the properties of.That’s what we need,high clarify is good for our detection.

Our mail to METU IGEM team
Dear Metu İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity to form a platform where we can discuss our safety issues, what we have done to overcome them and the main parts that have challenged us the most.
After reading your abstract a few questions on the safety of your projects popped into our minds. If you are interested in forming a discussion platform, we would be delighted  receive your answers as this, on the day of the platform will enable your team to see how much progression was made with safety from today onwards.
We would be really grateful to read your questions on the safety of our project too J
iGEM cares about safety, so do we! Lets take a step together and make a change in how we handle this caseJ
Questions
1)      When you change the genetic information of bacteria in bees’ guts this may have the possibility of changing the genetic material of most bacterial flora. Have you thought about a possible solution to this?
2)      Will this change effect the bees honey production and so affect humans and animals health?
3)      How will you manage the amount of Coumaric Acid produced?
4)      Will coumaric acid affect plants which the bees’ touch?
Metu hope your project is going well. It's a pitty we couldn't make it to the national re-union in Istanbul but do hope you made the most of it :)

Their Response
Hi ATOMS Turkiye,
For the first question, we will introduce our gene construct to the bacteria before hand and then introduce it to the host bee via food (a process called paratransgenesis), so it is highly unlikely for the other bacteria to get this part. Also, our system is optimized for b. subtilis, the promoters we used and the products as a whole have slim to no chance of functioning anywhere else.
For the second question, the bacillus strain we selected is native to the bees'"

Protein Screening
Designer proteins , which enhance binding capacities or improve enzymatic activities, have a large potential in both research and biotechnological processes. They are usually created by constructing and screening libraries of mutated protein variants. Proteins with desired properties are selected for in functional screenings. Despite the success of the method, it is labor intensive and limited in throughput. First protein extracts need to be prepared. Second, after successful screens individual mutated proteins must be tracked back to the original strains. Our Sporobeads would eliminate the need to track protein mutants, allowing researchers to screen huge quantities of mutated proteins, only identifying and sequencing these proteins after successful screening. Figures 1 and 2 offer schematics of the process of using Sporobeads for protein screening for either enzymatic or binding affinities.

Fig. 2: The simple protein-screening process in our Sporobeads using affinity binding as a requisite.

Signal Pathway : JAK-STAT Pathway
  There are many signal pathways from plasma membrane receptor to the gene regulation. Figure B is an example of these pathways, MAP kinase pathway linked with RAS pathway. In this pathway,
With existence of signal molecule, receptor kinases dimerize themselves and phosphorylate each other.
This phosphorylated receptor dimer is cognized by Grb2 and recruit SOS protein, the Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor(GEP)
Recruited SOS protein substitute as GDP of Ras protein with GTP.
Ras protein with GTP changes its conformation and activate its own kinase activity(Ras pathway so far)
Ras kinase activate the MAP kinase kinase kinase, MAP KKK(also called as Raf protein) with phosphorylation
MAP KKK activates the MAP kinase kinase, MAP KK(also called as Mek) with phosphorylation
MAP KK activates the MAP kinase, MAP K(also called as Erk) with phosphorylation
Activated MAP Kinase phosphorylates many cytosol proteins.
For example, if Jun TF is phosphorylated by MAP K, phosphorylated Jun go inside of nucleus and activate the transcription to bind to DNA. (MAP pathway so far)
  But to port this signal pathway into the Yeast is not easy because this pathway is related with too many new proteins, while JAK-STAT pathway is easy to port because it doesn’t have many participating proteins. The signal transduction step of JAK-STAT pathway as follows.
   
Cytokine binds to the cytokine receptor with JAK kinase.
Kinases form dimer and are phosphorylated by JAK.
These phosphorylated tyrosine residue is cognized by STAT protein.
STAT which cognize phosphorylated tyrosine phosphorylate other STAT protein.
Two phosphorylated STAT protein form dimer and go inside to the nucleus and activate near gene to bind to the APRE element.
  Because JAK-STAT pathway have only 5 steps while RAS-MAP pathway require 9 steps, we decide to port JAK-STAT pathway to the Yeast.

This is the reverse of the complement sequence (in reference to the ORF of our genes). The sequence we've ordered (that has been shared with you) is only the forward sequence, which makes sense with regard to the NAG1, AGM1, and UAP1 open reading frames. However, this means we have to make sure that the reverseprimers are the REVERSE COMPLEMENT of the sequence we are dealing with. That is the direction the second strand is synthesized in. Another way to think of it is that the last nucleotide in the primer sequence is the one that will have nucleotides added to it by the DNA Polymerase - keeping this in mind with the 5' --> 3' synthesis, you should be set to design the primers.
Now that we all understand primer design, what primers do we need?
The primers between the genes are fairly simple. There are two gaps between the three genes. The primers will span both open reading frames, and incorporate the ribosome binding site in the middle. The 3' end will drive amplification of the desired gene, while the 5' end will facilitate gibson assembly (have I emphasized this point enough?). That means we need 4 primers between the 2 gaps (one going in each direction - don't forget REVERSE COMPLEMENT).
The primers on the very outside of the trio of genes is a special case (I will refer to these as the flankingprimers). We only need to generate primers in the direction of the gene (we don't have to amplify the plasmid), BUT. The ability to add different 5' ends means we can direct incorporation into different backbone plasmids. The bolded, black sequence in the shared IDT G-bits is homologous to the biobrick plasmid backbone. If we use this sequence, we can only gibson-assemble into the biobrick plasmid. HOWEVER, if we add sequence to the 5' end of the 5' flanking primer (draw it out if that is confusing) - we can incorporate additional features, such as the T7 promoter. ADDITIONALLY, if we use a different 5' sequence - say, one homologous to the pUC18 plasmid - we can gibson-assemble the entire trio of genes into the pUC18 plasmid (the one Acetobacter uses in just about every reference).

Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#beta-carotene_-_-_TEXT.html," confirmed that K2151200 results in production β-carotene (Figure 4B) as the absorbance spectrum shows high similarity to the established absorbance spectrum of β-carotene [13] .
Sadly, there appears to be no significant difference of β-carotene levels between the different promoters inserted upstream of K2151200 (Figure 4A).  Our promoters could potentially still have an effect that the absorbance method is masking due to the extended preparation steps (centrifugation and manual pipetting of extracts) that could introduce bias in the measurement.  In order to have a more robust answer to whether these promoters affect overall levels of β-carotene further work would need to be done in making the protocol more quantitative, for example using HPLC.
Following this quantification analysis, the constructs were sequenced, which showed that they did not possess promoter sequences upstream of K2151200 as was intended.  As explained before, we chose our promoters based on their relevant strengths to increase β-carotene as much as possible.  Considering this, we hypothesize that the lack of promoters is due to the stress from producing high levels of β-carotene, heavily selecting for unsuccessful ligation.
A weaker promoter of strength less than the 3 we focused on could potentially result in a notable increase in β-carotene levels, however this increase would be heavily limited due to the limited activity of the promoter.  Sadly, due to time constraints, we were unable to determine whether this would be the case.

We ligated crtE, crtB, crtI, and crtY together to form a composite BioBrick ( BBa_K2151200 ) and submitted it to the registry.
