CCA_San_Diego,2017,Team:CCA San Diego#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," microorganisms with published annotated genes capable of degrading the most abundant PAH in crude oils.
In the second phase, operons were designed as synthetic genes to exclude restriction enzyme sites reserved for prefix and suffix sequences and to improve the %GC content for optimum expression in E. coli. In addition, RBS sequences were introduced between open reading frames and an inducible promoter was cloned upstream of the operons.
In the third phase, the catabolic pathways were cloned into a RK2 plasmid to have the potential to be introduced into various strains of bacteria for the purpose of gene augmentation.

UAlberta,2018,Team:UAlberta#IntegratedHP_-_-_TEXT.html," are trying to treat. Our construct was made in Bl21 DE3 E. coli. This is a lab strain, and therefore survives poorly in the wild, and would likely not be able to spread if we introduced it to the hive. Secondly, we had to consider the environmental persistence of porphyrin. Porphyrin is a light-sensitive molecule, and would degrade if it escaped into the environment, but it is able to persist in the dark space of the bee gut. The inability of porphyrin to persist in lit environments negates the need for a kill switch in our system: there is no need to limit porphyrin production to the bee gut, as the molecule will be degraded if produced in a light environment. An alternative approach would be to use our construct in a bioreactor to biosynthetically produce porphyrin. This approach avoids the environmental considerations involved in introducing E. coli into bee hives, and is therefore a valid ethical consideration in trying to minimize potential negative impacts of our project.
A large part of our ethical considerations this year involved deciding how to work with bees in a lab setting. We chose to work with live bees because it was the only plausible way to work with Nosema (we talk about this more on our safety page). When working with bees we made sure that we were working within iGEM guidelines. We also connected with experts to gain advice on how best to work with bees. We relied on the expertise of community members like Elizabeth Goldie, Dr. Rassol, and Courtney MacInnis. They answered questions that could not be answered by papers, and gave us ideas on how to care for the bees while we tested on them.

Considering researcher safety
The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction team is a computational team, and worked on designing software that not only improve clarity and efficiency in designing synthetic biological parts, but also increase public awareness through education of the next-generation of scientists through outreach.
Considering public safety
To foster appreciation of laboratory processes and understand common safety concerns raised by synthetic biologists, our computational team received hands-on training at the Synthetic Biology Center at MIT with Natalie Kuldell . We carried out two separate experiments inspired by a previous iGEM experiments: Eau d’Coli and e.Chromi; and learned a lot of the basic lab techniques biology students in introductory cellular biology laboratories.  We also discussed extensively safety concerns in the field, from everyday technical concerns (e.g. labeling petri dishes, the correct to remove gloves) to recently implemented policies (considering public and environmental safety).  From the training we began to appreciate the challenges and troubleshooting methods involved with working in a synthetic biology lab and realized the importance of communication and collaboration.  The themes of communication and collaboration were emphasized in the design and testing of the MoClo Planner . We designed our software and user studies for testing with paired collaborators and took meticulous notes of the communication and collaborative techniques students used in designing their biological constructs.
Considering environmental safety through user research
In addition to wet lab training, various domain experts were interviewed throughout the summer and fall semester, from synthetic biology lab instructors and professors to pharmaceutical lab technicians and patent officers on the ethics, biosafety, and biosecurity concerns involved in designing, implementing, and testing synthetic biology software with human users.  The questions and concerns raised in our dialogue with domain experts informed our design process greatly, and also made us realize that greater education and public awareness were needed.  We were inspired to create an art project, SynFlo that educated high school students on the theory and basic safety concerns of biological contamination in a wet-lab environment.  We presented SynFlo to Framingham High School and MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound summer program students . We allowed them to brainstorm and ask questions on the safety concerns involved in synthetic"

Cloning & Expression of sMMO
The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus is an enzyme complex capable of oxidizing the greenhouse gas methane to methanol. The complex consists of three main components all of which are required for proper enzyme function. The hydroxylase component itself is made up of the three subunits α, β and γ which are arranged as a heterodimer (α2β2γ2) (Figure 1). The α subunit houses the active site of the enzyme where the hydroxylation of methane takes place. The reductase component MMOR oxidizes NAD(P)H and transfers the electrons to the hydroxylase. The electron transfer is facilitated by a [2Fe-2S] cluster and a FAD cofactor bound to the reductase. It is assumed that the third component, the regulatory protein MMOB,  has a function in modulating electron transfer as it binds to the same site of MMOH as MMOR [1]. Another open reading frame within the mmo operon encodes MMOD whose function has not yet been clearly determined [2,3]. Despite this uncertainty, we included all components of the mmo operon in our cloning strategy.
Figure 1: mmo operon and subunit organisation of the methane monooxygenase
Growth Kinetics of the sMMO Host Organism Methylococcus capsulatus
For the purpose of ensuring a significant degradation of methane in the cow’s rumen, our organism has to meet several requirements: It has to be well characterized  to simplify the laboratory handling while ensuring low safety risks. Furthermore, the ability to grow fast in the respective environment and high levels of heterologous protein expression have to be given. Another aspect to consider is the ubiquitous occurrence in the cow"

Many brainstorming sessions took place in order to discuss objectives and to decide how we should make our first attempt at the iGEM competition. With great input from ULB Professor L. Van Melderen (Université Libre de Bruxelles), the academical supervisor of the ULB iGEM Team, a calendar was set: the team would take part in the iGEM 2016 Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Once solid, the project received Vincent Blondel, the rector of UCL, approbation and the team could finally focus on the project elaboration and start gathering funds. By that time spring was well and its way. They had no time to loose…

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Humanpratices_-_-_TEXT.html,") biosafety manual to determine the risk level of the microorganisms involved.  According to the WHO manual, a risk level one microorganism is one “that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.” The University of Alberta team is using two non-virulent, relatively harmless strains of Escherichia coli: TG1 and TOP10. Consequently, these microorganisms are classified under risk level one.
      If our project goes completely according to plan this year, there will be no major safety concerns. Our microorganisms, biological parts, laboratory equipment and chemicals are all relatively harmless. The biological parts we are using simply consist of color, antibiotic-resistance (Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, Ampicillin) and repressor genes. In terms of chemicals, other than the myriad of flammable solvents in the lab, the only other regularly used chemical that poses a possible health risk is ethidium bromide ( EtBr ). When exposed to extremely high concentrations of EtBr in experiments, human cell lines have received damage to their DNA. The concentration of EtBr used in our lab (10 mg/mL) is much higher than these levels which have shown toxic effects. To mitigate such risks, good microbiological techniques are consistently used in the lab, so gloves are always worn. The most dangerous laboratory equipments we use are a transilluminator, gel apparatus, and a Bunsen burner. The risks posed by exposure to UV radiation, electric shocks  and open flames can be easily controlled with proper laboratory safety training. At the University of Alberta, the safety of our researchers is always our top priority. When any student first steps in the lab, they must go through the necessary laboratory safety training. Students are taught how to properly use equipment, dispose of wastes, autoclave used glassware and biologically-contaminated waste, disinfect counters and when to wear safety protection. Counters are always clean and uncluttered, and proper pipetting protocol is always used.
      Proper laboratory safety training is practiced by all undergraduate and high school students to ensure cross-contamination does not occur, thus keeping results consistent from trial to trial. Proper technique is also practiced to prevent microorganisms from adhering to our clothes, and infecting others, including family members.
      Our project not going according to plan would pose as little risk as us succeeding. The standard and well characterized biobytes we are using do not have the potential to combine in dangerous ways. As with many other synthesized DNA constructs, we have found that our plasmids are lost from the bacteria over"

Description:
"" Bacteria is a vital decomposer in our everyday lives. It decomposes and recycles things that can be reused in the nature. Our team came to think that this beneficial bacterium might be a solution to the problem regarding increasing trash in the Earth. Of all projects attempting to solve trash problems, research about plastic degrading bacteria is the most popular. However, our team felt that the research has not been efficient enough and fast enough to solve the fundamental problem. Through this research, as a student, we hope to dedicate to what our society is facing.                                                 The fundamental purpose of the research is to generate a more efficient and fast plastic degrading process through the plastic degrading bacteria and make plastic bacteria practically usable. The current bacteria are slow in degrading speed and low in degrading quantity, so our research hopes to find better solution for efficiency.""
KoreaSonyeod is a high school team working also on degradation of plastic. Due to the fact that our team is really concerned about the accumulation of plastic waste, we ventured to help other iGEM teams that also working to solve this problem. Therefore, we contacted team KoreaSonyeod and offered them our help. KoreaSonyeod team focused on PET degradation using a  different enzyme than ours. In their project, the monomers of PET bonds are broken by PETase and MHETase leading to the same two products as in our project - Terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol. As we developed TPA detection protocol, we helped KoreaSonyeod team how to detect TPA, by providing our protocol and mentoring them how to use it property.

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," our homologous structure model it forms a channel, in middle of which the active site resides.  Although MlrA seems to be a membrane protein, there has been studies, where at least some of it is located in the cytosol (3).
PICTURE
There has been a previous iGEM project about degradation of microcystin (Ranger amongst Enemies, Peking 2014). Their device was engineered in E. coli, which expressed MlrA as a part of their project. The MlrA sequence used was from Sphingomonas, but the exact species was not mentioned. Their BioBrick of the enzyme differed in one amino acid compared to the one we found in GenBank and that we have used in our work.
Design
We have three different variants of the enzyme for production in S. cerevisiae as well as a positive control for production in E. coli , since it has been already established that heterologous production of MlrA results in active enzyme (3).
We will use the MlrA sequence from Sphingomonas sp. ACM-396 (LINK TO GENBANK), as it has been characterized to degrade MC-LR, and because apparently it was the one used in Peking 2014 teamâ€™s work. To make sure that we get the best possible protein yields from expression in yeast and E. coli , codon optimization was required.
In mass production the most efficient way to produce proteins is having them secreted into the growing media. This poses a problem as our enzyme is putatively a membrane protein. In the effort of having it secreted, we are using a yeast-specific secretion tag, mating factor Î±. Mating factor Î± is also used to localize membrane proteins into the plasma membrane. We will produce four different versions of the enzyme: MlrAY, MlrAYAlpha, MlrAY3Alpha and MlrAE.
MlrAY, containing no mating factor Î±, should be soluble in the cytosol.
MlrAYAlpha has one secretion tag, which should localize the protein into the plasma membrane.
MlrAY3Alpha has a secretion tag with a triple propeptide part, and so is the most likely of the three proteins to be secreted, if at all.
MlrAE, used as a positive control by production of the enzyme in E. coli. It has been demonstrated earlier that the enzyme is active in this production system.
For the yeast backbone we are using pRS415-GAL whereas pSVA1 is used as the bacterial backbone."

So what I think: people might try to eliminate it as a public health problem. Wherefore you say for something to be a public health problem [it] should be [...] less than 1 in 1000. And those are the targets we are fighting for. So if that is done and there could be some backlog and you see that people are not carrying the chlamydia, [but] it is still around. Of course they are doing something. There is this SAFE strategy so that the chlamydia can not find their way out [...]. But the project is really strengthening, especially in surveillance. In countries where they have reached less than the threshold and the surveillance is very active.

There is a very nice networking. You can see the eyes, you can have data [...], you can upload the data to the server.

George:
For PCR we are taking blood and swabs. These are the two samples that we use. [...] We believe, if chlamydia is not found there, the follicles that are found are not trachomatous follicles. And the other one is we have a standard in terms of follicles if we flip the lid and we see that there are almost five follicles on the center of the lid then we classify that this person has trachoma. We call that trachoma follicular (TF). If the conjunctiva is red also, we add this one has trachoma inflammation. So we call that trachoma TI. So if it’s TF that one could be inflamed or could not be inflamed but he has got some follicles on the lid, especially on the center part. So that’s what we use the most. But the PCR [...] is expensive. We only use it to confirm phenotype. Like Are you saying the truth? Let’s confirm! It´s the gold standard.
Samira:
And how long does it take to analyse the data? What’s the time between Ok, I think this person has trachoma and the treatment with antibiotics?
George:

UESTC-China,2018,Team:UESTC-China#test16_-_-_TEXT.html," size of butanol: initial pH > temperature > initial OD. If the temperature is too high or too low, the initial pH is too acidic and too alkaline, and the initial OD is too large to be favorable for butanol synthesis. Only when these three significant influence factors are in the optimal region, the amount of butanol synthesis can be maximized.
Fig.2    Response surface and contour plots for butanol production
1.4  Model verification
According to the prediction results of the regression equation, the model was further verified under the optimal conditions of butanol fermentation. The verification results are shown in Fig. 3. Butanol reached a maximum of 7.88g/L after 72h, which was 77.08% higher than the optimized butanol yield, and the maximum synthesis rate of butanol was significantly improved.
Fig.3    The butanol production and productivity contrast between optimum and non-optimum
 
2. Biochemical reaction model
We first consider each reaction as an independent kinetic. We assume that the seven-step reaction in the fermentation process is consistent with the Michaelis-Menten equation. The basic model of biochemical reaction can be obtained according to the Mie equation and the law of conservation of mass [6]. The basic model was modified due to the competitive effects of different substrates on the same enzyme and the inhibition of the product. Using MATLAB software to solve the above model, the yield of each product can be obtained with time.
2.1 Basic theory of the model
2.1.1  Michaelis-Menten equation
In biochemistry, the Michaelis-Menten equation is one of the most famous enzyme kinetic models. This model gives the relationship between the enzymatic reaction rate v and the substrate concentration [S] and enzyme concentration [E]. For the following enzymatic reactions:
Where，\({k_f}\)（forward rate），\({k_r}\)（reverse rate），\({k_cat}\)（catalytic rate）denote the rate constants; the double arrows between S（substrate）and ES（enzyme-substrate complex）represent the fact that enzyme-substrate binding is a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of P (product).
When the enzyme concentration is much smaller than the substrate concentration, the product formation rate is:
\[\upsilon  = \frac{{d[P]}}{{dt}} = \frac{{{k_{cat}} \cdot [S] \cdot [E]}}{{{k_m} + [S]}}\]

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2010,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," used in a wide variety of metabolic pathways as cofactors in redox reactions and are available in most organisms. The cofactor has a broad absorption spectrum, with a maximum at 450 nm.
Under the presence of light, absorption of a photon leads to the formation of a covalent adduct between the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue in the AsLOV2 domain, which results in conformational rearrangements in LovTAP. This change impacts the affinity of the shared helix for the two domains: disrupting the contacts between the shared helix and the LOV domain and enabling the association of the shared helix with the TrpR domain, which establishes  DNA-binding affinity at the trpL promoter and LovTAP can then bind to DNA as an homodimer, repressing the transcription of the genes downstream of the promoter.
In the dark, when the shared helix contacts the LOV domain, the TrpR domain's DNA-binding affinity decreases and LovTAP is in an inactive conformation.
Our construction is consequently based on an ""inhibit the inhibitor"" logic. By constructing our reporter genes under a repressed promoter (cI binding site), and having LovTAP repress the inhibitor of said promoter (cI lambda repressor), we establish a direct <IF Light> logic gate.
See also LovTAP .
Signaling Cascade
When our device is struck by blue light, the following cascade will ensure:
Photon input
Lov-domain conformational change
LovTAP dimerization
trpL promoter is repressed
Concentration of cI repressor collapses

SUSTC-Shenzhen-B,2013,Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B#feature.html_-_-_TEXT.html,". In fact, the first version of mindmap was the result of our brainstorm when we were collecting previous iGEM projects. The classification in mindmap is somewhat different. It is idea-driven and can make you to think more. If you are freshman to synthetic biology, you can find it useful to spend some time in mindmap.
Information page
After finishing your retrieving and click one of the circuit in the result list or the deepest level bubble of mindmap, an information page will jump out. The information of a circuit is divided into four parts, information, LGD, feedback, and comment. We will discuss information here. The information part holds information defined in RFC 102, including basic information, ranking, circuit construct, input, output, regulatory information and result. Information such as reference is also included. You can find as many as information that defined in the RFC standard in a prime way. You can also start a new search by clicking the tags. The circuits which have same tag can be found in a result page.
SBOL supported
The information of circuit can be exported as SBOL, which can be used for sharing and data exchanging. The SBOL in our software is an extension of core SBOL and it can record additional information that defined in the RFC 102.
LGD
LGD is short for logical genetic diagram. LGD can utilize an algorithm behind to draw a dynamic diagram of genetic circuit. It is a powerful tool to show the structure of circuit and regulatory relations between parts. And the concept of circuit and the important role of regulatory relations in our software are coordinate with our REF 101 and RFC 102.
Feedback and comment
We call for you to give experience feedback and comment about circuits. Feedback is experience of using this circuit by other people. They can tell the feel after repeat experiment from a perspective of users, not uploader. The feedback proposed must be checked by professional level users before they can be put on the site. If you haven’t use this circuit, you can also comment the circuit in your opinion. And there is no check when proposing comment.
Sharing by uploading
circuit by uploading. In upload page, you can fill out a form and upload. You can also import some information by SBOL. The method can be found in tutorial. Not every blank in the form is a must. You can feel free to fill the least required ones. You can always change or complement the information later. Both the information uploaded and edited must be checked by professional level users to ensure quality. And when the information can be put on the website, you can get an email from the"

Imperial_College,2018,Team:Imperial College#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," asking whether synthetic biology projects can improve lives, especially since public funding for technology is highly dependent on public approval. We can broadly define the main issues in synthetic biology as theoretical and applied. Inspired by Whitford et. al., 2018. Here are the list of socio-ethical issues discussed: 1. Is it ethical to control biology through machines (whether remotely or not)? What sort of legislation would we need if these systems were to scale up to the level of multi-cellular organisms? Are there pieces of existing legislation we could adopt? 2. Would we need to label/inform consumers about the usage of GMOs in future artificial food products made with this technology? 3. If biocontainment and biosafety strategies prove to be rather useful in containing ecological damage or misuse of technology, are the current laws and regulations around the use of GMO/synthetic biology products ethical considering the potential benefit of such products? More interestingly, what if the level of risk using synthetic biology could be measured and thus we are able to perform a cost-benefit analysis on the usage of such technologies? Would we use it? Should we use it? 4. What sort of industries are likely to be disrupted by advances in synthetic biology, and if they are disrupted, what sort of consequences will it have? Consideration of how disruption occurs often affects the resultant consequence. 5. What new industries or markets will open because of synthetic biology (Internet of beings?)? What are the consequences of such new markets? What would these markets look like? 6. If our device can control life, does this make life part of a machine? or does it make machines part of life? 7. What will the UK do when it leaves the EU regarding laws about biotechnology? 8. What are the other potential applications of our project? What would the development of these applications look like? Are they ethical? 9. How would this technology evolve in the future?
Synbio outreach at Imperial
As members of Imperial College London, we participated in many outreach events for Imperial College. At the beginning of our project, we helped supervise a group of sixth-formers with their transformation experiments as well as giving a presentation on synthetic biology in an outreach effort led by Nico McCarty, a Ph.D student. We also hosted various departmental seminars to update academic staff as well as students at Imperial on our project. This culminated in a final seminar with the synthetic biology society at Imperial which also included the socio-ethics discussion above.

At present, our project is still in the laboratory stage and has not yet reach the large-scale application. In order to seek scenarios of large-scale application in a better way.With the help of the instructor group, we held a seminar with the Astronautics Model Team of Anhui University of Technology to develop a social practice program.
We got in touch with a factory in Maanshan(Maanshan Steel Plant), and a six-rotor drone was provided by the model team, as shown in Fig.1 :
Fig.1 Six-rotor drone
Zhao Lei, a member of our team who has studied embedded programming development, used different gas sensors (the gas sensor can detect the mass of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other gases in each liter) and STM32 ARM microcontroller to develope a mountable carbon dioxide detection device on the drone. As the picture shows:
Fig.2 Gas detector
We used this drone to carry the detection device into the air and tested the air nearing the end of the factory's exhaust system. It was found that the concentration of carbon dioxide nearing the smoke extraction device was extremely high,and it is 5-20 times greater than the normal value.As mentioned in the eleven national standards for greenhouse gas management, including Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Reporting for Industrial Enterprises.The mass ratio of the various gases in the exhaust gas from the production process of such factories is about :oxygen: carbon dioxide: sulfur dioxide: hydrogen sulfide: Carbon monoxide: Hydrogen chloride: Fluoride: Nitrogen oxide: Other=14:10:3:3:3:2:3:8:54. After several measurements and averaging , we knew the composition,content and mass percentage of each gas in the factory exhaust gas.

Introduction
1. Inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that                         affects the gastrointestinal tract. It has two major clinically defined forms, one is Crohn's                         disease that can affect any parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and the other is ulcerative                         colitis that affects the colonic mucosa [1]. Although the pathophysiology of IBD is largely                         unknown, some factors that have a major role motivating of IBD have been identified, including                         genetic factors, the host's immune system, and environmental factors [2]. Patients with IBD                         often have symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, and weight loss                         during disease activity [3], which decrease the life quality of patients dramatically.                         Unfortunately, IBD is not curable and IBD patients have a higher risk of developing colorectal                         cancer [1].
Figure 1. Inflammatory bowel diseases. Left: IBD patients have chronic inflammation in intestine tract. Right: Factors contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.
2. War inside the intestine
In general, when the immune system overreacts to the flora normally                         resident in the gut, it causes a series of inflammatory events that may damage and destroy the                         intestinal wall [4]. Some biomolecules are released by bacteria which induce an inflammatory                         reaction to intestinal epithelial cells, causing the destroyed tight"

Background
    Allergy, also known as type I hypersensitivity reaction, is defined as hypersensitivity to substances commonly recognized as harmless, resulting in inflammatory reaction, and symptoms like asthma, rash and running nose, severe allergy can be lethal. These typically harmless substances are called allergens. Allergens are everywhere, people may get exposed to allergens in various ways: direct oral ingestion of food allergens, breathe in airborne allergens like pollens and dust, skin exposure to allergens like latex and the fur or feather of home pets, injection of drugs, or some components in insects' poisons, etc. These years, money spent in combating with allergy is mounting up to astronomical figures. Allergen test is a powerful method to deal with allergy. One will try to avoid exposure to his/her allergens in daily life if their allergens are identified, and their chance to develop allergy will be reduced. That's why most medical centers around the world provide allergen test services.
    As diagramed in figure 1, when a kind of allergen somehow enters the body fluid of someone for the first time, the allergens are captured by antigen presenting cells (APCs), then T cells' recognition of the epitopes presented by APCs, and induces series of signal transduction and cell differentiation events. The overall result is, some of the B cells differentiate into plasma cells, producing IgE specifically targets on different epitopes of these allergens.
Figure 1. The basic mechanism of developing allergy. A: Antigen presenting cells present allergens to T cells via MHCⅡ. B: T cells is induced to differentiate into Th2 cells. C: With the help of Th2 cells, B cells differentiate into plasma cells, secreting specific IgE targets on the allergen. E: IgEs bind to FcεRI receptors in the membrane of basophil granulocytes and mast cells. F: The presence of the allergens induces the crosslink of FcεRI receptors, leads to the release of"

From these dissimilar three genes (NpPSY, NpLCY and crt I) only two transgenes (crt I and PSY) are required to turn Golden Rice into a reality . Last based on the fact that the activity of rice LCYs is obviously not rate limiting, since lycopene doesn’t accumulate and the lycopene cyclase activities isn’t required to proceed down the pathway. Consequently the Golden Rice is yellow-golden colored because of the activity of intrinsic rice cyclases.
Figure 11: Engineered carotenoid pathway in grains of Golden Rice
“What is the intension of producing new Golden Rice generations?”
In further experiments they produced Golden Rice 1 (GR1) and Golden Rice 2 (GR2)(see figure 7). One difference to the first developed Golden Rice prototype is that the used transgenes (NpPSY,crt I) are regulated by the tissue-specific Glutelinpromoter (gt1) instead of in the prototype used constitutive 35S promoter. The last works because of the exclusive effect of the Glutelinpromoter in the rice endosperm. Experiments with PSY genes which are the more active compared to crt I from different sources identified the maize and rice genes as the most efficient in rice grains . Golden Rice 2 contains just ZmPSY and crt I in contrast to Golden Rice 1 (crt I and NpPSY). Another phytoene synthase (psy) from another plant were used because of the fact that the Phytoensynthase of the plant corn (zea mays) had a better achievement as the plant daffodil ( Narcissus pseudonarcissus). Another reason for the development of new Golden Rice generations was the resulting amount of β-carotene levels. Table 2 shows a list of the resulting β-carotene levels by using the different rice generations. To combat VAD in South Asia it is necessary to provide adequate amounts of provitamin A in children's diets. Just the amount of 31 µg/g of β-carotene covers the daily provitamin A requirements of the target population in the absence of a more varied diet to maintain appropriate levels of vitamin A in the body. This underlines the need of GR2 and difference to the other generations.

Several constructs, including PgpdA and afp1, were miniprepped today and PgpdA and afp1 were digested for ligation. In Carotenoids, we unfortunately discovered that pC13CV is also bad, and we suspect that we have the wrong miniprep. Gel electrophoresis showed that pC13A and pC13L are good.

Since the team was established in March, we have worked a lot for our projects. During these months, we determined the topic of our project, found instructors and laboratories, built the plasmids and transformed the engineered bacteria, detected the protein of interest, and verified the bacteria’s functions. With the progress of the project, in order to make our project more beneficial to humans, we have carried out a wealth of human practice such as telling middle school students about cancer-related knowledge, visiting pharmaceutical companies, surveys, and interviewing doctors. Of course, we have also collaborated intensively with other teams. We participated in the 5th Conference of China iGEMer Communication, and helped SKLMT-China iGEM team complete a part of their lab. We invited students from team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai together to visit the Roche Pharmaceutical Factory, and obtained a plasmid we needed with help from team SSTi-SZGD.
Through our efforts, we successfully constructed a plasmid containing T3SS system with neoantigen, transformed the attenuated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proved that the engineered bacteria have the function of causing a specific immune response. Our program will provide a safer and cheaper approach to cancer treatment in the future.

UCC_Ireland,2016,Team:UCC Ireland#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," about the disease would suggest that a prevention may be a much better solution than a treatment. So we concluded that not only is there a need for immunisation against Leishmaniasis, but the need is actually much greater than we had ever anticipated.
Also, the fact that many attempt to treat the lesions with home-made self-remedies indicates that people do actually want to treat the condition, so a viable therapeutic should be welcomed by the population. But it appears that the inconvenience and pain involved in the injected antimony treatment is a major factor in detering people from seeking medical help for the condition. This highlights the need to ensure that the treatment is convenient and that it doesn’t instigate fear to be accepted by the population. More on this will be discussed following our visit to the Choluteca area.
A recording of part of the conversation with Dr. Valladares can be found here
National Autonomous University of Honduras, Tegucigalpa
Leading on from the visit to the hospital, we were eager to learn more about the condition in Honduras, and to deepen our understanding of Leishmaniasis on a scientific level. Thus, we visited the National Autonomous University of Honduras in Tegucigalpa, where we met Dr. Jorge Alberto Carrasco. Dr. Carrasco is head of Immunology and Parasitology in the University, and he is a leading expert on Leishmaniasis in the country. He is also part of the biosecurity council of Honduras.
Figure 3: National Autonomous University of Honduras
Here, Dr. Carrasco lectured us on both the immunology and the parasitology of Leishmaniasis. He explained the immunocellular response to the pathogen. It was noteworthy that immunity to the infection is mainly cell mediated, but humoral immunity can also play a role. This falls perfectly in line with our decision to use the LJM11 protein in our vaccine, as LJM11 is believed to induce both cell mediated and humoral immunity.
We also learned that the lack of diagnosis and treatment ensure that the life cycle of the parasite is maintained. As the parasite continues to move from sandfly to person and vice versa the untreated population act as a reservoir to ensure the infection will continue to spread rapidly. This is why there is such a high demand for immunisation against the disease. Also, as many are infected at a young age (early childhood), it is important that the vaccine can provide immunity against successive infection by different forms of the parasite leading to more severe infections, eg. mucocutaneous or visceral Leishmanias"

Hong_Kong_HKU,2018,Team:Hong Kong HKU#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," Strand 5 by DNA-21. Displacement by DNA-217 was lower, since it was designed to bind distal to the toehold and did not participate in strand displacement. This result implies that strand displacement was the main reason of increase in fluorescence in this experiment.
NDC-AS displaced by DNA-21 showed lower fluorescence than NDC. This was expected because NDC-AS was designed to have extended complementary region between Strand 1 and Strand 5, to increase displacement specificity. Nonetheless, NDC-AS displaced by DNA-21 also showed significantly higher fluorescence than when displaced by DNA-217 and no input. It can be concluded that NDC-AS also functioned as expected in the presence of target sequences.
Therapeutic Effects
Entry - MCF-7 fluorescence microscopy
Entry of NDC and NDC-AS into MCF-7 cells was analyzed under the fluorescence microscope. DAPI, a fluorescent stain that binds strongly to AT-rich region of DNA, was used to stain the nuclei of MCF-7 in blue. Doxorubicin is a self-fluorescence molecule which has a maximum excitation of 480nm, and maximum emission at 595nm [3]. With the natural red fluorescent signal of doxorubicin, the ratio of number of cells with doxorubicin in red to number of nuclei in blue can be calculated. A high ratio suggests greater accumulation of doxorubicin in the cells.
Though entry of NDC-AS was not found to be significantly higher than NDC, both nanostructures when loaded with doxorubicin, resulted in significantly higher intracellular doxorudicin signal than doxorubicin alone.
Though AS1411 did not facilitated drug entry here, we would like to investigate whether it has extra cancer cell killing effect due to its binding to nudleolin. Therefore, we conducted a cytotoxicity assay.
Action - MCF-7 MTT cytotoxicity assay
To show the therapeutic effect of our NDC and NDC-AS, we tested their ability to kill MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line in MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Our MCF-7 were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 20μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with an"

PCR samples are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. Gene ruler DNA ladder mix (red) is used as marker.
Results:
Analysis:
Two weak bands at app. 4500bp and 850bp respectively. The upper band could correspond to the pKJ606 plasmid with insert, and the lower band might indicate VF2-VR without insert, rendering these results rather inconlclusive. Therefore an ON culture for miniprep was made.

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitin synthase_-_-_TEXT.html," from the ÄKTA purification. A band at the size of 21 kDa can be seen (red arrow). This band was verfied to be our enzyme by the following activity assay. Marker is the Page Ruler Prestained Ladder from Thermo Fischer.
UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay
To verify the functionality of the NodC enzyme, the UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase Assay was performed. This assay shows a luminescence, which indicates the conversion of free UDP to ATP. The UDP is set free by the reaction of the NodC enzyme.
The UDP standard curve shows increasing luminescence with increasing UDP concentration. With this curve the conversion to free UDP can be calculated.
The evaluation of the assay with sample 17 (see Figure 9) and 18 (data not shown) shows that the NodC enzyme converts the UDP-GlcNAc to free UPD and a growing oligo-GlcNAc-chain. So the assay shows that the NodC enzyme can create chitin oligomers.
Figure 10.UDP standard curve. The standard curve shows the linearity and sensitivity of the UDP-Glo™ Lycosyltransferase Assay. The curve was prepared over the indicated range of UDP concentration in 25 µl buffer. The luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Values represent the mean of four replicates (N =4) and the standard deviation is shown. For better visibility the values for the small concentrations are shown in the additional graph. The following assays (Figure 11 and 12) are based on this standard curve. RLU = relative light units.
Figure 11. Activity assay of NodC. The NodC (40 ng) was titrated in 1X glycosyltransferase reaction buffer the presence of 100 μM of UDP-N-acetylglcosamine and 10 mM N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor substrate. The reaction was performed as described before and the luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a Tecan200 Infinite Pro plate reader. Each point is an average of two experiments (N = 2), and the error bars represent the standard deviations. RLU = relative light units.
The higher the concentration of the NodC enzyme is, the more UDP is set free. This could be verified by employing a higher concentration of NodC in the assay"

CRISPRi
The origin of the CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing tool
The CRISPR/Cas system is a naturally occurring defence mechanism in bacteria. It confers adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGEs), like phages. CRISPR-Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)- are short segments of repetitive DNA that are identical to each other. Due to the palindromic nature of the sequence, RNA transcribed from these repeats forms hairpin turns. These small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are interspaced with unique DNA sequences known as spacer DNA. These DNA regions encode sequences complementary to MGEs introduced to the cell previously by phages. Upstream of the CRISPR array one can usually find the cas genes. These genes encode the Cas proteins that play an essential role during the different stages of bacterial immunity against intruding DNA. When bacteria are infected by a virus or phage, the CRISPR array is transcribed and the product, crRNA, forms a complex with (multiple) Cas protein(s), called the Cas-crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. Depending on the organism different proteins are involved in this process. The crRNA guides the Cas protein(s) to the invading DNA which leads to degradation of dangerous virus or phage DNA before the infection has started.
The CRISPR ‘revolution’
To date the CRISPR system has been adapted to form a new revolutionary gene editing tool, mostly known under the name CRISPR/Cas9. This technique relies on two main components: the short guide RNA (sgRNA) and the Cas9 protein. The sgRNAs can be split into two parts: the “seed” region, which is a 20 bp sequence that can be easily modified to be complementary to target a gene of interest, and a “handle” region which facilitates the binding of Cas9 to the sgRNA. The sgRNA functions as a ‘guide’ to ensure Cas9 creates double-strand breakage"

When doing the Parts submission, we followed the instructions indicated on the Help Submission site: http://parts.igem.org/Help:Submission
We took care of labelling the samples as DNA (non-hazardous, non-regulated, non-infectious, for research purposes only), and we used prepared box for shippment as container. There was a short delay during the shipment procedure, but BioBricks arrived to the USA.
A part from DNA parts submission, we also had to do shipment when sequencing. For that, we used also a system of prepared labelling of samples and its primers, together with special boxes from the provider.

Each year, the UCSC iGEM team presents to the Bioethics class during the second Summer Session. A few team members diligently prepared a presentation about our questionnaires and project for that purpose. Several of us attended the presentation, and afterwards broke into small groups with students in the class to ask and answer questions about our ethics. Because of this presentation, we learned about the IRB at UCSC and how we needed to get our questionnaires approved, since we were technically working with “human subjects” if we sent it out.
Another small group designed a poster to be displayed at the Annual Physical and Biological Sciences Summer Research Symposium. This poster included details about our three parallel experiments, our research, and our outreach. Three team members presented the information to interested audiences at the Symposium.
After successfully linearizing pUC19 and pXRL2, we repeated the same experiment with larger volumes to get more product for future use. Using this product, we performed several DPN1s and clean and concentrate experiments. The first four tests were failures. We used both our advisor’s reagents and Zymo’s reagents. Our solution that eventually worked was to prewarm the 30 uL water we were using as the elution buffer and let it sit for several minutes, in the final step. On the fifth experiment, the clean and concentrate worked but still not very well. We tried one more time using only 10 uL water to elute and got sufficient concentrations for our Gibson reactions.
This was the week in which we discovered our collective error in the PCR protocol we had used up until this point. This was a lesson to us and the rest of the team about blindly following protocols without questioning them. Upon redoing our PCR experiment with the corrected protocol in a 10uL reaction, our gel showed bands indicating a successful linearization. We also went through the protocol for the creation of chemicompetent yeast cells in anticipation for our transformation into Y. lipolytica. Protocol was successful and yielded 2.5 mL of gly"

As a new team, with limited knowledge of iGEM competition, we desperately needed instructions and suggestions on how to start and manage a team. We have met obstacles and setbacks and we have been seeking advice from 3 teams.
NUDT-China: We invited iGEM NUDT-China that has participated in iGEM for three times to answer our puzzles. During the meeting, NUDT-China introduced the iGEM process, and shared their experience in team building in detail with us. At the same time, they gave comments on our project, and put forward a lot of good ideas.
Nanjing-China: After proposing some initial ideas of our own project, in order to polish up it, some of our team members went to Nanjing University to obtain experience. In Nanjing University, both teams gave a presentation on their project design. As a veteran team, Nanjing-China gave us constructive suggestions which were significant to us. From then on, we gradually became clearer in thoughts and got started with our work.
UESTC-China: The UESTC-China post some plasmids and introduced to us some details about the iGEM.
Counseling
Biosafety issues
Doctor Li Ming is experienced in doing research in horizontal gene transfer and teaching the lecture on biosafety for undergraduates. The biosafety issue is one of the major concerns of both participant teams and organizers of iGEM. Before we started in the wet lab, we asked Doctor Li to evaluate the biosafety issues of our whole project. He introduced the biosafety classifications of different organisms and protection practices among different biosafety level labs. The Vi antigen project was his major concern and he gave us valuable suggestions. He also communicated with Doctor Cong Yanuang to confirm our lab procedures, making sure we were not going to culture S.Typhi but just to extract the genomic DNA of S.Typhi. He helped us analyze whether there were potential transposable elements among the His targeting locus, and the result proved to be negative, which meant the device integrated into the His locus would not be horizontally transferred to other bacteria. At last, he brought up with several biological containment strategies, including the metabolic auxotroph, suicide genes and kill switches. We really appreciate Doctor Li’s instructions on biosafety issues and his thoughtful ideas helped us a lot.

ArtScienceBangalore,2010,Team:ArtScienceBangalore#NoteBook_-_-_TEXT.html," Exeter University describes synbio as a 'kludge': Making Knowledge in Synthetic Biology: Design Meets Kludge . A kludge is an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a particular purpose - it's a bit like jugaad, a new word James and I learnt today. We watched Kempinski , a mysterious science fiction short. Simple and shot on a very low-budget, Kempinski is a documentary of a future somewhere in Africa, its realistic inhabitants living in a strange mystical world. The interviewees discuss their existence showing the only artifacts of this other realm - fluorescent strip lights - somehow imbued with animist power.
This morning, we looked at the ways synbio might be hacked in unexpected ways. Starting with a talk on the Promise and Peril in Synthetic Biology, we discussed the social, ethical and cultural issues raised by synbio. We discussed synbio hype, who benefits, and the critics of synbio. With the BP oil spill and Bhopal Gas Tragedy in our minds, what might the synbio version of engineering failure be? What is the grey area between the disaster of bioterror/bioerror, or the perfect sustainable future we're promised?
This is the list we all came up with:
Bioterrorism
Bioerrorism
Irresponsible Promotion: Artists irresponsibly appropriating technology - lack of criticality?
Creating Monsters... bad design
Destruction of natural ecological networks – foreign species
Bandwagon – throwing money at inappropriate technology and solutions? (Global rather than local solutions/politics)
Blind Faith: Making it just because you can, not questioning why doing it – new farmed-out mass technology is a synbio lab.
Environmental disaster… things escape that are fine in the lab, that reproduce
Synbio’s Paradox It’s safe because it can’t escape and isn’t robust outside the lab. Yet we have applications that will be put into the environment!
Intellectual Property who owns the technology. Should corporations be allowed to patent DNA? Are we making something new – so that can be patented?
Is their interest the community? Who will control the licensing?
Bioprospecting taking things from nature and commercializing them
Give and Take How can people be compensated – how to create a sustainable industry?
Rate of Change Can policy and law keep up with the rate of change of technology
Just because we can make it, should we?
How do you govern it?
Priority How do we prioritize what we want, where we want it?
Unexpected wars… War because Middle East’s oil is no longer wanted!
Getting left behind will everyone have to do"

Plan for Cro- We want to induce lambda phage lysis through over production of Cro. So we put Cro behind the pBAD promoter (inserted Cro into pIG12) and will induce Cro with arabinose. Second step we want to modify the tail  fibers of lambda so that a biofilm degrading enzyme will be added.
Construct pJG80 constitutes as follows: HapR/GRP-RFP/Qrr4-Lux0/U Plan for quorum sensing genes 1. Amplify HapA promoter fused to GFP. B1251- forward primer for pHapA, BI252- Reverse fusion for pHapA with GFP (GFP will come from pGLO  2. Digest/ligate/transform pJG80 and construct from step 1 with PstI and EcoRI. 4. Cut out CqsS from pIG78 and insert into newly formed plasmid.
PCR for pHapA (BI251/BI252) amplified from cholera worked. Amplification of CqsS (BI230/BI231) also worked.

Collaborations
During the project we helped many other teams by answering their questionnaires and interview requests. We worked closely together  with the SDU iGEM team from the University of Southern Denmark with regard to technical issues, give feedback on each others poster and presentation. In order to be able to organize this we arranged the Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference, where all teams from the Scandinavian countries were invited.
Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference
The first Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference was held the 9th October here at DTU.  The purpose of this conference was to present the status of our work to each other, have a practice session for the presentations and show a first draft of the poster to each other. Based on this we had a discussion session, where we talked about our experiences, our difficulties and challenges with the project, but we also discussed what is needed to obtain good results.
Unfortunately the Swedish teams resigned before the conference, so only the Danish teams were participating.  We had a constructive day that ended in a dinner and socializing before we went home with new energy and inspiration for our projects.
Both teams would like to thank the Department of Systems Biology at DTU for sponsoring food and providing facilities for our conference.

I am really excited for being part of our IGEM team. When I first joined IGEM, I expected to use my programming knowledge to help the team build our project, but IGEM was a great experience to learn new things. Although I have never programmed in python, but IGEM helped us learn these necessary skills before project started. My work is to create a reliable database. Thought my work, I managed to search the materials online and learn by myself. The creation of the initial database didn’t take long, but then we realized that building a database with a robust schema is more important. Working together with my teammates, we finally find a way to populate the database. Teamwork is the next important thing I learned in IGEM. IGEM isn’t just a individual project. We can only put small pieces together with efficient communication. So I learned to working out problems with my team. Another thing I learned in IGEM is planning. We break the whole project into smaller parts and set up clear goals for each one. It helped move our project forward. For the future, I hope I can join more projects like IGEM so I can create meaningful products and also improve myself.

2)Auto addition of prefix and suffix
Considering the feedback from wet teams that they find it troublesome to use the original genetic sequences without prefix and suffix during analog piecing experiments with great need of bio-bricks’ sequences, our search engine has the ability to add prefix and suffix according to users’ demands and display them with different color from the usual sequences. With a choice box including various binding types, users can simply choose the type they need and let the program judges the gene order of corresponding bio-bricks. Finally, users can view the genetic sequences with colored prefixes and suffixes and copy these sequences in one click. This seemingly tiny feature actually helps cut down useless efforts in experiments.
3)Mark down the bio-bricks you need
“Favorite” is a common feature that we can usually find in the social platforms. They’re implanted into the WEiGEM 2.0 now, making it more convenient for users to look up the former searching data and avoid searching repeatedly. One can mark down the bio-bricks he/she find them likely to be useful in the future and review them later for experiment design.
4)Bio-bricks information sharing by QR code
QR code is another wonderful and significant tool to the optimization of our search engine. First off, each bio-brick has its unique QR code, and one can share the detailed information to others in a scan. Imagine a situation like this: team members are working together and need to search for bio-bricks. Once one member receives the result, others will be able to scan the QR code and view the details about the bio-bricks. Besides, the QR code also works as a syncing tool. Since we had cooperation with team SKLBC-GDSYZX, we allow the Forum users to scan the QR code pop up automatically in the “Favorite” section of SKLBC-GDSYZX’s website and sync their marked bio-bricks data to the website.

To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

As the result, alkali resistance device could decrease intracellular pH (Fig.6.1, 6.2).
Figure.6.1 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaB.  NhaB is not effected by pH, and can assist NhaA to regulate alkaline environment. Here we assumed that initial pH was 9.0 and NhaB had already been activated.
Figure.6.2 Intracellular pH change regulated by alkali resistance circuit led by NhaA.  NhaA will be induced at pH 7.0 ~ 9.0, while NhaB will function when NhaA cannot function normally. Here we assumed that initial pH was 8.0 and NhaA had already been activated.
Basic Regulation Subsystem Model
In basic regulation circuit containing acid regulation and alkali regulation device, pH-responsive promoters lead the expression of functional genes. As the products of two functional genes are both enzymes, main processes considered in this model are their translation, degradation and catalysis. We assumed that the H+ or OH- was straightly contacted with the promoters and induced the transcription process.
Acid regulation device consists of acid-responsive promoter P-asr and gene GadA producing enzyme which catalyzes the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA can be transported to the environment to regulate acidic micro-environment (Fig.1).
Fig.1 Acid regulation device.
The reaction processes of acid regulation device are described as below:
As for alkali regulation device, gene circuit contains alkali-responsive promoter P-atp2 and functional gene LdhA (Fig.2). LdhA encodes a lactate dehydrogenase which converts pyruvate to lactic acid. Lactic acid will be secreted outside the cell and neutralize the OH-.
Fig.2 Alkali regulation device.
The reaction processes of alkali regulation device are described as below:
To simulate the processes above, we constructed cyclic processes which had four groups of differential equations. pH ranges which were determined by promoters were applied as end conditions to switch among equations. To examine the function of regulation subsystem, we set up the initial pH to alkaline range.

Thus, the tocopherols are able to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from lipid peroxidation, strengthening the cell membrane and possibly preventing cell death. Therefore, we suspect the increased presence of tocopherols could potentially increase a cell's tolerance to fatty acids.

We also hope to expand the diversity of the cells, allowing players to choose whether they want to be an animal cell or a plant cell. This would introduce the process of photosynthesis, and allow the students to be able to draw differences between the processes and compositions of the different types of eukaryotic cells.
Activity 4: Inclusion and Diversity Report
People: We felt that up to this point, we had not addressed the needs of one of the most crucial stakeholders in the synthetic biology community - the iGEM teams themselves!
Design and Dialogue:
In his Nature article, Jon Freeman writes that “heteronormative assumptions can still create less conscious forms of bias, and an unwelcoming environment that puts scientists from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ) at a disadvantage.” It is well known that individuals that identify with certain genders and sexualities are underrepresented and often discriminated against in science and technology. Though research on LGBTQ people in STEM is scarce, data does show that sexual minorities are more likely to drop out of STEM degrees at a higher rate than women overall, as well as report more negative workplace experiences. It is thus imperative to generate greater awareness about and act accordingly upon measures that increase diversity and inclusivity.
In addition to disparities currently present in science, recent political events encouraged us to write our iGEM diversity report and investigate further into the climate that disadvantaged groups face in synthetic biology. In December 2017, the Trump Administration gave a list of forbidden words to the CDC, which included the following: ""vulnerable,"" ""entitlement,"" ""diversity,"" ""transgender,"" ""fetus,"" ""evidence-based"" and ""science-based."" The words were reportedly banned because they were too controversial, though some CDC offices require use of some of those words in reports and writings. For example, the CDC’s work with HIV prevention amongst transgender people to reduce health disparities and their work with birth defects and research on the developing fetus represent some instances where the words would be used
Language and communication represent the foundational steps towards building a better environment for marginalized groups of individuals; without being able to talk freely about certain issues, there is no way for said issues to be normalized as they should be. Without the support of mainstream sources of public influence, diversity initiatives suffer, visibility decreases, and there is no benefit to science overall (Freeman). Invisibility is a huge problem for women and sexual minorities in STEM – little dialogue and role models are either present or even spoken about. For example, few"

Design Response
Our target audience, those living in remote areas of Australia, raised several concerns with the original bio-chamber design. Their feedback provided us with the opportunity to improve our design and ensure that it was tailored to the needs of our intended market.
Portability
Mr Tony James raised concerns that our older conceptual design was not suited for someone who travels around Australia for months at a time in a four-wheel drive. He stated that if he were to use “The Living Battery”, it would have to be detachable and small enough to take with him in his car as he travels.
This feedback invigorated Team Macquarie to design a portable bio-chamber that can be attached to the roof of a car. Being on the roof means that the E. coli cells are exposed to maximum sunlight during the daytime which results in a higher yield of H2 production.
Fig 1. The ""Living battery"" attached to the top of a four wheel drive.
Sustainability
Mrs Linda Ivey, of Mimosa Eco Retreat, was very excited about our conceptual design. However, she claimed that she would only be interested in using “The Living Battery” on her property if it was sustainable. The very concept of our design is sustainability. The production of hydrogen as a fuel source is independent of fossil fuels and requires only sunlight, cells and nutrients. In addition to this, our autoclave is designed to be powered by a Fresnel lens that utilises the heat from sunlight to sterilise the contents of the autoclave.
Safety
This fear of the cells being accidentally released the environment was echoed in many of the interviews. Team Macquarie addressed this issue with the inclusion of a short segment in our farmers video explaining a few reasons why the DH5-alpha E. coli cells we are working with cannot survive outside of their media. Firstly, the cells are auxotrophic which means they are dependent on specific amino acids that are only found in our lab media [1]. In addition to this they are hemH mutants which means they cannot survive outside of a rich carbon source. Finally, the cells are RecA mutants which means that they cannot undergo homolog"

Human Practices - Silver
Our Human Practices efforts this year have been quite fruitful. We have made more outreach connections this year, and gained valuable insight into how scientists use our software. Our goal was to expand our user base, and through our beta testing efforts we have more users and protocol than ever before.
ProtoCat Beta Testing
Several teams have given us quite valuable feedback on ProtoCat through our beta testing initiative. We reached out to fellow iGEM teams and requested their assistance with testing ProtoCat, as students of biology and other sciences would better be able to evaluate whether or not ProtoCat is truly a useful service than the computer science students who designed it. The teams evaluated the software on several fronts: our Search Function, the Upload Process, the Category System, the User Page, and the Protocol itself. After they provided us with feedback, we gave them assistance with their wikis. Thank you to the following teams: MSU iGEM team, Carroll High School iGEM team, iGEM Peshawar, University of Westminster iGEM team, University of Florida iGEM team, and Michigan Synthetic Biology.
Menlo Innovations Meeting
Additionally, we met with the founders of Menlo Innovations, a local Ann Arbor technology business to discuss the future of ProtoCat, namely, ways to make our product more sustainable and get it adopted by more users. They were able to offer us quite useful advice that we will keep in mind as we continue to grow and develop not only our software, but our team.
iGEM North American Upper Midwest Meetup
This year we also attended the first iGEM North American Upper Midwest Meetup with Michigan Synthetic Biology, Michigan State University iGEM and the Carroll High School iGEM team. At this meetup, teams got to know each other while touring the scenic Michigan State University campus, and had the chance to practice presenting their projects to each other, receiving valuable feedback and having a great time!

IIT Madras Collaboration
Lastly, we have established a relationship with the iGEM team from IIT Madras this year.. During their work on their host organism database ChassiDex, they directed their data donors to upload their protocols to ProtoCat, further populating our database with protocol and increasing the usage of our software. They include the links to our database on the pages of their database"

Figure 4: Presequence Digest of pSB1C3-OBP2A. All seven plasmid purifications of the overnight cultures done on the 26/6 were digested to see if they contained the OBP2A insert. It is clear from the gel that all but sample 3 contain the insert for OBP2A as they all have faint bands at 500 bp's which corresponds to the size of OBP2A. It also appears that sample 5 contains the highest concentration, so that will be the sample that is sent for sequencing.

Risks of Your Project Now
Please describe risks of working with the biological materials (cells, organisms, DNA, etc.) that you are using in your project. If you are taking any safety precautions (even basic ones, like rubber gloves), that is because your work has some risks, however small. Therefore, please discuss possible risks and what you have done (or might do) to minimize them, instead of simply saying that there are no risks at all.
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Since our experimental room is small, we sometime work in a crowded situations. So we need to be careful not to make a glancing hit. This might happen unexpected accidents.  We use a cancer-causing reagent, ethidium bromide, and we should be careful to use it.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
Biological materials or these products might be toxic if they escaped from our lab. Perhaps they escape by an earthquake, a fire, and so on.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Escaping bacteria from lab by disposing wastes without autoclave might harm the environment that includes natural life.

Then we consider whether the performance of Boolean gate cascades is good enough. We will examine a biology example and first extract the modelling part of it. Later we will discuss whether our simulation results correspond to experiments.
Truth table
Then we are going to discuss whether our simulation corresponds to wet-lab experiments.
Background
Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as an input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate consisting of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behavior of the complete program.

Q1: What are magnetotactic bacteria?
One Sentence In Brief:
File:AMB-1.gif
Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 under cryotomography and 3-D reconstruction
Magnetotactic bacteria, also known as magnetic bacteria, are an evolutionarily diverse group [ 1 ] of motile, Gram-negative eubacteria expressing magnetotaxis.
Q2: Community Yearning for The Strain?
We weren't wrong, were we?: )
During our review on past iGem projects, we concluded, to more or less an extend, teams dreaming for magnetotaxis have concluded in using this strain......yet only two team ever actually tried. One of them was Duke University 2006 , the other being us.
Below are several arguments about the choice of this strain and reasons stopping previous iGem teams / supporting us in standing soundly on this step.
(1) So Let's Talk About The iGem History
Throughout the history of iGem, we have gained notice from exhaustive online searching that a remarkable number of previous iGem teams have continually proposed projects related to magnetosome, magnetospirillum, and magnetotaxis every year around the world.
Among these respectful pioneers, Duke University had made their magnetotactic bacteria-based project to the official jamboree titled “Bacterial Dynamo”, focusing on the use of AMB-1 as AC voltage generator [ 2 ], but somehow limited by the lack of genetic manipulation toolkits for Magentospirillum magneticum AMB-1.
What’s worth mentioning was the diversity of ideas regarding the application of magnetotactic bacteria proposed by a great variety of iGem teams (See Table 1). This even led to one mentioning on 2009 iGem official website about “magnetic bacteria” as one of the Ideas for Bacteria"

We have sequenced the parts with standard primers VF2 and VR. The sequence of the 2.5k part shows 100% agreement with the desired sequence.
Toxin Expression
BACTERIA CULTURE
The solid or liquid culture medium is LB culture with 34ug/ml chloromycetin and 80mM arabinose.
Both the antibiotics and arabinose are added after the medium cools down to 60℃. 2% (w/v) of agar is added in solid medium.
It can be clearly seen that the recombinant cology turns red, indicating the expression of reporter mCherry (figure 5, 6), showing that the target gene may be expressed to a great extent.
Figure 5 Expression of reporter mCherry in LB solid medium with arabinose and chloromycetin.
Figure 6 Expression of reporter mCherry in LB liqiud medium with arabinose and chloromycetin.
SDS-PAGE
5ul sample is loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE separation gel. We use 250kDa marker Precision Plus Protein? Dual Color Standards #161-0374. Parameters can be seen in protocols.
According to the result of SDS-PAGE (figure 7), target protein (14kDa) is strongly expressed (line 4) compared with the negative control--the wildtype BL21 (DE3) strain (line 1).

TERMITES in vivo EXPERIMENTS
Figure 8  toxin effect of tcdA1 on termites.
We fed the same amount of termites separately with Plu1537-expressing BL21, Plu1537-expressing BL21 embedded with CNC and control group: mCherry-expressing BL21. For more details please go to our Protocol
It can be clearly seen that Plu1537-expressing BL21 embedded with CNCs has strong toxicity on termites while raw Plu1537-expressing BL21 has little effect. According to the results, functions of CNCs as reducing the phobotaxis is confirmed.
Judging from the SDS PAGE results and toxicity confirmation on termites, we conclude that the device pl"

Identify, investigate & address issues relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual    property rights (Human Practices) in the context of the project:
This year Cork iGEM identified intellectual property rights as an issue. We interviewed the (INSERT TITLE HERE) Cathal Garvey to    investigate the issue and see his views on the issue.
Issues relating to the safety of the system for use as a diagnostic were identified. As with all diagnostics, this system must be    optimised, standardised and deemed as good as or better than current procedures. The use of live cells in a diagnostic system is a    unique feature which may lead to unforeseen complications such as unsuitable growth conditions in some settings or the impact of    contaminating growth on results. To address this, we investigated suitable controls and validates our results by having outside    labs (TCD & UCL) carry out our tests. We also sought the advice of experienced Biomedical Scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey on the issue.
Another aspect of our human practices work was that done by team member Donnchadh in Malawi. The issue of sustainability of our detector    in a real life lab setting was investigated by Donnchadh as he visited hospital labs in Malawi where the detector may theoretically be used.    He surveyed staff members on the equipment and reagents they had and whether they believed such a detector was a viable and sustainable tool.    We considered this in the design of"

Human Practices
Human Practice is an important part of iGEM since it’s about visually bringing the projects outside the lab and thereby putting them in context with society and real world problems. Integration between science and the public is key for any development.
Involving public into our project was one of our goals. To do that we wanted to include as many people as possible. That is why we teamed up with iGEM Stockholm and organized a panel discussion on the topic of Ethics of Engineering life and we managed to attract more than a 100 people to discuss their opinion with us. Of course no discussion could run without experts, that is why we invited three panelists to help us and guide through the complicated waters that ethics are. The three panellists: Anthony Forster , Heidi Howard and Cecile van der Vlugt offered a unique insight to different aspects of thinking about ethics in not only our project during iGEM but also in research on general.
EVENT
So we wanted to produce crocin, but then what? Before going through with our project we wanted to make sure that we were actually doing something of worth, so we started off by doing a market analysis to confirm that there exists a market for crocin.
The discussion itself took place in Albanova Hall at KTH Royal Institute in Stockholm on 14th of September 2017. Shortly before 6pm first people out of the 167 who have booked the tickets started roaming into the hall and the talk could begin. From the start it was clear that the topic of Ethics in Science and particular GMOs are a subject that brings in a lot of interest and opinions. It took only one question from the moderators to get the discussion going. From that point the whole panel was a lively interaction between the audience and the panelists. We were lucky enough to attract people from both scientific and non-scientific background as well as people from research environment. Thanks to that we were able to get opinions and insight from various parts of the spectra.
The Topics
As expected the most discussed topic were GMOs and their legal regulation around the world. But we also managed"

Cas13a is patent-pending and therefore the owners of the Cas13a patent have time to develop their own on site detection methods that integrate with Cas13a.
CINDY Seq is open source due to the iGEM competition and therefore, easy to copy.
Figure 1: Outcome of our SWOT analysis.
Our patenting process
What is a patent?
A patent is a set of exclusive rights to inventors of a non-obvious solution to a technical problem. Once a patent is granted, the holder has the exclusive rights to the commercial benefits of the invention. For our novel detection method CINDY Seq, we filed a patent application with the Netherlands patent office (Octrooicentrum Nederland, Den Haag). The idea came up in one of our weekly meetings, in which we discussed weekly updates and thought about better ways for a readout of our Cas13a  detection assay. Clearly the interdisciplinarity of our team was an asset here. We speculated about the feasibility of using a phase transition as readout, and from that moment on it went pretty quick. We first tested the principle by showing that a non-specific RNase (RNase A) would redissolve RNA/spermine coacervates. This was indeed the case as we describe on the results page , and we speculated that the RNase A could be interchanged by activated Cas13a. Later in the project, we also successfully did this, giving a full proof of principle of CINDY Seq.
When could we file a patent?
Although in principle it is possible to file patent applications for an idea on itself, we were advised by patent attorneys to give a proof of principle before filing. In the following we would like to share some of our experiences how we got to this point. The entire process was accompanied by our supervisor Louis Reese, patent officers from TU Delft, and patent attorneys (from NLO). In the process of filing, there were several important steps that are chronologically described in this section. Once we realized the novelty of combining the physical phenomenon of coacervation with Cas13a, it also appeared that there might be enormous potential for even broader applications. Therefore, it was decided to disclose our idea to the patent office from TU Delft. This amounts to filling in a standardized form in which the inventors are listed and briefly describe their invention. At this stage, the invention is still not to be made public, as this internal disclosure does not provide actual protection on the intellectual property. This meant that it still had to be protected against publication at"
Toronto,2014,Team:Toronto#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," and the ""array"".
Cas gene(s): The core of a type II CRISPR system is Cas9, an endonuclease. Its original purpose in bacteria is to degrade foreign DNA.
Array: By incorporating bits of foreign DNA into this array, the bacteria gains immunity to it in the future. Those bits, which are called spacers, are the instructions that tell Cas9 where to cut. They are complementary to part of the DNA of a previous invader; the exact sequence it matches is called the protospacer. So, the array follows a pattern of spacer - repeat - spacer - repeat, where the repeats are palindromic sequences that aid in identification of the individual spacers. When foreign DNA enters the bacterium, if the bacterium possesses a complementary spacer to it, that spacer is transcribed separately from its surrounding parts as what is called a crRNA.
TracrRNA: Binds to repeats to help with transcription of the array to the currently needed crRNA. crRNA + tracrRNA together is called guideRNA (gRNA) and it is this that directs Cas9 to where it needs to cut.
CRISPR as a plasmid loss genetic safeguard
The CRISPR system is a suitable mechanism for implementing a plasmid loss genetic safeguard because it can cause plasmid loss within the bacteria cell. In particular, the precise targeting of Cas9 to a specific protospacer makes it possible to target the synthetic plasmid only, without causing damage to the cell's own genomic DNA. This is important because if we harmed the host cell in the process of removing the synthetic plasmid, it would be no different from the kill-switch scenario, where there is a fitness cost on cells to have an intact genetic safeguard.
Another incidental benefit of using CRISPR results from the ease with which it can retargetted. By changing the spacer, the inducible CRISPR system we are making for our project can be repurposed by future iGEM teams for applications other than biocontainment.
Existing CRISPR BioBrick
The CRISPR system already exists in the registry as BBa_K1218011 , a biobricked version of the pCas9 plasmid described in Jiang et al, 2013. pCas9 was designed to allow expression in E. coli of the type II CRISPR-Cas system originally from Streptococcus pyogenes. It contains in one convenient package the minimum essential components to allow the CRISPR/Cas9 system to work, including the tracrRNA, Cas"

The 1 liter culture of AE blue-CBD-Flag-Lumino-His was removed from the 37 °C shaker (set to 100rpm) after 32 hours of incubation and placed on a stir plate to incubate at room temperature for 15 hours. Because this culture was not showing the expected color, I made a new culture of LB + Chloro and innoculated it using a large amount of the cultures grown from the plate made on 8/7 of the AE blue-CBD-His tag. This was set on a stir plate at room temperature. According to Geneious, the size of this fusion protein is 39.6 kDa.
