Signal Integration: Applications of RNA Riboregulator Capabilities
Abstract:
This project explores some of the ways that the secondary structure of messenger RNA can be used to control the rate of protein expression. The 32oC ribothermometer made by the 2008 TUDelft team will be coupled to fluorescent proteins to visually confirm temperature-dependent translation. The ""ribolock"" made by the 2006 Berkeley team will be tested at various temperatures to determine if it could double for use as a ribothermometer. Finally, a proof-of-concept NAND logic gate will be constructed: a ribolock will be used to interpret two concurrent environmental signals into an on/off control for mCherry output.
Safety Considerations
   1. None of our project ideas raise any safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety.
   2. There is a Biosafety Commitee at the University of Victoria, which can be found at http://ohs.uvic.ca/biosafety/index.html .
   3. Our project raised no issues as it did not involve any dangerous organisms, genes, or materials.
   4. None of the new biobrick parts we made this year raise any safety issues.

leaking of heavy metal ions in Xiangjiang River
heavy metal pollution in Ganxi River
While searching ideas of our project, some serious incidents caught our eyes   . One of the most severe disasters was the one that happened in Hunan Province,   China. It was mainly about the leaking of heavy metal ions in Xiangjiang River and   the Huaihe River. The arsenic content of the main contaminated areas exceeded 715   times at maximum and the Cd^(2+) content exceeded 206 times at maximum.
In thirty-six Bay mining area of Chenzhou, Hunan Province, arsenic content of   Guanxi River sediment exceeded 715.73 times. In Ganxi village’s paddy field, Cd^  (2+) content exceeded 206.67 times. The highest content of Pb^(2+) in paddy field   reached to 1527.8mg / kg (that is per kilogram containing 1.5 grams), exceeding   5.093 times.
Looking for help from Government
After noticing the repeated pollution incidents, we began to do some surveys to   find out whether the heavy metal pollution incident was particularly prominent not   only in China but also all over the world. So we began to evaluate the meaning of   our project. First, we started from China.
We visited the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection which was the highest environmental protection departments in China. We asked them how   serious the heavy metal pollution was in China at present. The Vice Minister of   Environmental Protection of China told us that the part of Yangtze River near the   coast, whose water of the best quality in our seven major river systems had   been affected by heavy metal pollution including Cd, Cu and Pb. And in the 21   cities along the river, six cities' percentage of heavy metal pollution   accumulation had reached 65%.
Set up an alliance
Since serious pollution problems had brought up, we decided to do something. To   gather all the forces together for more information and power, we established   the China Heavy Metal Pollution Research and Investigation Alliance, which consisted   of SJTU / SCUT / XMU / UCAS / JLU /FAFU.

The above simulation illustrates what will be occurring in a sample from our culture. The large red blobs symbolize the yeast, the green shapes act as the E. coli, and the purple “L”s symbolize lactate being secreted from the yeast. At the start, the yeast and E. coli are separated and randomly scattered throughout the solution, but as the yeast secretes the lactate, the E. coli will travel in the direction that it received the lactate via chemotaxis. They will continue to follow the trail of lactate until they make it to the source, the yeast, and then bind to its surface. However, if no lactate is detected after some time, the E. coli will die. Similarly, if no E. coli bind, the yeast dies after some time.
Project
CUPID’s underlying concept is derived from the evolutionary theories of endosymbiosis and obligate mutualism. When first designing the project, our team aimed for something that we felt would be a great, paper-worthy goal, inducing an endosymbiotic event between E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Through the design process, we hypothesized that if we induced a scenario where the two organisms would depend on the other to live, we could put them in conditions averse to their cooperation to apply a selective pressure for uptake of the E. coli, or cause the two organisms to increase their binding affinities for one another.
To achieve this goal, we designed two constructs, one to be employed in each of the organisms.  These constructs had to have two qualities: One, the ability to produce a product that would activate gene expression in the other organism, and Two, the ability to make the complementing organism dependent on this gene being activated.  As a step towards this goal, we sought out inducible gene systems that we thought would be functional in each organism.
In yeast, we saw great potential to expand on the use of the FUS1 promoter the Rose-Hulman iGEM team worked with last year.  If we could make the yeast dependent on the activation of this promoter sequence, then we should be able to make yeast dependent on E. coli.  We used the gene encoding for His3p (Im"

We performed EMSA for Tn5 and dxCas9 portion of the fusion protein separately. Figure 17A displays the EMSA of adapter. Loading of adapter on the fusion protein retards DNA movement on PAGE, which was observed as higher bands on figure 17A, lane 7 and 8. It indicates that mobility shift occurs when >1.5µM of fusion protein is present. We performed three different negative controls in parallel:
No adapter DNA was added (figure 17A, lane 2).
No fusion protein was added (figure 17A, lane 3,4, and 10).
Fusion protein was denatured by heat (figure 17A, lane 9).
None of these negative control reactions resulted in the band shift, confirming the specificity of our result.
With the same principle, higher bands observed on figure 17B, lane 5,6,14, and 15, confirmed the complex formation between sgRNA-loaded fusion protein with the target DNA. As a negative control, the same reaction was carried out without sgRNA. In this case, the dxCas9 should not be able to find the target DNA and complex should not be formed. The absence of higher bands on figure 17B, lane 7-11 confirmed this.
We performed integration assay based on the protocol. To amplify the integration products, we performed PCR with primers that anneal to the end of adapter DNA, and the beginning or end of target DNA. Figure 18 displays the PCR products on 5% TBE native gel.
We designed the sgRNA to target the second exon-exon junction of EPO cDNA (position ~200bp from total length 623bp). When integration of adapter DNA (length ~50bp) occurs, 2 fragments of ~250bp and"

This year's Heidelberg team has an ambitious project that goes far beyond the aims of other teams. Not even the designing of a genetherapeutical regulator but also its test on mice is fascinating. But indeed, besides all the thrill and scientific challenges the project raises several fundamental questions. Thereby I was not interested in dealing with animal testing in general because German legislation and restriction handle this issue quiet. I pursued the matter if it is problematic that animal testing is conducted within the iGEM competition. Or asked the other way around: which problems may rise from conducting animal testing within the iGEM competition? Should we differentiate between iGEM and normal research groups? What responsibilities may the organizers of iGEM have to face? And most important: should young students conduct animal testing to win a competition?

The importance and public interest to SynBio increased during the last years noticeable. Magazines, newspapers, TV-stations, reports, all dealing with SynBio and all are using terms to mediate facts, opinions or even manipulations. These terms, however, are the base of the perception of SynBio and they could be quite problematic. Phrases like ""artificial cells"", ""living machines"" or ""genetically engineered machines"" test and provoke our intuitions concerning one of the most distinct concepts humans know: nature and technology. The terms also pretend to be something they not really are. If you want to know why ""living machine"" is high-grade questionable, why ""artificial cell"" is misleading and what kind of problems may occur of an inappropriate use of terms and what, at last, the ""flesh-shoe"" has to do with all of this, feel free to press the button below.

UT-Tokyo,2014,Team:UT-Tokyo#Counter#Project#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," So we also used the stochastic model. The most common formulation of stochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation (CME). We used Gillespie algorithm to solve CME. Other method to solve CME is mentioned in Part4.
In Part2(Leaky expression analysis), taking the influences of the leak of sigma factor into consideration, we designed model which can change the induce time. In the end, we concluded that the leak of sigma-factor can be ignored when the induce time is much longer than the time of degradation of sigma-factor.
In Part3(Improvement of counter), the current sigma-Re-counter depends much on pulse length, so we devised genetic circuits that would not be affected by the pulse length of the arabinose induction. We modeled this construct to test if it can be realized.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""contTitle"" />
First construction we came up with about the counter is described as following.
<img src = ""
"" class = ""figure"" />
These generators have following functions:
・production of cis-repressed mRNA of a sigma factor by constitutive promoter.
・production of taRNA by the 1st arabinose induction and activating of cis-repressed mRNA by taRNA.
・positive feedback loops formed by sigma factors.
・production of cis-repressed mRNA of GFP by sigma factors.
・activating mRNA of GFP by the 2nd arabinose induction.
・degradation of sigma factors by induction of IPTG.
The counter consists of these functions. Our first work is confirming theoretically that these functions cooperate with each other, GFP expresses significantly only by 2nd arabinose induction and the counter is reset by IPTG.
In this simulation, we used two types of models, the deterministic model and the stochastic model. First, we simulated the counter by the deterministic model, which is popular and intuitive. Second, we simulated it by the stochastic model, which takes paucity and fluctuation of reactants into account.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," that is not naturally present in the body of the horse or that is present in elevated concentrations. Mellegers explained to us that this is because horses are never consenting parties when it comes to doping use, and so they must be protected more strictly.
EPO is not a suitable target gene for equestrian gene doping, as it does not have a performance enhancing effect in horses. Other genes have been identified, that e.g. enhance muscle mass and strength, regulate oxygen, help overcoming pain, enhance injury repair or are involved with angiogenesis and the energy metabolism ( Wilkin et al, 2017 ). Due to the versatility of our method, detection of other genes is easily achievable. Our model on the determination of the detection window will have to be adapted drastically, since it will have to take into account equestrian physiology as well as regulation cycles for the genes in question. All other components of our detection method will be easily convertible to horse racing.
Doping testing in equestrian sports works via an A-B-C system. First, the A sample is tested for doping. If the result is positive, the horse owner or trainer can decide to appeal. As part of this appeal, the B sample is tested with a more thorough detection method. The C sample is stored for (anonymous) research purposes. “Your pre-screen and screen fits with this model well.” Mellegers assured us. Since the appealing party pays for the testing of the B sample, cost is also less of an issue.
Testing speed is important in applying a detection method. “The time between placement matches and registration closing of the main match is often only one week,” Mellegers explains, “so a doping sample should be shipped to testing facilities abroad and analyzed in less than one week. Most of our tests take two to three days.” Herein lies the strength of our fast detection method compared to methods without pre-screen or efficient data-processing.
Blood will probably always be collected as a sample in the future. Currently, a doping official has 20 minutes with a horse to collect a sample. They initially try to receive an urine sample, but if the horse does not comply they take a blood sample. “In the future, we are planning to collect both samples always so that we have enough sample material to do advanced testing in cases of appeal.” according to Mellegers. For ADOPE, this means that blood sampling will remain relevant in equestrian testing.
Finally, we learned that transparency is incredibly important in equestrian sports. “Horse racing is built upon dreams” Mellegers says. If you are not completely transparent"

1st experiment:
Fig. 5. Fluorescent western blot image, using anti-6xHis antibody to visulaize different                                CueO mutants expressed in the presence (+) and in the absence (-) of UAA. Commassie                                staining
Fig. 6. Commasie stained gel image of the same samples shown on the western blot in                            figure 5.
In this experiment we produced both fluorescent western blot and coomassie stained gel (of                            the same experiment) that shows the specificity of the unnatural amino acid incorporation                            machinery in four different mutants in the E.coli copper oxidase (CueO). For each mutant we                            induced the production of the protein (~57kDa) with (+) or without (-) the unnatural amino                            acid present in the growth medium. It can be seen very clearly from the fluorescent blot that the protein is present only in                            the culture that were incubated with the unnatural amino acid - except for G450 which                            appears to be a non-permisive site where there is no incorporation of UUA at all.
2nd experiment:
In this Anti-his-tag western blotting we were able to show that there in minimal non-                           specific incorporation when there were no UAA. In other words, our logic AND gate 2nd                             condition is robust. When our bacteria are in nature they could not translate their                            essential protein, but its inactive truncated form.
Potential applications of Genetic code expansion and UAA:
By the use of site specific incorporation of many different Unnatural amino acids into proteins numerous possibilities open up for synthetic biology and many other fields. Among those possibilities are:
Probes of Protein Structure and Function: Many biophysical and mechanistic studies require significant quantities of proteins with a probe incorporated         at a unique site in a protein. UAA mutagenesis methodology is well suited to many such problems.[8]
Therapeutic proteins UAA mutagenesis is beginning to find many applications in the generation of therapeutic proteins, where the         production of large quantities of homogenously modified protein is desired.[8]
Protein Evolution with an Expanded Genetic Code It is quite possible that the ability to encode additional amino acids with novel properties would be evolutionarily advantageous, especially since nature’s choice of 20 could have been arbitrarily fixed at the point of transition between communal and Darwinian evolution paradigms and subsequently sustained by the code’s inertia. Furthermore, in the limited scope of laboratory-directed"

The digest reactions were allowed to run for 1 hour at 37ºC (waterbath).
9ul of each of the samples were taken and placed into 5 Eppendorf tubes. 1ul of loading buffer was added to all samples and mixed. The DNA samples were then loaded into agarose gel and placed under DNA gel electrophoresis for about 1 hour. However the electrophoresis failed because the gel was too thin. Another attempt will be made at a later date.
Ligation of cadA promoter and arsR BioBrick
Transformation of E. coli with ligated product
Competent DH5-alpha E. coli cells were then transformed with the ligated cotC in pMUTIN4 BioBrick. The transformations were carried out according to Dr. Aldridge's transformation protocol and there were only a few changes made:
Step 2 - the waiting time was 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes
Step 5 - the waiting/incubation time was also 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
Once the transformation process was completed the cells were plated onto two LB + chloramphenicol plates - one plate containing 200ul of transformant cells in LB and the other plate containing 500ul of cells in LB.

Introduction
It has been proved that we got 9 strains which contain right sleB clone. Yesterday, we cultured 50ml cells for Midi Prep. We'll perform a Midi Prep today to get large amount of plasmid with sleB biobrick.
Also we had get the cwlJ fragment successful, to get the cwlJ biobrick, we'll do the same procedure as we did to sleB.
To get a double clone of cwlJ:sleB, we need digest plasmid pSB1AT3:sleB and ligate with cwlJ fragment.
Experiment procedure
Midi Prep
Before we carried out Midi Prep, we take out 1ml of cell mix and put them into 1.5ml eppendorf tube to keep in fridge.
50ml of cells were used for Midi Prep.

Since phlFp is not offered by the headquarter, forward and reverse oligos of phlFp with XbaI and PstI sticky ends were designed and ordered, which were subsequently phosphorylated and annealed.
Figure 1. phlFp module
Promoter, Repressor and Inducer Specification
Promoter name: phlFp (PhlF repressible promoter: BBa_K1899004 )
Length: 66 base pairs
Sequence: 5'cgacgtacggtggaatctgattcgttaccaattgacatgatacgaaacgtaccgtatcgttaaggt3'
Repressor name: PhlF (PhlF repressor)
Part Length: 603 base pairs
Fold of repression: 83-fold
Inducer name: DAPG (2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol)
Effective inducer range(μM): 0.0244-25
In Pseudomonas bacteria, PhlF represses phlfp which regulates the phlACBD operon involved in plant defence. In our project, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) was used to induce phlfp driven expressions. DAPG is an anti-fungal derivative of phloroglucinol which is synthesised by PhlD. DAPG promotes its own synthesis by preventing PhlF from repressing the phlfp promoter.
Mechanism of phlFp - PhlF - DAPG Interaction
Figure 1. Behaviour of PhlF in the presence/absence of DAPG
In the absence of DAPG, PhlF would bind to phlFp, inhibiting transcription and thus bringing GFP expression to a halt. In the presence of DAPG, however, PhlF would lose the ability to bind to phlFp, allowing transcription to proceed, resulting GFP expression.

Miniprepped and nanodropped 12 LRs from Aug 9. Hef1a: Delta-mCherry has esp. low concentration.  Did FACS on&nbsp;[iGEM2011:Confluency Experiment]&nbsp;which shows best starting value around 1.5*10^5 cells/mL starting concentration. FACS machine showed around 40% efficiency. Matlab shows around 30%. In either case, we should start transfections with cells less confluent than we have been. TRE:LacI-Krab experiment seems to have worked, but there is only about 2x repression. Also put up FACS from AmCyan which is more green than blue. Worked on Circuit Diagrams and write ups for the public wiki. 42 FACS in less than 1 hour. Very fast because Ken's samples were concentrated.
August 10
I updated the wiki (first (per usual(winning))). Prepared for FACS. Transfected Confluency Experiment ([iGEM2011:Confluency Experiment]). Today Jenny FACSed some DRD2 (apparently a failure from pictures) and some Delta-Notch stuff (also a failure).  Completed Tyler's Hef1a_GV16 page with pretty FACS images. Some problems with either no cells in sample or visibly clumped cells. Started LR reactions for a few more Tango parts and the Ephrin parts. Shockingly did nothing else.

Worked on MATLAB stuff more. Treated TRE:mKate and TRE:eBFP2 experiments with dox. Transfected for pDisplay immunofluoresence experiment again. Passed cells into 60 mm plates for N-cad knockdown experiment.  Removed propagations of various gene/promoter entry vectors and inoculated a single colony from each. Did alignments of sequencing data for samples sent out yesterday. One LR reaction failed unexpectedly, but the other failures involving minCMV promoters appear to have occurred due to contamination"

Gold Medal
To earn a Gold Medal, in addition to the Silver Medal requirements, a team must:
1. Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained.
Using our database functions, Team SYSU-China's biobrick designs are shared among team members and output as SBOL format file which can be delivered through Internet during their experiment.
2a. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
OR
2b. In place of requirement two, a team may instead use SBOL in your software documentation.
All the Biobricks data from our software’s database could be expressed in SBOL format.
PLUS
3a. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports one of the following:
1. design of BioBrick Parts or Devices
2. construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices
3. characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices
4. the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices
We have developed a simulation system that every regulatory element is given several standard dynamic parameters. Thus most gene expression process can be simulated with our system. Furthermore, newly found element can be also definited with these parameters to be simulated.
5. the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
We are providing the improved SBOL format for Biobrick sharing. We combined several standard dynamic information for different type of Biobricks with other tradition information and hopefully it would lead to a new era of quantitative design.
OR
3b. Build upon existing software from a previous iGEM competition found on the The Registry of Software Tools
Silver Medal
To earn a Silver Medal, in addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, a team must do ONE of the following
We have done both.
1. Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool.
We plan to improve our software tool in several aspects presented below:                       First, the regulation network of E.coli would be introduced and simulated by our next version of software so that interaction between artificial genes and host metabolism could be considered during creature design.                       Second, Biobrick designer for riboswitch and riboregulator would be added,"

Figure 3: Tree structure of binding in pLacI*:LacI4
Modeling with Templates
Manual modeling of biological system is widely used in synthetic biology. However, it requires an overall understanding of the biological network and large amount of data, making it difficult even for professionals. Actually, the data provided manually are redundant because different reactions may occur with a same mechanism. Based on this idea, we introduce the concept of Template, which is the minimal data set for describing biological reaction networks, as a feasible way to implement automatic modeling. The term “automatic” does not mean modeling without providing any information. Instead, we aim at providing minimal amount of data. Similar to C++ programming language, templates allow generic description of species of a certain structural pattern or reactions of a certain reaction mechanism.
Substituent and Template
There are two kinds of templates: Template Species and Template Reactions. They are designed to represent a family of species with similar structure and a family of reactions with similar mechanism respectively. In order to realize this idea, we add the container of Substituent into MoDeL. There are currently six objects in this container, ANY, ANYUB, ONE, ONEUB, NZ and NZUB. Though defined differently, they actually serve the same purpose: representing other parts. Let’s take ANY as an example (see Figure 4). ANY, represents parts on ONE chain and the number of represented parts can range from zero to infinity. For example, a DNA species with structure ANY - pTetR - ANY represents any DNA with part pTetR.
Figure 4: Template DNA species
A reaction with template species as its reactants, modifiers or products is a Template Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted"
Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html,"_K1172503 strains on media supplemented with different carbon sources under anaerobic conditions.
Figure 28 shows that under anaerobic conditions both strains grow well on glucose but seem to be unable to use acetate or glycerol efficiently.
Figure 29: Growth of E. coli KRX and E. coli KRX BBa_K1172503 strains on media supplemented with different carbon sources under aerobic conditions after 26 hours.
To ascertain whether glucose, glycerol or acetate are suitable substrates under aerobic conditions, eight additional cultures were inoculated with both strains. For these cultures only an end-point determination was carried out. The results can be seen in Figure 29. They indicate that acetate is, as expected, not a suitable substrate. Growth is best with glucose as a substrate, but glycerol yields satisfactory results as well.
The data acquired points to glycerol being the most suitable substrate, since the bacteria seem to have difficulties using it for fermentation but show satisfactory growth under conditions allowing for aerobic respiration. To make sure glycerol can also be used for respiration with terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen, bacteria were cultivated under anaerobic conditions in M9 medium containing glycerol as a carbon source and potassium nitrate as a soluble electron acceptor.
Figure 30: Growth of E. coli KRX and E. coli KRX BBa_K1172503 strains on media supplemented with glycerol under anaerobic condition. Graphs marked KNO3 were supplemented with potassium nitrate.
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 30. Cultures which were supplemented with KNO3 grow significantly faster than those without, indicating that potassium nitrate is indeed used as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration.
Based on these results, M9 medium with 5.1 g of glycerol per liter is used for all future experiments with the fuel cell.
Exogenous Mediators
Redox molecules which are chemically synthesized can be added into the anode chamber of the fuel cell to act as mediators , transporting electrons from the bacteria to the fuel cells anode. Here, these chemicals are referred to as exogenous mediators.
To identify exogenous mediators which can easily be reduced by E. coli, a simple experiment was conducted. A culture of E. coli KRX was split into 1.5 mL reaction tubes. Methylene blue and neutral red were added in varying concentrations. Since all mediators tested lose their color when reduced, a change in the color of the solution indicates that the bacteria are able to reduce the"

During     biofilm formation Vibrio cholera will secret quorum sensing     molecule called Vibrio cholera autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) which is bind     to CqsS receptor in E.coli. CAI-1 molecule act as “find me signal”     for E.coli, at the same time the binding of QS molecule to receptor     in E.coli, it will active motile gene, CheZ which is enable E.coli     migrate to source of infection, besides activate motile gene, it will     also activate killing gene which is enable E.coli producing biofilm     enzyme degrading matrix such as: alpha amylase, substilisin, and     nuclease. After release enzyme degrading matrix our E.coli will     secrete peptide 1018, an innate immunity peptide from human     cathelicidin which is successfully expressed in E.coli as novel     antibiotic peptide to kill Vibrio cholera directly. By interconnecting     the principles of pathogen-directed motility with the dual system     degrading and killing biofilm, we gained significantly develop     killing activity to combat biofilm formation and further severe     infection.

Writing about the chemicals’ material safety data sheet (MSDS) and important safety pictograms found on the bottles and flasks would be also very useful because they are a basic part of biosafety and so that everybody not just biologists can understand the meaning of the figures found on each material in a laboratory.  We also recommend to write about the biosafety risk group of the used bacteria before and after the genetic modification (BSL1 and S1).  You should write some sentences about the biosafety laws of your country and institution and mention that your team meet all the requirements.  They may seem very basic aspects but we think you had better write about them to make sure about nothing will miss from the safety cases. In conclusion, we think, your safety part is a well-written, comprehensive, professional work. Congratulate!”

Introduction to Synthetic Biology
  Synthetic biology is an area of biology which aims on reforming and creating genes to let them function in expected ways, constructing new biological functions and systems that are not found in nature. The former focuses on synthesizing gene fragments, inserting artificial DNA into living cells and enabling them to express rightly; while the latter majors in rewriting natural systems, and building a new biological system as a platform for many technologies.
 
  Our instructor Prof.He gave students an splendid presentation to inspire their interest in synthetic biology.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," their size             (Fig. 1). Because of that, we have chosen to analyze only the first few spheres formed in every simulation             as their size proved to be most accurate.
ϵ (interface thickness parameter) is also an important parameter as it defines the width of transition             between phases and affects both the surface tension force and the relaxation time of interface. Usually it             is compared to the characteristic length of the system and must be chosen small enough to depict interface             changes accurately, yet too small of a thickness shall cause instabilities in calculations.
Most of the time the model can be described with several dimensionless parameters, such as capillary number             calculated for the continuous phase, Ca =μcvc/γ, the Reynolds number Re =ρvcL/μc, the viscosity ratio             λ=μd/μc, and the flow rate ratio Q=vd/vc3. In our model Reynolds number is small (Re < 1) and does not                 influence droplet size, so we mainly focus on Ca, λ and Q and consider the influence of the latter two                 on the liposome formation.
Fig. 1 Visual comparison of modeled and real life liposome formation process. A slight diffusion     is observed in a model due to the diffusion term in C-H equations, which makes long simulations unreliable. In the     plot, phase variables A, B and C have values of 1 (blue), 2 (green) and 3 (red) respectively.
Geometry
Since the microfluidic devices were designed by ourselves, we were able to extract the exact geometry from the         CAD file. The part that interested us was the junction at which all of three phases contacted and started         forming droplets (Fig. 2). However, we then proceeded to minimize the geometry (Fig. 3) in order to reduce the         computation times and improve solution qualities:
Device height was greater than our largest expected droplets, so 2D model was sufficient;
Since our devices were technically perfectly symmetrical, it was more efficient to do calculations                     for only half of it and mirror the results;
Usually only the first few droplets need to be analyzed, so the length of post-junction part could                     be decreased;
Microchannels usually contain only one phase, so their length was not crucial.
Fig. 2 Original 3D junction geometry extracted from the CAD file. Because of its size, it is too     inefficient to simulate this whole piece of device.

Local Sensitivity Analysis (LSA)
Besides global sensitivity analysis, we also implement additional local sensitivity analysis technique, which can measure time-varying sensitivities along arbitrary trajectories. For local methods, the basic measures of sensitivity are the partial derivatives.

The rest of the model remain unchanged, as it concerns intracellular phenomena that are assumed to happen the same way in vitro than in vivo.
Switching OD target for our
in vitro
experiments
As an example and guide for our experiments, here is are the two different responses that our system should exhibit according to the design guidelines that we produced:
Expected activation behavior of the quorum sensing module, in the tumor environment (in vivo) or in a tube (in vitro). The observed difference comes from the fact that no diffusion of AHL happens in the tubes during our experiments, making the activation of the quorum sensing taking place at lower OD.
We can see that the correction of the model to stick better to the reality of our experiments is essential to correctly lead our experimentations and subsequent data fits. In the in vitro situation, we should aim for an activation of the quorum sensing at OD 0.05.
LuxR expression fitting
What experiment do we need to fit the expression of LuxR?
LuxR is the regulatory protein binding AHL and subsequently activating a promoter where LuxR-AHL tetramers can bind:
The amount of LuxR present in the cell is crucial to know how much AHL is necessary to fully activate the promoter. And inversely, knowing the AHL dose response curve of the very simple system constituted of the constitutively luxR gene and a fluorescent reporter under the Lux promoter is enough to deduce the amount of LuxR in the bacteria, and therefore their expression level. This is why we have designed and performed an experiment to precisely measure a dose response curve of such a system to be able to fit our luxR expression parameter.
Fitting method
We used the the following process to fit our model to experimental data:
From an initial set of parameters for our model, we simulate the response of the system that we should obtain
We quantify the difference (via a cost function) between the model-based response and the actual experimental data
We change the set of parameters in a way that is expected to reduce the cost (with gradient-based method) the and go back to step 1. and iterate
Thanks to the MEIGO toolbox already used for our parameter search , we do not have to implement this whole process
de novo
but we can focus on the cost function that will be used for the fitting. We built it taking the chi"

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html," 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.
Directivity
All the four constructed graphs build for BioGuide are directed graphs.     So that, for every edge there must be a single source and a target.     There is no single edge which is bidirectional. In mathematical form     this can be represented as:
If an edge e has node v as source and node w as target then the edge     can be expressed as
For a directed graph the combination (v, w) is totally different     from (w, v). Therefore,
The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,     as explained in Figure 2.
Connectivity
The nodes forming their own sub-graphs disconnected from the rest     of the nodes have been recognized, which showed us the presence of incompatibility     between few regulators and promoters of the devices. We have observed     this disconnection in all four of our graphs. The basis of the disconnection     has been shown in Figure 3, where the two sub-graphs without any edge     that connects them to the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].
Fig. 3: A zoomed in screenshot showing two sub-graphs within     the disconnected graph.
""Semi-Simplicity""
A simple graph is a graph in which no more than one edge contains     the same set of nodes. So, in a simple graph it is not possible to find     more than one edge with the same source and the same target. Additionally,     an edge with the same source and target, forming a loop is not allowed.     But, in synthetic biology it is possible to construct a device consisting     of devices or bio bricks of the same species or type. Accordingly, our     graphs are simple graphs with an exception of possible self-containing     loops, where the edge starts from and ends on the same node. Our graphs     have an exception of having loops and due to this permitted flexibility     our graphs are ""semi-simple"".
For general information about graphs refer to:

Figure 7) Western blot of mRFP induction
There is mild restoration visible in the splicing expression construct.
The LOV constructs to the right are somewhat harder to interpret. On the top at around 36 kDa we see the DnaXn-mRFPn fusion protein as we saw it in the coexpression samples. To the bottom, as expected, the LOV-DnaXc-mRFPc construct is found. Inbetween, a weak band is visible at the same size as the reassembled mRFP band in the coexpression sample. We therefore deduce that protein splicing has taken place with the LOV domain constructs. However, the samples that were illuminated for 12 hours show significantly less overall expression than the corresponding sample induced for 4 hours. We hypothesise this is caused by protein degradation or a long-time phototoxic effect that we did not detect in our phototoxicity test. As the non-illuminated control for the 4 hour time point is missing, no clear result for the effect of light induction could be derived yet.
Figure 8) FACS analysis of mRFP expression cultures
Samples from left to right: LB, LOV-6, BL21, coex*, coex,  C, N, IDE-CHT, WT, LOV-12
Very interestingly, the FACS analysis of our mRFP cultures revealed a curious behaviour. The mutated (non-splicing) mRFP coexpression samples very obviously show more fluorescence than the splicing samples.
This is supported by fluroescent microscopy pictures, where the supposedly non splicing variants is stronger in fluorescence than the splicing variant (Figure 9).
Figure 9) The non-splicing variant shows stronger fluorescence than the splicing variant
Panel A: Bacteria transformed with both of the non splicing variants, a strong fluorescence is visible. Panel B: Transformation of the splicing variants results only a mild fluorescence.
Discussion
In the context of these experiments, we designed a new approach to regulate intein splicing via light induction. The connection between caging peptides and intein splicing was so far not established in literature. However, this application becomes only possible by the discovery of very small, artificially created C-inteins. We successfully managed to verify the splicing reaction of SspDnaX in the context of split mRFP. However, we were surprised by the low"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Introduction
In our iGEM project we tried to create an Escherichia coli cell which is capable to sense capsaicin in a complex sample and report the concentration with a luciferase light signal. We combined a native receptor system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the readout system of the firefly luciferase. The native receptor senses the phenolic compound acetosyringone. For this reason we used directed evolution to modify the binding region of the native receptor to generate a new capsaicin receptor because of the chemical similarities of acetosyringone and capsaicin. We established a screening system based on antibiotic concentration gradients to screen the newly generated receptors. In our E. coli acetos"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

UCLouvain,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage. However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant (pIV*S324G) the bacteria became more sensitive to the action of vancomycin. vancomycin is an antibiotic that can’t cross the outer membrane of bacteria because of its hydrophilicity. So if the bacteria expressing pIV proteins are sensitive to vancomycin it means that the channel pIV is opened. These effects are illustrated on the figure 1.
Figure 1: Graph showing the effect of vancomycin on the growth of E.Coli expressing or not pIV proteins or pIV* mutant proteins. IPTG is here used to induce the production of pIV via the control of the promoter of this gene. Marciano et al.
Figure 2: Primary structure of pIV. The “leaky” mutations are represented in green and are concentrated in GATE1 and GATE2. (Spagnuolo et al., 2010)
Beyond the use of vancomycin to highlight the permeability caused by the pIV*, Marciano et al, used a strain of E. coli with a deletion of the gene LamB. This one codes for a maltoporin placed in the outer membrane. Without this LamB gene, the bacteria can’t grow on maltodextrin (larger than triose) media; The concentration of maltodextrin was determined too (0.2% to 0.6%). Thanks to that method, bacteria with the open channel pIV and only them can grow on this media.
Finally this article estimated the diameter of the hole (6 nm) when the porin is open.
Thanks to all these precious informations contained in this article, we could optimize our selection method and several of our protocols.
Few years after, Spagnuolo et al.(2010) were able to identify residues in the pIV primary structure responsible for the gating mechanism. They achieved this by random mutagenesis of the pIV gene followed by selection for mutants with compromised barrier function, called “leaky”. They identified mutations in 34 residues, 30 of which clustered into two regions located in the center of the conserved C-terminal secretin family domain. They called these two regions GATE1 and GATE2, that span respectively 39 and 14 residues (figure 2). These informations allowed us to choose to target the regions GATE1 and GATE2 with our mutagenesis approach.

Gifu,2014,Team:Gifu#Projects#Cellulose to Amylopectin_-_-_TEXT.html,"      So some cards are thrown away when it is written incorrectly, stained or sent from disagreeable person.     It is a sheer waste to throw away many cards, so it is great idea that we transform card into MOCHI, tranditional Japanese food made from rice and composed of amylopectin.      Paper contains cellulose, and both amylopectin and cellulose are polyglucose.      Why we can't the transformation?
We genetically modify Escherichia coli and make 2 type of function. One of the function is synthesis of cellulase, which is enzyme analyzes cellulose into glucose. Another is synthesis of amylopectin synthetic enzyme. We use them to analyze cellulose (it compose new year’s card) and synthesize amylopectin (it is main ingredient of MOCHI). In 2008, the iGEM team of the University of Edinburgh studied reducing cellulose to glucose. We refer to this study and improve it to reduce cellulose. On the other hand we introduce gene coding amylopectin synthetic enzyme from Oryza sativa into E.coli to synthesize amylopectin in body of E.coli. In fact, E.coli have a function to synthesize glycogen from glucose in natural. So we use some parts of this function and remove some of them to realize the efficient transformation.
In vivo, proteins are synthesized in transcription and translation.      Generally, mRNA is single-strand RNA, starting translation by binding ribosome on initiation codon, and ending by separating ribosome from mRNA.      In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-chain, massive proteins and to improve translation efficiency.      That is, allowing ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism by producing circular mRNA and causing a defect of termination codon.     To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage.      Splicing is a mechanism removing circular introns which don't code for proteins and joining in exons which code for ones.      It occurs after transcription.      Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from introns to exons.     So we will introduce the plasmids which place the sequence of the end of introns as a splicing ribozyme on the end of a gene coding for proteins into E.coli, and cyclize mRNA for      synthesis of long-chain, massive proteins.

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

Overview
The University of Exeter’s 2014 iGEM team’s project is called: E.R.A.S.E. Explosive Remediation by Applied Synthetic E. coli.  We aim to design a biological system that will enable safe bioremediation and detection of two of the most common explosives: TNT and Nitroglycerin (NG). As proof-of-principle we have performed this work in E. coli.
Background
TNT and NG are some of the most ubiquitous chemicals used in industrial and military explosives. This includes their use on demolition sites, in landmines and as other explosive remnants of war ( ERW ). However, whilst humanitarian concerns surrounding the explosive properties of TNT and NG are likely to be the first association we have with these chemicals, they are also toxic environmental pollutants. These can be the remnants of munitions factories, as well as mining and building sites, around the world. Unused munitions are difficult to dispose of with dumping sites a common solution. Many munitions, both dumped and planted, are able to leak into the surrounding soil, which in turn causes environmental pollution. Please see The Problem for more information.
The Project
We therefore sought to design a system that would:
Degrade TNT or NG. Importantly this should be to a non-toxic product.
Detect TNT or NG in a sample.
Terminate all cellular viability when there was no TNT or NG remaining in the sample.
Modelling
The first page Modelling details the design and modelling of our proposed system, and the influence this had on our choice of experiments.

Finally, the columns were put into clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and 20-30 μl water (55°C) were added to the center of the column. After letting the column stand for 1 minute it was centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the elute.
For larger DNA fragments, the QIAEX II® Gel Extraction Kit was used (suitable for 40 bp to 50 kbp). Solutions were prepared as advised in the instruction protocol. DNA bands were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel and transfered to a microcentrifuge tube. After weighing the slices, buffer QX1 was added according to the DNA fragment size (6 volumes for <100 bp; 3 volumes for 100 bp – 4 kb; 3 volumes with 2 volumes of water for >4 kb). QIAEX II was vortexed for 30 seconds to resuspend the agent and added to the samples (10 μl QIAEXII for ≤2 μg DNA; 30 μl for 2–10 μg DNA; and an additional 30 μl for each additional 10 μg DNA). Subsequently the solution was mixed and incubated at 50°C for 10 min to solubilize the agarose and bind the DNA. Since we mainly used this kit for larger fragments, the resuspended pellet was only inverted and flicked to avoid shearing forces. We did not observe changes in color, that is why no pH adjustment were done. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant carefully removed with a pipet. The pellet was washed with 500 μl buffer QX1 to remove residual agarose contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and all supernatant residues removed with a pipet. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl buffer PE to remove salt contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant removed with a pipet. Pellets were air-dried for 10-15 minutes until they became white. To elute the DNA, 20 μl of water were added and pellet resuspended by flicking. After incubation"

Being one part of the iGEM society is a wonderful way to learn about what is going on in the field of synthetic biology, how to share your fancy ideas with people and work collaboratively with team members. Besides, it provides fantastic opportunities to make friends with people in other teams and EVEN have collaboration internationally. Since the PKU iGEM team was founded in 2007, we have been cooperating with other iGEM teams from different countries and continents.
Asia Taiwan Workshop
In the spring, we joined the Asia workshop in Taiwan. We did a presentation to share our idea about heavy metal decontamination kit with other iGEM participants. At the same time, we learned more about projects from other teams and made"
Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#proof#domain_-_-_TEXT.html," domains in our project
In this project, we used zinc finger proteins as adaptor molecules that recognize and bind specific DNA sequences instead of their original function as transcription factors. Every selected zinc finger was linked to functional polypeptide that had to retain its biological function. The advantages of using zinc finger domains in our project are their specificity of binding  to DNA sequences and the possibility to combine different zinc fingers together, to even further increase their specificity. Our DNA program sequence was designed to organize zinc finger domains linked to functional proteins (split GFPs or biosynthetic enzymes) into a functional complex. We were able to show that functional proteins linked to zinc finger domains bind to the specific target sites on a DNA program, and that biosynthetic enzymes in such ordered state improve the yield of biosynthetic pathway.
Choosing zinc finger domains
First of all we searched through Registry of standard biological parts for existing zinc finger proteins. We found three poorly characterized parts: BBa_K165007 (Gli-1 DNA binding domain), BBa_K165006 (Zif268-HIV DNA-binding domain) and BBa_K165008 (YY1 DNA-binding domain). We compared information about these three zinc fingers found on Registry with information from literature. We decided to use Gli-1 zinc finger and Zif268-HIV zinc finger. The latter was renamed to Zfn HIVC, based on amino acid sequence comparisons and information about the DNA binding site found in literature. We did not use zinc finger YY1 due to its four finger structure. Additional information about Gli-1 and ZnfHIVC that was gathered from the literature and acquired in our experimental work was re-entered to the Registry. In order to realize our project goal at least 5 more DNA binding domains were needed. We chose to limit our search to zinc fingers with  3 fingers and binding length of 9-10 nucleotides,  that have have known binding affinity and that the affinity for similar sequences was very low. Our literature search resulted in 13 putative zinc fingers that met our requirements. So the question was how to choose 7 additional zinc fingers out of 13. We decided to write a computer software for that pourpose and named it ZNF Buster.
ZNF Buster returned the following results that best matched our criteria.
Gli-1
ZNF HIVC
Zif 268
PBSII

Jazz
ZNF Buster
When choosing 7 zinc fingers out of 13 we wanted to avoid picking a group of zinc finger proteins that bind to similar DNA sequences"

Financial and legal records, military and government documents,     these are just a few examples of important information that must be     preserved for a long time, but could cause great damage in the     wrong hands. The system we constructed will be useful for the kind     of sensitive information that should be stored or transferred in a     very secure manner, but does not have to be accessed quickly     (within seconds).
Our data storage device has four main applications:
Secure storage of sensitive data (can’t be hacked digitally        while stored)
Secure transfer of sensitive data (can’t be hacked        digitally during transfer)
Archival data storage (high storage density, long lifespan)
Time capsule to preserve information about our civilization        (dense, durable and DNA-based)
What is sensitive data?
Data  can be classified as sensitive if any of the following     conditions are true:
Unauthorized disclosure may have serious adverse effects on      the reputation, resources, or services of a business,      institution or individual.
The data is protected under federal or state regulations.
There are considerations relating to ethics, privacy or      intellectual property rights.
Some examples of sensitive data that could be stored and     transferred using our system include:

Hong_Kong_HKU,2015,Team:Hong Kong HKU#temp_-_-_TEXT.html," gene that should be active at a time. The secret behind this function is our modified version of the lambda repressor mechanism.
We constructed a mathematical model that simulates the interactions of the molecules and function of the gene switch we designed. This revealed interesting phenomena in the dynamics of our system which helps us to better understand the capabilities and limitations of the gene switch. We also made an interactive simulation available to everybody to best illustrate how our idea actually works.
To control the amount of blue light on our cell cultures, we created the LED rig device. This enabled us to perform diverse experiments in order to characterize our light response element. These results show that our light response element is able to regulate the downstream gene expression precisely. In addition, the response time is in a ten-minute-scale, which enables constant and nearly real-time control over bacterial cultures. In addition, we hypothesize that this system is also applicable to bioreactors, which would enable higher level of control in industrial bioprocesses. However, our fully functional prototype is still under ongoing development.
We have developed an open approach to biotech business inspired by the business models for open source software. Following the Open Source philosophy, we will distribute open Aalto-Helsinki Bioworks technologies for free to everybody - as long as they share the improvements made on the technology. Therefore, we empower our users to participate in product development. Our business model is based on hardware and wide range of services offered to our customers.
During the summer we participated in Aalto Entrepreneurship Society’s Summer of Startups 2014 incubator programme to learn the essential entrepreneurial skills, such as pitching, investor relations, customer-driven development and explaining the science for general audience. See our Demo Day video for details.
iGEM is an international experience and as the first Finnish team, we went to find advice and experience around the globe. We contributed to the iGEM community by building a BioBrick Seeker tool which makes it easy to find parts of your interest in the 2014 BioBrick distribution. This tool has been used by iGEM teams all over the world! We also did a lot of cooperation , including filling out surveys and having skype conversations and live meetings with current and previous iGEM teams from France, Colombia, Switzerland, USA and the Netherlands. We even made a video together with ETH Zürich team to Colombia team’s challenge.
We wanted to raise awareness about synthetic biology in Finland and also showcase researchers’ work to young people and undergraduate students. Therefore, we have been reaching out to general public, especially young people via social media , including Facebook , Twitter ,"

Binding: Zhang Zijian & Meng Liuyi
An important improvement was constructed by these two members. They tested binding efficiency between E.coli and cyanobacteria. Equipped with fluorescence microscope, they calculated binding efficiency of protein-cyanobacteria and E.coli-cyanobacteria interaction.
Killing: Yao Lanqiu & Lu Xiaoyu
Killing cyanobacteria is the core of our project, so YAO and LU spent a lot of time searching for a weapon. Finally, lysozyme was chosen from tens of candidates. They measured cyanobacteria growth curves under different conditions. Killing effects on different species of cyanobacteria were tested by them, which showed the wide applicability of our project.
Degradation: Jin Yuji & Zhang Fengyu
Cyanobacterial toxins are serious threats from algal bloom. Degradation group found a enzyme MlrA that can degrade it. A sophisticated experiment assay was established to test degradation efficiency.  Several signal peptides were tried for the sake of secreting MlrA outside cells.
Suicide: Wu Jie
Considering biosafety, a suicide system was introduced into our E.coli. Wu Jie made effort transferring induction suicide system into E.coli. He tested growth curves of E.coli under variant inducing conditions.

Fig. 1 PCR amplification of ICA 9-mer. This time, the results are much cleaner than the one from 7/13/2015 . The anticipated product corresponding to a successful 9-mer is 1018 bp.
It seems that we are able to get ICA to work properly.
While the accessory bands are still present to some degree, the major product is our desired 9-mer.
We still do not know if the accessory bands are an artifact of PCR or ICA.
It seems that a 1:100 dilution of the crude eluate does not provide sufficient template for amplification.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#11 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,", LB plates containing chloramphenicol will need to be produced.
Changes to the Bacillus transformation protocol (day of transformation)
For step 5 of the protocol the incubation period was for 2 hours
For step 6, we inserted 5μl of DNA into the Bacillus subtilis cells we intended to transform and then 5μl of water to the Bacillus subtilis cells we intended to use as a control (to show that B. subtilis can only become resistant to chloramphenicol once it has received pGFP-rrnB)
Additionally for step 6, we incubated the cultures for 45 minutes instead of 1 hour - 45 minutes is actually sufficient time.
Steps 7 and 8 were completely left out; the solutions were plated out without centrifugation. As it happens the centrifugation step, which aims to concentrate the transformed cells, was not needed in this case.
What we did
Today's work involved the Bacillus transformations and making chloramphenicol LB + agar plates.
Bacillus transformations
The transforming Bacillus subtilis 168 protocol was used to transform the bacteria with pGFP-rrnB. Here is a summary of events:
Taking tubes 1 and 4 from the overnight incubation (tube 1 containing Bacillus subtilis in MM competence medium and tube 4 containing only MM competence medium), 0.6ml of each of the solutions was added to 2 tubes which both contained 10ml of fresh MM competence medium.
After 3 hours of incubation 10ml of prewarmed starvation medium was added to both tubes and another 2 hours of incubation followed.
0.4ml was taken from the tube containing no B. subtilis and placed into 1 Eppendorf tube; 0.8ml was taken from the tube containing B. subtilis along with MM competence medium plus starvation medium and equally distributed into 2 Eppendorf tubes. 5µl of pGFP-rrnB DNA was added to 1 Eppendorf containing B. subtilis whilst to the other Eppendorf tube containing B. subtilis 5µl of water was added.
After 45 mins of incubation, the tubes were plated onto three chloramphenicol plates and one LB only plate in the following manner:
50µl of MM and starvation solutions with NO Bacillus subtilis (originating from tube 4) was added to the LB only plate

Moving Signaling Circuit from psB1AC3 into Surette Vector (pCS26)
A restriction digest was set up using NotI for PQ-B-R-OU-B in psB1AC3 and LuxCDABE in pCS26. The goal here is to move the PQ-OU construct into the cloning site of the pCS26 vector, thereby removing LuxCDABE. The vector was then phosphotased, and the solutions were ligated and then transformed into XL Gold and TOP10 competent cells. These cells were then plated on LB+Kanamycin overnight.

Continuation of August 5th
DNA replication progress: I need to get the polymerase to move along the strand of DNA, the leading strand is much easier since it actually does not have to detect anything and just rez the nucleotides as it moves down the strand, but the RNA primers will no longer be able to be physical so I will have to use another method.
I made slides and edited video clips and snapshots that were taken yesterday for second life presentation tomorrow for the virtual lab and the synthetic kingdom and the results so far for both domains. There is one video for each as well as some explanatory slides.
Also, some changes were made to note cards and substrings for the construction station since they were initially divided with back slashes and are now divided by spaces, which are not recognized as the note card reader so the substrings had to be changed. Another issue I discovered was that in order to properly secure one section of the DNA extraction activity I will require permission"

The reasons why we chose these four persons to do our user studies are: first, we should choose participants that can cover different background, say, wet-lab background, to ensure that we can study how CORE could meet the needs of individuals of different background, not only from wet-lab; second, time is limited and we can only do user studies of a limited number of people who are also familiar with us or at the nearby.

Some Feedbacks
“We’re doing the project on si-RNA; however, in CORE Design there are no parts on si-RNA. To make CORE more universal, is it necessary to add si-RNA as biological parts so that the database of CORE is more complete?”
(In fact, it is impossible for CORE to contain all the biological parts in the nature, whether they are in Registry or not. However, CORE can add new parts and define the type of your new parts, so it is possible for users of CORE to extend the parts in the database of CORE.)
“Co-development is good! We can help each other on this platform.”
“For CORE Bank, it should consider the situations in which teams’ projects contain no genetic circuits. Say, how can our project be stored on this repository?”
(It is a good suggestion, and we should work harder on these suggestions)
Inspirations
For team that does not take genetic circuit design as their project, what they feel most useful in CORE might be the Co-development module. It is a platform designed for not only collaborative construction of genetic design but also question and answer. If they have any problem in their project, they can feel free to ask questions and get answers.
Although most of the teams’ projects are devoted to genetic circuit design, we should take more into considerations; for example, not all teams devote their project to circuit design. CORE Bank is aimed specifically at hosting the genetic design of teams; Maybe, there should be a repository for other kinds of project?

Ideas come together ，then spark!r
rPeking University
    On July 14, 2018, we came to Peking University for a collaboration and exchanged ideas with Peking University's IGEM team.
    After the self-introduction, we introduced each other's projects and proposed suggestions on the project. The project of Peking University's IGEM team is to design a protein scaffold to increase the enzymatic reaction rate and yield, and hope to be applied to industrial production. In the exchange, we raised our confusion and exchanged experimental design.
    Later, we introduced our own projects, and Peking University students also made opinions for the improvement of our projects. In addition to considering whether urate oxidase can be expressed and correctly modified in E. coli nissle, we should also consider whether UOX can pass through the intestinal wall cells from the intestinal tract into the blood, rather than being ""absorbed"" by the intestinal wall cells. In addition, due to the existence of certain immunological rejection of human uric acid oxidase, the immune response of UOX in the blood is also a problem that I must think about and solve.
    During the collaboration and exchange with Peking University's IGEM team, we saw each other's bright spots and re-examined our projects from a new perspective. In such exchanges and thoughts, we believe that we will find problems in our thinking, improve our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.
After that ,Peking University offers us the pSB plasmid.
rNorheastern University
    In August 2018, we came to Shenyang, China, and exchanged ideas with two iGEM teams at Northeastern University, and further explored the next step of cooperation.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#HP#School Talks_-_-_TEXT.html," parts of our project require more explanations. The mutation and the selection system were not as well understood as the library design. To address this challenge, we redistributed the time between the different parts of our lecture and improved the related figures significantly.
Our evolutionary improvements had visible impacts to the third presentational course. The questions, regarding the mutation system and the selection system, showed consistently better results. However, the tested pupils performed not equally well in questions related to other parts of the presentation.  Some examined statements were “An impress of your practical operations would be interesting” and “Please sum up a more detailed summery, at the end of your presentation”. Hence, we spread the summery and inserted more detailed information about our practical lab-work and possible applications of our system.
Pupils, hearing the fourth and last version of our presentation, were able to give right answer to 90 % the general synthetic biology and 84 % of the project-related questions, respectively. In summary, the comprehension by the pupils shows an evident increase of more than 30 % within the four evolutional stages, as seen in the score graphs (Fig. 2 and 3).

Every summer the Familie-Osthushenrich-Foundation and the municipal government give young students the opportunity to experience working in a microbiological laboratory and to learn about research done at the CeBiTec.
As part of the CeBiTec we were glad to present iGEM to the attendees, contribute by advising the young participants in the lab and organizinga big barbecue in the evening. Generally, the pupils stay one week at the institute and learn about different topics like biotechnology, molecular biology, synthetic biology and bioinformatics. The program also includes a practical part regarding taxonomy, bioinformatics, proteomics and synthetic biology. The iGEM team contributed by providing and supervising the experiments of this very last part.
Moreover, we had several discussions about the implications of synthetic biology on the society.
During this week, we talked a lot about synthetic biology and our experiments. Furthermore we allowed the students to do genetic engineering experiments.
We instructed the teenagers to perform basic laboratory techniques such as transformation, plasmid isolation and plating on selective agar. In detail, the experiments were done to identify different resistances and different fluorescence proteins encoded on different plasmids. By transforming"

Our method provides a way to increase the intrinsic ability of the microorganisms to utilize the available oxygen. The Vitreoscilla hemoglobin platform technology has previously worked in bacteria, yeast and higher eukaryotes such as plants and mammalian cells to improve cell productivity, giving it a wide range of applications.
Benefits
Water-logging, where water saturates the roots of the plant, is a common issue in agriculture with about 6 to 10 million hectares of land affected in India alone [6]. In 2011, the average crop yield of rice, cereals and wheat in India was 2636 kg/hectare according to the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation [7]. To put this in perspective, 6 to 10 millions of hectares equals approximately 16 000 to 26 000 million kg of food affected in negative ways by water-logging every year. VHb co-expression can be a viable solution to alleviate this issue, while also providing the additional benefit of increasing the biomass content of plants [8][9].
A frequent issue in the case of bioremediation is the lack of oxygen in the environment where it is taking place. VHb has been used in various bioremediation scenarios for exactly this reason [10][11][12]. Many of the previously mentioned contaminants can lead to serious disorders in the domestic microbial flora [13] and human population [14].
Ethanol makes up three fourths of biofuel use [15]. Until now it has been produced using cornstarch, sugar canes and sugar beets, however a cost-effective production of bioethanol will necessitate the development of alternative fermentation feedstocks and increased productivity [16].
Results and future vision
When designing our project, we chose green flourescent protein as a proof-of-concept protein. The measured protein concentration prooved to increase significantly with the VHb expression level. See our Results section for further specifics.
We envision our VHb system as future platform technology that other iGEM teams, researchers or companies build upon by co-expressing their own proteins, cultivating their bioremediating bacteria or growing their plants. The VHb technology is not a product per se, it is rather a method, a way of designing your expression system when the goal is to increase the productivity of the desired end product.
Our project promotes the introduction of molecular approaches in the pursuit of higher product yields for the biomanufacturing scene. It also introduces an additional design parameter by allowing the user to tweak the oxygen"

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HansJonas_-_-_TEXT.html," asks about the foundations of ethics in the era of modern technology. The second questions its practical application, in which Jonas chiefly emphasizes the role of politics. (PV p.61). In the fifth chapter, Jonas goes into more detail when he deals with the question whether capitalism or Marxism is more capable of implementing the responsibility for future generations. Jonas points to a considerable disadvantage of capitalism when he tackles this question. The artificial maintenance of markets of goods, people could not even imagine, has the tendency of wastage. Jonas doesn’t have confidence in the incorporation of ecological views and responsibility by companies. He is remarkably pessimistic about the capability of democratic states to deal with the adverse effects of modern technology.
The practical application of the work of Jonas for the scientist is a delicate question (Achterhuis, 1992). How to incorporate his concept of responsibility, which reaches so far that it is impossible to implement this in  the practical setting of science. Only outright prohibitions can be derived from this approach, but these are issues at the end of the spectrum, not questions that common scientists need to deal with.
This dilemma is partly due to Jonas’ attitude towards technology. We have to keep in mind that this book was published in 1979. Technology for Jonas is something outside the human and which threatens the human, although technology and ethics are intertwined. Men and the community are not prepared for this modern technology. Nowadays, we can view technology in a less antagonistic way and rather consider it part of human life. Hence the encounter between the human and technology can be seen from a different and less dualistic perspective. Technology is not only external, but is also a part of our life on which we rely and which creates new values. For Jonas technology intrinsically means alienation.
This aspect of alienation is characteristic for philosophers who were confronted with enormous impact of technology during the last century. The evolution of technology during that time was fast, and consequently it became a part of the human life, but it was not fully integrated. The development of technology was considered somehow external.  The attitude of philosophers in that period of time was one of being critical (e.g. Heidegger, Ellul) and even inimical to technology. In addition, the development of technology deemed insurmountable. For example, Ellul emphasizes the autonomous power of technology. Philosophers in this period of time thought that technology would influence labor relations and social structure, but also human life on a more fundamental level (van den Berg & Keymolen, 2013). Nowadays, technology is not external to us, but interwoven"

Then, to better quantify cellulose binding, we would need to assay using absorbance left after x number of washes. After this characterization is finished, we would then reconstruct a HYDRA with cellulose and spores. If we succeed, the bioHYDRAs could then be used as a reversible, biological, self-folding mechanism for biOrigami. In conjunction with bioplastics, we can then create structures that contain both reversible and irreversible folds, expanding the potential and complexity of the structures we make with biOrigami.

Making HYDRAs (from Columbia's Chen at al.: [1]
We used 5µl of 0.1% Poly-L-Lysine to coat the polyamide tape on each spot where we wanted to put spores. We then allowed it to dry for several hours. A spore-glue mixture was made using 1µl of Elmer’s glue with 1 ml of a suspension of spores (2.55e9 spores/ml). 10µl of this spore glue mixture was applied to the poly-L-Lysine coated surfaces and allowed to dry. It is crucial to ensure that there is no surface on the polyimide tape that is not covered with spores.

""Pulldate is great for the consumer, and could be even better for the producer, when you throw out your food before expired.""
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
'Pull date Box' can be used with any Tupperwar food storage system and gives you immediate access to information about what's in the box. The intensity of coloration on the 'Pull date Box' sticky-tape will show you how old its contents are. If it is completely red, you'd better throw it away if you want to protect your children!
Technical Description
To use the system, install our patented antigen-antibody sticky-tape on any of your Tupperwar storage system by pulling a piece through the little opening on the top of the box. Close it and keep it locked. Now the tape is contaminated with the contents of the box. The concentration of different bad smells will affect the intensity of coloration because of the specialized antibodies on the sticky-tape sheet.

Abstract
Our project is preserving food without cooling by flavor that E. coli produces
Therefore, We asked Team Tokyo-Tech to calculate the sufficient amount of culture fluid of E. coli which produce Geraniol (flavor) and time that Geraniol functions to preserve of the food in a certain lunch box.
Setting the situation and method
They constructed a model that They were preserving rice in a certain lunch box and laying the “Geraniol sheet” which contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E. coli on the bottom of the lunch box. Rice was packed in the lanch box and the Geraniol sheet put(8W X 8D X 2H) on the center of the bottom of lanch box. The Graniol sheet is 8W X 8D X 2H,It contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E. coli in a culture fluid.
They calculated the concentration of Geraniol in the sheet to surpass the effective bactericidal in the place where it was the lightest after 24 hours had passed since Graniol began to spread in lanch box.

iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-ups
We participated in a iGEM JAPAN exchange meet-up held in Aug 14 at Tokyo Metropolitan University, where iGEM teams from Japan gathered, made presentations on their projects and  shared opinions on these projects. Our team introduced our project, especially BioBrick Search, which was already in action at that time, to other teams. This enabled them to take advantage of our tools. Also, we gained a lot of feedback from other teams that were essential in improving our tools. It was a great opportunity for all of us.
BioBrick Search
We put up a community post regarding BioBrick Search to let other iGEM teams around the world know about our tool ( https://2012.igem.org/Community ). We got access from 16 different countries and other iGEM teams, in general, gave us favorable responses. The feedback we received include:
We successfully found the appropriate parts from their functions.
We took into account the ""reliability"" score to determine which BioBrick parts to use.
Our project is similar to a past project from Tokyo Tech and we used this tool to find the parts that Tokyo Tech submitted.

Several effects and new questions will rise of that interdisciplinarity, reflexivity and critical perspectives. What are the effects of those institutional and disciplinary causes of the ethical questions? Why and how can we enlighten what is “new” in biological engineering and in the IGEM competition through ethical reflexion? As we will analyze it in the introduction, we will have to consider the ethical reflexion as necessary, once we have admitted the social responsibilities of science and scientists regarding the social effects of their theoretical and material production. Our work will be lead by another imperative of the ethical reflexion, in order to make it concrete and not to give up to that intellectual temptation to go through concepts and methods without actually “doing something” about it. That imperative is making that ethical reflexion “practical” and so, to see who, where and when the decision process is made and how we can operate on it. Beside our aim, a rapid check on the institutional literature about synthetic biology, such as (CRI), make us consider the fact that reflexion is shared between different kinds of actors of that scientific field, especially States, international organizations and national agencies. The ethical questions about synthetic biology are also and mainly about questioning the governance of the field. How, as a first step, will we manage the debate? Then, how will we supply the decision making? In other words, who is going to decide? Who, after putting stakes into light, will deal and manage the tensions linked to that stakes? That tension is inherent to what could be the definition of “scientific ethics” : the coexistence, the “harmony” between a free scientific research, both in theories and practices, and the social responsibilities of those scientific theories and practices. The necessity of the ethical question can now be seen as “viral”, once accepted, it leads us necessarily to the question of the governance, of the decision making, of the action and regulation, from now, each seen as something necessary too.

On Wednesday, the 19th of September we went to Utrecht for an interview with the NRC newspaper. NRC was interested in writing an article about all six of the Dutch iGEM teams and a meeting was scheduled for this. Groningen, Utrecht, Leiden and Eindhoven were present and we talked about several topics of the iGEM process. What is it exactly that you team is working on, how does a biobrick influence synthetic biology, do you interact with the public about your project, what happens with the research that you do, these were all questions that we discussed that day. It was a very informative afternoon and it was nice to see such a variety in teams since everyone is working on something different. We are very glad that NRC showed interest in iGEM and this can increase awareness for the iGEM competition, since it is a relatively unknown subject in Eindhoven.

Interview Cursor
November 2018
We scheduled an interview with the Cursor, the official newspaper of our University. This was about our team, what we did, our project, what we achieved and how Boston went for us. We aimed to attract more attention from our university to our team and the iGEM competition. There are several student teams on our university, and the iGEM team is not very well known outside the Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry Faculties. This is because we do not have something concrete toshow, like for instance a racing car. However via Cursor we hope that we can show everyone that synthetic biology is not just spending every day in the lab and only doing science, but that it is also socially very relevant and dealing with relevant problems and that synthetic biology might very well be the future of society.

Abstract
The problem of uranium contamination is a source of great concern. Uranium could have severe detrimental health effects (it is particularly harmful to the liver, kidney and bones) and lead to environment issues (chemical and radioactive hazards). Current treatment options available for uranium leaks in nuclear power plants or uranium pollution around ore-fields, such as ion exchange, flocculation-setting and phytoremediation, all have limitations including their high cost, low efficiency and the sheer complexity of the involved procedures.
To address these problems, the Peking iGEM team aims to construct a novel functional biomaterial consisting of multiple functional protein modules. This material is designed to be produced and secreted by bacteria, and self-assembled to form a polymer network. In combination with a specific Super Uranyl-binding Protein , it obtains the ability to adsorb uranyl ions. After very short contacting with polluted water, the uranyl-laden biomaterial, which also contains a monomeric streptavidin module , could be easily retrieved using biotinylated magnetic beads.
This uranyl-binding biomaterial shows a series of advantages, such as high specificity, high efficiency, self-assembly and renewability. Furthermore, the uranyl-binding module could be replaced or combined with modules that are capable of binding other heavy metal ions, as well as fluorescent proteins, obtaining multi-functionality . By taking advantage of modularization in the design, additional applications beyond uranium adsorption could be developed based on this material in the future."
TU_Eindhoven,2015,Team:TU Eindhoven#Policy Practices#Application scenarios_-_-_TEXT.html," however, the immunity of the patient is tested by interferon gamma detection, a signaling molecule which is secreted by immune cells upon recognition of the pathogen. The developed test shows similar specificity and sensitivity as skin tests and serological tests. Data is, however, available within 24 hours and the test does not depend on training of personnel. A drawback in the diagnostics of Q fever is that the distinction between patients with an acute infection or patients which already have been through the disease process is hard to make. For microbiologists this is a very important thing, because they are only allowed to give antibiotics to patients with acute Q fever. At a later stage only treatment in psychological aspect can be done.
Figure  5: After first contact with the pathogen, 40% of the patients fall ill. After the patient falls ill, DNA of Coxiella Burnetti becomes detectable in the blood. This DNA remains detectable for approximately 2 weeks. 1.5 weeks after the acute infection, Phase I-antibodies become detectable in the blood. In an acute infection, this is rapidly followed by detectable levels of Phase II-antibodies. In contrast to Coxiella Burnetii’s DNA, serological tests for antibodies remain positive for more than 12 months after the acute infection.
Future application: COMBs
Goat vaccination
The biomarkers available for Q fever have led to a wide range of diagnostical tools. Conventional tools to detect previous Q fever have been serological tests and skin tests. Both tests, however, have major drawbacks. Serological tests suffer from a higher variability and show long return times. Skin tests also suffer from a higher variability and success of skin tests relies on trained personnel [Specific Interferon gamma Detection]. As an alternative to these tests, interferon gamma detection has been developed. In this test, a blood sample from the patient is taken which is incubated with Coxiella Burnetti antigens. Rather than testing for the presence of antibodies, however, the immunity of the patient is tested by interferon gamma detection, a signaling molecule which is secreted by immune cells upon recognition of the pathogen. The developed test shows similar specificity and sensitivity as skin tests and serological tests. Data is, however, available within 24 hours and the test does not depend on training of personnel.
Both serology and the interferon gamma detection test have a major disadvantage, however, as they rely on immunology of the patient. This is a problem because of the lag phase in antibody response: it takes up to two weeks before a patient’s blood"

Overcoming Weaknesses and Threats
4.6 Anticipation
Doping knows a long history of development. As a rat race, detection methods have for a long time been following up on developments in doping use. We believe we should not be naïve in the sense that this time we are first, since there are certainly clues that gene doping is already happening. However, gene doping is different from more conventional doping in the sense that it is highly versatile. Therefore, we thought of a method to anticipate further developments within gene doping. This we do through our self-learning algorithm for gene doping sequence classification as is described on our software tool page. We challenged engineers at the Cyber Security Week to hack our method in order to become as strong as we can be against gene doping. In this way we are the first to openly use collaborative strengths in the race against doping.
We realize that inventive and knowledgeable people could potentially mess with our system, as with almost every detection method. Therefore, we asked all stakeholders we interviewed how they would circumvent our method in order to map our weaknesses. Most directed us into RNA injections in the samples. This might indeed complicate our targeted sequencing. However, then they would need to have the specific knowledge of the actual guide RNA’s that are used, they must have access to the blood sample afterwards and this will not circumvent our prescreen. When the prescreen is positive and the sequence verification negative, a second blood sample might be requested, which fits in with the standard practice in doping testing.

Greece,2017,Team:Greece#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," of millimetres in height and centimetres across. An E. Coli cell is about 1μm -- a huge difference in scale! This difference makes the problem quite difficult to solve in practice.
An important simplification at this point is to assume axial symmetry around the axis of the cylinder, thus making the problem tractable. We express the PDE in cylindrical coordinates;  after eliminating the angular coefficients of the derivatives, we are left with:
$$\rho \frac{\partial{\mathit{[AHL]}}}{\partial{t}} = D \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{\rho}}\left(\rho \frac{\partial{\mathit{[AHL]}}}{\partial{\rho}}\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial{z}}\left(\rho \frac{\partial{\mathit{[AHL]}}}{\partial{z}}\right)\right) + \rho q$$
If we now transform $\rho \mapsto x$ & $z \mapsto y$, thus having:
$$x \frac{\partial{\mathit{[AHL]}}}{\partial{t}} = \nabla \cdot \left(xD \nabla \mathit{[AHL]} \right) + x q$$
This is identical to the diffusion equation above, where the time coefficient is $x$, the diffusion coefficient $xD$ and the production coefficient $xq$. Therefore, we’ll solve this problem on a 2D vertical cross-section of the cylinder, whose solutions are the same as the initial equation on the full 3D cylinder. The final geometry is shown in figure 10 . The bacteria are the small red rectangles shown in the zoomed-in image.
Figure 10 left: The geometry on which the diffusion PDE is solved. It represents an axisymmetric 3D cylindrical geometry: an agar plate. The left side is the cylinder’s axis, the right side is the rim. The top is the cylinder’s surface. On the top near the axis there are some bacteria. Since this perspective is a cross-section of the agar plate, the bacteria actually occupy a small disk on the surface of the agar near the axis (every shape in this geometry should be rotated around the axis to imagine its 3D representation).
Figure 10 right: Each red rectangle represents an E. Coli cell. The bacteria are organized in orderly rings and layers with no spaces between them (maximum density). In this case, there are 600 rings of bacteria and 4 layers**"
