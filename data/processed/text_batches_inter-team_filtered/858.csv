Pipette 10uL of dH2O (distilled water) into the well. Pipette up and down a few times and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended. The resuspension will be red, as the dried DNA has cresol red dye. We recommend that you do not use TE to resuspend the dried DNA.
Transform 1ul of the resuspended DNA into your desired competent cells, plate your transformation with the appropriate antibiotic* and grow overnight.
Pick a single colony and inoculate broth (again, with the correct antibiotic) and grow for 16 hours.
Use the resulting culture to miniprep the DNA AND make your own glycerol stock (for further instruction on making a glycerol see this page ). We recommend using the miniprepped DNA to run QC tests, such as restriction digests and sequencing.
* To know which antibiotics to use, look at the plasmid that the part is in. The naming scheme for plasmids is specifically designed to indicate antibiotic resistance.

British_Columbia,2014,Team:British Columbia#Teamtest_-_-_TEXT.html," engineering principles (ie. reusability, modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating. I feel that iGEM is a rare opportunity, especially for undergraduate students, to get to put together a project of their own design and presenting it internationally.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to better and refine my modelling skills and knowledge from participating in iGEM and if possible to get to touch a bit of wet lab as well.
What inspires you:
The possibility of alternate realities inspires me and in a way I see research as a means that could bridge us from our present state to one of these realities. It is an incredible privilege to be able to entertain our imagination through practical means of testing and experimentation and of those rare moments when we can reap results from it, there are many thanks to give.
Desired Impact on the World:
It would be an exciting realm to be in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Public Health and be able to contribute in that area.
Hobbies:
I enjoy reading the National Geographics, New York Times and every now and then, the Sanger Blog.

Major and Year:
Honors Microbiology and Immunology 4th Year
Why iGEM:
I first heard about iGEM when I was in high school and ever since I wanted to be part of it, for me this is a very exciting opportunity. I first joined the team last year and I enjoyed it so much I decided to return. I can’t wait to make some awesome bacteria! I moved to Canada two years ago from Germany. Now I am really enjoying Vancouver.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to play a bigger role in designing the constructs and systems for our project this year. In addition I hope to improve my public speaking skills and learn even more about the creative applications of microbes through this years Giant Jamboree!
What inspires you:
I love bacteria and all sorts of Microbes but aside from microbiology I am interested in marine biology. Through scuba diving, my favourite destination being Egypt, I fell in love with the beautiful underwater world.
Desired Impact on the World:
I love research and I want to pursue a career in science, what that will look like and where I will be is a mystery right now but I’m sure it will all work out.
Hobbies:
My favourite thing to do here is skiing in winter; I can’t wait for next season. On campus you can find me either in the lab, at the gallery, or at the pool napping. But if there is something you"

Case Study
New South Wales, Australia: In 2004, New South Wales, Australia observed a huge spike in nickel concentration in their drinking water. (See graph) Although scientists don't know the exact reasons for how nickel concentrations increased so dramatically, as shown in figure 1, they hypothesize that it could be the result of a natural reduction of flow rate during a period of drought and the subsequent introduction of mine water into the drinking water supply. Overall fluctuations of nickel concentrations over the three years were attributed to natural dilution and changes in demands of water.
The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines mandates a safety threshold of  0.02 mg Ni/L water, a value that is based on 70 kg (154 lbs) average body weight, 2 L water consumed daily and 1000 as the safety factor to account for uncertainty of extending animal study results to humans. The residents of New South Wales are assumed to have a similar diet to the rest of Australia's population so that the results of the study can be extended to the whole country. The study also assumed that the entire population of New South Wales was nickel-sensitive. This would lead to a lower Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) and set stricter limit for tolerable mean nickel concentrations. The result of the study showed that the mean nickel concentration, 0.03 mg/L with a 95% confidence interval of 0.02-0.04 mg/L, is only approximately 7% of the LOAEL. Thus the mean nickel concentration in drinking water in New South Wales appears to have no health risks.
New South Wales, Austrailia
Although no real risks were detected, the town implemented increased surveillance of nickel concentrations and made plans to use alternative sources to supplement drinking water supplies during droughts. This study shows the importance of continued vigilance in maintaining high water quality standards at all times, had the concentration of nickel increased past the LOAEL, health effects could have been more drastic.[9]
Current Remediation Techniques
Cyclic electrowinning/precipitation (CEP) : use of electrical current to transform positively charged metal cations into a stable, solid state where they can be easily separated from water and removed.
Drawback: concentration of cations must be high (threshold of 100 ppm)
Chemical precipitation: use of hydroxides and sulfides to precipitate cations.
Advantages:
Well-established, many available chemicals and equipment
Convenient, self-operating and low-maintenance due to closed system nature"

The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Furthermore, we synthesized this variant and together with two receptors we designed based on educated guesses we got three receptors for our experimental work.
Experimental design
Verification of peroxisomal protein import was performed  by tagging the fluorescent protein mTurquoise with our designed PTS variants. Additionally, a peroxisomal membrane protein was used to ensure peroxisomal localization. For that reason, we chose the transmembrane domain of Pex13 tagged with the fluorescent protein mRuby.
Pex13−mRuby
We used the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13 as a fluorescent marker − by just using the transmembrane domain of Pex13 with a short linker, we make sure that it has no influence on the peroxisomal features. To obtain a higher differentiation from mTurquoise, which we use for another construct, we chose to work with mRuby. Literature research revealed that such constructs have been tested before − Erdmann et al. (2004) described a construct containing only PEX13200-310 with a C-terminal GFP.
Figure 1.3: PEX13 construct with C-terminal mRuby.
Pex5 variant
In order to achieve an orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery we used a Pex5 knockout yeast strain in which we transformed our artificial  Pex5 variant containing a modified PTS1 binding pocket. Our variation facilitates the detection of a non native PTS1 variant instead of the wild type PTS1. The construct contains a medium strength promotor, the Pex5 gene and a terminator. The remaining plasmid parts can be seen in the plasmid map below.
Figure 1.4: Pex5 gene variant.
mTurquoise−PTS
Our approach for import verification is based on the fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with our modeled PTS variants. After several promotor tests with different strengths, we decided to express this construct only in low amounts, since this was the most suitable possibility to detect potential mTurquoise localization.
Our construct is depicted in the figure below.
Figure 1.5: Fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with the PTS variant.
Combination of our constructs
To combine our constructs, we cloned our PEX5 and mTurquoise constructs into a level 2 plasmid portrayed below.

Subsequently,  co-transformation of the PEX13−mRuby plasmid and the level 2 plasmid was performed in order to verify peroxisomal colocal"

Friday 1st
We had a meeting with today with some of the supervisors, who are keen to feel out aspects of the project we can ‘kill’ – now that there’s four weeks left. This caused some dismay, but there is some logic to it. There is to be a more official meeting next week where a final decision will be made.
We also had a meeting with Dr. Sam Brown, who advised us on the best way to go about modelling our populations and the mathematics of their growth patterns.

We met with Frazer again today, who showed us the thing he’s made. It’s a boat with a tree in it, and it represents all kinds of stuff. Then we went to the pub.
Tuesday 5th
Had a Skype chat with the iGEM team from Colombia – seems they are an organising an interesting competition that they want us to be a part of – we shall investigate this.
The model is also becoming more sophisticated after a long discussion today.
Wednesday 6th
Elize and Chiara read all about ants and bees and viruses. They seem confident that this will further our human practices, but it also possible they have simply gone mad.
Thursday 7th
Another big, grand meeting with the supervisors, which ended up being mostly about branding. Some rash promises were made regarding wiki deadlines, and we talked about our art project by Frazer.
Friday 8th
The population control genes were transformed into our cells, and a PAGE gel was run for our degron ligations.
Weekend 9th-10th
Overnight incubations for some transformants were set up - nothing major.
Week 12 (11th August – 17th August)
Monday 11th
The population constructs were miniprepped out and examined on a gel, to mixed results. On a more positive note, we all had a branding meeting at the pub in the evening, where a sort of proto-logo was designed.
Tuesday 12th

We then made some adjustments to the concentrations of substrates provided by Paris_Bettencourt in 2014, because we found that our E. coli could not grow at the concentration of 5mM of Benzoic acid, which might be due to the burden of four plasmids and the fragility of our bacteria. Therefore, we used the concentration of 1 mM, at which our E.coli can grow normally.
.
HPLC was applied to detect our products in the fluid LB medium. However, we faced great difficulties because rare previous literature had reported the mobile phase, the temperature, and even the parameter settings of the three molecules, especially geosmin and methyl benzoate. So we chose acetonitrile-water, which is the most common mobile phase, to roughly separate the substances in the LB medium and 200nm as the detection wavelength, which was commonly used to detect Limonene[6].
Figure 6. The HPLC results of the standard samples of Limonene, Methyl benzoate and Geosmin. The retention times were 8.770min, 3.764min, 2.835min, respectively.
Figure 7. The HPLC result of the sample induced by blue light. Peaks at 2.703min, and 3.743min were found, which were closed to the peaks of methyl benzoate and geosmin. But further analysis (for example mass spectrometry, MS) were also required to determine the substances which produced these peaks.
The HPLC results of standard samples were shown in Figure 6, while that of our samples induced by Blue light was shown in figure 7. The retention times of Limonene, Methyl benzoate and Geosmin were 8.770min, 3.764min, 2.835min, respectively. The peaks were found in our HPLC results of our samples, but the peaks were not divided and further analysis (for example MS) were required to determine the substances which produced these peaks. What’s more, it required a large amount of time and effort for us to discover the right mobile phase and specific detection wavelengths of the products. Considering that our system had been tested by fluorescent proteins and enzymes and it really worked well, we did not spend more time on the HPLC analysis, but we believed that we could do further researches on our products once the conditions and the parameter settings of our products were reported.(More details of the function of our system, see LIGHT TO COLOR ).

OxyR is constitutively expressed but activated only under oxidative stressed conditions caused by H2O2. The activated OxyR binds to the promoter region of the ahpC gene and promotes its transcription.

Fig.2 The sufA operon(sufABCDSE) is involved in the assembly of Fe-S clusters.Expression of the sufA gene is induced by superoxide generators and hydrogen peroxide.The sufA-proximal region also contains the OxyR binding region(OBR),and OxyR functions as one of the activators of the sufA operon.
sufA promoter is controlled by some transcription factors including OxyR, regulates the transcription of sufABCDSE operon encoding an alternative Fe-S cluster assembly system in E.coli. We also constructed expression systems in which the sufA promoter controls the transcription of fluorescent protein genes and measured the fluorescent intensity.
2. How is the pen that efficiently mixes the active oxygen and E. coli made?
The E.coli Pen changes the mixing rate for E. coli culture medium and hydrogen peroxide.  The volume of each solution, placed in different tubes within the pen, can be regulated by the frequency and intensity of pressing the pen's piston which can be interchanged among both tubes. For example, to make red ink, one presses the pyston in the E. coli tube three times and then interchanges to the hydrogen peroxide tube and presses the piston twice. Or, to use green ink, press the E. coli tube five times and then the hydrogen peroxide tube only once. In this way, one is able to produce any color. This is a spectacular way of producing new colors that any conventional pen can not realize. The movie of the E.coli Pen is shown in the first page of wiki of our team.

4. Audiogenetics platform construction with directed-evolution
With continuing development in synthetic biology, plenty of methods have been developed to regulate gene expression artificially, including the two most common regulation systems, chemical genetics [15] and optogenetics. [16] [17]
In chemical genetics, small molecule drugs such as aTc are used to induce gene expression, while it lacks spatial specificity and the concentration of small chemicals in the cell is not stable. Optogenetics employs light as an input signal to induce gene expression. However, there are side effects caused by laser-induced heating and abnormal ion distribution caused by over-expressed pumps or channels. In addition, undesired disturbance of homeostasis can make it difficult for experimental interpretation. Shallow penetration of light in human tissue also limit the clinical application of optogenetics. [18]
Based on the previous study, we hoped to establish a platform to realize audiogenetics. Compared to the methods above, sound signal is easy to generate and less harmful to research objects.
The key element of this platform is the receptor of sound, which is the mechanosensitive channel. We developed a method to screen channel mutants which could response to specific sound frequency and intensity.
First of all, a library of TRPC5 channel was constructed by random mutation. We made the ankyrin repeats region (which is proposed to responsible for mechanical force sensing. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] ) as the mutation region by using error-prone PCR.
Secondly, cell with single copy TRPC5 should be produced. As been reported, high-efficiency screening method is crucial for directed evolution. Thus, we need to ensure that each transfected cell has only one mutated TRPC5 copy---cells contain two or more copy number of TRPC5 could complicate the selectivity. To realize this goal, we developed a two-step strategy, used PiggyBac transposon to integrate a single Loxp site into CHO-K1 cells’ genome. Then, we got single colonies by FACS. After extracting cell’s genome, we established a  real-time qPCR strategy to identify cell clones with single copy"

Our advisor Esengül provided us with a protocol for the Gibson Assembly (see protocols).
The first step of the Gibson Assembly was to generate linear DNA segments by Phusion PCR. This was performed and to check the products, 5µL reaction product was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel.
None of the PCR products yielded the correct length. Especially K1149051 was not nearly the length expected. Sequences arrived, and it appeared that the were not correct. We figured that the backbone could have been pasted to each other twice, forming a plasmid like that with antibiotic resistance. For this, another round of colony PCR for K1149051 pSB4A5. Another colony PCR should be performed.

Figure 2: A Comparison of the total number of blast® hit matches of proteins of interest with predicted genes in M. polymorpha
Figure 3: A comparison of the congruence of blast® hit matches of proteins of interest with predicted genes and with mRNA transcripts in M. polymorpha
The mean total number of hits for a predicted gene was 5 [see Figure 2]. Of the genes for which the hit value is at this frequency or above, all except three relate to nitrate-inducible responses; the remainder relate to potassium starvation responses. It can be considered that the queried genes with more matches to M. polymorpha along the predicted gene sequence lengths are likelier to be better homologues. However we think that a mapping of the blast® hits to the predicted genes would be needed to confirm this. This is because a spread of hits along the gene length would give stronger evidence than many hits to the same location, which we have not ruled out at this time.
Comparing Figures 2 and 3 , predicted genes 4354 and 11107 are the best candidates for further work as they both have relatively high hit frequency and congruence with mRNA and the queried gene sequences. Gene 11107 also demonstrates a good match with the gene AtNRT2.1 (45.6% congruence) which has been shown to be “induced by very low levels of nitrate (50 μM KNO3)” (Filleur, Daniel-Vedele, 1999) [8] . Given this sensitivity, we suggest that this gene would be a very good candidate for experimentally verifying the associated promoter (P_Ni20, iGEM Registry Part:BBa_K1484336). Gene 4354 demonstrates a good match with the gene AtNRT2.2 (57.7% congruence), which is expressed up to 8 days earlier than AtNRT2.1 (Zhuo et al., 1999) [9] and so it may be quicker to experimentally verify the promoter for  this potential homologue [P_Ni17, iGEM Registry Part:BBa_K1484333].
Although gene 11169 did not match with an mRNA transcript, it has been included in Figure 3 as an observation of interest. It might seem a very good candidate for further"
Carnegie_Mellon,2014,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Talks_-_-_TEXT.html," volunteered at the Science is Fun: Hands-On Workshops for Kids Grs. 3-5 with Catalina Achim, one of the team members at DNAZone and a chemistry professor at CMU in order to understand what the implementation of one of the established kits would be like in a smaller classroom setting. The ten kids all came from different parts of the country since the workshop was open to any child visiting that weekend and were primarily in elementary school. Two color-related experiments were run for the younger crowd. The first involved using a spectrometer to distinguish visible color bands off a CD and in two different lightings. In a brighter setting, the bands were sharper and also brighter, while in a darker setting they were mainly dull. Using colored cellophane, the kids were able to isolate often one color band depending on the color chosen from the cellophane pieces. The second experiment involved solubility when it comes to water vs. shaving cream. Finding out that food coloring is not soluble in shaving cream gave the kids free reign to create color pictures using this property. Dropping different food coloring dyes on shaving cream and then mixing it with toothpicks and tongue depressors, the kids could make a colorful mosaic piece and then imprint it on an index card to take home. Overall, it was fun helped us realized how the kits would work (and would need improvement on) in a smaller setting, especially with elementary.

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Collaborations
We joined up with the National University of Singapore iGEM Team to collaborate and help each other with the modelling aspect of our projects.
In order to assist us characterise our star peptide, we asked NUS Singapore to create a simple diffusion simulation on MATLAB. Their diffusion program and our subsequent utilisation of this simulator can be found here.
The NUS Singapore team asked us to help them visualise and compare the simulation and theoretical solutions they developed for their cylindrical diffusion system. Their model involves determining the concentration of a particular molecule in terms of cylindrical coordinates at a particular instance in time. The coordinate system of their model is illustrated below.
NUS Singapore provided us with results from a two-dimensional diffusion simulation they developed. The simulation data contains $r$ and $z$ values for different time steps in the cylindrical bacteria. The initial condition of their model is visualised below, with yellow representing a high concentration and purple representing a low concentration.
Using MATLAB, we were able to provide visual representations for various time steps of their simulation.
From the images displayed above, we can see that the system undergoes diffusion until the concentration field is essentially uniform.
NUS Singapore also provided as with us with the equations for the theoretical solution they had developed to the cyclindrical diffusion problem:
Using the same initial concentration field used in the simulation, we attempted to implement this theoretical solution in MATLAB. Our goal was to vary the number of terms in the series and visualise the resulting concentration fields. Unfortunately, due to some difficulties experienced in the implementation process, we cannot be confident that our results are an accurate representation of the theoretical model provided. In the future, we recommend that an integrator specific to cylindrical coordinates and this model be developed in order for the Kik term to be accurately determined.
Nonetheless, featured below are the concentration fields obtained for different final values of $I$ and $K$ after 10ms. Although these fields are not representative of the theoretical solution, the impact of the number of terms in the series used is still evident. It can therefore be recommended that if this theoretical solution is to be used for further analysis, the maximum number of terms permitted by the available computing power should be used.

We have also modified the PAH sequence on two accounts, in order to remove restriction enzyme recognition sites that would otherwise not allow for the biobricking of the enzyme.
How it was modified
The PAH enzyme in its normal form contains 2 restriction enzyme sites that make it unsuitable for submitting directly to the BioBrick registry. For this reason we used Site Directed Mutagenesis to modify one amino acid in this sequence, thereby removing the restriction enzyme recognition sites and making the DNA sequence suitable for submission to the registry.
We also submitted a seperate DNA part to the registry that has been modified to make

Thanks to the advice Mr. XU gave us, we notice the connection between laboratory work and marketing. Let’s design a device for the application of our project!
Mr. LI
Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the CAFS
How will our device and bacteria be applied in practical fish breeding? We interviewed Mr. LI, Management Staff of the sturgeon breeding technology engineering center of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences to find out the answer.
Key point
At present, full-flow aquaculture was an advanced aquatic cultivation model, which isn’t wildly adapted due to the high cost.
Chemicals or biological agents are rarely used in the full-flow aquaculture factory.
Ammonia nitrogen index isn’t contained in the on-line water monitor system.
It’s quite troublesome and dangerous to detect ammonia nitrogen in laboratory.
The staff of the sturgeon breeding center was grad to apply genetically engineered bacteria product as far as it is highly efficient. Let’s do more things on application!
Interviews with government officials
Wenqi PENG
Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research
Is excessive ammonia genuinely fatal to aquatic creatures? We interviewed Wenqi PENG, Deputy Director of China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research to find out the answer.
Key point
Ammonia: the largest source of water pollution in China after 2010
Fish cannot live in water with the concentration of ammonia above 2mg/L or that of dissolved oxygen below 0.2mg/L
March, 2007, because of Tai Hu’s eutrophication, more than 3 million citizens of Wu Xi City were affected.
No approach was widely adopted to treat ammonia pollution that is both efficiently and economically in China.
We learned from this communication that excessive ammonia is a crucial problem all over the world and. Let’s try to use bacteria to treat excessive ammonia in the fish pond efficiently and economically!
Mr. LI
Supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau
As our device is designed for aquaculture industry, we should have knowledge of what kind of technologies are already used and will to be used in aquaculture. This is why we intervewed Mr. LI, supervisor of Yancheng Ocean and Fisheries Bureau.
Key point
Aquaculture business in Yan Chen City is significantly prosperous.
Biological products is the major method taken to balance and control aqua environment.
IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.

Fig 5. The mapping results of circuit Odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry after BLAST on wormbase.org. The black line represents location of the gene we insert. The comparison result showed that our gene inserted in the chromosome I and started at 14851599.
After getting the genetically inserted worms, we successfully got the hybrid by mating 2 strains.
Examining the function of AWA and AWB neurons
Firstly, the experiment in which inserted worms are strongly attracted by diacetyl shows that the insertion did not degrade normal neuron function (Fig.6)
We also test the result in the neuron level (Fig.7)
Fig. 6 C.elegans' locomotion in the Gaussian plate C.elegans can move forward freely in the channel, and then we will get its locomotion distribution just like the Galton Nail Plate model. However, after adding diacetyl in the side channel, the distribution is changed. C.elegans tend to move towards the right (or the left) due to their preference to diacetyl.
Fig.7 Demonstrate the function of AWA neuron  A) Confocal Image of  worm’s head neuron cells of AWA neurons are circled at the photo (yellow) B) The fluorescence intensity of 497-527nm emission of GEM-GECO falls steeply after applying diacetyl. Combined with calcium, the emission wavelength of GEM-GECO shift from 510nm to 470nm ( central peak)
Examining the behavioral change of individual worms
We designed two methods to observe inserted worms’ behavior change:
Inducing free-moving worms by certain wavelength (Fig.8A)
Stimulating worms semi-fixed in microfluidic chips (Fig.8B)
In the inducing experiments, Odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry worms shows a strong preference to blue light. In the later experiment, we will use this preference to train them to form specific behavior.
Unfortunately, str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP worms are not clearly repelled by the red light. The low sensitivity is probably due to the expression level of Chrimson under the control of str-1 promoter. An modified circuit containing amplification step is design, but the implementation cannot meet the deadline of this wiki.

Safety Considerations in the Lab
How we prepared for lab work
All Principal Investigators, mentors, and undergraduate researchers were required to complete lab safety training and safety courses developed by the University of Calgary's Environment Health and Safety (EHS) services prior to working in the lab. These mandatory safety training courses included courses on occupational health and safety, laboratory safety, hazard assessment, incident reporting and investigation, spill response, biosafety, bloodborne pathogens, and an updated versions of the WHMIS course. The courses cover biological containment protocols, handling of hazardous materials such as liquid nitrogen, and disposal of waste, as well as standard safety and laboratory practices. All required us to take a test following each course, which certified safe lab work under the EHS Guidelines. All team members, advisors, and mentors received credit for each course and training program listed, and supervisors were present in the lab at all times to oversee undergraduate work.
The University of Calgary has a university-wide Biosafety Committee , whose guidelines for safe biological laboratory practices were adhered to throughout the project. The team’s lab benches and experimental plans were assessed and deemed safe to proceed with by this Biosafety Committee. The University's Environment Health and Safety (EHS) services provided additional training for individuals working with radiation and irradiated cells.
Our project utilized Bacillus subtilis and a commonly used lab-strain of Escherichia coli, TOP10. Both are non-pathogenic and non-infectious, and are classified as Biosafety Level 1 organisms (BSL-1). Therefore, these organisms posed no significant risk to researchers. Since the BSL-1 cells (E. coli and B. subtilis) have GRAS labelling, the main cloning component of out project did not require ethics approval by review boards. Some team members worked with HCT116 and 1BR3 primary cell lines, which are human colon carcinoma and human skin fibroblast cell lines and are classified as Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2).The cell lines were received from completely anonymous donors. We handled these cell lines at containment level"

SJTU-BioX-Shanghai,2018,Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai#Interview_-_-_TEXT.html," colon cancer is 2% in people over 50 years of age, and the incidence of colon cancer has little to do with gender. It has been learned from the database of professors in recent years that the age of the onset of colon cancer is decreasing year by year.
All kinds of data suggest that colon cancer needs to receive more attention.
At the same time, after understanding the design of our project, Professor Dr. Davis said that our project is expected to be a convenient and early screening method for colon cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), colorectal cancer is the second most common tumor in men and women after lung cancer. About 2% of people over the age of 50 will eventually develop colorectal cancer in North America. Colorectal cancer often has the same effect on men and women. However, men tend to develop it at a younger age.
2. Hospital population interview
Our project is for the public, not for the doctor. Therefore, it is necessary for us to interview the masses and listen to the voices of the masses; instead of just referring to the professor's recommendations and the doctor's clinical data.
We divided the mass interview into two parts, interviewing the masses and interviewing patients. The reason why we want to treat the respondents in two categories is because the problems we prepare are different from the information we need.
The masses are almost undiseased population, which is a direct target for our early diagnosis of colon cancer. We need to introduce to the masses to promote our products and inspection process, and to investigate the acceptance of the masses.
For people:
If this test is included in a routine test, will you participate in the test?
How much do you think this test should cost?
What are your expectations for this project?
For patients, we focus on pain points in patients. Under the condition of not touching the patient's privacy, we try to interviewee the patient's about their living status and the early examination of colon cancer experienced as much as possible from their mouth.
For patients (general level):
How did you find yourself sick?
How long have you been sick?
How long have you been treated?
How is your treatment effect?
How do you do with your life after long-time treatment?
Is there any change that the cancer gives to you?
From your level of awareness, do you think our project makes sense?
The conclusion is:
With the improvement of science and technology, colon cancer is no longer as painful as before, and most people are acceptable. However, considering the individual tolerance, patients can choose painless colonoscopy according to their own wishes. Painless colon"
UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," soluble silk protein solutions must be much like how they are in natural spider spinnerets. The majority of spinning methods entail pushing, or extruding, silk solution through very thin channels. During this extrusion, shear forces on the silk solution cause the amino acids of the proteins to align in a way that allows the strong beta sheets of the silk structure to form. Multiple proteins are similarly aligned, causing separate proteins to interact and form larger structures.[2]
We used a 21 gauge needle to load the silk dope into a 1 mL BD syringe with luer lok. We then replaced the needle with PEEK tubing of 0.127 mm inner diameter. We used a syringe pump to extrude the silk at a rate of 10 uL/min into a coagulation bath of 90% v/v isopropanol and water. After the fiber formed, we drew it out of the bath and wound it around a motorized godet to collect the fiber as it formed.
Prototype of our setup. The glass dish contains the isopropanol bath. The godet is driven by a stepper motor.
A closeup of our spinner setup. The godet draws the fiber from the bath after it has formed.
Closeup of the co-spun silk wound around the godet.
Co-spun silk after removing from the godet. A small volume (~500 uL) of dope yields a very long contiguous length of fiber, but in order to remove from the godet without inadvertently stretching the fiber, we had to cut it.

We used an EVOS light microscope to image the fibers under white light and blue excitation light. We used ImageJ to determine fluorescence of the fiber.
Testing the composite silk
We tested our co-spun fibers in an Instron model 5564 table mounted system with a 10kN load cell. To prepare our fibers for testing, we mounted them on cardstock frames with 10 mm gauge length. We then loaded the carded fibers into the Instron with pneumatic grips and cut the sides of the cardstock frame. We then had the machine extend the fiber at a rate of 0.1 mm/min and measure the tensile force of the fiber.
An example of the frames that we used to prepare the fibers for Instron testing.

We took images along three points on the fiber and used ImageJ to measure the diameter of the fiber at each point."

We worked in many different scientific fields to find suitable ways for the translational incorporate of non-canonical amino acids into proteins. Repurposing existing codons or incorporating new bases are two possible ways. We realized both ways to expand the genetic code of Escherichia coli.
The repurposing of a codon for the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) is possible using the rarely used amber stop codon UAG or other rarely used codons like the leucine codon CUA. To incorporate a non-canonical amino acid using these codons, an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( tRNA/aaRS ) pair is necessary, which can charge the ncAA to the tRNA. We designed and synthetized the novel ncAA Nγ‑2‑cyanobenzothiazol‑6‑yl‑L‑asparagine ( CBT-asparagine ). This ncAA has the chemical ability of perform a highly specific covalent binding reaction, which we wanted to incorporate into our target protein. Therefore, we created a library of aaRS with"

Week 16
04-19: Meeting with Marc Lemonnier, CEO of Antabio
We met Marc Lemonnier, founding CEO of ANTABIO: a start-up that develops novel therapies to treat drug-resistant infections by the most critical Gram-negative pathogens. This was our first meeting within the Entrepreneurship part of the project. The aim was to learn about the approach to follow to start a business and to have a first external opinion regarding the integration of our biological system into the market. You can read the result of his testimony here.
04-20: 13th brainstorming
We’ve found a company called “Sunwaterlife” that work on water treatment by filtrating water in Toulouse. We’ve planned to meet them to take advices from their experience, and ask if they could help us to build our device to contain GMMs into a membrane to avoid their dispersion into the environment. For the peptide-producer yeast, we’ve selected Pichia pastoris, famous for it’s capacity of fast production of proteins. To make a communication between our two organisms, we’ve thought of using diacetyl: our detector organism produces diacetyl in response of CAI-1 detection, that triggers AMP by P. pastoris.

04-26: 14th brainstorming
For safety reasons we can’t use V. cholerae for our proof of concept, and we can’t use any gene from that bacteria. As V. harveyi is genetically close to V. cholerae but not pathogenic for human, we can use it’s quorum sensing molecule, the C8-CAI-1 that looks very much as the CAI-1, to mimic V. cholerae. Here, the idea is to engineer a bacteria to be a “cholerae-like bacteria” that produces a lot quorum sensing molecules to be detected by our detector V. harveyi.

Discovery Festival
We organized an iGEM workshop on the Discovery Festival in the Netherlands in collaboration with 3 other Dutch iGEM teams: Amsterdam, Groningen and Wageningen_UR. To cooperate in this large project, the 4 teams met a couple of times on different locations in the Netherlands. Besides these meetings, we discussed a lot during several Skype-meetings. We will take our visitors on a tour in our provisional laboratory, where they will learn about the process of genetic modification. The festival will take place in 3 cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven, and over 5000 visitors are expected. Hopefully, this will inspire other teams in upcoming years to combine forces in reaching out to the public. More information can be found on the public outreach page .

3 Secondary Objective: Solving vitamin A deficiency in the developing world
4 Further Considerations
Introduction: Global problems
It has been predicted that by 2015 supplies of easy-to-access oil and natural gas will no longer keep up with demand. This prediction is based on the current rate of consumption, but this is expect to increase. The repercussions of this are already being felt on a global level with food prices rising.
The burning of fossil fuels is also fuelling global warming. This is having negative effects on crop yields worldwide, with longer droughts occurring year on year, especially in Africa and Australia. The melting of the polar ice-caps which accompanies this will raise sea-levels, inundating currently arable land, reducing the land available for an ever enlarging world population.
At present the major alternative to fossil fuel use for transport comes from ethanol fermented from starch and sugar in sugar cane and soy bean. These biofuel crops are being grown in areas previously used for food crops or in previously pristine natural environments, and thus are unsustainable.
All this is burdening the global economy and destroying lives, and worse is likely to come.
Wouldn't it be brilliant if we could do something to counter this trend?
This is what the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team have been trying to do. - The rising cost of food coupled to the current unsustainability of human activity makes this the perfect time to contemplate the restructuring of global agriculture.
Primary Objective: A single sustainable bacterial solution
A false-colour SEM of MicroMaize cells.
We have been investigating engineering bacteria to produce starch from the cellulose in waste biomass (that is agricultural waste, wood chippings, waste from paper production etc.). This starch could be:
sold to the biofuels industry for conversion to ethanol
used as feed for livestock
used as a starch supplement in the human diet if needed.
This will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and free up agricultural land for the growth of food crops, ultimately putting less strain on ecosystems.
Secondary Objective: Solving vitamin A deficiency in the developing world

Student Helper
XUE Yuan Soso
Yuan Xue is a senior high school student (graduating in 2010) currently pursuing study in La Salle Catholic College Preparatory located in Portland, Oregon. He developed an interest in the field of biology and chemistry after studying the corresponding courses at high school that soon attracted him to iGEM. After approximately two weeks of volunteering in a former iGEM project of iHKU team over the summer of 2008, he had an honor to pledge to working with university students as a HKU-HKBU team member this year in 2009. This precious opportunity gave him an insight into the application of principles of synthetic biology to contributing human welfare; furthermore, it inspired him to pursue further studies in the corresponding field of study as he found it to be intellectually provocative and intriguing.
He was assigned as a wet lab researcher tasked with activating the polar expression on Escherichia coli 2443 OMPT. His primary approach to tackling this task was transforming plasmids into 2443 OMPT. He learned a tremendous amounts of knowledge on regards to research techniques, data analysis, setting for experiments, and the mindset of research – to be both innovative and steadfast.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#Linker_-_-_TEXT.html," negative control. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1100-bp when digested. The gel was a 2% agarose gel and was run at 80 volts for 90 minutes.
A construction attempted this week consited of placing the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) gene behind the promoter BBa_J04500 . Also attempted were plasmid switches of all of the coil genes ordered. Colonies were seen for all of the transformed ligation mixtures for these constructions. Colony PCR of these transformed colonies only produced potentially viable results for the J04500 + K648013 construct. The K-coil, K-coil His-tag and E-coil His-tag plasmid switches also displayed bands around the expected size during colony PCR.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
This week contained some disappointment as the BioBrick constructions continued to have limited efficacy. The confirmation digests of the construct that showed some promise during last week’s colony PCR (J04500 + K648013) and the plasmid switches (K-coil, K-coil His-tag and E-coil His-tag) did not produce expected results. One rather notable issue is the ~200-bp size difference seen in the J04500 + K648013 from the expected size of 955-bp. The difference appears to suggest that the LacI promoter is not present. This hypothesis was confirmed with sequencing results. This would suggest that the wrong enzymes were used during construction or that there is potential contamination of the enzyme buffers used.
A replicate of these constructions this week also produced similar results. Due to this it is recommended that new buffers be used for further constructions. Some of the difficulty present with plasmid switching the coils is due to their small size however. Since the coils themselves are at minimum approximately 60-bp in size. This is not kinetically favorable for BioBrick construction. It may be wise to primer on the coils to appropriate constructs when the time comes for their addition.  Also present in our constructions are re-ligations of the original vector. Due to this the time for phosphatase treatment will be increased from two to three hours to limit this issue.
Week 13: July 22 - July 26
Proceeding with the recommendations from last week regarding BioBrick constructions the plasmid switches of the coil genes into pSB1C3 were attempted again. Based off of the colony PCR there were some potential completed parts for the plasmid"

In order to verify the function of P-atp2, we attached it to Lac Z alpha. In a pXMJ19 plasmid, it was used to transfer this sequence. As this has been thoroughly tested in our lab, we designed to put X-gal into four fermenters equipped with P-atp2-B0034-Lac Z alpha, maintained at ±1 units in different pH from 6.0 to 9.0. The pH was controlled by addition of HCl or NaOH. Compared with empty plasmid, experimental group was bluer than the corresponding control group. However, it became bluer and bluer along with the increasing extracellular pH.
So far, the promoter P-atp2 induced at a range of alkaline pH has been verified. To achieve precise control of the acid production, error-prone was utilized. In this step, we optimized the function of P-atp2, to mutate and filtrate a number of accurate promoters with activity. Despite using EP-PCR, the function of P-atp didn’t change, so we chose those promoters to build a database.
Overall, we have achieved important success in establishing P-atp2 promoters with different efficiency. And we can use it in plenty of specific alkaline situations.

DTU-Denmark,2018,Team:DTU-Denmark#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," we have planned for the final substrate on Mars to be cyanobacteria as they produce O2 from carbon dioxide and can function as a carbon source.
The extreme environment on Mars makes it very hostile compared to on Earth. Extreme cold, high radiation, and very thin atmosphere does not make it an easy task to build nor to live on Mars. We have looked into protecting humans and materials by introducing melanin into the biomaterials, which builds on the work of the Stanford Brown 2016 team . We have also worked on improving the growth and structural strength of the final materials by experimentally testing several fungal candidates, growth conditions and many different substrates. We have also worked with the gene gfaA to improve the structural strength of the mycotecture as well as the gene amilCP to introduce color changes in our materials.
In our project, we chose to primarily work with Aspergillus oryzae as working with Schizophyllum commune and Pleurotus ostreatus proved to be too difficult and time-consuming both in regard to genetic manipulation and growth, for which reason all of the synthetic biology was done in DH5-α E. coli.
Parallel to the wetlab work, a lot of effort has been put into making different models . These modeling efforts have led to two growth models and a mechanical model of the structural integrities using the COMSOL® modeling software. The first of the growth models predict phenotypic growth behavior of fungal colonies by simulating hyphal branching patterns. The other uses a set of partial differential equations to describe the density distribution of fungus considering parameters such as substrate concentration. The final project design, which is made to be easily producible on Mars, utilizes two assemblable triangular planes which can form geodesic domes. The structural integrity of these domes have been simulated with a mechanical model using experimental data based on our fungal materials measured by industrial grade equipment at DTU as well as equipment of our own design .
We are not the first movers when it comes to the production of mycotectures. We have sought out the Green Island, NY-based company Ecovative Design for guidance. They have been extremely helpful in determining growth and baking conditions, as well as sharing their protoplasting protocol and the Ganoderma resinaceum strain, when producing the bricks.
In the iGEM spirit of sharing knowledge and working together,  we have eagerly sought out opportunities to create awareness and collaborate with other iGEM teams. In the spring we hosted a 3-day workshop for the Nordic iGEM teams , we started a high"

Temperature-regulated system
Introduction
It is not a dream anymore that ""making the impossible possible"" with the increase of modern technology. It is also a serious problem that what human has brought to Earth  along with our progressing civilization. Drastic environmental changes are inevitable due to the fact of massive developing industries. Temperature changing are one of the problems we need to confront.
Cells are constantly subjected to changing environmental conditions. Comparing with chemical substances, temperature is more accessible, convenient and lower costing. Moreover, temperature is also less burden to the organisms. Therefore, few organisms use temperature as a regulating factor. A mechanism found in different organisms that makes the cell respond to thermal changes, for example, is the RNA thermometer.
An RNA thermometer is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. The expression of heat-shock, cold-shock and some virulence genes are coordinated in response to temperature changes. There are several systems"

We would like to thank all of those who have supported and assisted us in the laboratory, in the school and in society since the             beginning of our tetracycline detecting and degradation project.

Detection Chasis
The first one is the which belong to the most important section of this double D system. Detecting the presence of tetracycline in the water sample is the first and most vital step among our project.
Through experimental discussion and design, we finally chose E. coli(DH5α) as our chassis organism to finish to constructed works. We need to detect tetracycline in water samples, so our chassis organism needs to be able to grow normally in the water samples containing tetracycline  and complete our detection work. Therefore, we introduced gene tetA, gene tetR and gene tetO to achieve that the original E.coli can be obtained tetracycline resistance. At the same time, gene gfp is used as the visual output, therefore, it is more intuitive to judge whether tetracycline is contained in water samples. We successfully built the detection chasis which registered in the composite parts with its number:
BBa_K2685007
More than 40 genes encoding tetracycline resistance have been characterized to date and they are divided into 11 classes[1]. Among the various tet genes, the tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(E) and tet(G) are reported in gram-negative bacteria. Comparing with those tet genes, we finally chose the tet(A) gene to construct in detection chasis to provide a tetracycline resistance[2][3]. tet(A) gene can code a transmembrane efflux protein that resistance to tetracycline. This is an energy-dependent process that"

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

The flow speed in a microfluidic chip can be modulated with flow rate, tightly tunable with a syringe pump, and the cross-section of the channel, determined with the microfabrication process. After calculation and simulation of fluid dynamics, relationship between the flow speed and shear stress can be readily obtained.
Fig. 2 Photomask We Made to Fabricate the Microfluidics Chip
Specifically, as the dimensions of the microfluidics devices being reduced, physics characteristics in conventional laboratory-scale are no longer applied. Usually the fluid flow in microfludic chips is laminar flow (Reynolds number<3). It leads to a drastic simplification of the complex Navier-Stokes equations describing fluid mechanics.
Our Microfluidics Design
In order to speed up the shear force sweeping experiment, we would like to have parallel chambers with different flow speeds and shear forces in the same chip. After a number of design, fabrication and experiment cycles, we end up with this specifically designed microfluidics chip (Fig.3) so that the flow speeds inside three channels follow a 1:9:81 ratio (Fig.4). The flow rate ratio is determined by the channel branching and branching length. The channels are all with the same width and height, so that the flow rate is linear related to flow speed and shear force. The observation window is designed that three channels are parallel and just fit into the optical field of our Nikon Ti-E live cell imaging systems with a 10x NA0.45 objective and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera.

Fig. 4 Flow speeds inside three channels follow a 1:9:81 ratio
Microfluidics chips in our experiment were made with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) covalently bound on a glass slide. PDMS is the material widely used on fast prototyping microfluidic devices. PDMS chips are widely used in laboratories, especially in the academic community due to their low cost and ease of fabrication. Here are listed the main advantages of such chips: 1. Oxygen and gas permeability 2. Optical transparency, robustness 3. Non toxicity 4. Biocompatibility 5. No water permeability
One of the main drawbacks of PDMS chips is its hydrophobicity. Consequently,"

Conclusions
We can confirm that the rates of formation of the intermediates, namely PPIX, were consistent with our modelling. The highest concentration of ALA (5mM) produced the most CPIII and PPIX, and the lowest concentration (0mM) produced negligible amounts of both intermediates. These results also support Macquarie's 2015 iGEM modelling results for the production of PPIX.
Future Experimental Considerations
For future experiments, we suggest:
Analysing the pellet composition to determine whether the compositions are affecting the resulting output
Altering the media and growth conditions utilised by the experiment to provide alternative results that should still support our hypothesis
Running the IPTG induced cells for 7 days for an accurate comparison between the liquid cultures
Repeating the whole experiment a couple more times for accuracy
Test the pathway all the way from ALA to chlorophyll a, as that is the new main model
Looking To The Future
In terms of creating exciting simulations and simple graphs that could be a model in the future, here is a list of ideas that might have the opportunity to be performed:
Improve current estimation and application of models to take a step further in reaching our goal:
Increase efficiency of hydrogen production via trial simulations with different environmental factors.
For example, Mg-chelatase plasmid is designated as a whole system throughout the chlorophyll biosynthesis and hydrogen production pathway.
Production yield can be maximised by testing and adjustment of limiting parameters or further investigation on other alternatives.
Create an application or program that provides a life interactive model of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway:
It will visually communicate the knowledge of functional intermediates, substrates and enzymes within the pathway especially towards education and outreaching the public.

Colourimetric Application
Background
        In the perverse experiments, we have developed an efficient method to detect metal ions. In order                     to make our method can be used more extensively and popularly, we plan to build up an application to                     help people who are non-professional to deal with the result of chromogenic reaction.
        So why we developed the APP of the smart phone in our project?
        1. Smart phones have been widely used in all over the world, and their ability                     of taking photos has become better and better, which is able to achieve gray scanning accurately. Therefore,                     an application helping people to use our devices can improve the convenience of our method.
        2. The gray scale of our result can been modeled to refer the concentration                     of metal ions.
Gray scanning analysis
        Each color in RGB model has a corresponding value, and each RGB value has a corresponding                     gray value which change as the color change. The darker the color is, the smaller the gray scale value                     is; The lighter the color is, the bigger the gray scale value is. The formula is
U=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
APP: Insight into metal ions
1. Choose metal element that user is going to detect. Initialize corresponding relative molecular mass, the Chinese name or the English name of the metal.
2. Take a picture of the colorimetric card, which can be taken by camera, or be obtained from the mobile album of your phone.
3. Obtain available color of the colorimetric card one by one.
4. Take a picture of the sample.
5. Obtain available color of the sample.
6. Process data. Based on data from step 3 and 5, by means of the formula, the app knows which section the color of the sample is in. So that the app works out the approximate concentration.
7. Display data. Based on the relative molecular mass and the concentration of last step, work out the concentration before dilution.

Introduction
Interlab is aimed to improve reproducibility and compare the difference between laboratories.                         To complete this job,we make three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference                         point, a particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve. Completion of the                         calibrations will ensure that we understand the measurement process and that we can take the                         cell measurements under the same conditions. For the sake of consistency and reproducibility,                         we used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha like other teams. Later, we conducted the CFU experiment.                         We                         count colonies for our two Positive Control (BBa_I20270) cultures and two Negative Control                         (BBa_R0040) cultures.
Methods
—— OD 600 Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
We use LUDOX CL-X (45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to obtain a                         conversion factor to transform your absorbance (AbS600) data from our plate reader                         into a                         comparable OD600 measurement.
$$ Correction\ factor=\frac{ReferenceOD_{600}}{reading_{LUDOX CL-X}-reading_{H_2 O}} $$
—— Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
We prepare a dilution series of monodisperse silica microspheres and measure the AbS600 in our                         plate reader. This measurement allow us to construct a standard curve of particle concentration                         which can be used to convert Abs600 measurements to an estimated number of cells.
$\surd$ Prepare the Microsphere Stock Solution
$\surd$ Prepare the serial dilution of Microspheres
$\surd$ Measure AbS600 of all samples in instrument
——Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein                         Protocol
We will prepare a dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates and measure the                         fluorescence in a 96"
Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#NeuTest1_-_-_TEXT.html,"Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary scientific area that has recently developed. It links various fields of science like biology, chemistry, physics, molecular genetics, informatics and engineering.
Due to this combination the relation of biological design and function can be investigated from an entirely new perspective. The previous approach was limited to the examination of a structure and its function and the attempt to explain how they correlate. Recently, the reverse strategy is applied. Biological parts are specifically designed and constructed according to a desired function. These parts are characterized by a standardized modular design that facilitates their handling. The subsequent introduction of the synthetic constructs to living cells can either cause the replacement of original cellular components or result in additional elements that act cooperatively or more or less autonomously (see fig. 1).
Nagarajan Nandagopal and Michael B. Elowitz. (2011). Synthetic Biology: Integrated Gene Circuits. SCIENCE, Vol. 333: 1244-1248.
Another very important and necessary feature of biological parts is orthogonality, which means in this context that independent devices can be combined unrestrictedly.   This principle derives from the area of engineering and aims to alter subsystems,   without impeding others.
This way cells can be modified as requested, resulting in a predictable behaviour. Among others, this technique can be beneficial for the effective production of certain substances, like biofuels or antibiotics.

We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
- Done! We viewed the lack of information about the intrinsic noise of the promoters on the Registry as a safety concern, both within the field of synthetic biology and for the greater public. By measuring and publishing this information for three of the most frequently used iGEM promoters, we allow future teams and future scientists to better ensure the stability and safety of the genetic networks they create.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:  Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
- Done! In keeping with our theme of informing and educating future scientists about how best to ensure the safety of their work, we conducted extensive outreach initiatives to promote greater awareness and understanding of synthetic biology in school systems and the public. These include:
- Creating an educational synthetic biology booklet with modules for students ranging through ages 5 - 18, coordinating with educational officials of Williamsburg/James City County Public Schools to implement this set of activities, and distributing this booklet for use in schools throughout the state of Virginia,
- Running 9 synthetic biology workshops throughout the state of Virginia to educate and inform students in primary and secondary school about concepts, applications, and safety concerns in the field, and
- Organizing a one-day exhibit with the Q?rius program of the Smithsonian National Museum System to bring the educational themes from the local workshops to the nation’s capital.
- For more information, please visit our practices page .

Project Timeline
The team met for the first time at the beginning of April. For the next month-and-a-half, we brainstormed ideas for our project. By our first day in lab at the end of May, we knew we wanted to design a thallium sensor. Our circuit design solidified over the next week or so as we started to familiarize ourselves with the lab space. By the next week, we were learning lab techniques and applying them to our project.
As we became more comfortable in the lab, we started thinking about human practices. We reached out to summer programs and science museums in the area to see if we could share our iGEM experience with their kids. From July through August, we were busy teaching others about synthetic biology as we continued to develop our idea in the lab.
Work on the Wiki started early in the summer, mainly developing the overall design and adding as much information as we had. Modeling started near the end of the summer as our project became finalized and we had better ideas for what to model.
See our lab notebook for more details on what we worked on each week. It's been a great summer, and we can't wait to meet everyone at the Jamboree!"

USTC-China,2014,Team:USTC-China#modeling#conjugation_-_-_TEXT.html,"To be specific, eliminating the variable of location automatically make the form of possible governing equations going from PDE to ODE: a huge simplification math-wise and an acceptable compromise bio-wise. It's natural to interpret $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$ as  mean values of bacteria concentrations.
The concentration of each type of bacterium is governed by logistic function when an individual type peacefully grows, free from interference of others. $r$, rate of birth, $d$, rate of death, and $K$, environmental capacity are introduced as required by logistic function
$$     \frac{dN}{dt}=[r(1-\frac{N}{k})-d]N     $$     and its integral form.
$$     N(t)=\frac{\frac{r-d}{r}K}{1+(\frac{(r-d)K}{rN_0}-1)e^{-(r-d)t}}
$$     This assumption generally settles down the shape of the equations in the model and establishes a bridge connecting the experimental observation and the theoretical prediction. They will be detailed after.
The different types of bacterium interfere with each other in two ways:  competition & conjugation.
Competition is originated from the contradiction between limited nutrition in the medium and endless reproduction desire of bacteria. Regarding $n$ in $(1-\frac{n}{k})$ of logistic function as the total concentration of all types of bacterium by convention, empowers the equations to describe this phenomenon. Conjugation is the way by which engineered plasmids transfer from E.Coli to C.C.. By appropriately adding a term proportional to the concentration of E. Coli with plasmids and C.C. without plasmids, enables us to evaluate the influence on the growth of bacteria caused by conjugation.
With all the assumptions above, we established our model in principal, which is able to describe almost everything which can affect the amount of bacteria: birth, death, competition and conjugation. We write down our formalism with ODE.      $$\frac{dn_1}{dt}=[r_1(1-\frac{n_1+n_2+n_3}{K}-d_1)]n_1$$     $$\frac{dn_2}{dt}=[r_2(1-\frac{n_1+n_2+n_3}{K}-d_2-d_3)]n_2-kn_1n_2$$     $$\frac{dn_3}{dt}=[r_3(1-\frac{n_1+n_2+n"

UCL,2017,Team:UCL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", the process is instantaneous, allowing for light to break any prevention of cell adhesion immediately.
Design
First, we designed a BioBrick based on the preproprotein of E-cadherin (BBa_K2332312) and tested its capability of forming cell-cell adhesions via aggregation assays. Prof. Stephen Price, UCL, kindly provided us the E-cadherin preproprotein - a key element in how tissue cells adhere to each other naturally. Specifically, E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule that functions in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell morphology during embryongenesis and adulthood. During the secretory pathway the encoded preproprotein undergoes proteolytic processing to generate a mature protein.
Previously, iGEM UCSF 2011 used the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (BBa_K644000) trying to form cell connections. However, E-cadherin’s function depends not only on the presence of calcium but also on the bonding of linker-proteins like alpha and beta catenin to the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin and the actin filaments in the cortex of the mammalian cell. This ‘anchoring’ results in stable mass action and the formation of adherens junctions between cells.
We chose the interaction between the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin and beta-catenin as an entry point into E-Cadherin’s physiology to render the protein photosensitive. By fusing the novel photocleavable protein PhoCl to the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin the interaction with beta-catenin is sterically inhibited. PhoCl is an engineered green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein (Zhang et al. 2017) which we received as a gift from the Robert Campbell lab, University of Alberta, Canada. It consists of 232 amino acids that are cleaved into an ~66-residue N-terminal fragment and an ~166-residue C-terminal fragment. We designed a new BioBrick based on PhoCl (BBa_K2332311) and a BioBrick of the E-cadherin-PhoCl fusion protein (BBa_).
The fusion protein cannot form stable cell-cell connections due to the lack of interactions with the actin cortex. However, after 400 nm, violet light exposure the sterical interference of the N-terminal 66 amino acid PhoCl remnant is too weak to inhibit the formation of connections between E-cadherin and the actin"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," existing design should work and suggested looking into the design of his B-series of Zika virus toehold switches to improve our existing switches. We did so, and modified our design to base them on these switches which have reduced system leakage. They have shorter loops and no-refolding domain which helped increase sensitivity. Based on his feedback, we also increased the loop size for the 15b-5p switch design. This compensates for its long stem (which reduces on state activity), increasing dynamic range. With his help, our switches were optimized for their application as a diagnostic tool. Read more about our first series switches on our design page .

iGEM EPFL
After speaking to several experts who highlighted the importance of reducing false positives and false negatives (see applications section below), we began to explore ways to improve the design of our toehold switches. We spoke to iGEM EPFL - another team working with toehold switches. We explained the issues we had with homologous miRNAs that reduce the specificity of our sensors. iGEM EPFL suggested that we design our switches to utilize the mechanism employed in “Ribocomputing devices for sophisticated in vivo logic computation”. [1]
Based on this advice we designed a second series of toehold switches that can distinguish between miRNA sequences with one nucleotide differences. This improved our design , effectively reducing false positives, a crucial part of any diagnostic method.
With reduced cross-hybridisation, we could create an effective multiplexing assay: multiple switches that each regulate the production of a different reporter protein with a distinct emission peak. This would drastically increase the efficiency and scope of the test. As the second generation of switches can detect single base mismatch differences the sensitivity and specificity of the entire system would be improved.
Professor David Rubinsztein
Professor David Rubinsztein, Professor of Molecular Neurogenetics at Cambridge University, suggested that we use luciferase instead of GFP as our reporter protein. He explained that it may be able to provide more sensitive readings. We produced 4 composite parts as a result - with 2 being toehold switches containing luciferase. However, the constructs with luciferase were so long that, in combination with our inducible promoter, we were unable to insert them into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone in one ligation step. Unfortunately, we did not have time to ligate the individual components of the constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone so we were"

Gel layout
10µl of blue gel loading dye was added to each tube of digested plasmids. 20µl from the contents of each tube were then loaded into a 30-well agarose gel according to the following schematic:
(*the pSB-1C3 well has pSB-1C3 with abijk insert)
The ladder well has 10µl of 2-Log Ladder added into it.
A potential difference of 120V was applied across the gel for 40 minutes before it was stained with ethidium bromide for 30 minutes.
Analysis of Results
Analysis
The first three lanes produced expected results: pBAD33 and pBAD/HisB being “blank” plasmid backbones, the pSB-1C3-abijk lane giving two bands corresponding to similar sizes (being pSB-1C3 and abijk insert respectively).
All the other lanes seem to be showing only products in the 2kb range, which corresponds roughly to the size of the pSB-1C3 backbone, but the sizes are not uniform. Nonetheless, we know that the plasmid extraction step was carried out correctly as it did yield products approximating what we were looking for.
If it was a matter of the ligation step carried out on 23/06 failing entirely, we should be expecting a uniform row of backbone bands. Instead, there are minor but noticeable size variations between each band which cannot be successfully explained by failed digestion/ligation. It is thus speculated that the pSB-1C3 stock we received from iGEM HQ had suffered from varying extents of DNA degradation such that the restriction enzyme cut sites on their ends were no longer.

Extra Lab
Plates that were inoculated on Tuesday were checked for any transformants. The practical was followed by a talk on advanced assembly techniques (by Dr. Vitor Pinheiro).
Thursday 18th June
Morning Lab
Overnight cultures of the transformants were ready to harvest! A glycerol cell stock of E. coli transformants was made by harvesting 0.5 mL of cells and mixing with 0.5 mL of 50% (vol/vol) sterile glycerole (25% final [glycerol]). 1 mL of culture was lysed and used to harvest plasmid DNA.
Purified plasmids were screened for the presence of the insert by a diagnostic restriction digest. This restriction digest effectively liberates the insert from the vector and should yield 2 clear bands. EcoRI & PstI were used to liberate the insert (note that where ligation occurs between XbaI & SpeI in the suffix forms a scar, therefore the EcoRI restriction site in the suffix must be used as a diagnostic - refer to Figure 1). Agarose gels were ran of the digests. Varying degrees of success was observed.
Software & Extra Lab
The extra lab & Software groups had a skype interview with Jacob Beal about the interlab study. He laid out the main aims of the interlab study and answered questions that teams members had over the project.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation with algorithm is reasonable. However, we believe there are too many compromises, thus causing a number of inconsistencies. In the next version, we are looking forward to a more independent MoDeL.
New functions of iGaME
iGaME grows together with MoDeL. In the one-year process of software development, we have achieved many of our goals, and found even more to be achieved. Looking ahead, we have the following wishes for iGaME.
User-friendly output for both professionals and amateurs.
It is far from enough to provide only dynamic curves as output because users may want more information about the biological system. Professionals may want to know the whole picture of reaction network, how do the species react with each other, and what influence do they have on the network. Amateurs may not be interested in curves, and they want to have a more straightforward concept of the network.
We are planning to give a graphic display of the reaction network by showing the change of species quantities dynamically. Users could understand the underlying reasons why a curve reaches its peak from the network. We also plan to show the topological structure of reactions in network. By connecting species with reactions, users can get a clear"
