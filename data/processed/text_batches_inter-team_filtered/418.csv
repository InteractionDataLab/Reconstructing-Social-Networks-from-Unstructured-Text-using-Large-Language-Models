SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," the advice of Mrs. Dienhart, we decided to reevaluate the means of implementation of the PowerLeaf to ensure that the need for accessibility and user-comfort is met.
Essentiality - She supported our notion if the needs for accessibility and changeability are met, the PowerLeaf could help ensure that citizens of Odense use and remain in the public space for a longer amount of time. Something that is valuable, not only to the individual citizen, but also to the community as a whole, as it creates a sense of city cohesion and hence a high quality of city life.
Mrs. Dienhart introduced us to several considerations that shaped large parts of our project. We do not know the needs of every urban area in Odense and consequently, we have aimed to create a device that is changeable to a city in movement such as Odense.
Furthermore, this interview was also a source of inspiration for our ethical and safety thoughts. While we ought to strive for a sustainable tomorrow, we do not necessarily have to provide an exhaustive description of what the future should look like.
Interviewing the City Renewal Project My Bolbro
Rikke Falgreen Mortensen is the manager of the Bolbro’s city renewal project called Mit Bolbro i.e. My Bolbro. We arranged a meeting with her with the intent of further investigating how the PowerLeaf could and should be integrated in an urban area of Odense, in this case the neighbourhood of Bolbro.
Bolbro is an old neighbourhood in Odense historically known to be the home of the working class. While Bolbro provides a homely atmosphere known to the locals, it has had a hard time attracting new residents. However, this is subject to change as the neighbourhood in 2016 received approximately 1.6 million US dollars to renew its city space and to create an even more appealing, and vibrant neighbourhood. This will be achieved by including the locals, as Bolbro is characterized by having a strong, engaging civil society. Mrs. Mortensen is not only an expert in urban renewal, but also in how to include local citizens in reshaping the public space in which they reside.
Mrs. Mortensen also argued that a changeable design would be the optimal solution to fit the challenges one faces in creating a vibrant, green city ambience. Such a task depends on different preferences, laws and needs. A technology needs to be both flexible and accessible to successfully contribute to the process of creating an engaging city environment. She showed great interest in our device and even offered to implement it in the parks of Bolbro, should the product become a reality.

Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power to sweep away all the tiredness and stress, while the fascinating design works are the spring of imagination and creativity.
Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.
Jiang WU
Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.
Making a plan, doing experiments and fail and planning again. Following this circle and eventually gained payback.
He is a chemist with an artistic heart, deeply attracted by CS and mathematics and has a"

To introduce the lower school to synthetic biology and the ethics involved in this exciting field of science we created a weekly club within our school. We chose to make the club specifically for year 7s because by teaching them the basic principles of genetic engineering they can research further throughout their time in high school and form their own opinions about genetic engineering and potentially become the future iGEM team. The club provided the iGEM team with the opportunity to engage with the younger members of the school community and explore their opinions about the complex ideas we were introducing them to.
Each weekly 1-hour session in the BioBlast club built upon their knowledge about DNA and genetic engineering starting from the basics and gradually working up. We started by looking at cells and using microscopes to identify the nucleus, then in following sessions, we studied DNA and its structure. All our sessions had a practical element to keep students engaged since they were 11-12 years old. For example, when we were looking at the structure of DNA we used sweets to create 3D models - this was very successful as by the end of the session they could identify elements of the DNA structure. In following sessions, we transitioned onto Darwin and Mendel and the effect of genes on phenotypes (demonstrated by a practical involving Gelli-baff which mimicked natural selection) and then moved onto genetic engineering. It was in these sessions that big ethical debates were raised naturally by the students and lead onto organic discussions such as “Should we genetically engineer a ‘perfect’ human?” and “Is it ethical to genetically modify farm animals for agriculture?”.
It was very encouraging to see these debates developing without prompting from us and to see these issues discussed with a solid scientific background. In the final session, we played a board game created by the Exeter IGEM team in 2016 which taught the students about plasmid construction and illuminated the vast potential of genetic engineering- this was very successful as at this point the students had a solid scientific foundation and could follow along very well to a game created for slightly older students.

Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#HeatherNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"unk inspired design. For the functionality, we added a panel for the twitter feed of messages, using JQuery to fill the queue and to create a sliding panel.
Tuesday: In addition to working on the design mock-up, I spent some time today working on functionality improvements, and debugging some of the issues related to the canvas dynamic resizing.
New ticker shows backward translation
Wednesday: Another feature we added is a panel for the protocol, so that the user can follow the instructions to execute the tasks of the application. This is also a sliding panel that can be toggled open or closed.
Thursday: Today I began to work on revisiting the ticker. Using a canvas animation, the goal is to have the DNA codons scroll across the top of the screen and convert to English at a specified point. One of the challenges I have encountered is adjusting the speed of the animation, since three nucleotide bases correspond to one English letter. Additionally, I spend some time re-implementing functionality of the lab protocol on the new html canvas.
Friday: As the summer research program is drawing to a close, Joanna and I worked on laying out our poster, writing abstracts, and implementing the new design. I finished reprogramming the functionality of the application, only to discover a bug in the execution. The images are appearing on some machines, but not others. This is a frustrating end to a busy week, but we’re making progress and moving forward.
Week 10: July 29 - Aug 2
Monday: Spent the day debugging the functionality issue. It was a challenge and took a longer time than I had hoped, but it felt very satisfying to finally solve the problem, and it is a relief to be able to move forward.
Tuesday: Today I recreated the DNA synthesis animation, so that each letter of the codon translation is animated to show the process of translation from English to DNA code in greater detail. This also helped to improve synchronization of execution as the translation is occurring.
DNA animation
Wednesday: With one day left, I finished the DNA animation and continued to improve the functionality. Also, we will be performing user studies with the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound students on Friday, so Joanna and I discussed the user-testing protocol and created a questionnaire from which to gather data. This helped us to think further about the research perspective of our project and gathering the appropriate data for analysis. We are particularly interested in better understanding the potential of our application to facilitate learning. In the afternoon, Joanna and I met with Orit to discuss our user- testing protocol, and received helpful feedback and advice.

Panama,2011,Team:Panama#Human Practice#Expectation from HS_-_-_TEXT.html," we called it Science Urgency, and also including a brief history of how this term was mentioned by Barbara Hobom in 1980, and how nowadays becomes a Science. Following this, we talked them about our project of Biorhamnolipids or Biorramnolipidos , the main idea, how we did it and why is this important for Panama.
Finally we showed them, some examples of projects from others team, in this opportunity we used [ The Cambrigde 2010 ] project called Firefly o Luciernaga , [ Macquarie Australia Team 2010 ] project of Engineering a Bacteriophytochrome switch – creating a controllable E. coli or Interruptor de la Luz para controlar la Bacteria E. coli and also the [ Berkeley Team 2010 ] project about Service Delivery of substances into the Choaflagellates or Servicio de entrega de sustancias al Coanoglagelado . The reason of doing this was to let them know of the variety and utility of projects, and how other teams design incredible projects. Also we show them some instructional videos found in iGEM 2010 website like EPF_Lausanne 2010 Movie , Cambridge 2010 Gibson Assembly Song and BioBuilder .
Most Students showed very interesting on this, some of them made interesting questions like one student from fifth year who asked how do we do to control changing DNA position (Mutagenesis) if all this is abstract? And also other students asked if this could be out of control or others just asked how they can get into iGEM. The main reason of doing this of giving all this presentations in differents High School is cause we work as a media to trasmit information  we got from all this time being in iGEM since last year, now all this students work for the same purpose, cause most of them were going to mentioned what we talked to them to their Relatives, some friends. Just like show the next picture of how the information goes flows.

Hawaii,2018,Team:Hawaii#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," in size. While there are some bands that are indicative of the presence of Gag and the Gag-Pro polyprotein, there appears to be no signs of the RT protein. The Tricine gel experiment was unsuccessful in separating the protease and the smaller RT protein. This may have been due to the modifications made to Haider et al., 2012’s protocols, such as running the gel at 70V stacking and 150V running rather than the continuous 125-150V, however, these modifications should not have significantly impacted the overall experiment. The protease cleavage sites will be determined via mass spectrometry and trypsin digest rather than redoing another tricine gel experiment, since the mass spectrometry will offer more accurate results.
Figure 1. CR2-Gag-Prot-RT 35 C; Inclusion body purification without lysozyme run on a tricine gel, (4% Stacking, 10% resolving). The gel does not appear to be able to successfully separate proteins of 5-30 kDa or less as the lowest readable bands are around 50 kDa, indicative of the Gag protein.
Figure 2. CR2-Gag-Prot-RT 28C; inclusion body purification without lysozyme run on a tricine gel, (4% Stacking, 10% resolving). The gel does not appear to be able to successfully separate proteins of 5-30 kDa or less as the lowest readable bands are around 50 kDa, indicative of the Gag protein.
V. CR2 Gag-Prot-RT Purification
Purpose: To produce higher quality SDS-PAGE gel images of the soluble vs. insoluble fractions and to determine if enough expressed protein may be purified from the soluble fraction for future work.
Attributions: Purifications were performed by Ryan Shontell, Gina Watanabe, Jonathan Tello and John Banasihan.
Materials and Methods: A soluble protein purification on the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT was performed according to our standard protocol. The proteins collected for this experiment were induced at 28°C and 35°C. This was not done under denaturing conditions as there was no urea present in the in buffers used. Both the soluble and insoluble proteins were collected and tested on an SDS PAGE.
Results and Discussion: Gels comparing the soluble and insoluble fractions of CR2 Gag-Prot-RT were run to generate higher quality gels to determine which fraction the expressed proteins occur and to determine whether smaller degradation fragments of the CR2 Gag-Prot-"

Meeting with Nanjing Agricultural University:
https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAU-CHINA/Collaborations
In the process of talking with team leaders and the students in charge of each module, we had a brief understanding of the content of their project, and put forward a lot of practical and useful suggestions for the problems they are facing.
Below is a brief summary of our proposal:
1.Human Practice:
We both have expressed great interest in the Best integrated Human Practise Prize. Therefore we shared our HP content with each other and worked together to study the award criteria for the gold medal and decided that we will improve our activities.
2. Project:
Members in Nanjing Agricultural University did a survey among farmers in rural areas, but the results are not pleasant enough. We made some relative constructive suggestions.
Question 1: At present, there are far too few studies on yeast. And there is no accurate data on the sequence of yeast promoter gene.
Answer:
1. Find a relevant company to help the sequencing;
2. There is a mentor doing yeast-related research in Tsinghua University. Contact him for help;
3. Contact other teams who has similar needs and apply for the iGEM authorities for publication of relevant information.
 Question 2: The government did not publish the data of the amount of vomit toxin in wheat products in the market.
Answer:
1. Apply for checking the official information from the China Food and Drug Administration;
2 Go to the market get sampling by buying wheat products, and then carry out vomit toxin test.
Question 3: The yeast is eucaryote. Compared with the Escherichia coli, the experiment of competent cell culture and plasmid importation are more difficult and time-consuming, so that the project progress will be slow.
Answer:
1.Optimize the yeast. Screen more suitable yeast to act as a chassis organism through related experiments;
2.It is recommended that the project be completed in steps. For example, do wheat vomit toxin research this year and rice related pathogenic toxin research next year. In this way, the research of main crop can be completed.
Question 4: The sustainability of the project needs to be improved. Answer: Apply for Entrepreneurship Project in NAU and industrialize this project"

Standard Assembly
How does it work?
Prior to the BioBricks assembly, you must add all the BioBricks                 to the BioBrick Creator (to add a new BioBrick, create it and select it from                your computer). You can also upload more BioBricks previously created with                 this program. Once you have uploaded a BioBrick it will appear in the box below                 (these are the BioBricks available for assembly).
Application will only read TXT files that were created by Module I.                 TXT files from other applications may produced unexpected results, please fix them                 before use.
After selecting some BioBricks you will be able to build a customized list to make your new composite part based in BioBricks.

Results: Bio-Brick Assembly vs. Gibson Assembly
Gibson or BioBrick assembly? - Mary Beton
Why this question is important:
One of the aims of the iGEM foundation is for advancement of synthetic biology, and if techniques available to the teams are outdated then this could seriously impede their     progress, as well as potentially teaching the competing students redundant methods. There has been a small trend in recent years of iGEM teams starting to consider and use      Gibson assembly as an alternative (notably Cambridge 2010, who produced a song about it) to BioBrick assembly. Is it in the interests of the iGEM foundation to consider     including this as an iGEM standard technique? Or does the specific nature of the Parts Registry mean teams who choose Gibson Assembly should retrofit BioBrick restriction sites     onto their new parts and use the technique so long as, overall, they can cohere with the current iGEM requirements? We thought it was a significant question which has to be      asked if iGEM is to play a genuine role in synthetic biology development.
Biobrick Assembly
How it works
The BioBrick platform has lead to the wide exploration and use of different restriction enzymes and assembly standards, Biobrick assembly is the assembly format familiar to      most iGEM teams. Its reliance on four key restriction enzymes (shown in fig. 1) make it easy to cut upstream or downstream of the DNA sequence as required. Rather than merely      using the EcoRI and PstI sites, the additional use of the internal XbaI and SpeI sites, which cut to form identical overhangs (fig. 2) ensure not only that two biobricks can be     ligated together at the same time as they are put into a plasmid using the external E and P sites, but also that the recombined X-S site ‘scar’ won’t be recognised by either of      the two enzymes again when correctly ligated (fig. 2).

With the goal of fascinating the public, instead of boring them with serious scientific essays, we used our daily language, even adding a humorous tone, in discussing our research. From time to time, we referred to trending topics to make our research much easier to be comprehended and a whole lot more interesting to those who aren’t involved in the scientific field.
For instance, in one of articles, we introduced our research project, referring to the trending anime series Working Cells. In this way, science appears less daunting and connects more to our daily activities.
BioBuilder at School.
Last year, we started the first BioBuilder club in mainland China at our school. Targeting practically everyone who has an interest in biology, we host synthetic and molecular biology courses with the intention to spread knowledge among middle and high school students. As the course materials are all in English, we first helped to translate part of the BioBuilder textbook, protocols and manuals for us and future schools to use, and then steadily started from basic strawberry DNA extraction to violin production from E.coli. The courses was a great success and directly lead to the formation of our iGEM team.
Now we are connecting with other local high schools to see if we can bring this course system to them, and all of our team members are thrilled to start a new roll of the course this year!
Edx Course Translation Group.
Starting this summer, we use our language skills in helping the MITx to translate the molecular biology web course on Edx to mandarin. The group already had 10 people and is using the transifex platform to translate the videos. We hope that through translating these courses into Chinese, we can increase their popularity, thus raising public knowledge on the topic outside our school and on a rather social level.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer1_-_-_TEXT.html," work, Toehold-GFP and Trigger RNA must be transformed into the same bacteria. Origin incompatibility prevents us to transform two different originated plasmids in the same bacteria. Therefore we decided to clone Toehold-GFP into a ColA originated plasmid and clone Trigger RNA into a ColE originated plasmid. PSB1C3 plasmid has a ColE origin so we cloned Trigger RNA into it. We designed this ColA originated plasmid for cloning Toehold-GFP sequence and named it ‘pColA’.
pColA-Toehold GFP CLONING
After cloning Toehold-GFP into PSB1C3 vector successfully, as we are planning to transform this gene into the same bacteria with Trigger RNA, we cloned it into pColA plasmid.  In order to do cloning into this vector, we removed the gene from PSB1C3-Toehold GFP plasmid by cutting it with NotI enzyme. Then we ligated these cut genes into the plasmid by using T4 DNA Ligase . Ocurring products were transformed into BL21 competent cell strain.
To check if the cloning is correct, a colony PCR was perfomed with ColA Forward and ColA Reverse primers. If the cloning isn’t made properly t the band should be 192 bp long, but if colony PCR worked, Toehold-GFP’s band should be at 1196 bp line.
As the result of colony PCR, the possible right cloned colonies were incubated in liquid culture for 16 hours. After this incubation, we isolated plasmid DNA from this bacteria culture by miniprep plasmid isolation method. We controlled obtained colonies with cut-check as a second control of cloning. We used NotI restriction enzyme for cut-check.
PSB1C3-Trigger RNA/pColA-Toehold-GFP Cotransformation:
To show And Gate system works properly, these two plasmids with different origins should be transformed into the same bacteria. T7 is the promoter which produces Trigger RNA and Toehold-GFP mRNA’s , so we assured that they were cotransformed into a bacteria strain including T7 RNA polymerase. BL21 served this purpose, and after cotransformation, we observed grown colonies.
Functional Assay:
We designed a functional assay setup in order to figure out if Toehold-Trigger RNA system is functional. The main goal of this setup is to show that; Toehold-GFP doesn’t give fluorecence alone but if it comes together with Trigger RNA, GFP"

Finally, one issue specific to our project is the fact that the small bag containing bacteria would probably have to be manipulated by beekeepers. Indeed our system would be optimized to last at most 2 to 3 weeks, after which the bag would have to be replaced. That would designing a specific training for the beekeepers, and a safe way to get rid of the used bags.
Education
- Discussion with beekeepers
- ExpoSciences Midi-Pyrénées
- Communication in high school
- ExpoSciences International
- Exciting perspectives!
The iGEM competition is not all about wet lab and finding sponsors. For our project to really be alive, public contact is paramount. When we first started to reach out to the public we realised that the issue of the decline in bee population was  a well-known issue. Still in spite of this, most of the people interviewed weren't aware of the role played by Varroa destructor. This is why we focused a big part of our energy on communicating with the public, in order to raise awareness about a worrying situation.
Discussion with beekeepers
At the very beginning of the project, we were not at all specialists of the bees. That’s why we met with a beekeeper (who was also a microbiologist) to discuss our project and the material restrictions we should submit to.
Our project was followed by the regional newspapers (20 minutes, Métronews, La Dépêche), but also by some national magazines such as Capital or Industrie et Technologies.
This increased our visibility, and thanks to an article we were contacted by the Director of the “Laboratoire Français d’Apidologie” (French Laboratory of Apidology). He offered us his collaboration, and made available his infrastructures, and his teams.
Furthermore, several beekeepers from the forum “La Ruche Warré” heard about the project thanks to the same article. In order to discuss our project with people having a first hand experience of the problem, we joined this forum. We had a very interesting exchange with the beekeepers about our project and synthetic biology in general, explaining about its principle, its interest and the practicability of our solution with the beekeepers.
ExpoSciences Midi-Pyrénées
Our team took part in the regional ExpoSciences in Toulouse. This event brings together scientists of all ages and levels  who want to share their knowledge. It’s a good exercise in communication and it enabled us to make synthetic biology better known. Given that DNA is our"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  PCR will be repeated again to amplify our construct.  A longer extension time will be used, as well as running only the primers with no template for a control.
Procedures:
PCR reaction: The reaction master mix was prepared from the following: 5x reaction buffer, 15uL 2uM dNTP, 7.5uL 10uM PCquad primer prefix, 3.8uL 10uM PCquad primer suffix #1, 3.8uL Q5 polymerase 0.75uL ddH2O, 44uL
Mixed using a p20.
To three separate PCR tubes, 24uL of mastermix was added.  The tubes were labeled 1, 2, and 3, for 0.25uL of 1ng/uL template (0.25ng), 0.125 uL of template + 0.125uL TE buffer, and 0.25uL of TE buffer, respectively.   The reaction was ran at 66C with the following settings:
Initial denaturation:  98C, 30sec 25 cycles:  98C, 10 sec; 66C, 10sec; 72C, 25sec Final extension:  72C, 5min Hold: 4C
Running the gel:
The pre-made agarose gel from 7-16 was used.  To each reaction tube, 5uL of 6x SDS loading dye was added and mixed.  28uL of the sample was loaded to the gel.  The gel was ran at 100V for 25 minutes.
Observations:   After running the gel, the two bands with template DNA appear to be the same intensity, with the desired size more intense than previous runs.  The lane with primers only did not yield any band, which suggests the non-specific band is"

Project Motivation
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Without it, there'd be far too much time spent just on merging in changes from other programmers and far too little time spent actually coding. It's reasonable that an analogy exists in synthetic biology, where complicated structures are modified with the utmost of detail. But because most synthetic biologists work on relatively small logical functions in comparison to the hulking data structures programmers wield, introducing a version control system seemed like overkill. With today's exponentially-increasing complexity of synthetic life, though, it will soon be a grave mistake to not use some sort of change-tracking tool; biologists will soon get caught up in the same logical complexity that plagues professional programmers. Especially as synthetic biology grows as a field, with increasing support from government and enterprise, more people will get involved in these projects and an inability to effectively collaborate could hamper the entire industry.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Existing methods of tracking gene changes don't scale well, and don't incorporate the power of the version control tools programmers are used to. While programming version control tools could be used to cover DNA data, they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. Darwin is a way around that. It's built off of version control tools, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it manipulates the DNA data to optimize for these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system. Darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.

Suspecting that perhaps the restriction sites were not present, we tested the plasmid samples through restriction digests.
Figure 2. E.chromi Dark Green digested with various restriction enzymes to confirm the presence of the Biobrick restriction sites.
As can be noted from Figure 2, the Xba1 site is not present in the Dark Green E.chromi Biobrick part, although the Spe1 and EcoR1 sites are present.
Although time would not allow for us to further characterise these parts, it must be noted that the parts themselves still functioned, as a visible colour change was easily detected in E.coli transformed with these Biobrick parts.

Cornell_NY,2016,Team:Cornell NY#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," our idea as a whole was valuable because it includes a preventative measure for bovine mastitis. We showed him our proposed sketches for the milking shell with various modules, and he indicated that the most useful modules would be the temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cold shock. Blane said that our app would be more useful for bigger and more technologically advanced farms, and referred us to two more farms we could speak to. Blane also pointed out the importance of cost effectiveness. Farmers want to know that our device works, and whether they are going to get a return on their investment.

Quality Milk Production Services
Ithaca, NY
We went back to speak with Daryl Nydam of Quality Milk Production Services now that our ideas were more fleshed out. Dr. Nydam lent us a field guide for bovine mastitis that gave us a solid foundation of how we should move forward with bacteriocin testing, and agreed to provide us with infected milk samples that we could use as test targets. We asked Dr. Nydam how we would know if our product was successful. He answered that if we could show that bacteriocins work better than antibiotics, then it could be a home run.
For our milking shell, Dr. Nydam liked the iodine spray, UV light, and cold shock modules. He did not think the temperature sensor or the flow sensor were necessary as they were already implemented in farms, or were not good indicators for prevention. He mentioned that the iodine spray module would contaminate the milk if we kept it at the top of the shell. He was particularly interested in the cold shock module for its innovation, but suggested that we talk to more experts to see whether cold shock would be physiologically effective.
We also spoke to Dr. Nydam about our app. He recommended some academic literature that would help us with the economic analysis of treating or culling a cow. He was fascinated by the somatic cell counter and urged us to further pursue that option. While there are tests like the California Mastitis Test that already allow farmers to quickly detect mastitis, this new innovation could change the way the disease is approached and dealt with by farmers.
Dr. Nydam praised us for choosing a project in the dairy industry because of the strong agricultural presence in New York, along with the connections that Cornell has. Overall, Dr. Nydam emphasized something that everyone we have met has said: farmers want ease and effectiveness.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#99_-_-_TEXT.html," to treat the horse in the purpose of avoiding mass rupture and severe consequences.
Methods of Detection
Currently the only method for detection and counting of how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires timely shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing and treat their horses regardless of need, contributing to the problem of resistance [10].
Resistance development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,5]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance[2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [15,16].
Due to all of these facts, we aim to develop a diagnostic tool to give horse owners a better estimation of the amount of worms in the horse. This would allow them to adapt the deworming treatment based on the level of infection.
Large Strongyles
Strongylus Vulgaris
Large Strongyles
The small strongyles larger cousin, Strongylus Vulgaris, is the most pathogenic parasite in horses, posing a significant threat[1]. They, like small strongyles, live in the grass and and infect the horse after being ingested[4]. During the different larval stages inside the horse, the parasite enters the intestinal blood vessels as a part of their life cycle[4,11]. Because of this, they generally can’t be targeted by deworming drugs or detection methods and can cause major problems for domestic animals[8]. The large strongyle therefore needs to be detected in pasture in order to prevent infection.
Symptoms
When the worms migrate in the arteries they cause inflammation in the arterial wall and induce the formation of blood clots. When a small blood clot forms, it may form an embolism, which can detach and travel in"

Modeling Approach
Due to the increasing consumption of beef and dairy products cattle are nowadays a major contributor to the emission of greenhouse gases, thus vastly affecting global warming. In this year's project the iGEM Team Braunschweig is aiming at reducing the cows' share of the cake by designing a methane degrading bacterium – E. cowli.
However, due to safety and ethical concerns it is not easily manageable to test our system in vivo. Nonetheless, the effects of E. cowli on methane emissions by cattle need to be evaluated. Therefore, we created a mathematical model simulation based on data experimentally obtained in this project and previously published literature. The model was used to evaluate eventual costs and a theoretical scale-up of the system.
Mathematical Model
In this year's iGEM project, our objective is to decrease the amount of methane produced through enteric fermentation inside the cows’ rumen without affecting the internal microbiota. Produced methane is subsequently released from the digestive tract through the mouth by eructation or burping. To inhibit the emission, thus reducing the atmospheric methane levels, we established a methane degrading bacterium – E. cowli.
Our mathematical model, based on laboratory and literature data, provides an overview of the efficiency and impact of our system. E. cowli is capable of utilizing methane for the production of methanol. Methanol is subsequently excreted and metabolized by other organisms of the cows' microbiota [1]. To degrade methane E. cowli uses the well-characterized enzyme complex soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) from M. capsulatus catalyzing the conversion of methane to methanol with simultaneous consumption of oxygen and the cofactor NADH+H+ (see eq. 1 and eq. 2).

Deadlines and General Points:
Abstract and title still need to be looked over need to add our tag line- Sweet scents. Nothing cheesy. onto the title.
Safety form still needs to be completed, it was suggested that it could be given over to Alex to get done.
Registration for the Jamboree has been completed, so everyone flying out to Boston is registered.
An Insurance form and occupational health form for the trip needs to be filled out by everyone going to Boston, Wfx will send around the form that needs to be completed.
Also everyone needs to remember to fill out the esta for going to the US.
London YSB- poster needs to be completed and sent off to be printed before Friday morning at the latest.  It needs to be collected by someone on the Friday as there will not be time to collect it on the Monday morning.
Wiki Progress:
Wiki looks the same as last week
This week we aim to have a contacts page, Information about the team page and have a bit more about what we are doing for our project.  Also can put a link to the safety form on as well.
Claire has written a bit about our project and has uploaded it onto the one drive.
Computational:
Matt and Taylor have looked at the Edinburgh Wiki and they didn't find much out about their computational work.
Need to do more research into flux control ect
Presentation:
Had a proper presentation run through and feedback was provided for Rosie and Matt, general consensus was that it was good just a few more additional changes could be made.
 
09.09.2014

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

After everyone had the chance to give his presentation the public was invited to join a discussion and ask questions. The amount of questions was enormous and a lot of interesting questions were asked to all three guests. They were of great diversity about ethical problems of synthetic biology (what if we do something that is not needed?), the difference between synthetic biology and normal biology, the difficulties over successfully communicating synthetic biology with the public and the interests of the public, the fact of having open source ideas or having project patented which is important to get money for further research, and about creating new chassis for research and production while there are great organisms available.
To put it all in a nutshell it was a great evening and was worth the effort the iGEM team did to make this happen. The public and the speakers seemed to be satisfied with the science café and enjoyed their evening. And as usual in a science café it was a great opportunity to communicate a scientific topic to the public and attract their interest.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," that a gold medal can result in a boost in fundraising. Teams that win a gold medal could probably raise funding more easily. Therefore this is also an important reason we think the medal requirements should not be too hard. However, we do believe that it is important to update the requirements every year. Among other things, new technology developments will make it more easy to meet certain requirements. Therefore, just as in the past few years, the requirements have to be adapted every year and if required they have to be tightened.
Finally, we have looked into potential inequalities within the competition and we have eventually focused on three potential inequalities: Budget, Laws & Regulation and Travel costs. Based on the survey, it appears that there are large differences in budgets between teams (Figure 1)
Figure 1: Budget distribution of the iGEM teams. Data based on the teams that fill out the survey.
We have extensively researched the possibilities to decrease the differences in budgets and decrease the inequality within the competition therefore. However, we have concluded that none of those options would positively contribute to the competition. Most of the options appeared to be uncontrollable or could negatively influence the project results.  In our opinion the research project is the most important aspect of the competition. Teams should not be limited in, for example, their budget therefore. Instead of limiting ‘wealthy’ teams, the competition could better promote ‘less wealthy’ teams.  We have discussed multiple ways to do this in the report.
Differences in Laws & Regulations between different countries can also result in inequalities. Based on the survey it appears that several teams had legal issues. About 30%  of the teams does encounter problems. Based on the survey it appears that most of these teams had problems with the fact that the regulation was not sufficient enough. In many countries the regulations about biotechnology and synthetic biology is not up to date or even almost absent. Therefore, there are  many teams that operated in a grey area. Fortunately, there were teams that started a collaboration with the government to solve the problems, which is in our opinion a great example of the potential of iGEM.
Finally there are large differences in the travel costs between the teams, which also results in an inequality within the competition. Teams from for example Boston, New York or Philadelphia can travel for 50 to 100 euro per person while teams from Australia probably need 1000-1500 euro per person for traveling. Figure 2 illustrates the differences between different countries in traveling costs.

Discussing with previous iGEMers
April 13rd 2014
We invited two previous iGEMers from Zhejiang University(Zukai Liu) and Natinal Chiao Tung University(Haoxian Wang) to share a lot of experiences, feelings and lessons for joining the iGEM competition with us, such as the experience of building a team, selecting a track and running a project. We have obtained much information about iGEM from them. As new iGEMers, it was really a great encouragement for us. Meanwhile, we got prepared for the iGEM competition as they suggested, such as scheduling for weekly group meetings.
C3-B3 2014 International Workshop and Summer school on “Biological Bytes” and iGEM Meet-Up
August 17-23rd 2014
We attended an International Workshop and Summer School on ""Biological Big Bytes"", a Satellite Meeting of the International Workshop/Summer school on Crops, Chips & Computers(short for C3-B3). It was combined with the iGEM Meet-Up for three teams in Harbin, China(HIT-Harbin, NEAU-Harbin and us) and it was organized by Harbin Institute of Technology. In this international conference, we asked and discussed biological questions with foreigner professors. More importantly, it was combined with the iGEM Meet-Up for three teams in Harbin, giving us a great opportunity to share our projects and experiences with other teams and also letting us to hear the wonderful thoughts and ideas from them. The meet-up truly promoted communications between iGEMers. Here we express our sincere thanks for them!

MIT,2016,Team:MIT#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," improve the lives of people inflicted with a chronic disease. Through iGEM, Liz hopes to gain knowledge in the many applications synthetic biology has with diseases, and to learn the skills needed to begin a wet lab project and carry it out to completion. In the future, Liz wants to apply what she's learned from iGEM to an independent project or continue the team's work in Endometriosis. On the MIT campus, Liz also is a member of the student group, SaveTFP, and plans to increase her theatrical make-up skills through helping with the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble. She also enjoys baking, reading, and exploring both Cambridge and Boston.
Theresa Machemer
Theresa is a sophomore majoring in Biology and minoring in Writing. She first heard about iGEM through some guy who she hasn’t seen since, and only managed to apply because her friend in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science forwarded her the iGEM email that was sent to the EECS mailing list. She didn’t know anything about circuits or synthetic biology before iGEM, but this year’s project- improving the state of endometriosis diagnosis and treatment methods- is really exciting, and it’s a great opportunity to learn about synbio, lab work and the project design process. In her free time, Theresa crochets mini dolls for her Etsy store, plays violin, and writes for Odyssey.
Sarah Caso
Sarah is a sophomore majoring in Chemical-Biological Engineering. She’s always had a strong interest in chemistry and became particularly excited about biology during her first semester at MIT. She joined the iGEM team to learn about how engineering can be applied to solve biological problems and to gain wetlab experience. The project has sparked her interest in developing new approaches to cure diseases, as this year's iGEM team is striving to build a biological circuit to cure endometriosis, a disease formerly only cured through surgical procedures. Outside of iGEM, she enjoys sailing for the MIT Varsity Sailing Team, cooking, playing the clarinet, and exploring Boston.
Archis Bhandarkar
Archis is a junior studying Biological Engineering and Electrical Engineering at MIT. Systems and synthetic biology attract him as fields that can provide the tools to unravel the innerworkings of complex biological systems. In the future, he aspires to be part of the ranks of physicians and surgeons ushering in a new era of genomic medicine. His dream is that patients with currently intractable genetic disorders can someday walk into his care and receive the treatment they need.

1. The distance between lacI and lacO is too close, which may affect the function. So we desided to construct pBBR1-rhlABC-fimS-lacO-BcsA and pBad30-fimE-cm-lacI.
2. There was a solution that the BcsA and gfp genes were digested and ligated to pK18, and the lacO-BcsA/GFP could be obtained if PCR started from the lacO position before the pK18 cloning site.
3. We redesigned the primers.

Fire is horrible especially if flame spreads over. Fire retardant chemicals can stop the fire and resist for up to 30 minutes. However, the chemicals contain halogen elements and organophosphate that have adverse effect on wildlife. Natural products have been reported as fire retardant biomaterials such as milk and wool because of high amount of phosphorus and nitrogen contents, respectively. We mined data from protein database and found a protein candidate, SR protein (serine/arginine splicing factor) with fire retardant properties. Cotton and cloth soaked with SR protein-producing bacteria have been proved as fire retardant materials on flame test. Furthermore, the wooden house painted with our bio-coatings are resistant to fire up to 45 seconds. We demonstrated the prototype to DLuB Fire Retardant Paint Inc. and plan to transfer the technology to KraigLabs, a Spider Silk Technology Company using genetically modified silkworm to produce fire retardant fabrics.

In June 2015, flammable dust explosion  occurred at Formosa Fun Coast in Taiwan. The accident killed 10 people and injured more than 500 visitors. It reminds us how harmful a fire could be. We studied fire retardant chemicals and amazed at the 30-min fire resistant on the wooden house painted with fire retardant coatings .

However, the chemicals are composed of organophosphates and/or halogen element such as chlorine and bromine. Both of which are confirmed toxic to human body and further make poisonous gasses when burning. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warn  the adverse effect on wildlife with exposure to such chemicals. Any natural products can replace the chemicals and be safe materials with fire retardant properties? We want to find the answer.

What’s fire? Fire is an oxidation-reduction chemical reaction. Combustion occurs between oxygen and fuel with heat over ignition temperature. The three elements are known as fire triangle. Free radicals formed in the burning process could spread the fire. Fire extinguished if one, or more, of four of them are removed or isolated.
In addition to fire retardant chemicals, there’s some natural products have been recognized as fire retardant bio-material"
TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Meetings_-_-_TEXT.html," of Steven's proposed questions (see below)
Ethical question
Last week we discussed who is ultimately responsible (legally and morally) for safety, security, etc. The Dutch VSNU (Vereniging voor Universiteiten - Association of universities in the Netherlands) also published on moral responsibilities of university researchers ( link ). The question of this week relates to the relation between natural scientists and social scientists, or, to put it bluntly: the relation between ethics and science. In the individual interviews carried out within the project, you all have different opinions on how ethics should be addressed in scientific practice. Some stated that ethicists should ""tickle"" scientists, others state that scientists should consider ethics themselves. All of you stated that at some point, cooperation between ethicists and scientists is necessary. The question of this week:
How would you like to see ethics incorporated in your daily work and how do you see ethicists and scientists work together in this?
Main conclusions for this question:
Intensive ethical awareness creation is important at the beginning of a project. Ethical issues first have to be ""officially"" introduced, hereafter they can be more easily discussed.
Weekly questions within the iGEM group are appreciated as a method to integrate ethics in daily scientific practice
The condition is that the ethical question asked is relevant to the researchers. Scientific knowledge is expected from ethicists, likewise ethical knowledge can be expected from scientists.
Students from other disciplines (not biotechnology) have not experienced intenstive ethical surveys in their field of education, but do feel that moral issues need to be considered.

Ethical question
Last week we discussed whether or not application in society should have a focus in scientific design processes. We got wound up in a discussion on what the goals of iGEM are for MIT and for us, and we decided that before any product can be applied in society, in any shape or form, first other issues need to be considered, like safety, security and liability. The question of this week regards these issues in respect to the responsibilities of MIT, the TU Delft and ourselves:
Who should be responsible for safety or security, and why, and who should be liable in case of "" emergency""?

Korea_U_Seoul had collaborated with ‘ KoreaSonyeodul team from Hankuk Foreign Language High School. ‘KoreaSonyeodul’ is a team made up with 7 high school girls, and this year is their first time participating iGEM. We, Korea_U_Seoul team has participated iGEM since 2009, therefore our persistent experience on iGEM and synthetic biology-related activities could help them starting things up, through this collaboration.
The collaboration was mainly proceeded in two categories: mentoring new high school team , and experimental exchanges .
1. Mentoring a new high school team
After several contacts via e-mail, we could finally have a chance to meet KoreaSonyeodul. The first meet up was held in June, at Korea University. Since Korea_U_Seoul and KoreaSonyeodul are the only Korean team this year, it was in fact a quite meaningful session that all the Korean participants were gathering.
First part of the meet up was about introducing our own project. Korea_U_Seoul prepared a brief speech on who we are, what we have done in last 7 years with iGEM, and our plans for this year’s project.
Next was KoreaSonyeodul. They proposed what they had in mind, and it was a brilliant idea so we actively participated with bunch of questions and answers coming and going.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration session was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of iGEM newbies are facing.
We went through the realistic preparations on iGEM jamboree participation, such as registration, transportations and accommodation reservations together with advices of former participants from our team. Also, we together checked the important schedules with essential requirements such as team/personal registration, wiki freeze and part submission. Especially, since experiment schedules often require a long time with many variables occurring in real time, we could give advices on planning the overall project to KoreaSonyeodul which didn’t have much lab experiences before.
More than filling the requirements and essential preparations, we could deeply communicate about difficulties in running such a"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," 2009). A survey conducted in Europe by the ICEF monitor reveals that only 12.5% of the students studying abroad in the UK, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany wish to stay in those countries 5 years after their graduation. The majority of them plan to return back home  (SVR 2012). It is likely that when returning home many of these scientists will establish themselves in their field of interest, using the skills they acquired from their studies abroad. In the case of iGEM, people that seek to participate in the competition have a keen interest in Synthetic Biology and it is common for alumni to consider a career in the field. Since Synthetic Biology is such a young and ever expanding discipline, it is not unlikely that iGEM alumni that come from countries with no previous history in the competition, will return home and try to set the scene for the growth of SynBio and even iGEM itself.
Although a significant number of countries enters the competition every year, the top 6 is occupied only by very few of them, as demonstrated in the map (Heatmap with top 6).
Case studies
China
The country with the biggest growth in participation is China. As seen in the figure, the participation of Chinese teams has leaped from 9 in 2010 to a staggering 50 within the last four years. Although the number of Chinese teams is on the rise, this is not reflected in the annual top 6 teams in the competition. There has been only one finalist team in 2013, 2011, 2010 and 2007 and none in any other years. The teams come from some of the highest ranked universities in the country (QS 2013) and as noted previously, China is placed 2nd in the citable publications rankings (SJR 2014). Therefore the result seems unexpected for a country with such strong presence in the competition and significant academic reputation. Many factors are at play here but it is certainly a consideration that the country is ranked in place 34 out of 60 in the EF proficiency index (EF English Proficiency Index 2014), classified as ‘low’. This can have a significant impact in the communication of the project which turn affects its competition performance.
Case study: Germany, a success story
Germany is a country that frequents the top 6 of the competition, and the non-English speaking country with most finalists in its history. Last year Germany dominated iGEM: 3 out of the 6 finalists came from the country. In Undergrad, the winner and 1st runner"

BBa_K2705000 : PgltAB
Design
This sequence includes the promoter (forward) of gltAB (glutamate synthase) and the promoter (backward) of gltC (LysR family transcriptional regulator). GltC can bind specific DNA site on it. Thus the expression of downstream proteins is upregulated, which is repressed by high concentration glutamate.
Since PgltAB can sense intracellular glutamate level, we combined it with proteins such as GFP and LacI, so that these proteins can respond to intracellular glutamate concentration and carry out their own function.
Proof of Function
Detection of gltC transcription level in LL3-PgltAB-GFP under different glutamate concentrations
LL3-PgltAB-GFP was cultured in M9 medium with different extracellular glutamate concentrations. From the 6th hour, we extracted the total RNA of LL3-PgltAB-GFP every 3 hours and tested the transcription of gltC together with the respective intracellular glutamate concentrations. Transcription level of gltC in plateau phase is shown in Fig. 1. It could be indicated that the transcription of gltC was repressed with the increasing intracellular glutamate concentration. Primers used in the assay are listed in Table 1.

Siwat is doing more plate reader Shiv is at the New Scientist Live, Lidia is here as well.
Week 12 - 17/09/18
Monday
A freezing day. In the morning we checked the results of the plate reader with pyocyanin. We picked a new concentration of pyocyanin = 2.5 uM, when cells grow healthy and express a wonderful amount of GFP. We had lunch in JCR. Shazia came to take back the Eppendorf equipment on loan. Good news (finally...): it looks like we have spatially patterned GFP !! Now let's not say cat before we have it in the bag: Thomas is redoinfg the same exact experiment to check if it is luck or out system actual works.  We had a meeting afetr lunch with Rodrigo and Thomas to summarise what we have done and make a plan for the coming weeks, which look very intense. We decided the overall theme of the preseantation and assigned roles. Josh stayed late in SAF to do Assembly of the application plasmids.  Yutong, Thomas and Alberto stayed in Bessemer to do wiki, redo the electrode stimulation and sulfite plates experiment. Unfortunately Alberto could not finish the experiment as we got kicked out by the security at 12 am.
Tuesday
Another freezing day. Lunch in Farmer's Market. Today is Thomas's Birthday. As a present, we have a proof of concept! The same experiment which showed spatially patterned GFP worked again. We showed the plates to Nicolas, Alice and Albert, who looked surprisingly satisfied with the results. Yutong and Alberto are working on the banner. Lidia is working hard on the library characterization. We have no news on the dry lab guy. This working situation is a bit dispersive. Luis declared that he feels a bit alone. Let's talk about this! We finalised a date for the debate for human practices with SynBIC: it's the 9th of October, after Tom Ellis preseantation!
Wednesday
Today is Josh's Last day... we are going to miss him but we wish him good luck in Cambridge! Lidia and Yutong worked mainly in SAFB on the promoter library. Alberto and Lidia then began the library characterization with the plate reader. Alberto used a multichannel pipette for the first time, amazing! Thomas redid the stimulation experiment and worked again. We now have big hopes for when the PCB arrives. We had a big"

Our human practice efforts in terms of engagement directly led to information that we incorporated into our project design.
Initially unsure of the best way to address the issue of antibiotic resistance via outreach, we performed extensive research on the subject. The publications we read mentioned many causes for the rapid pace of resistance development, including the overprescription of antibiotics in developed countries. We concluded that we needed the perspectives of clinicians if we were to understand why doctors overprescribe antibiotics, and how a group of undergraduates could hope to persuade doctors to prescribe antibiotics more appropriately.
As such, we interviewed Drs. Persell, Postelnick, and Scheetz, all of whom work on the research and clinical side of medicine through the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Medicine. These interviews revealed a major reason doctors prescribe unneeded antibiotics: patient demand. Instead of persuading doctors to change their behavior, we decided to educate the public on appropriate use and prescription of antibiotics.
In addition, the three physicians agreed that CRISPR would be more effective if targeted to knock out resistance genes for existing antibiotics rather than serving as a novel antibiotic by targeting other bacterial genes. Existing antibiotic resistance proteins, such as beta-lactamase and floral quinolone, are safer targets and result from well-characterized sequences. This advice incorporated well into the design of CRISPR Capsules—a realistic future aim would be to introduce Cas9 encapsulated in OMVs to a cell already containing a guide RNA for a selection marker such as ampicillin. If Cas9 enters the cell and cuts the resistance gene, it will not grow on that antibiotic. This would be a proof of concept for targeting antibiotic resistance with CRISPR, and also a simple test of successful OMV delivery.
One interview question asked the clinicians to identify what they considered the most worrying antibiotic-resistant infections. Their answers included hospital skin infections like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. This also informed our project design, because topical infections would be safe early applications of a bacterially-derived product to evaluate immune response to the therapy.

From the very beginning, we had a startup approach that was developed in various ways. We build our project to continue after the contest and create a company. We went on the field, we talked with many biotech entrepreneurs in Europe, but also with regulators to find how our solution could fit the market. This quickly abled us to pivot and to adapt the scope of our project to build something scientifically strong but also with a possible go to market.
Our strong team & Advisory board
We started with a clear vision that highly drives all the members of the team. We strongly believed that having a shared core value will be the best motivation for our team. The first thing we do, was sitting down to talk about the problem that we wanted to solve on the planet. After few brainstorming we all wanted to solve an humanitarian large scale problem. We were also very concerned about the antimicrobial resistance. What if you could solve act in both field? Usually big pharmas and bio based startups do not find solutions for humanitarian field. It is not often big market and if does not worth to work in this field. But a contest like iGEM gave us the opportunities to strive for finding a solution.
We got the best of our 11 students hard working and  highly motivated team we knew the importance of having a structured and efficient collaboration approach. As any startups we used management tools, we established processes to be as efficient as possible. Everyone has his clear role in this venture.
Beside the team, we created an advisory board. It is constituted of key science entrepreneur, such as Victor Dillard (CEO of Desktop Genetic, Forbes 30 Under 30, MIT Innovator Under 35, who also came as a speaker on our conference). We also have entrepreneurship mentor such as Stephan Dehousse (serial entrepreneur, and CTO of Startup Factory), Bruno Wattenbergh (Strategy Professor at Solvay Business School) and Azèle Mathieu (managing director of the life-science incubator Lifetech.brussels). And also key researchers such as Jean-Paul Pirnay (from the Military Hospital, world"

Collaborations
Collaboration – whether interpersonal, intercommunal or international – is an essential condition for human development in any field, where synthetic biology is not an exception, particularly as modern information technologies has made it so easy. And it goes without saying that collaboration within the iGEM competition enhances each team’s experience and contributes greatly to its success.
KU Leuven
KU Leuven team has kindly invited us to participate in their activities aimed at creating a base of project descriptions translated into different languages. The working iGEM language is English and fortunately each team seems to be at home with it. But synthetic biology goes far beyond the iGEM limits and in this context we find the idea of KU Leuven a very promising one. The team has created a Google Drive account where each team invited to participate in this collaboration could add its project description in English and have it translated by other teams into their native languages and do the same for other teams. According to KU Leuven’s idea, finally it would be a kind of library of project descriptions available in different languages for those who are interested in synthetic biology but cannot read English. We have translated all the projects proposed for translation into our native language, which is Russian, and hope that this way we have contributed to dissemination of knowledge on synthetic biology around the globe. We also hope that this KU Leuven’s initiative is just a first step on a long road and finally a valuable source of information will be built up with the help of other teams, where not only project descriptions but also other more detailed information on iGEM projects will be available in all the languages of the world. And we will always be glad to participate.
iGEM Tuebingen
When looking through collaboration requests from other teams we came across the idea proposed by iGEM Tuebingen that we found quite interesting as it was close to what we intended to do ourselves. Their idea was to create short tutorial videos that would promote synthetic biology and iGEM and would be available to anyone interested on YouTube. We have made a series of tutorial videos explaining how to use some basic lab methods, namely: PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.

Outreach
In Germany people are very suspicious when it comes to Synthetic Biology. Despite of strict regulations and decisive risk and technological impact assessment the public opinon is marked by prejudices and anxiety for biotechnology. Therefore outreach is a central part of every German iGEM project.
To inform the public the German iGEM teams arranged a SynBioDay, that was held all over Germany. We presented posters, organized experiments and as a special additional we invited the iGEM team from SDU-Denmark to help us.

Education
Synthetic Biology is new and unknown life sciences. Therefore we hosted a student academy for interested pupils to learn about Synthetic Biology. The student academy was addressed to talented pupils of higher grades in order to deepen their understanding of molecular processes in cells. Together with the pupils we worked on practical experiments, while telling them about SynBio. Of course we also took the opportunity to present our project to a young audience and had an interesting discussion.

Here you can find the articles to our project. Feel free to take a look,  because we tried hard to have an open communication with the public. That's why we published two press releases and fortunately triggered a huge media response: many many web pages took up our press release resulting in several articles in online magazines and articles in the printed press. Furthermore we talked in two radio broadcastings and are part of a TV documentation about SynBio.

Project Achievements
Using synthetic biology, we designed a way to treat catheter-associated urinary infections (UTIs) as an alternative to antibiotics. We engineered Escherichia coli to synthesize and secrete enzymes which would treat UTIs in a sustainable way. This is how we did it.
During our journey we added 12 new BioBrick parts to the iGEM registry. Check out our parts page .
Our parts worked. Our data shows that our proteins are synthesised by E. coli and are also secreted across the cell membrane. They break down the biofilm just as we predicted. Here are our results .
We maintained contact with the end user of our project. We gained approval of doctors, nurses and the patients of urinary infections today. Their suggestions and concerns influenced our design from the beginning. Take a look at our conversation .

Raspberry Pi
2014-07-17
The Raspberry Pi is a cheap (40.-) and small single-board computer that we are going to use in order to monitor the light in each of the chambers of the microfluidic chip.
In order to track the light we need a good camera that is cheap and allows us to be flexible.
We chose the Raspberry Pi NoIR, NoIR stands for No Infrared Filter meaning that with this camera we are able to see near infrared wavelength.
 
Near infrared correspond to wavelength between 700 and 1000nm we will use this feature of the camera with the IFP.

Light tracking
2014-10-15
In order to view the light change in a chamber we need to track the light intensity.
For this part we made a custom C++ code using OpenCV (you can find the entire code there  https://github.com/arthurgiroux/igemtracking/ )
 
 
 Here's the result output:
 
 
 
The most common color space that program uses is RGB where the pixel color can be split into three components Red, Green and Blue with values between 0 and 255.
 
But there exists a lot of other color space that can be used for different applications, in our case we are interested in light intensity and not really in colors.
 
In our code we use the YCrCb color space, it decomposes a pixel into three components Y: the luma value (the intensity), Cr is the red difference and Cb is the blue difference.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Waste Degradation: SRF_-_-_TEXT.html," calculated the time-dependent sensitivity of P(3HB) with respect to the initial conditions of other species (species formed along the synthesis pathway and enzymes involved). [67]
For a species x, whose concentration depends on time, it can be expressed as x(t).  To calculate the sensitivity of x(t) with respect to another species y(t), the sensitivity with normalisation relative to the numerator x(t) can be calculated as:
Therefore, the underlying algorithm for this sensitivity analysis of P(3HB) is:
Sensitivity analysis: enzyme concentrations
The sensitivity analysis of the enzymes involved in the synthetic pathway is carried out, which determine the most sensitive enzyme in the pathway
We plot a time integral of the sensitivity analysis which has the algorithm as:
The senstivity result is:
According to the simulation result, we found that the PHB production is highly sensitive to the concentration of PhaB and PhaC. In contrast, the system is not sensitive to the concentration of atoAD and atoB. In theory, increase the concentration of any of the enzyme will increase the flux of the system. However, for the strain E.coli K12 MG1655, both atoAD (acetoacetate:acetoacetyl-coA transferase) and atoB （acetoacetyl-coA thiolase) favour the reverse reactions, it becomes the rate limiting step in our pathway. Acetoacetyl-coA intends to be converted to acetoacetate instead of 3HB-coA. [68] Therefore, the concentration of PhaB become really critical which push the system to flow in the forward direction.
Scan with different levels of PhaB
The plot below is to show that increasing PhaB concentration within the engineered organism would have a positive effect on the concentration of the P(3HB) synthesised.  As so many parameters within the model were taken from different sources, it would be difficult to give a simulation plot that is accurate quantitatively. It was decided to show the single cell simulation for this because the scans were carried out up to the doubling time of 20mins, hence avoided the issue of scaling-up which would have otherwise subjected the simulation to more errors.  Therefore, this plot should be interpreted from a qualitative perspective and the trend should be observed.
Difference between promoter expressions after optimisation
In order to choose the strongest promoter that is available to increase the gene expression. We ran a parameter scan of enzyme expression rates of a range of Anderson's constitutive promoters. The simulations shows the PHB production under different Anderson's promoters. The"

A positive control using Gluc codig device with Pr (BBa_K2023007) could have been made during the three days of measurement to test substrate efficiency and luminometer parameters. However, this BioBrick was created afterwards. We hoped that this BioBrick will serve as a future control for all bioluminescence assays in iGEM project to ensure the substrate efficiency.
Preliminary considerations
Toluene does not have auto-bioluminescence
We determine the effect of adding toluene to cell culture medium on bioluminescence intensity. As shown on the graph below the bioluminescence intensity of the LB + toluene at 10 mg/L (47.71 RLU) do not significantly differ from the bioluminescence intensity of the LB (48.93 RLU). The little bioluminescence found was due to the substrate added in our sample.
Therefore, toluene addition in our samples will not impact their bioluminescence intensity.

Bacteria E.coli have little auto-bioluminescence
Bacteria transformed with a genetic construction that does not contain Gaussia luciferase gene were used in this study. The auto-bioluminescence of E.coli cells was assessed by comparate E.coli bacteria bioluminescence intensity to LB bioluminescence intensity. As shown on the figure 3, the bioluminescence intensity of E.coli cells (53.14 RLU) was a little superior to LB bioluminescence intensity (48.93 RLU) but not significantly superior. E.coli cells have little auto-bioluminescence. However, this bioluminescence in greatly inferior to the one produce by our biosensor in presence of pollutant (results presented after)

ComR/S transcription factor : Lab Results
In order to make a UV sensitive ComR/S system three plasmids were given to us.

pcMMCD 102

Glucoronidase
Erythromycin
pcMMCD 105
P1655
pcMMCD 106
Pshp0064
The promoters chosen are two proteins’ promoters induced by ComR in Streptococcus thermophilius. P1655 is a strong promoter heavily induced by ComR. On the contrary, Pshp0064 is a much weaker promoter.
The plasmids were contained inside an E. coli DH5-alpha strain that were GusA+. This meant glucoronidase's expression even when not induced.      To prevent this, we extracted the plasmids and inserted them in E. coli DH5-alpha GusA- strain.
This allowed us to quantify glucuronidase activity in ComS’s presence with para-nitrophenol glucuronide (protocol described in notebook).      We took the optical density at 405 nm wavelength after induction. This is the absorption wavelength of para-nitrophenol.      The pcMMCD 102 and pcMMCD 106 gave no signal except background noise. Only pcMMCD 105 gave a significant signal.

To obtain a good UV detector we need the expression to be closely linked in time with the ComS presence.
We assessed this with the same test with pcMMCD 105 but this time with different incubation times.        As you can see on fig.1, the signal is already visible after 20 minutes and becomes steady after 80 minutes.

Multiple Miniprep isolations
Attempted 15 miniprep reactions on both non-mutated and mutated luxCDABE plasmid.
The isolated plasmid was pooled together and attempted to concentrate the plasmid by spinning the tube in a vacifuge. After several hours (2.5 hours) the concentration was higher.
Tried ethanol precipitation earlier in the day but there was no precipitate found when done.

Verification of NotI Digest
Objective: To do one last verification that LuxOD47E is in the psB1AC3 vector before we send it down for DNA Sequecning.  We will do a NotI digest with
Started with Plasmid Isolation this morning (Sigma).
Used 1000 Nanodrop Spectrophotometer to determine concentrations.
Set up a restriction digest with NotI enzyme and REact Buffer 3, left to digest in the 37 C waterbath overnight.

Model
By building a mathematical model, we demonstrate the principles of the project and provide guidance                     for optimizing product design and its application.
Gray value-density model The relationship between the gray value and the added                     substance concentration
We have established a grayscale model to describe our results in antigen fixation, antibody                         immobilization and detection, and to digitize the results into accurate numbers. This model can                         guide us to more accurately determine the relationship between the reaction results and our                         effects in three phases. Especially in the detection, the concentration of the analyte can be                         embodied and digitized, thus giving us a better and specific detection limit.
For the gray value calculation of a resulting image, we first grayscale it. In order to calculate                         the gray value of the color picture, we have grayed out with MATLAB. At the same time, in order                         to give a clear grayscale picture, we performed image equalization and gave a balanced                         picture[Attachment 1]. After obtaining the grayscale image, we use the formula (1) to                         calculate the grayscale of the image. In order to obtain accurate data more conveniently, we use                         the programming language to design a small software [Attachment 2], which can                         calculate the average grayscale of the image. There is an error in the data for the no grayscale                         picture. According to our experimental results, it is about 5% when the gray value is not too                         low. Compared with the equalized grayscale image, the error is about 10%.
$$ g_w = \sum_{i=0}^{255} i \times T_i \div T \tag{1} $$
For the experimental results, we can understand whether it is fixed antigen, immobilized antibody                         or detection. In the initial stage, the gray value is positively correlated with the                         concentration of the additive; and as the concentration of the additive increases, the gray                         value is not proportional to the increase. There are two models that satisfy these properties,                         namely equation (2) and formula (3):
Michaelis-Menten model: $$ y = \frac{\alpha x}{\beta + x} \tag{2} $$
Exponential growth model: $$ y = \alpha (1- exp(-\beta x)) \tag{3} $$
We substituting the above two formulas into the literature we examined[2], where model                         (2) is in                         good agreement. At the same time model (2) if the enzyme is compared to our slide, the substrate                         is analogous to our"
