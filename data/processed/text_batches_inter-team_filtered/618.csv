Lab Manager
Improve your efficiency.
We also develop Synthetic Biology Laboratory Manager for lab management.
This is an internal management system constructed on internal php server, and can be visited and managed by any terminal supporting web browser. The Manager can assist users simplifying lab related affairs, such as experiments plan, facilities managing, papers sharing, meeting and  lecture noticing, supporting protocols and sofeware tools.
This system mainly has 6 sections:News, Experiments, Facilities, Papers, Meeting Records and Support. The homepage, also the News section, displays the latest news like the nearest experiment and meeting notification. Also, the latest and most important meeting results, decisions and arrangements will be published here.
As for experiments section, users can manage and read the experiment arrangement. Standard protocols are provided for their regular synthetic experiments such as cloning and expression. When specific experiment is selected, Available reagents and materials in the lab is also on the choosing list. Detailed protocol will be generated to tell researchers when and where to get different reagents for their experiments. When the experiment is finished, used reagents will be deleted from the database and remains will be informed to return to their store. Experiment result can also record in the Manager.
As the problem all the labs is facing, this system helps users clearly and neatly record and manage the experimental instruments, reagents and materials. Elaborate records are stored in the database, including the ITEM NO., the company, the account and comments. Moreover, about Meeting Record, all meeting notifications and meeting minutes will be published and stored here. In addition, every papers for jurnal clubs or different projects will be classified in Papers section. At here, users can easily share and learn about all reference about others' studying progress. In support page, we offer variety of common proposals and interfaces of diverse synthetic biology software.

Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," (Fungi). It performs hydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in dextran. This is a very large gene (1,818 nucleotides, native sequence). Both the nuclease part (BBa_K1792004) and dextranase part (BBa_K1792002) include a T7 promoter, which is IPTG inducible to get maximum yield of protein. The promoters and RBS are also selected for greatest yield of protein when induced. These proteins contain a N-terminal bacterial secretion tag. Which allows the proteins to be exported from cells and easily separated by centrifugation. The proteins also contain a 6X histidine tag for possible downstream purification and concentration via affinity chromatography (if necessary). Stop codons take care of the protein termination for both the nuclease and dextranase. There is a double terminator on the nuclease construct to stop mRNA production after the gene of interest is translated. The dextranase construct was very large, so to minimize part size a terminator element was not included. As a result, dextranase mRNA synthesis will continue until the transcription complex falls off.

Overview of the project
Polyhydroxyalcanoates (PHAs) are universal prokaryotic storage compounds of carbon and energy. They are accumulated into the cell as spherical inclusion bodies in case of oversupply of carbon sources. We aim to control the production and the composition of granules in E.Coli. Many industrial and biomedical applications for those granules had been evocated. We want to concentrate especially on two axes :
⋅ the granule as nano or micro-beads in order to purify a molecule of interest
⋅ the granule as a storage system for overproduced lipids of interest such as DHA or EPA.

Copper-binding models showing the concentrations of free enzyme (CUT A), formed complex (CUT A – Copper complex), and free copper. The change in concentration of free enzyme and formed complex over time as the enzyme binds to free copper is quite evident, and the result shows that the higher the initial concentration of copper (i.e. the higher the concentration of CuSo4), the faster the rate of change. However, there is no detectable change in the concentration of free copper at all regardless of the initial concentration. Why? We realized that this is because our copper concentration was too high compared to our enzyme concentration. The lowest copper concentration we used in the experiment was 0.2365 molar, whereas the enzyme concentration used was 1 micromolar, or 1E-6 molar. The tiny amount of enzyme is too insignificant to cause a change in the concentration of free copper.
Improve
With further research in elementary kinetics, we realized that our enzyme, CUT A, is capable of binding to six copper ions simultaneously. Previously, we have assumed that there is a 1:1 ratio of enzyme to copper ions. This assumption turns out to be false. With multiple binding, the new equations are as follows (where n represents the number of substrates each enzyme can bind to):
Results and Interpretation:
Figure 14a.
Figure 14b.
Figure 14c.
Copper-binding models where each free enzyme (CUT A) may bind to six substrates (copper ions). Compared with previous results, the rate of change of the concentrations of free enzyme and ion-enzyme complexes are faster, but there is still no detectable change to the concentration of free copper. This is expected as the difference between the copper concentration and enzyme concentration is too great (of a 6th order). Successful removal of copper ions will require a much higher concentration of enzymes.

Stochastic movement of the cells
As promised before, we give the two functions describing the movement of the bacteria in the microfluidic device:
where Nsw/unsw denotes either the number of switched bacteria (or recombinated bacteria) or unswitched bacteria. The idea here is to have, on average at each step time, dt.kdiff.f(x,t) bacteria that will move, a result we would get from usual diffusion. As previously mentioned, we cannot use regular diffusion since our algorithm must apply to discrete data lying on a wide range of integers.
Simulations
Now let's present the graphical display of our simulation tool. Once the user has selected a refreshment speed x, the software will draw every x minutes the unswitched bacteria in grey, the switched ones in red and the arabinose in small blue points.
We see on the following picture that after a certain amount of time, both cells and arabinose are distributed rather uniformly, and that the concentration of arabinose decreases near the tunnel as it is washed away by the flow.
The software also gives us the dynamics of recombined bacteria, LuxI and AHL slice by slice. This is what we will exploit here.
In the following simulations, the device was divided into 15 slices. We exhibit some results on the fifth slice. To count, one can either look at the number of recombined bacteria thanks to RFP, or set up the timer thanks to AHL. We will see that depending on the parameters, one or other may not be possible. For the first one, it is necessary to have clear steps, implying that the time between the pulses will be large enough to allow the system to stabilise. For the second, distinct steps on the AHL graph are necessary to set up the timer. Indeed, this allows to design the bacteria in the way that they will produce GFP only once a certain treshold in AHL was reached. However, admitting that this timer is set up, then it is possible to count more frequent events even without steps as we shall see in figure 4. In the sequel, the time between two pulses will be denoted T2.

With these constructive suggestions, we adjusted our project design in the following aspects. Firstly, we tried assembling multiple-targeting miRNA inhibitors in our wet-lab experiments. Two miRNA Lockers, targeting two and four different miRNA molecules simultaneously were designed, assembled, and generated in our lab work and passed sequencing verification. Though cellular experiments on those Lockers have not been finished yet due to the time limits of iGEM, we believe our current results have shown the great potential of our approach on multi-miRNA targeting ( see results page for more details ). Secondly, some user-oriented modifications have been made on the building of our dsDNA library. A model, aiming to help users selecting the optimal oligonucleotides for Locker construction by analyzing the effect of different overhang combinations on the secondary structure of the generated Lockers ( see model page for more information ). More details on the interviews can be found on the HP silver page .
Market demand:
Suggested by Dr. Song, we investigated existing microRNA inhibitors in the market. Our HQ team managed to contact with some companies to inquire prices of their miRNA inhibitors. According to the instruction given by those companies, we calculated the costs of each products. Then we found that prices of most miRNA inhibitors are quite high, to an extent of $52.68 for the transfection of one million cells. For most microRNA researching laboratories or microRNA antagonist therapies where large consumptions were needed, current approaches may be very costly. Thus, there is a big market for low-cost miRNA inhibitors.
The major reason for the high cost of current miRNA inhibitors was thought to be the highly costing chemical modifications like as in Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs). For such matter, in our project design, unmodified DNA was directly used as miRNA inhibitors. Besides, due to the high cost of long-strand oligo DNA synthesis, we managed to develop a novel miRNA Locker generating procedure reducing the uses of long synthesized single strand oligo DNA, thus further reduce the cost( see design page for more details ).
Building on the modifications mentioned above, we recounted the cost of our scheme considering all reagent costs and experimental procedure. The cost transfecting one million cells using our scheme was successfully reduced to around $4.83. Together with the brilliant miRNA inhibiting effect of miRNA Lockers as well as its advantages on scalability, we thought our product could be a competitive candidate for miRNA loss of function researches as well as potential clinical uses ( details on cost account can be found on silver HP page ).

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#DiscoveryFestival_-_-_TEXT.html," we place a video guestbook. Here we will ask people to share what they think would be a good use for synthetic biology. What should next year’s iGEM team make?
Cooperation
To make this happen in three different cities on the same night, we cooperated with all Dutch iGEM teams except the team from Delft, which bailed out at the last moment. We divided the tasks, such as getting lab equipment (in threefold) or designing posters, equally amongst the other four teams. Our team will provide several important lab attributes and we designed the posters that will be used. We also divided the locations: The Amsterdam and Groningen teams will attend the Amsterdam festival together, while the Eindhoven team attends the festival in their home city and we will go to Rotterdam.
Communication Science
As an extra addition to the Rotterdam version of the festival, our team will be joined by Paulien Poelarends. She is an Applied Communication Science student at Wageningen UR and for her Msc. Thesis, she researches communication difficulties between scientists and the public. To read a summary of her proposal and a first impression of her data, see Communication Science .
Report
An overview of the party hall in Erasmus MC (Rotterdam) before the kick-off
The Rotterdam version of the Discovery festival as well as those in the other two cities were a great success! Over 1200 people visited the location in Rotterdam, and over 4000 attended the three festivals combined (based on presale numbers). With happy, interested people from all kinds of backgrounds mixed together, the general atmosphere on the festival as well as in our improvised lab was really great!
Lab Experience
We prepared a provisional laboratory where small groups of people (3-6) could manually go through a simulation of synthetic biology. In the first step they ‘ordered DNA online’, and through various subsequent steps they learned to use devices like an actual centrifuge, vortex and pipettes, and a make-shift electroporator. In the last step, they experienced the outcome of their endeavours by seeing or smelling the phenotype that they selected for in step one.
Soon after the festival doors opened at 8 p.m., the first group of visitors entered our lab. We took them along on their own synbio trip. Although somewhat uneasy at first, we soon got a hang of how to engage people, spark their interest and make them aware of what they were doing.  Throughout the evening, our lab has not lacked attention. Our team was giving tours constantly and it was not unusual for visitors to stand in line because our entire"

Our human practices includes several aspects, such as biosafety, social activity and public education. Since Carindex is a genetically engineered product, our work is to focus on promoting the knowledge of genetically engineered product and surveying on people's concern about it.
Self-learning
1. The Third International Symposium on Epigenetic Genomics：
In order to complete our project and product, we need various knowledge from different fields. In May, 2017, the whole team participated in the third International Symposium on Epigenetic Genomics organized by the National Chung Cheng University. In this conference, we learned a lot from the professors and asked them a lot of question, including oral health studies. We had received a lot of precious information from the conference, we also had some discusses on the Biosafety with those lecturers. They helped us to ensure that our product are safety enough protect us and the environment.
   
2. Safety Training：
All of us participated in the safety training held by Chung Cheng University in the middle of September,to learn what potentially dangers may happen while we are working on our experiments, also how these dangers can be avoided.
3. MIT beyond food mini bootcamp：
Since one of our goals is to win the entrepreneurship special prize, we participated in the ""MIT beyond food mini bootcamp"" held in Taiwan during May, 2017. Through this two-day camp, we learned a lot from many entrepreneurs in this field and experienced operating as a businessman. This gave us a clearer and better idea for our entrepreneurship plan.

For product testing in production industries: “Most likely in terms of lab testing downtime and reproducibility, the industry could benefit from 3D printing biofilms.”
Steffen Eickhardt, Head of Biofilm Test Facility, University of Copenhagen
“For research based applications, 3D biofilm printing could be used in combination with human cells (tissue engineering) to test host-pathogen interactions. Enabling studies such as these could in time influence how we treat patients and also change the way research is done on chronic bacterial infections.”

“Pharmaceutical industries will favour batch processes in the foreseeable future due to better process control and controlled risks. In the field of bulk chemicals and some fine chemicals, application of continuous processes might be interesting.”

For a complete policy and practice assessment, we thought it would be nice to not only include companies and research groups, but also the iGEM community.
For a complete policy and practice assessment, we thought it would be nice to not only include companies and research groups, but also the iGEM community. Since many iGEM teams are dealing or working with biofilms or co-cultures, our technology could be fruitful for a lot of these projects. In this section we will show you how our project could be used in combination with other iGEM projects. With these examples we show that our DIY printer and the biolink system form a useful addition to the iGEM community. The application scenarios described below are discussed and written together with the iGEM Berlin and iGEM KU Leuven team. Our collaboration with these teams was a great opportunity to share our technology and use it for other applications.
iGEM Berlin
The iGEM team of Berlin uses synthetic biology to develop a molecular filtering machine. This project has great opportunities in solving the problems with microplastics finding their ways into the wastewater treatment plant. During the wastewater treatment, the microplastics are not removed sufficiently. The ‘escaped’ microplastics are taken up by organisms living in rivers, lakes and the oceans, but also by human beings through the food chain"

They are able to tolerate deadily UV radiation and osmotic rays [18] , as well as the almost complete dehydration by switching to ‘anhydrobiotic state’, which confer resistance towards various environmental extremes.
What’s worth mentioning is that, anhydrobiotic ability is observed in various invertebrates, tardigrades, arthropods, and nematodes [14] . Trehalose are suggested to have an important role mediating desiccation resistance in anhydrobiotic organisms, however, the accumulation of trehalose is observed when the last two phylum subjected to desiccation, but not in tardigrades [15,16] . With further searching, we noticed that tardigrades’ anhydrobiotic ability are mediated by a rather novel class of protein called TDPs (tardigrades intrinsically disorded proteins)----the protein that our iGEM team is currently focusing on.
About our project
a) Inspiration
Every year, iGEM competition motivates teams from all over the world to devise numerous great project, genetically engineered organisms are designed to serve in wide range of fields. However, when it comes to application, the regulation of gene expression is not the only rising issue, but also the resilience of these engineered organisms that we need to concern. For example, some team’s bacteria have to work in dessert with extremely low water content( .ref ), or when cell components are freeze dried on the test paper to make a paper based biosensor, the system must undergo severe dehydration for storage and transport, and this would probably hamper their effectiveness during work.( .ref ). Our investigationfor the 2016 iGEM projects showed that over 299 entries, x% engineered organisms are facing practical issues related with extreme working conditions or environmental stress. As a consequence, team SIAT-SCIE is focusing on how we can transform the resilience of tardigrades into the engineered organisms. Increasing their efficiency during work and gives them greater potential to be put into real practice.
b) What are we doing?
Our first goal is to test whether TDPs can provide desiccation resistance for enzyme in vitro.
Secondly, we transfer our designed plasmid into DH5α and express TDP in vivo to see if it can confer desiccation resistance, by comparing the engineered strain with the E. coli that didn’t express the TDP gene. Hence a protection mechanism is developed, which can facilitate other iGEM teams"

TERRA Adapter
Creating the TERRA Adapter
The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip that is capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip running the experiment into the intended lab vessel. The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as users don’t need to design a chip that both performs both a biological experiment and proper output selection. For droplet-based experiments, the TERRA Adapter has two valves and a set of four pressure regulators per output. In continuous flow experiments, there are two valves for every output and an extra output that serves as a flush mechanism for cleaning the nozzle between outputs, but no pressure regulators.
After both discussing with Fraunhofer and Phenomyx about the lack of standardization in the microfluidic industry and evaluating the advantages of making our system compatible with commercial microfluidic chips, we made the output selection mechanism its own chip - the TERRA Adapter. Output selection is a necessary part of TERRA because the system needs direct control over when the output of the microfluidic chip is dispensed. This control is vital because the flow into the chip is continuous, whereas output must be noncontinuous. The TERRA Adapter allows for great flexibility in the experimental chip as it can be either user-designed or bought commercially, and does not require a built-in output selector.
Output Selector with Pressure Regulators
The first features resembling a TERRA Adapter were the valve-based output selectors used the initial versions of our proof of concept chips. An output selector is a combination of two valves and two ports that work in tandem. When one valve is open, the other is closed. This means the input only goes to one of the two outputs at any one time. When the valves are actuated, the liquid is redirected to the other output. Using this concept, our simple two-valve output selector system controls when an input is flowing to waste and the output nozzle, allowing direct control over when the output is dispensed. The output selector used in the 4-Pressure Regulator chip is identical to"

We are very grateful to the Tricastin nuclear power plant, Centraco, Michel from the Bugey Nuclear Power Station and Assystem for answering our questions and helping us to get our project closer to reality.
To conclude, we have to dedicate a really big thanks to the team INSA-LYon iGEM (2010)(check their wiki ). They engaged for the first time Lyon and its prestigious schools into the iGEM competition. Without them, the Lyon Biosciences team wouldn't exist.
Using their experience, we learned a lot and understood all the benefits to collaborate wih other people. In this aim, we create a partnership between the INSA de Lyon and the ENS de Lyon, everyone contributing by different ways to an unique project.
But the gathering between these two schools wouldn’t have been possible without the work of some of our supervisors! So, as students and advisors, we would like first to thank them for all the efforts! This collaboration is really rewarding for all the members of the team, as  on the scientific side than the human side.

Is it Compatible with the BioBrick Standard?
Our next step was to prove that our plasmid was compatible with the BioBrick standard.  We made three BioBricks by combining BioBricks already present in the registry: the Anderson promoter (BBa_K880005) paired with the chromoproteins: amilCP (BBa_K592009) , amilGFP (BBa_K592010) or mRFP (E1010) .  We assembled these BioBricks in our plasmid and transformed them into chemically competent DH5Α cells.

Expression of Heterologous Proteins
Next step was to show that pSB1A8YL could be transformed into our yeast Y. lipolytica and enable protein expression.  We used a transformation protocol received from Cory M. Schwartz, University of California. We designed a composite part containing a TEF promoter and hrGFP codon-optimized for Y. lipolytica ( (BBa_K2117005) ).
This BioBrick was inserted into pSB1A8YL.  We wanted to show that we were able to transform, replicate and detect expression of a heterologous protein from ( (BBa_K2117005) ) in Y. lipolytica.

Background
Results of measurement often vary due to methods and units employed. The results from different laboratories can only be compared when protocols and units are standardized.
Aim
Teams all over the world measure the fluorescence of the same devices with same protocols and units to study the distribution pattern of those results.
Results
Abs600 of cultures of 5 strains at selected time.
Fluorescence intensity (FI) of cultures of 5 strains at selected time.
FI/Abs600 of cultures of 5 strains at selected time.
Conclusion
The relative transcription initiation strength of three promoters is consistent with the result characterized by RFP FI yet some problems occurred when we conducted the experiment.
Background Aim Method Result Discussion
Background
iGEM aims to improve the tools both available to the iGEM community and to the synthetic biology community as a whole. One of the greatest challenges in synthetic biology study is that measurements of fluorescence usually cannot be compared because results are often reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways.
Often this work is done by doing some sort of ""relative expression"" comparison; however, being unable to directly compare measurements makes it harder to debug engineered biological constructs, harder to effectively share constructs between laboratories, and even harder to just interpret experimental controls.
Aim
We used plate reader to measure bacterial GFP fluorescence intensity, results of which could indirectly characterize the transcription initiation strength of corresponding promoters in a common, comparable way. Moreover, since the same experiments are being conducted by teams from all over the world following same protocols, the international iGEM community tries to answer questions of major significance: how close can the results be when fluorescence is measured in laboratories all around the world and, with results being normalized in a common, comparable unit, what are the distribution pattern of these results.

Second, we designed a series of models of experimental record, and we are adding them to the platform as a different function. Users can add a model for recording experimental data efficiently. Third, the innovative design of platform’s interface is made. We will improve the interface according to it.
Most of the software function had been completed and the users can use it. We will improve some function that not good enough next week. Before the ensuring Wednesday, we will give instruction and the users can use the software more efficient. We plan to make a community post at iGEM official page and received responses from other iGEM teams who use our software.
That was a funny day. We discussed how we can make full use of things to make a mascot. Additionally, we sat around and have a brainstorm, after which we got the idea of how to record the introduction movie. Together we put forward a lot of helpful ideas and funny tips. Hong planned to draw more than 1000 pictures! That was amazing!
And for distinct parts of our wiki, the job was distributed to five members and each one had to draw the scheme quickly. After that, they need to discuss with our designer Hong to know whether the idea can be achieved or not.

For this is the last month for us to prepare for the iGEM. We are now ready to start preparing for our speaking. That was really a hard work. Thus we need to know what other teams had done before. So we downloaded their videos and carefully watching them. That may help us on make a good presentation.
We have got the idea on how to make the PPT for our presentation. Besides, this week, we also made some instruction books for users to use our software. We also worked on the wiki to make sure that we will be able to show it to teams from all over the world. Our designer, Hong, had drew so many graphs to beautify our wiki. There is still so many problems need to be solved in the last two weeks. We need to hurry up! Keep on!
This week, we tried to give a presentation to our guiders. They offered us some good suggestions. We need to beautify our PPT. That’s a hard but interesting work. That’s a challenge for us. And we believe that we can finish the job by our hard working"
BU_Wellesley_Software,2011,Team:BU Wellesley Software#Puppetshow_-_-_TEXT.html,"-pLuxR was tested by restriction mapping the part. Colony A did not ligate properly but colony B and C did work. The insert is about the same size as the backbone so the fact that there are two bands right under each other is correct. As there was no control for the first double volume ligation, we repeated it but we used RFPc and Ptet once again and did a single volume ligation at the same time. This time the plates clearly showed that the double ligation had the same, if not more, colonies on the plates than the manual control. The regular ligations with the RFPc and Ptet unfortunately still had discrepancies between the robot trials and the manual trial. The restriction mapping for the single and double volume ligations proved that both ligations worked properly.
Safety practices
As wet-lab protocols were repeated on the robot the same safety procedures were performed. The trials that were run on the robot were done inside a closed laboratory meant for biological processes.  Also while the robot was performing its task, individuals were not allowed to interfere directly with the robot.
None of the materials used in our iGEM project pose a significant risk to the health and safety of our team members and laboratory. We work in a standard BSL1 certified lab space and mainly work with ''E. coli'' bacteria. Furthermore, there is no risk to the public health or environment if the materials of our project were released. This is because the genes that we are using and studying code for transcriptional proteins and are not pathogenic or toxic. There is no threat of security through misuse of our materials because of their nonlethal nature. In terms of lab safety and institutional standards, there is an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at Boston University which evaluates all research projects, primarily those involved with recombinant DNA, and insures proper biosafety guidelines. We are in contact with the IBC and are in the process of approving our project.
There is also a Laboratory Safety Committee through which all wet lab members have taken mandatory laboratory safety training. This training provides a basic overview to chemical and biosafety, fire and life safety, emergency management, and waste management. In the United States, the major centers for biosafety procedures and guidelines are the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The cultures were subsequently diluted 500-fold with REM in 96-well plates, which were further incubated at 37°C in a shaker at 1000 rpm. Once the diluted cultures reached an OD600 of 0.12–0.14 (~3 h), 10 μL aliquots were transferred into 1 mL REM in 24-well plates (Corning/Costar 3524). These plates were incubated at 37°C in a Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific, USA) under constant shaking at 1,000 rpm for 20 h to maintain exponential growth, during which the OD600 and fluorescence values were recorded

Testing AHL degradation by aiiA
The product of the aiiA gene AHL-lactonase degrades AHL in many strains of Bacillus, however, it is unclear to what extent (if any) B. subtilis strain 168 degrades AHL. If 168 is good at degrading AHL this will be a problem when our signaling system is eventually moved into strain 168.
We are testing B. subtilis strain 168’s ability to degrade AHL by exposing synthetic AHL to the strain and then testing its ability to be recognized by the receiver.
Materials
Bacillus subtilis - protease deficient (NPR and APR) derived from strain 168 - grown up in an over night culture of LB.
Synthetic AHL – Sigma K3007 – AHL powder was dissolved in EA buffer and diluted to 10uM concentration
E. coli with T9002 AHL receiver grown up in overnight culture of LB
All plates contain soft agar with 200uL of E. coli AHL receiver mixed-in. Plates 1,2 and 4 contain Bacillus in fresh LB medium, while plate 5 contains Bacillus in it’s overnight LB. Plate 5 was used to test if an excreted product of Bacillus is responsible for the degradation of AHL. The product of the aiiA gene in Bacillus subtilis is most likely not exported.

Understanding circuits and Construction procedures
I spent some time going over the basic biology and lab procedures with Jeremy. I drew out the response circuit, vectors, restriction sites, promoters to make sense of what I will be constructing in the lab later next week.
I worked on the construction plan which I will submit to  Sonja and Thane tomorrow. I decided taht since C1 lambda is currently in 2K3 plasmid and Pqrr4 is in an 1AC3 plasmid, it would make sense to move C1 lambda (1kb) behind Pqrr4 and grow the colonies on Chlroramphenical plates. Then I could move my construct (RBS-aiiA-B0015) behind the C1 lambda. Since my construct is only about 900 kb, it shouldn't be too hard to move. This would be the ideal method of construction because my construct is in psB1AK3. Cloning the aiiA construct after C1 lambda would allow me to grow the colonies on Chloramphenical plates. This method of construction does not require a plasmid switch.
I did a bit of research of aiiA to get a better understanding of my construct and how it ""fits"" into the response circuit.
STEFAN
Stations almost complete!
Finished most of the notecards except for the eukaryotic cell station since I am still trying to figure that out and the smelly bacteria station because that might be change. The problem there is that it's not really very interactive. The bacteria are there but don't really do anything and the squid just tells you about them. I was thinking of a quiz but that might be too superficial in the questions that can be asked.  Various seaweed and rock were added, some terraforming was done so people will not wander off the path and a starting area was made. This consists of Professor Squidmund Freud giving directions, a sign saying ""Welcome to the Synthetic Kingdom"" and a map.

Glucose inhibition  on fluorescence in minimal media on bdh2. The fluorescence of GFP in bdh2 under M9WCM shows significant difference in fluorescence output (p < 0.0001.). This compared to M9 media where fluorescence is almost half. The fluorescence in glucose is quite stable despite the decreased growth witnessed in the growth assay. Characterisation was done in M9 and M9WCM. Data points show final time point after 6h growth for each concentration. The arabinose concentration was kept at 6 μM for all samples. Growth was at 37°C with shaking over 6h.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
The null hypothesis, glucose concentration does not influence growth of MG1655 in M9 minimal (M9M) media and M9 minimal waste conditioned media (M9MWCM) was tested using a two-tailed t-test. This must be rejected because p < 0.0001, thus glucose concentration has an influence on growth in M9M and M9MWCM. In addition to this, the null hypothesis: glucose concentration does not influence fluorescence in M9 minimal media must be rejected as p < 0.0001. Thus glucose concentration influences fluorescence.
Conclusions: Growth is significantly influenced glucose with regards to growth in M9M and M9MWCM. Bdh2 grown in glucose grow better in M9MWCM than M9M but are inhibited with increasing glucose concentration.

Abstract
Our team will try to make a new technology called LAM (Lactic acid mediated) communication utilizing GAR+ prion. GAR, or glucose associated repression controls the usage of glucose of yeast. In 2016, it was proved that this pathway is managed by the certain amount of lactic acid. Lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria, affects the prion formed gar- and induces the formation of GAR+. Considering this mechanism and terminators of fission yeast and regulating the amount of mRNA of GFP and antisense-GFP, we will enable yeast to communicate each other beyond the species of gram-negative bacteria and make a biosensor to sense hiochi.  .
Background
In Gifu prefecture, there are many rivers that are called “clear river”. The water coming from the streams is famous for its good quality and good deliciousness. Therefore, it is natural that the development of sake brewing. However, there is a trouble which is called “an act of God” in the process of sake brewing. This is the phenomenon of “Hiochi”.
Now the risk of Hiochi has generally decreased by the complete control, the measurement of Hiochi. However, in the current sake market, the popularity of Namazake is increasing. Namazake have not passed the step of Hiire, pastuerization. Hence, Namazake have not been sterilized by heating. The taste of Namazake is fresh and delicate and the smell is pretty good. Also, there remains a feeling of sparkling. However, simply because Namazake have not been done “Hiire”, there may occur “Hiochi” after being opened the bottle when people store at home. So, we plan to make a biosensor which detects the causative bacteria of Hiochi.

Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Waste Degradation: SRF_-_-_TEXT.html," mathematical and deterministic model that is based on MATLAB extension Simbiology for polyurethane degradation. The model contains the kinetic properties of degradation enzymes that are helpful for the design of assays. As we scaled up the initial concentrations of all substrates to meet the conditions for a bio-reactor, the model can provide preliminary simulations and predictions for the MAPLE system.
Design
Objective
Here are some specific objectives for the model to achieve:
1. The model should contain the gene expression model of the degradation enzymes because the enzyme concentration determines the rate of plastic degradation. In our case for PUR degradation, we used pBAD strong promoter K206000 for most enzymes. We built the gene expression model based on inducible pBAD promoter, which gene expression rate can be regulated by inducer concentration.
2. The model should show the efficiency of the enzyme secretion to the culture from the cells. It's also important because the enzyme concentration in the culture depends on it. Here we used pelB secretion tag for most enzymes in order to achieve a high efficiency.
3. The model basically predicts how long will take to degrade a known concentration of soluble polyurethane. It is assumed that the enzyme in our assays has the same kinetic properties as the enzyme used in the literature. The model can suggest a suitable concentration of the plastic to use in order to get good results from the assays.
4. It is known that ethylene glycol is toxic to E.coli. It has, however, no clear effect on the growth of our MG1655 strain when the concentration of ethylene glycol is below 200 mM. The model, therefore, should suggest a safe range of polyurethane concentration to avoid a high concentration (>200mM) of ethylene glycol produced.

Both of our projects rely on Cas12a-fluorophore-based assays in order to create an assay that will allow early detection of HIV                 in infants (as Austin_LASA is performing) and early detection of cancer-relapse.
We have developed our Cas12a assay with the purpose of detecting point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements found in ctDNA as well as the detection of an amplicon that contains an amplified miRNA sequence to target. These processes are               explained in detail on our Project Design page.
During our project, we spent a long time working with these Cas12a assays and there was a lot of effort that went into the optimization of these assays that came with many trials, in terms of Cas12a pre-incubation             time, activator concentration, DNAse alert concentration, etc. We had a very insightful discussion about our experiences and shared our knowledge and advice on working with such Cas12a assays. Here are the protocols that we shared with the             Austin_LASA team, hoping that it would provide useful insights for their Cas12a experiment designs.
In both of our projects, the ultimate goal was to design a “kit” and part of this kit would require an isothermal amplification step of a DNA target sequence. We learned that Austin_LASA’s team had successfully performed Loop mediated isothermal                 amplification (LAMP) for their project and we took this opportunity to learn about this possibility of isothermal amplification, as well as the implications of performing it successfully. It was a pleasure to exchange ideas with them.
NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team
We were very happy to get the change to collaborate with the NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team . Our collaboration was based on ethical reflections linked to the project, in particular to the methods used and the social implications.
The NUS Singapore-Sci iGEM Team had created a survey on the myths and misconceptions associated with Synthetic Biology. After sharing this survey with us, we entered a discussion that lead to our team deciding to also create a survey that                   aims at capturing the general public opinion concerning our project. After investigating the nature of the components in our project, we followed two approaches: firstly to study the impact of the techniques used in the project as well                   as the awareness of those performing them, second"

Problem
Gout is a kind of metabolic disease caused by the urate crystals at the joints and deposited in the tissue, which is as a result of the body’s purine metabolic disorder and decreased excretion of uric acid in the kidney, making the blood uric acid (sUA) level increase. The nature of gout is hyperuricemia —— a more terrible evil than gout!
Hyperuricemia refers to the symptom that the level of uric acid is unusually high in blood. It commonly affects joints and leads to the acute/chronic gouty arthritis which are shown as joint deformity. But the this is just the tip of the iceberg for hyperuricemia’s harm. Hyperuricemia also can damage the kidney, causing renal abnormalities and chronic kidney disease. What’s more, it has something to do with  diabetes and other metabolic diseases.

Modelling
An ambitious project of 73 differential equations
Two parts: Model of our own system and modelling database
The modelling part of our project is divided into two parts; the model of our own system and a suggestion of a modelling database being integrated in the iGEM website. Since the Edible coli project aims to make E. coli produce both the essential and the non-essential amino acids in our protein called OneProt, we decided to make a model of the biosynthesis of these amino acids in E. coli in orderto detect bottlenecks in the system. This was a very ambitious project and required a lot of research and time. The biosynthesis of the amino acids consists of over 73 intermediates and thus would require at least 73 ODE's. After a long summer of modelling we came to the realization that since most teams in iGEM need to model pathways every year, it is a shame that every team needs to start from scratch when – most likely – the modelling of the enzymes in their system has already been modelled before in iGEM. This is when we came up with the idea of a modelling database, which would – just like the current parts registry – contain basic modelling “bricks”. These bricks would be uploaded from the teams that have already made them for their own project. Creating this system would allow future teams to make much"

Transfected cells are cultured for 48 hours before performing flow cytometry, long enough for protein expression level to achieve steady state.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," biological systems from standard and exchangeable parts obtained from cells. Generally, there are several common difficulties for the iGEM teams which would be hard to solve sometimes due to the knowledge-gap without a well-studied biological mechanism. Some of the examples are listed as follows:
1. Hard to define standardised biological parts.  Absolute measures, standardised characterisation, have to be deployed in order to reduce the associated complexity of parts comparison.
2. Not available for predictable design procedures resulting in tedious trials and errors. The teams have to optimise the systems at all costs.
3. Hard to avoid unexpected cell-cell interactions. Biological machineries need to be insulated from the natural cell machineries as much as possible.
4. Hard to avoid variability and lift the stability of the system at the same time.
We hope to have a brief investigation on the difficulties that iGEM teams would usually encountered to see if our Tristable Switch would be able to eradicate the problems. Making use of the advantages of that the Tristable Switch proceeds, for example, higher specificity, ultra stability and being toolkit-like, hopefully, iGEM teams could further improve their projects or be provided with alternatives. Difficulties that came across during biosensing are brought into focus owing to its popularity among iGEM teams.

According to the Agilent manual for the kit we use, the primers are designed with the following constraints:
Length between 25 and 45 bases, ideally.
Melting temperature above 78° C.
Mutation near the middle of the primers, with 10 to 15 bases on each side.
Ideally, have a GC content of at least 40%, and terminate with one or more G or C bases.
The online tool ensures the constraints are met, all that is needed is to choose the site and type of mutation.
The easiest way to design primers is to copy the wild-type sequence into the sequence, then ""upload and translate"" it. A little clarification to the provided documentation: when the sequence is uploaded, check boxes appear below a set of radio-buttons. They list the amino acids, translated from the provided sequence. Check up to seven positions, then choose what substitutions to operate using the drop-down menus above.
our primers are then ordered from Invitrogen. Upon arrival, they must be diluted ideally to 100 ng/µl. The primers we order contain too much DNA for the volume of the tube at that concentration, so we dilute them instead to 1 µg/µl.
Culture media preparation
The culture media must be prepared in advance. The required components are, once again, listed in the manual (p.15). For quick reference, three solutions are needed:
LB-Ampicillin Agar, prepared from autoclaved LB Agar. The LB Agar is not needed alone.
NZY+ Broth (autoclaved)
TE Buffer which can just be taken from a miniprep or gel extraction kit.
The agar broth is used to pour plates, as described in the agar plates protocol .
Mutation reaction
The mutation reaction creates the mutant strand. It is carried out like a PCR, in a thermal cycler. Mix the following reagents, for each 50 µl reaction volume:
Reagents for the mutation reactions

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Neil loads DNA samples into gel but they disperse in buffer immediately
With the two midi-prepped plasmids prepared (midipreps of plasmid containing RFP and plasmid containing GFP) we were in a position to carry out DNA Gel Electrophoresis. Samples for electrophoresis were prepared in accordance of the protocol, i.e. 9ul of DNA + 1ul of loading buffer. The samples were then loaded onto the gel.
However as the samples were pipette just above the wells of the agarose gel they dispersed into the surrounding buffer solution; they did not fall into the wells! Something within the midi-prepped plasmid solution was causing them to float. It became clear that not all of the ethanol had been removed from the samples (the ethanol coming from Wash Solution 2).
In light of this incident, no gel electrophoresis could be carried out. Next week, we will have an analysis of the situation along with a solution to the problem.

Background
Foot odor and tinea pedis (athlete's foot) are such common foot diseases. Foot odor can always cause embarrassing trouble in public areas. And tinea pedis (athlete's foot) makes patient’s foot itching, scaling, and redness. A lot of people in Sichuan Province of China suffer from this, which is consistent with our human practice survey result.
Two problems are hard to treat because the diseases are caused by microorganisms. Foot odor is due to the metabolism result of microbiome on foot surface, acetic acid and isovaleric acid contribute most. Tinea pedis is a fungus infection disease, most commonly caused by Trichophyton rubrum, a fungi species originated from Southeast Asia (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1091684-overview). However, even though ointment has been developed to inhibit the growth of microorganisms living on our feet, the continuous inhibition ability is not good as expected. The shoes always provide perfect warm and mild environment for microorganisms to hide and revive at proper time on skin.
So SCU-China 2016 design an innovative insole “Comfootable” to deal with it. Two engineered strains E. coli, strain ”Rihanna” and strain “Drake” are living in the insole, to help us to achieve our goal: to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and remove the odor.
Engeneered E.coli Strain
""Rihanna""
You can stand on my umbrella to ANTI microorganisms.
Antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ is synthesizing in “Rih……...anna” anytime. When your foot is on the insole, the temperature of your foot induces the temperature sensitive promoter to drive the expression of self-kill gene hokD to lyse the “Rihanna” to release CecropinXJ.

Back to Homepage
Introduction
Circuit+, an online registry of standard genetic circuits, aims to fill the vacancy of genetic circuits’ database and sharing platform. In the database behind, we design several tables to record all kinds of information to comprehensively describe a genetic circuit. All the information we record and require in Create is based on our standard of RFC 97 and RFC 101. Users can retrieve circuits, browse information, share by exporting information in SBOL and submit new circuits. As for sharing platform, we call for users to submit their own genetic circuits and post their comment of other circuits. Furthermore, even average people are allowed and encouraged to upload their crazy ideas to Mindmap. Thus, Circuit+ is a good place for exchanging genetic circuits and obtaining a better understanding about synthetic biology.
Feature
Mindmap
Mindmap is a most interesting way to do retrieving, and actually it’s more than that. By clicking bubbles one and another, you can go into a deeper level of the classification and eventually find some circuits. You can use this way to have an overlook of circuits we have here and get some idea about synthetic biology. And most importantly, it can work as a medium of brainstorm. In fact, the first version of Mindmap was the result of our brainstorm when we were collecting previous iGEM projects. The classification in Mindmap is now somewhat different. It is idea-driven and can make you to think more. If you are freshman to synthetic biology, you can find it useful to spend some time in Mindmap.
SBOL supported
The information of circuit can be exported in form of SBOL, which can simplify the job of sharing and data exchanging. The SBOL in our software is an extension of core SBOL and it can record additional information that defined in the RFC 97.

When it comes to human practice in synthetic biology there are many issues and precautions that must be considered. At the end of the day you are creating a novel organism in a lab and how it reacts outside of a lab can be very different from what you would expect given the immense number of variables to consider. Our team has created the means to produce theoretical organisms given a desired input and output. While no organism is actually created, we give the information needed to design a novel organism of choice along with the stoichiometry of the reactions going on within it. In this regard we are doing the same thing as the wet lab teams are doing, which is creating new cells; therefore, the same safety measures must be taken.
Certain safety precautions must be taken in order to ensure that an organism does not continue to grow rapidly and multiply exponentially out of control and upset the order of balance in an environment. A safeguard to prevent this scenario could be to analyze the balance of ATP produced in order to see if the energy production is too high, in which the organism would grow out of control, or low enough that the organism would be present for a small while before dying off.
ATP is the energy within a cell and a majority of what it relies on to flourish. By limiting ATP produced we lessen the chances of a cell growing vigorously and being a potential danger to the environment.  The actual means to prevent this is by creating a script that will analyze ATP consumption and production. With this information, you are able to adjust the ATP metabolism in whatever way you want.  You will be able to keep the production low enough so cell processes can still occur and allow the cell to grow to an extent but not high enough that it can potentially grow out of control.
This ATP balance is not hard to do. If you have a stoichiometric matrix of the cell or are able to analyze the ATP processes going on then you have the necessary information to control the cells' growth. By analyzing the ATP you can create a positive-negative balance. If the ATP produced is in a positive range then the cell will potentially have too much energy and will grow wildly. If negative you can assume that your cell will eventually die out.
There are many variables to consider when creating a novel organism and even more when you are talking about integrating a cell into an environment. It is almost impossible to be certain how"

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#overview_-_-_TEXT.html,", our treatment protocol seeks to reduce microbial loads within the infected fish through the use of a peptide called Entericidin B. Recent studies have shown the peptide to be toxic to the growth of Flavobacterium psychrophilum, thereby providing a potential treatment to BCWD[2]. Hundreds of bacterial entericidin phenotypes exist naturally. This year, Cornell iGEM has engineered 20 strains of Escherichia coli for the regulated production of such peptides to test their efficacy against the growth of Flavobacterium psychrophilum. In doing so, we plan to develop the most effective probiotic treatment for BCWD and advance the study of therapeutic probiotic treatments in combatting similar diseases.
In addition, the team engineered a novel fish drug delivery system to safely administer our probiotic treatment without environmental harm. We have developed a working prototype of a fish tag that can safely latch onto the skin of a fish and demonstrate the secure and time-effective release of our peptide to treat BCWD in an infected fish. Our fish tag aligns with current practices of fish tagging in the aquaculture industry today, and has immediate potential to be implemented on both a local and global scale. We have shared the device with local hatcheries and fish farms to both garner feedback to improve prototype designs as well as help local farmers combat coldwater disease.
Success of this putative microbial control system holds important ramifications for human and animal health, as similar treatment methods could be devised for other bacterial infections. Prevention of BCWD will help provide a more secure, sustainable future in the fish industry and beyond to aid growing population necessary to sustain the continued increase of the human population.
Project Background
The Disease: Bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) is a bacterial infection among fish caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, a Gram-negative bacillus. The name of the disease is derived from the fact that infection typically occurs at temperatures below 13 degrees Celsius [4]. The rapid spread of this waterborne disease occurs through horizontal transmission of bacteria from one fish to another, and is exacerbated when fish are contained in dense populations such as those commonly found on fish farms [5]. Symptoms of BCWD include external fish skin lesions and necrosis of the fins, both of which render fish commercially inviable [4].
Local BCWD Outbreaks: Cornell University is situated in the Finger Lakes region as well as a part of the Great Lakes region. Unfortunately, the region has recently been hard hit by the effects of BCWD. For example, in 2010, Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery, a Ohio facility"

The Team
Left to right: Richard, Bing, Lesia, Adam, Thien, Nina, Joanna; Seated: Douglas
The 2009 University of California Berkeley Software team was composed of seven undergraduate students, one postdoctoral instructor ( Douglas Densmore ) and one faculty advisor ( J.Christopher Anderson ). The team was made up of both bioengineering as well as electrical engineering and computer science students. The participants were selected from over 100 applicants which applied in the Spring of 2009 to be members of the team. Students were selected based on GPA, related research experience, performance on a series of tutorials, letters of recommendation, and short interview sessions.
The team was broken into four projects: Bing Xia focused on revamping the general software infrastructure . Joanna Chen and Richard Mar developed Spectacles . Thien Nguyen and Nina Revko examined assembly protocols and workflow design . Finally, Lesia Bilitchenko and Adam Liu created Eugene .
The team was funded by the National Science Foundation , the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center , qb3 , the Coalition to Diversify Computing , and the Center for Hybrid Embedded Systems Software . We want to thank all our sponsors and are excited to present our work at the jamboree!

The Alternative
Antibodies have provided many useful applications throughout the years, both in therapeutics and in research. However, the expensiveness and time-consuming part of antibody production entails that research and development of alternatives is needed. We need to think differently.
Peptide aptamers make up one alternative. These combinatorial recognition proteins have been known for more than 15 years Reference: Colas P. The eleven-year switch of peptide aptamers. Journal of biology. 2008;7(1):2.
Colas P, Cohen B, Jessen T, Grishina I, McCoy J, Brent R. Genetic selection of peptide aptamers that recognize and inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Nature. 1996;380(6574):548-50. and they provide high specificity and strong binding affinity (see table 1).
Peptide aptamers consist of a variable peptide sequence inserted into a scaffold protein. It is through this variable loop that they bind their target. Various scaffolds have been used as carriers and conformational stabilizers of peptide aptamers. Of the most frequently used is the bacterial and human thioredoxin (hTrx). Reference:"

In this meeting, we talk about the experiments we fall.
Recently we tried to knock out the relevant genes of VNP20009. But there were no positive results.  After second consideration, we make our next plan. In the future we are going to try different concentrations of L-arabinose, We will assay 1 mM (indicated in the original  protocol),  10  mM  and  0.1  M  of  L-arabinose. After  transformation  of  the  amplimer,  the  cells  were recovered in 1 ml of LB and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C (as suggested in the original method). In the next week we will try a serious of  time of incubation and temperature 30°C  before  plating.
We hope we can have a good result.

In 2007 Timothy K. Lu and James J. Collins published a paper, “Dispersing biofilms with engineered enzymatic bacteriophage,” in which the showed that they had engineered T7 and T3 phage to infect their E. Coli hosts with the gene for Dispersin B, which was released along with the phage progeny. The researchers achieved 99.997% degradation of the biofilm.  This is essentially what we are thinking to do: engineer a phage to infect a bacterial host with a gene that expresses a protein that will accelerate the degradation of cholera’s biofilm. These researchers show that it is possible for E.Coli. OUR PLAN"

Implementation of a Plant Biofilter
How does a biofilter look like? To face this question we considered the requirements for a moss filter and took a look at existing solutions.
We talked to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Clemens Posten, who is head of the Institute of bioprocess engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). So we were shown the institutes's bioreactors and Prof. Posten gave us an idea how a symbiosis between plant and technology can look like. In the past his group worked on a collaboration project with Prof. Dr. Reski (see our Advisory Board ) on biological process engineering for Physcomitrella patens. Throughout this discussion we figured out several important parameters we will have to control and possible problems we might have to solve in order to successfully implement our PhyscoFilter.
Although his institute at the moment mainly works with algae, two solutions became apparent as sensible. The tube reactor mainly consists of glass tubes in which the plant is grown. The open pond model is a meander-shaped pond or slowly floating stream.

The flat disposal of the polyurethane tube guarantees a maximum of incoming light. It consists of one tube with the length of 15m arranged in a spiral shape. A meander shape wasn't possible, because the tube's bending radius is limited. The tube has an inner diameter of 4mm and an outer diameter of 6mm. It is fixated on a wooden board with hot glue.
The idea behind that solution was to grow the moss on a big textile fiber inside the tube or on the tube wall. In this manner many parameters are set and"

In addition to the bands at 25 and 27 kDa, cultures carrying BBa_K2229300 (CsgD and OmpR234 expression) contained two extra bands at 15 kDa and 30 kDa, which were not observed in the controls. We looked into the product of other curli operon genes, and found that CsgG is around 30 kDa, whereas CsgA, B, C, E, and F are all around 15 kDa (Robinson et al. 2006; Uhlich et al. 2009; Shu et al. 2012). This suggests that, as expected, BBa_K2229300 stimulates the production of other curli proteins as well (predicted proteins and sizes are labeled in figure 3-15).
Figure 3-15 SDS-PAGE results show that BBa_K2229100, BBa_2229200, and BBa_K2229300 overexpress CsgD, OmpR234, or both proteins, respectively. Predicted proteins from the curli operons are listed on the right; E. coli expressing GFP was used as a positive control. Protein Gel: & Figure: Justin Y.
After confirming protein expression, we wanted to test if our constructs actually lead to faster and greater biofilm production. We used Congo Red (CR), a dye commonly used to measure biofilm production (Reinke & Gestwicki 2011). CR solution mixed with bacterial liquid cultures were transferred to 12-well microtiter plates, and incubated with glass coverslips at 37˚C for one day. The samples were then washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and dried at 60˚C. Any stained biofilm on the glass coverslips was solubilized in ethanol, and absorbance was measured at 500 nm (figures 3-16, 3-17, 3-19). If biofilms were present, the solution would appear red, which could be quantified by an absorbance value.
We find that overexpressing CsgD and/or OmpR234 increases biofilm production to different degrees, as we hypothesized (figure 3-19). Overexpression of CsgD (BBa_K2229100) doubles biofilm production compared to the control BBa_K805015 (figure 3-16), whereas overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K222920"

Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

TUDelft,2008,Team:TUDelft#Research Proposal_-_-_TEXT.html," At the least, one may state that both the bottom-up, constructing part and the top-down, deconstructing aspects of synthetic biology rely on the principle of using more or less biological systems in a more or less natural way. This new approach of biology brings about new applications, but also new risks and new ethical considerations. The question is to what extent the participants in the iGEM competition realize this.  We are interested in what these new ethical considerations as proposed by ethicists in the field of synthetic biology actually mean for the participants in iGEM. On an individual level, which ethical questions play a role for the TU Delft iGEM team? How do the team members work with or around these issues? These are the topics that are investigated in this study.
Before these individual team member analyses can be carried out, a road-map of the ethical considerations that are associated with synthetic biology need to be investigated. Therefore, a literature survey is carried out, exploring the general, ""macro"" ethical sides of synthetic biology. With this road map, a framework for a questionnaire has been developed, by which the ethical considerations on the individual ""micro"" level will be analyzed.
Predicted results from practical work
When input and output come together, a bio- thermometer could be created that changes color (or smells differently) at defined temperatures. A possible application of this project (temperature induced color production) can be to produce heat maps of surfaces on a microbial scale. A different application for the temperature sensitivity is to use this system for triggering bi-stable genetic switches or detection of temperature variations in cultivations. Furthermore, we hope the lab results will yield results to confirm or improve mathematical models based on the structure variations introduced in the temperature switch parts.
The modeling part itself could result in a predictive temperature sensitivity algorithm of RNA. Also, it could give insight in the enzymatic reactions that happen in the color pathway.
Finally, the ethics will provide us with a better insight of what iGEM participants know and think of developments in synthetic biology.

Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," rumen [2] .
The substrates for methanogenesis vary greatly among different methanogenic organisms because they use different modes of methanogenesis. For example, the archaeon Methanobrevibacter ruminantium (order Methanobacteriales) utilizes carbon dioxide, hydrogen and formate for methane production, whereas Methanosarcina barkeri (order Methanosarcinales) can grow on a wider range of substrates like acetate or methylamines, in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide [1] .
One obvious approach for the reduction of methane emissions is changing the diet fed to the animal. For example, the amount of methane emitted by cattle is lower when the diet consists mostly of concentrate, which is rich in nutrients and low in fibre content, rather than a mixture of concentrate and forage [3]. Another possibility is grinding the food before feeding so that it resides in the rumen for a shorter period. This way, there would be less time for the microorganisms, including methanogens, to work on the food [1] .
Apart from the type of food, the latter can also be supplemented by, for example, fatty acids which would then inhibit the protozoa associated with the methanogens. To this aim, it was found that medium-chain saturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 8-10 are most effective [4] . However, the use of unsaturated fatty acids which can act as hydrogen sinks and thus inhibit methanogenesis is also discussed [1] . Another approach by which the association between protozoans and methanogens may be split is defaunation, i.e. the removal of the protozoans from the rumen. As a large amount of methane emissions is accounted for by PAMs, this treatment would act on an equally large source of methane emissions [1, 2] .
There have also been vaccines developed in order to stimulate the ruminant’s immune system so that it acts on the methanogens [1] . However, such vaccines are usually directed against certain groups of methanogens only. In some cases, this might give those methanogens responsible for most of the emissions an advantage and thus increase methane emissions instead of decreasing them [5] .
Aside from the above-mentioned ones there are several further attempts to stop methane emissions in the rumen, but it also has to be considered that although by this process a substantial amount of energy is lost, methanogenesis still has a point in ruminal ecology. The removal of hydrogen prevents inhibition of the fermentative processes which are essential for the cattle’s"

Pricing and Promotion
Pricing
The pricing of our microlens arrays will depend on the benefits, type of relation and the volumes. It is announced that the increased efficiency of the solar panels is the main benefit for the customer. Our goal is to get a strong buyer-supplier relationship with a limited number of customers or even one specific customer. We will use the pricing by customer benefit strategy to determine the selling price of the microlens arrays for every single customer.
Figure 5: Advantages and disadvantages for potential customers
As shown in Figure 5, the total benefits of the customer have to be larger than disadvantages. We will discuss with our potential customers in detail what the benefits for both parties could be. Our revenue model will be comparable to the brokerage fee model.  We will ask our customers a fixed price in order to cover the costs, plus a variable price. This variable price will be depending on the benefits of our customers. We aim to get a variable price that is equal to 30%-50% of the extra profit our customers make with the microlens array.
Promotion
BioLens is the result of an iGEM project. One of the main advantages is the fact that the iGEM team gets a lot of media attention. The project acquires the interest of a whole variety of newspapers, magazines and television programs. This makes the public aware of our project. It is important that they know what the benefits of our project are. As can be seen in the customers analysis, most end users would be interested in more environmentally produced solar panels, but it appears that most of them did not think about this before they became aware of our project. It is crucial that also the public becomes aware of our project. When they are interested in more environmentally produced solar panels, indirectly this forces producers to produce them in a more environmentally way.
Furthermore, it is important to promote our product to solar panel manufactures. We are a B2B company and direct promotion will be our main promotion activity. Just as we did for the customer analysis, we will talk to potential customers and show them our product. Eventually, the main goal of our promotion activities is off course to sell our product, but we also have a broader social purpose to make the people aware of the fact that production methods can have a significant influence on the environment.

Several other strategies have been tested, too. We have positive expectation especially on the engineering of LuxR protein.
Fiinally, we have provided 13 biobricks that will be useful in various future projects using cell-cell communications.
One of the technical challenge of our project was that the reporter genes are quite slow by itself to develop readable signal. There are significant time-lag between transcription initiation and the time the reporter start emitting the signal. We have screened many different reporters including lucifeases, lacZ, and other fluorescent proteins. With our experimental setup, they all looked more or less the same level (some were in the range of 30-60 mins in microscope, but all needed 90-120 mins to get visible by eye). For more precise PoPS analysis, we should have conduct blotting analysis, instead of fluorescent analysis.
Biological timer was previously designed by Missouri Miners (2007) . In their system, they feed arabinose (input signal) to the bacteria, which consume the signal molecule. Upon eating up the molecule, the bacteria will generate GFP, signaling that time is up. This system is clever in that one can freely set the timer by adjusting the amount of arabinose fed to the cells. Our approach is more to make a series of timers. Obvious drawback of this approach is that we have to make new timer for each and every applications. Good thing about our system is that once created, we can run several timers simultaneously in a single pot; Combinatorial use of biological timers with different delay time would allows us to sequential switching of various genes, enabling more sophisticated control of the biological processes.

Valencia,2010,Team:Valencia#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"p’s changes in proteic conformation and it is responsible for its prion behaviour. This domain is 114 amino acids long and has a high content in glutamine and asparagine. The middle region (M) provides a solubilizing and/or spacing function. Finally, the COOH-terminus (C) is responsible for the translation-termination activity.
File:Valencia prion sup35.jpg
In [PSI+] cells, most Sup35p is insoluble and nonfunctional, causing an increase in the translational read-through of stop codons. This trait is heritable because Sup35p in the amyloid state as every prion influences new Sup35p to adopt the same conformation and passes from mother cell to daughter. In [psi-] cells, the translation-termination factor Sup35p is soluble and functional.
Behaviour
Sup35p is a subunit of the translation termination complex. Its prionic nature has been proposed to have some effect on the stress response, as a possible mechanism to obtain modified genetic expression products. When the prionic conformation is activated, the termination of translation is less effective and thus new longer proteins form (True and Lindquist, 2000; Tyedmers et al., 2008). When the sequence corresponding to the NM domains of Sup35p is fused to other gene, the protein resulting of this construction acquires the prionic behaviour (Li and Lindquist, 2000).
On the other side, GR activates the transcription of genes preceded by GRE (Glucocorticoid Receptor Element) when steroid hormones are present (Heitzer et al., 2007). However, it becomes a constitutive transcription activator when it lacks its C terminal ligand-binding domain (Schena and Yamamoto, 1988). Because of the length of amino acids of the cut protein, this short version of GR is named GR526.
Li and Lindquist (2000) showed that the fused protein (NMGR526) is a functional constitutive transcription activator. In addition, when the prionic conformation is reached because of the presence of a certain stimulus, NMGR526 is no longer capable of inducing the activation of the gene preceded by GRE. Tyedmers et al. (2000) checked the conditions that trigger the prionic conformation and they found that heat shock is a significantly relevant factor. The cells in which the prionic conformation is induced, the process is promoted in an autocatalytic manner and all the protein is found in the prionic conformation. The cells resulting show the phenotype ["

General Support
Dr. Howard Salis and Dr. Tom Richard were our iGEM coordinators and were instrumental in development of the big ideas for our projects as well as with troubleshooting specific experiments.
Project Support and Advice
Chiam Yu Ng (graduate student) was an outstanding mentor, helping us to learn design strategies and develop a cloning plan to set our project into motion. When we ran into problems with cloning, Chiam Yu was very patient and helped us to optimize our experimental processes.
Another great asset to our project was Tian Tian (graduate student). Because of her desk’s proximity to Clay’s, she skillfully answered an almost constant stream of questions - on everything from optimizing PCR protocols to tips for plasmid prep.
Manish Kushwaha (post-doc), Iman Farasat (graduate student), Long Chen (graduate student) and Amin Espah Borujeni (graduate student) all provided critical tips for improving our cloning strategy, as well as assistance developing our programs to optimize the GFPs.
Iman Farasat and Dr. Salis were a big help to the Biodetoxification project. Iman assisted us with forming an experimental plan and ordering primers for Gibson Chew-Back Annealing Assembly. They both taught us how to perform a CBA and homologous recombination and offered advice during our project troubleshooting. Tian Tian, Chiam Yu Ng, Long Chen, Manish Kushwaha and Amin Espah Borujeni answered our random questions.
Fundraising Help and Advice
Dr. Tom Richard and Dr. Howard Salis took on the burden of finding funding for the undergrads, and we are sincerely thankful for their work.
Lab Support
We are very appreciative of being able to use Dr. Salis’s Lab space and materials. Iman and Chiam Yu were crucial in the wet-lab success of both projects.
Difficult Technique Support
When we experienced problems with a tricky inverse PCR, Chiam Yu helped us to uncover a critical error in one of our primers. Designing an RBS library with the constraints that were present in our constructs was very difficult and Iman helped"

Then we came up with an idea that we could build a platform, where we communicate the up to date findings of synthesis biology, which can give us some clues of the match. We discussed other practical issues concerns Human practice, digifax and the management of the team. Every team shared their experience and learned from each other, making this seminar so meaningful.

Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," error because each concentration measurement was an opportunity for contamination of the culture. Furthermore, we realized at this point that pro-leu is not a good choice for a protecting group because of its availability in the environment. For our biocontainment system to be effective, the organism must not be able to scavenge protected leucine from the environment, and as a dipeptide, pro-leu can be easily accessed from the breakdown of peptides. Intrinsic proteases can likely cleave pro-leu, too. Additional research also revealed that pro-leu is toxic to E. coli cells, so E. coli have evolved a mechanism to exocytose pro-leu. Thus, we abandoned the use of pro-leu for future experiments and tested N-moc-leu instead.
To confirm the results of the growth test using better experimental design, we decided to streak JW5807-2 cells on minimal medium agar plates of 5 different conditions:
Negative control with only minimal media agar
Positive control of minimal media agar + leucine
Minimal media agar + 3mM CBZ-leu
Minimal media agar + 8mM CBZ-leu
Minimal media agar + 8.8mM N-moc-leu
Growth on the plates were checked after 24 hours. Growth was present on the positive control plates containing leucine. There was no growth on the negative control plates or any of the experimental plates. The results from the N-moc-leu plates are shown in Figure 6. These results demonstrated that E. coli cells do not have an intrinsic cleavage mechanism for CBZ-leu or N-moc-leu and cannot use these protected forms of leucine for survival.
The top two enzyme choices, CBZ-leu and N-moc-leu, were presented to the modeling team who modeled mutagenesis of the leucyl-tRNA synthetase to best confer complementarity with the protected leucine in the catalytic site. Given the time restraints, the modeling team was only able to thoroughly obtain data for a synthetase that conferred complementarity with CBZ-leu. However, preliminary data from modeling with N-moc-leu indicated that it required fewer amino acid residue changes when compared to using CBZ-leu. Fewer amino acid residue changes allows for easier reversion of the mutant to the wild-type synthetase. Therefore, since we had better modeling data for CBZ-leu and modeling indicated that CBZ-leu was the more secure form of protected leucine for our biocontainment system, we opted"
