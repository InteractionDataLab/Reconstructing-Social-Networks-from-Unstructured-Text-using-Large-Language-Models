Harvard_BioDesign,2014,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," spontaneously forms a covalent bond with the SpyTag domain when the two come close enough to one another in solution.
Sensing promoters – thus far we have coupled expression of the CsgA variants to one inducuble promoter: LacZ. In the future we hope to include promoters induced by more interesting environmental conditions, like temperature or atmospheric chemical concentrations (i.e. carbon monoxide), so that the composition of the curli fibers produced by the bacteria will reflect such environmental conditions.
Materials and Methods
Genetic constructs were created by PCR cloning reactions, Gibson assembly reactions, and related protocols. CsgA production was monitored via Congo Red assays, and chromoprotein-CsgA association was determined by culturing both transgenic proteins together for 24 hours, subjecting the solution to SDS gel electrophoresis, and observing the resultant protein bands for conjugation between the SpyTag and SpyCatcher-associated proteins.
The Experiments
Congo red assays
Congo red is a secondary diazo dye with a high affinity to amyloid fibers. Congo red spin down assays were used to quantify curli fiber productio. 100uL of a .015% solution of Congo red is incubated with 1mL of LSR10 cells producing csgA constructs resuspended in PBS. LSR10 cells have cellulose production knocked out as not to interfere with the specificity of congo red binding. Cells are pelleted and supernatant transferred to a 96-well plate to measure absorbance at 490nm. Cells that express more CsgA pull down more congo red from the supernatant resulting in lower absorbance levels.
Gel shift assays
Chromoprotein engineered with spycatcher (mRFP-Spycatcher) was expressed in LSR10 cells, lysed, and purified using a Ni-NTA column. Cells producing WT-CsgA and CsgA-Spytag were sheared using a sonication probe and spun down to isolate CsgA in supernatant. Supernatant was incubated with crude cell lysate and purified mRFP-Spycatcher over night then run on an SDS-Page gel. We expect part of the mRFP-Spycatcher population to shift up when bound to CsgA-Spytag.
Colormetric assays
Chromoproteins obtained from Uppsala 2011 were mixed at different ratios to indicate that a range of distinguishable color gradients can be achieved to detect relative levels of input by eye using a chromoprotein-binding schematic with multiple affinities.

If anybody needed a graphic for their section, they came for me. Underneath all the colorful diagrams and cute infographics however, was a whole ton of stress and hard work, but I enjoyed it nonetheless!

We have also found articles that describe how GANs were used to generate novel anti-cancer drug molecules that were not tested before, and proven to be effective alter on.
Deep down we already knew the question we wanted to ask - can we generate novel enzymes using the Generative Adversarial Networks?
Setting the goals
Despite the recent success of GANs in various field, to the best of our knowledge, no one attempted to apply this novel technique to proteins. In a way, it can be explained by the great complexity of such task. In order to proceed, one would need to re-design the architecture of GAN networks that work well with images and audio, to architecture that works well with sequences of amino acids.
This is why we have decided to create the world first Generative Adversarial Networks for Enzymatic Sequence generation.
We believe that the development of such framework will facilitate the discovery of novel and useful enzymes and accelerate the field of synthetic biology and protein engineering immensely.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," one species node.
LSAS
Assume the network has m transitions, with depth d and breadth b from a specified root, and V vertices which represent the aforementioned condensed nodes (centered on operons), and E directed edges connecting said vertices.
The SBiDer search algorithm is a modified version of breadth first search where at each transition m that is activated by the input species set a breadth first search for the output species set is performed. For a standard breadth first search, the complexity is
BFS Complexity = O(|b|^|d|)
This is another way of saying that in the worst case, every vertex and every edge is explored, which can be rewritten in terms of the number of vertices and edges. Since all edges have weights of one, V and E will always be positive.
BFS Complexity = O(|V| + |E|) => O(V + E).
For this standard BFS, assuming a large network where every node is connected to every other node, for V significantly large, V ≈ V - 1, meaning the number of edges searched after the selection of each successive node is approximately equal to V, meaning the V nodes are searched V times. Additionally, consider that the total number of edges (E) in a completely connected graph is bound by V^2. In a completely connected graph (with no self or duplicate edges) with V nodes, the total number of edges is (V-1) + (V-2) + (V-3) + … + 2 + 1. It has been shown that the (V-1)th partial sum of this divergent series sums to [V*(V-1)]/2, which is bound by V^2. Therefore the upper bound for the time complexity for a single breadth first search from a single activated transition from an input species is O(V + E) ≤ O(V+V^2) => O(V^2).
For our network, a breadth first search of time complexity O(V^2) happens at every activated transition m.
Therefore, the LSAS complexity = O(mV^2)
Paths generated using the LSAS search would resemble Figure 2 where a species node directly activates an operon, which produces a singular species node. The LSAS algorithm would not be able to capture the logic encompassed within Figure 3 where multiple species nodes are required to activate the middle input transition.
NLSAS
For the NLSAS, a similar tree from LSAS is created for each activated input transition by the input species. However, the difference here lies in the construction of the"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified and assembled (for Pf ferritin and DPS, detailed assembly protocol can be found in Method ) proteins were incubated overnight with 100mM hydrazine, respectively, and hydrazine leftover was measured by adding 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and HCl to the system (for detailed protocol, see Method ). Sample N2H4·H2SO4 exhibited apparent color change and UV absorption at 454nm after such reaction (Figure 1). Significant decrease of hydrazine concentration was observed after overnight incubation with all 6 proteins. However, since CuCl2 was added in culture medium of CueO-expressing bacteria to help correct folding, and Cu2+ alone exhibited considerable catalytic activity, it was hard to measure the catalytic activity of CueO. As for urease, additional experiments showed that it was not as efficient as Pf ferritin and DPS (Figure 3). Therefore, we stopped with these two enzymes and focused on the other 4 proteins.
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7d/T--UCAS--Degradation_Fig1.png
We tested the catalytic kinetics of 3His, Degrado, Pf ferritin and DPS and found that the most efficient one was Pf ferritin (Figure 4). Unfortunately, even though Pf ferritin was already the most effcicient candidate for Hydrazine Dehydrogenase (HDH), it took about an hour to reduce the concentration of hydrazine from 100uM to 50Um, which was far from efficient in general sense. In future, we will introduce point mutations into these proteins to improve their catalytic efficiency, find more multiheme proteins and test their N2H4-oxidation activity, and try to express codon-optimized HDH in E. coli.
From ammonia(ammonium) to hydroxylamine
We cast our sight on AmoA, a membrane protein in Anammox, which was anticipated to transform ammonia into hydroxylamine. E. coli bearing AmoA was incubated overnight with 1mM NH4Cl at 37°C in a shaker. Since AmoA is a copper-containing protein, 100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernat"

ITU iGEM Team Part Collaboration
We had a Skype call with ITU iGEM team. We discussed about arranging a meetup, part characterization and about helping each other. They characterized our 2A peptide-sequenced trial part and they made 3D simulation of FimH protein. And we helped them with restriction ligation and cloning of their part, K2141002. We used pET28a(+) as a vector. Furthermore, we helped them with plasmid purification. Members of the team came to Ankara from İstanbul, and we had a meetup at 29th of August to exchange parts, and we had a fun time together.
International iGEM Protocols
This year, we wanted to translate the iGEM lab protocols into different languages in order to make them more understandable and easy to apply at lab. Therefore, we collaborated with the teams : XMU China , INSA Lyon , LMU & TU Munich , Tokyo Tech , Toulouse , TU Eindhoven, Groningen and asked them to translate specific lab protocols into their native language. They returned and we achieved our goal.
Our second aim was to enable the lab protocols more understandable for new or other iGEM teams as it would be a lot easier to understand and apply protocols in their native language rather than English.
At the end of our collaboration , we received  iGEM lab protocols translated in French, German , Chinese , Japanese , Turkish and Dutch. We hope our cooperation can help other iGEM teams with their work ; Also we would like to thank each team to collaborate with us, it was an incredible experience.

FimH binds naturally to the mannose sugar that is found on the surfaces of eukaryotic cells. Because of this ability it can also bind to the healthy cells so we started to work on a more specific binding to target only cancer cells.

The PCR for the preparation of MutB without thioredoxin was also repeated but again did not work.
MutB, BtuF and GlmS constructs:
To all three constructs a CACC(ATT) stop codon was added by PCR.
Week 4: GH, LK, IF, ME, TS, AB, MS
MutB, BtuF and GlmS constructs:
All constructs were amplified with new primers for the vector pBAD18. After gel extraction, double digestion and purification, GlmS and BtuF could be ligated in pBAD18. The constructs were then transformed into TOP10. For BtuF, no plasmids could be detected after plasmid preparation.
MutB construct:
pET101 with MutB was digested as a control and could be transformed into TOP10. After preparation, the DNA was sent in for sequencing.
MutB constructs from the lab:
Due to our difficulties with acquiring a correct MutB construct, we received old constructs from the lab. A plasmid preparation was performed for the samples PTM3A, PTM3B, PTML and PMB5.
BtuF construct:
pET101 with BtuF was digested as a control.
GlmS construct:
GlmS in pBAD202 was transformed into S. blattae and R. planticola. After plasmid preparation, only the plasmid from S. blattae could be digested and a glycerol stock prepared. For samples from R. planticola no plasmids could be detected.

UCSD_Software,2014,Team:UCSD Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", a similar tree from LSAS is created for each activated input transition by the input species. However, the difference here lies in the construction of the path from the input species to the output species. A special traceback algorithm is used to tie the output species to the input species creating a path that may resemble a subnetwork rather than a traditional linear path. This traceback algorithm is where the true complexity of this algorithm arises from.
Similar to LSAS, this algorithm also begins by constructing a subnetwork of paths that can lead to the output of interest from a specific input. This generates a list of edges to be used in the traceback algorithm. Assuming every edge could be explored, the algorithm runs in O(E) time. As shown for the LSAS algorithm, O(E) <= O(V^2), and also returns a list that will be explored also in O(E) size or O(V^2). Again, a new list is constructed for each potentially activated transition, thus giving this entire first step a run time complexity of O(m*V^2).
Now, for each of the O(m) list of edges constructed from the last step, a traceback algorithm is run for this path from the output species set to return a subnetwork of operons that could form a system that leads to the production of the desired output. From the desired output species, the traceback algorithm searches through the list of edges E to find the transitions for each operon contained in the path that produces the output species of interest. Since every transition in the set E must be checked, the algorithm runs in O(E) or O(V^2) time. At worst, every operon must be checked, resulting in a complexity of O(m*V^2) for this step.
Now, in order to determine which species were required to activate the operons now connected to the output species, the database of transitions is searched to identify which transitions will have to be activated. This search happens across an O(m) space for each of the O(V) operons that could be activating the output. Therefore, this next time step happens in O(mV) time. The first two steps together now will happen as O(m*(V2+mV)). At the end of these steps, the path now has O(m*V) species.
However, it is important to note here that at the step when possible operons are being explored, the search will have a time complexity of O(E), and will never happen more than O(m*V) times, which is the bound for the number of unique species in the system. For the following step,"

Repressors1, in red in the plots, represent LacI molecules, which become inactive if they are attached to IPTG. If the user adds IPTG to the cell he will able to inactivate lots of them. The monitors allow you to see online how many repressors are inactive.
Repressors2, in blue, represent c1ts repressors, which become unstable and “die” when the temperature is increased. If the user establishes the temperature at 42 degrees, repressors2 will start to disappear. The temperature effect tells us how many times faster the repressors2 disappear if the temperature is 42.
Repressors1 can attach to kind-2 promoters and repress them, blocking their transcription, and vice-versa. The number of repressor molecules that a promoter can admit can be chosen by the user (0 means no limit)
The amounts of all molecules (except RNA polymerases and ribosomes to simplify the simulation) decrease sharply to the half once the bacterium passes through a cell cycle. All free molecules move following the rules of the Brownian movement.
Extending the model
This model could become more complicated adding more and more details of the real biological system, but it would increase the complexity of it and so the ability of making simulations in a reasonable time. Some of the improvements that could be implemented without making the program much more complex is the strength of the SD or adding a cycle life to the ribosomes and the RNA polymerases. A more interesting improvement and still plausible could be representing the growth of the bacterium while the time goes by and the sharp decrease of the size to the half after the binary fission.

Figure 1: Schematic of the model system where both strains are immunized against common environmental phages and the abundance of one can be modulated by the addition of a control phage.
Mixed cultures are often used in bioprocessing, where the quality of the final product requires optimal strain balance. We realized that mixed cultures harbouring different CRISPR assemblies could be modulated by applying selective pressure against targeted strains via phage addition. This provides a novel opportunity for tuning bacterial consortia, directly applicable to industrial bioprocesses such as yogurt production that rely on mixed culture fermentation. Here, we develop deterministic and probabilistic models to provide a predictive framework for optimizing strain balance within mixed populations. We then extend this model to allow for optimization of product formation, such as flavouring of yogurt.
Our main objectives were to:

TecMonterrey_GDL,2018,Team:TecMonterrey GDL#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Information and awareness campaigns
Informative and awareness campaigns were carried out on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to publicize our project and the causes of it. One of the messages with greater relevance was achieved on twitter, to get an answer by an important independent politician (Pedro Kumamoto), as well as the interest of psychologist and experts, who expressed their interest to join the project. We obtained 51 RT and 138 likes.
On the other hand, the #ScienceEverywhere campaign was held, in which teams around  the world were invited to take a photo in a representative place in their city, putting on a sign the km of distance from their city to the Giant Jamboree. Response from 3 teams was obtained.
Asking the experts
Dr. Guapo is chief of neurosurgery at the High Specialty Regional Hospital of Bajio in León, Guanajuato. We decided to approach him to ask if there is a drug capable of modulating the mood via the gut, we also asked his opinion about LactobachilI. He told us, that right now there are no drugs capable of modulating the mood at a gastrointestinal level, however he told us, that there are drugs that act directly at brain level as selective inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, which are commonly used in the treatment of depression and anxiety. He considers interesting the idea of using a genetically modified probiotic to modulate the mood, that could be used as an adjuvant or maybe even as a preventive treatment.
He made clear the need to conduct several studies (clinical, toxicological and mutagenic), to prove the safety of Lactobachill in human beings, also since it would be a transgenic the requirements would be harder to accomplish He also recommended talking with a psychiatrist to broaden our perspective.
José Luis S. Roldán is a pediatrician graduated from the state of Mexico, with more than 25 years of experience in the health industry. We contacted him to know if there is a relationship between an unbalanced microbiota and an abnormal growth in pediatric patients. He told us that there is, in fact, an effect between an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome; there are repercussions in the immunological  system,  usually the presence of certain microorganisms stimulate the defense of the immune system, there are several  of them that inhibit the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, an example of those are the bacteria from lactobacillus genus, the  bacteria present in a children gut can make them more susceptible to diseases related to inflammatory processes in their older life"

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

CT33 is thus a 33 amino acid long protein, which needs a free C-terminal end in order to achieve a stabilized binding with 14-3-3. The N-terminus can be used to link other proteins to, which in our case is a Strep-tag® II.
The Signaling Components
In each construct we incorporated a fluorophore, to visualize the location of our proteins and to detect if the two constructs are in close proximity by measuring Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the proteins GFP and mCherry. [15]
GFP is a Green Fluorescent Protein that can be excitated with a wavelength of 395 nm and has an emission peak around 509 nm. mCherry is a very stable red fluorescent protein with can be excitated with a wavelength of 587 nm and has an emission peak around 610 nm. mCherry can also absorb light of a lower wavelength, for example that emitted by GFP, making GFP and mCherry a couple that can be used to detect FRET, even though it is not the most optimal couple. The reason we choose this couple instead of a combination of fluorophores with a more efficient FRET, is that GFP and mCherry are better if you want to localize the protein under a microscope.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.

Project Summary
The goal for this project is to identify the essential genes required for the function of the 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) catabolism pathway found in Cupriavidus basilensis.(1) Furfual and its derivatives are toxic byproducts of the pretreatment process used to produce biofuels from biomass. They inhibit microbial growth and fermentation yields. This pathway also functions in Pseudomonas putida but does not function in an industrially relevant organism like Escherichia coli. Determining the essential genes associated with this pathway would allow researchers to engineer E. coli to produce biofuels from biomass and has the potential to make biofuel production cost effective. Sugar is an expensive feedstock, but with the HMF pathway, fermentation bacteria could grow off of the toxins produced in pretreatment. This would also allow for harsher pretreatment conditions and result in higher biofuel yields. We planned to used a combinatorial gene knockdown method using deactivated Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9) and the CRISPR system. We would use a furfural assay to determine which constructs had stopped catabolizing furfural. Sequencing of these constructs would tell us which genes are being turned off, and which need to stay on for the pathway to continue functioning.
Current Status
Due to the large size of the dCas9 system (5.5 kb) and the HMF pathway (7.5 kb), we had significant difficulty producing plasmids with these components. The HMF pathway was successfully integrated to a broad host vector, but the dCas9 would not insert. We decided to insert these large systems into the genome of P. putida to alleviate the problems to due high base pair cloning and because P. putida is naturally resistant to several antibiotics, which made it unfeasible to insert multiple plasmids containing the dCas9 and HMF pathway. It is resistant"

Policy & Practice
Introduction
Policy&Practice is one of the most important activities for iGEM. It's a great opportunity to let the local people or local school know about what iGEM is and the meaning of iGEM's work. And it's also important to get some advice to optimize the existing ideas from the expert who concerned with synthetic biology. Through the activities, we also can make a lot of great communities and relationships.
Participation in the Genetics Society of Japan
In order to introduce about details and progress of our project to the experts of synthetic biology, we participated in the Genetics Society of Japan, which was held in Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology. Genetics Society of Japan is a society that aims to encourage research on genetics and spread the knowledge. Many other Japanese teams (e.g. KYOTO or UT-TOKYO) participated in this society, and we discussed about each projects. And we also learned about the development of rational and efficient gene construction methods, and the importance of modeling.
Poster session in open campus
In Gifu University, towards the local high school students and citizens, open campus is held in August every year. At this time, in order to get to know a lot of people about this project and principles of iGEM, we gave a presentation by using poster. Most of the participants were interested in that content, and listened to our explanation enthusiastically. Thus we succeeded to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology and life sciences to the general public.
Life Science Seminar for high school students
Education for high school students is important in the terms of development of future science technology. Therefore we conducted a seminar on iGEM and life science for students at the Toho high school and Meito high school. Through this activity, we could tell them the depth and fun of biology.

Collaboration work with other teams
Needless to say, in research, cooperation with others is essential. This is also true in iGEM activity. By working together with other teams, we can proceed our study smoother. We seek an practical application example of circular mRNA. As a result, we decided to plan the large-scale synthesis of metallothionein which is a project tool of Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology of this year, Metallothionein"

Collaboration with WHU-China                     and SDU-CHINA
Optogenetic tool has broad prospects on synthetic biology, and the CcaS-CcaR system, which is                     developed from cyanobacteria has made obvious achievements, thus more and more teams are                     willing to                     use this system in their own projects. In the past two years, we have spent a great deal of time                     using it in our projects and accumulated a lot of experience (see more information in our previous                     wikis). This year, we collaborated with WHU-China and SDU-CHINA who use this system in their projects and                     sharing the experience how we regulated the expression of CcaS and CcaR protein to control this                     optogenetic tool and what we achieved.
Experience sharing with Worldshaper-Wuhan
We cooperated with the high school team, Worldshaper-Wuhan. We shared some information about our                     project and had several discussions then determined to have an experiment about the lncRNA IL7-AS in multiple cell lines.                     LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which might be a potential diagnostic biomarker and                     therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma. Through this experiment, firstly, we want to know if                     the IL7-AS has tissue specificity to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy cells or not.                     Secondly, we want to explore its applicability for which this biomarker can be widely utilized to                     detect tumours. The Worldshaper-Wuhan team successfully demonstrated that IL7-AS has specificity and                     universality. There were significant expression differences among 293T (the healthy cell), 769-P                     (the adenocarcinoma cell) and 786-O (the adenocarcinoma cell) cell lines. The expression in 769-P                     and 786-O were higher than that of 293T, showing specificity and universality of IL7-AS. Through our                     team's suggestions and Worldshaper-Wuhan's experiment, their project improved and we also got a new                     biomarker                     and therapeutic target for future projects.
Help from NAU-CHINA
After the information we got from meetings and public investigation, we thought it’s                                 necessary to                                 enhance the targeting of engineered Salmonella we used, we designed a fuse                                "

We use C++ as our programming language, cmake to manage our project, git to reversion control , yacc and lex to build our model file input assistant tool, Qt4 to build the GUI, Oracle dbxml as our Database manager system. Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

LCG-UNAM-Mexico,2008,Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," coefficients of the equations are constant (so we don’t have compartmentalization).
The quantity of nickel used by the cell is negligible compared to the concentrations in and out of the cell. This means we don’t need to include an equation describing the change  in the Ni concentration due to cell consumption in the time used by the  experiment.1
The  production of RcnR, LuxR and AiiA is constitutive and their  concentrations have reached the steady state at the beginning of the  experiment.
NikABCDE will not play a role in our model. NikABCDE serves to import nickel to the cell, however it only works in  anaerobic conditions and our experiment will be made in aerobic  conditions. This therefore implies that the nickel import will only  take place by the unknown mechanism, which nonetheless is constant and  constitutive.1

Team Chalmers Gothenburg
As a new iGEM team we were searching for other iGEM teams to discuss our ideas and hear their experience. We contacted several teams that worked on projects related to our concept during previous years. We were really excited that all of these teams answer to our e-mails. Eventually, our biggest collaboration  has been with team Chalmers Gothenburg from Sweden.
Like us, team Chalmers Gothenburg is working with yeast mating pheromone pathway. Their project Study in Scarlet is focusing on detection of contamination using yeasts. See their wiki for more information.
We had several Skype meetings and exchanged many friendly and helpful e-mails. Team Chalmers Gothenburg showed deep interest in our simulator CeCe. Therefore, we decided to create a simulation of their contamination detection. See our Software wiki page or Chalmers Simulation wiki page to see this amazing simulation.
Members of Chalmers team also offered us to participate in their Multinational GMO survey. Together we collected 94 survey from general public (50 Czech and 44 Swedish) and 82 from biologist (63 Czech and 19 Swedish). See our Human Practice page and Chalmers Human Practise page for more information. We want to thank to team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of collected data and for providing us the results.

We helped out a few other universities too! We collaborated with the BU-Wellesley Software team to assist them in their goal of creating an ambient auxiliary system for the laboratory setting, by helping them bridge the designer and end-user gap. Their project, appropriately called "" Puppetshow ,"" aims to automate laboratory processes through the use of automated liquid-handling robots while preserving the sensibility and communicability of a human researcher. Wellesley students visited our lab twice and we provided them with information for the HCI (human-computer interaction) aspects of their project, including showing them the techniques used on our lab.
We also served as Beta testers for BU's software project, including providing a robot configuration for them and allowing them to install their software on our igem computer to get feedback from us. Finally, our team programmed a robot that was used to characterize parts made by the BU iGEM team.
Depicted above is the 2011 MIT iGEM team's addition to the DARPA funded robot in collaboration with BU. We programmed a user interface for the colony picker that can be found here . A video of one of our instructors using our interface to guide the robot can be found here . The scanner can also be used a 2D barcode scanner, thanks to a collaboration with Ginkgo that allowed us to port their technology to the scanner.
Human Practices
Synthetic Biology is a field that combines concepts and methods from a variety of scientific areas. This inherent inter-departmental attitude is what drives the innovation in synbio research. As a diverse group of students (with backgrounds in everything from physics to biology to computer science) this idea was central to our work as a team this summer. It was therefore important that we shared the concepts of synthetic biology with the greater Boston community to gather ideas from many different scientific perspectives and to share the spirit of collaboration with our neighbors.
We decided to reach out to our community with a basic two-week synthetic biology class and by collaborating with other iGEM teams to help them in their projects. Our goals for the class were not just to teach the basic laboratory techniques to those who wanted to learn, but to emphasize the diversity of the field, and the problems and possibilities that exist within synbio today.

They then used a FACS machine to analyse the fluorescence of 10,000 cells in 2 cultures of wild types cells, and 5 cultures of Top10 cells expressing deGFP. We then analysed the data to determine that approximately ~50% of cells in the culture were fluorescent (Figure 5).
Figure 5: Single cell data for E. coli cells expressing deGFP (collected by Exeter iGEM). Columns 1-6: cells expressing deGFP. Columns 7 and 8: wild type Top10 cells. Red parts of the bar are non-fluorescent cells, green parts are fluorescent cells.
Expression of deGFP in a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system was then tested. Commercial S30 cell free kits for circular DNA from Promega were used so that results could be easily compared between labs. Reactions were prepared as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a master mix for 10 reactions was prepared (200 μL S30 premix, 150 μL S30 extract, 25 μL amino acid mix minus leucine, 25 μL amino acid mix minus cysteine) and 40 μL was added to nine tubes. To three tubes 1.2 μg J23100-deGFP was added, and J23100-sfGFP plasmid DNA was added to a further three. All reactions were then made up to 50 μL with nuclease-free water and transferred to a 96-well plate. Reactions were incubated in a BMG Labtech Fluostar Optima plate-reader at 37oC with fluorescence readings (excitation 485 nm, emission 510 nm) every 15 mins. It was found that, as expected, expression of the J23100-deGFP construct showed fluorescence above background level (Figure 6). It was also found that expression of the J23100-sfGFP construct in a CFPS system results in higher levels of fluorescence than deGFP. Therefore, although deGFP may show improved expression in CFPS systems than other GFP variants, sfGFP still shows higher fluorescence levels.

We also used one of our parts to report low mir-21 concentration, which is also one of the prototype that our device can be used in real research program.

Best Education and Public Engagement Our team has devoted to the popularization of science! Inspired by a hot debate on transgenic technology and GMOs in China, in a year’s time, our team together held six successful lecture in our university to share     the basic knowledge of different areas of biology. All of these lectures were delivered by the leading scientists in these areas and this series of events has become the most influential lectures held by Chinese iGEM team.
This all comes from the shock that students in our university, who are supposed to be the most educated and intelligent students in China, lack the basic ideas about transgenic technology. However, we are not satisfied with our achievements on the campus.     We search places outside our university to make more difference. We worked hard to get the chance to give a speech to all the students in a high school. We explained the simple principle of GMO food to the passengers and handed out leaflets on the     street. We introduced our project to visitors in Shanghai Science&Technology Museum. We cannot list all the efforts we’ve made to get involved into this big issue, but we can prove that our sincerity do make a difference!

June 19th
The team spent the week designing some of the constructs, but also looking into the details of the MFC construction. We came together to make some decisions regarding the latter. We have established that, to allow the bacteria to create biofilms, it would be better to grow them in an anaerobic environment in the final MFC. However, for the initial experiments, we will use an aerobic environment. The two bacterial strains we will use are K12 and W3110, as they have been used with MFC before, are well characterised and easily available.
We also met Prof. Smith, to discuss about methods of isolating the peptide once it is produced, for part characterisation. We chose to put a flag tag on the peptide, to be identified with antibodies by western blot.
June 26th
During our supervisory meeting we talked about which vectors are best to be used for our constructs, and which constructs should be put on what vectors. We have discussed the advantages of pET vs PUC vectors and other possibilities proposed. We decided to go with the 3 vectors of the pET duet, which have different antibiotic resistance and have compatible origins of replication. We would use one for the gold recognition, one for mtr and one for the quorum sensing.
We also showed the supervisors our defined sequences, hoping we will soon order the sequences. We presented the techniques we are planning to use for every part, to characterise it (beta galactosidase assays). Also, the methods of assembly were presented to the supervisors (amplified insert assembly, which they were unfamiliar with, and the formerly proposed Gibson assembly). We received positive feedback on our choices.
An issue was raised regarding the way in which we would isolate peptides from cells, to assess their presence (since they are too small to be run on a gel). We chose to perfor, pull down assays. Defining sequences. To be expanded.
July 2nd
We had a small discussion with Dr. Thomas, about ordering the sequences. We went over all the designed sequences, verified restriction sites and are now preparing to submit the online order for the sequences. We have received the ordered consumables and are now ready to start working in the lab. Our meetings from now on will be administrative meetings and troubleshooting meetings.

While every citizen in Hong Kong is subject to the Ordinance, laboratories in Hong  Kong are to refer to the more detailed Guidelines on Biosafety in the Clinical  Laboratory (the Guidelines), a publication of the Centre of Health Protection  under the Department of Health. The full text of the Guidelines can be accessed here . As our laboratory was constructed and is operated by the university’s Division of Life Science, the design of the lab, as well as activities performed within the lab, adhere to the above Guidelines.
HKUST’s  HSEO
The creation and enforcement of safety regulations is handled by the university’s  Health, Safety & Environment Office (HSEO). The HSEO also acts in a support function to promote biosafety and other safe laboratory practices by providing safety training for staff and students.
Ideas for Safety Issues
Measures for promoting the biosafety of our biological system employed by our team this year are nothing revolutionary. But we hope that future teams developing a system for which production of a signalling biomolecule is the aim always make efforts to control dosage. Linking well-characterized promoters to toxin/anti-toxin ‘switches’ gives us greater control of dosage, allowing us to place a somewhat reliable and quantifiable upper limit on biomolecule production.
We did not find well-characterized inducible  promoters for B. subtilis on the Registry. Our team therefore hopes to add some useful data about candidate promoters selected for our employed  toxin/anti-toxin cassette. Furthermore, we strongly support efforts that seek to provide the synthetic biology community with more detailed knowledge on the transcriptional and translational efficiency of parts. Such knowledge would help the community employ more dosage-sensitive tools, increasing the  repertoire of biological machinery. This year’s (2012’s) Carnegie Mellon University iGEM team has been working on a non-invasive, non-destructive characterization system that may help us take steps toward this end. See their wiki here .

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

Box (E) and Box (F) are the same cells but without prior addition of RFP by rhamnose. They show no binding because fimH is not being induced.This part was sequenced however the output was not added to the parts registry because we believe the data to be of poor quality due to improper primer binding. However the order of the composite part was confirmed by detection of FimH in many of the sequence reads near the beginning while RFP was not detected in the start region.

Therefore, we turned to Pengfei Gu, part of the pHD program at Washington University in St. Louis. His research interests include metabolic biochemistry and DIY Biology processes. We thought that his familiarity with aligning research fields would definitely help narrow down our decision.
Exploration
Pengfei was impressed with the scope of our project and thought the use of xenobiotic compounds to prevent bacterial contamination was an idea that needed to be explored further. He believed that exporting the tagatose metabolism pathway to prevent contamination was a smart idea but we also had to choose the right organism to be able to have the most effective solution. He pointed out that many organisms possess biochemical pathways that utilize biomass and conversion into products that resemble biofuels . However, these native micro-organisms are often ineffective in industrial processes. Furthermore, these isolated strains typically suffer from a lack of genetic and molecular biology tools. These traits are often limited and regulated by complex cascades of cellular control, and some additional functions need to be added to produce an integrated, multifunctional biocatalyst.
Therefore, he proposed the following criteria for the ideal bioprocessing microbe:
Needs to be easily manipulated
Proven successful in an industrial setting and scale
Superior conversion yields
Deliberation
Pengfei suggested that using synthetic biology to discover interesting bio-mass degrading and biofuel-producing genes can be transferred into a genetically tractable organism. Keeping in mind that we planned to do a proof of concept (for either this year's project or future implementation), we wanted organisms that have had preliminary work done regarding tagatose metabolism. After some literature research, it seemed that E. coli would be the most ideal choice: key parts of its genome are well characterized and it has widespread tools for genetic manipulation. In addition, it is one of a few model species that can be used as a launching point for other scientists in the future.
In addition, the Joris Lab in Belgium had performed gene knockouts in E. coli and enabled them to be able to metabolize tagatose. As a result, the convenience of tools at our disposal convinced us that changing the feedstock to tagatose and exporting fermentation biochemical pathways in E. coli would be the primary aim of our project.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software#test_-_-_TEXT.html,"ature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all, synthetic biology is an emerging     research discipline and an industrial application area which is highly     promising. Secondly, redefinition of the terminology to build a standard     nomenclature is needed as some of the terms are prone to be used instead     of another causing problems related to misuse for the global communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which serves for the information exhibition and exchange globally.     For instance, there are obvious misunderstandings about the words which     are predominantly used for regulation process. We have noticed that,     the terms “inhibitor” and “repressor” are being used as equivocally     in the part information pages. Like the lactose inhibitor protein, a     widely used DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, that have been labeled     both as “inhibitor” and “repressor” at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory elements. To sum up, we investigated all input elements for     promoters and classify these elements in terms of their function, affect     and required input element for them. So, we suggest that terminology     used for regulation of transcription should be defined clearly on iGEM’s     website and correct use of terminology should be enforced.
The second group of parameters was collected under the title “Output”,     which refers to products of functional genes. In contradiction, the     term “reporter” has also been described within the same list. Reporters     are also genes whose products, can be used for screening as an output.     According to our group, the usage of the term “reporter” for genes is     unnecessary and cause extra complexity for information distribution     and gives rise to discrepancies. Instead of using the term “reporter”,     predefined “gene” description should be used for genes, which can function     as reporters. The special information which is related with the characteristic     of that gene should also be presented on part info web page.
Furthermore, the same terminology “reporter” was used for both atomic     parts and composite bio-bricks. Also the overall image descriptions     for these were defined as “reporters”. We want to point out that using     same nomenclature for both atomic genes and for whole functional constructs     contributes to the complexity and makes specific explorations difficult     through the Parts Registry. So, assigning “reporter” for both"

The Wetwork Begins
We began the arduous process of generating enough competent cells to last us for the entire project, and started planning some experiments and DNA synthesis orders. After DNA from James Slock arrived, we transformed it successfully into some HNS mutant strains and obtained glowing bacteria.
A Sneaky Holiday
We went to the Lake District.
The Wetwork Continues
We continued over the summer to construct various BioBricks, which can all be found on our BioBricks page. We used Gibson Assembly to construct a lot of the BioBricks we needed together. We also developed various tools to aid with this process, including Gibthon , the ligation calculator and a tool for converting BioBricks to GenBank format. For more details see the Notebook and these pages.
Thinking Outside the Box
Daisy Ginsberg ran a session for us, helping us to think about what a future lit by bioluminescence might look like - a very useful human practices exercise!
French TV
A French TV crew from the channel ARTE came and filmed us in the lab for use in a documentary they were making, and also filmed us discussing some of the human practices side of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Music Video
After finding Gibson Assembly so useful over the summer, to promote it and fulfill our longing to make a Cambridge iGEM band, we wrote and recorded a song about Gibson Assembly to the tune of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something. We had a lot of fun and the number of hits on the youtube video are slowly increasing. You can find the video here!

Dr. Kyle Watters
P.h.D
In the Doudna Lab, Kyle began by winning a grant in conjunction with labs from UCSF and Sandia National Labs as part of the DARPA SafeGenes program. As part of this effort, Kyle is researching new methods to discover anti-CRISPR proteins which has culminated in a paper in Science describing three new anti-CRISPR proteins capable of inhibiting Cas12a. He continues to search for additional anti-CRISPRs and study their mechanisms of action. With the help of Ask a Scientist program from innovative genomics institute  (IGI) , iGEM team was matched with Kyle who took time to mentor us throughout the project. iGEM CMUQ team met with Kyle over skype and communicated via email to discuss and confirm our gRNA sequences and to share the idea of our project as whole. We gained invaluable insight and tips from his expertise in Cas12a and CRISPR in general. Website.

The interview gave us significant insight on how unaware people in the region are of genetic diseases and an overview of the degree of relative consanguinity. We also learnt that there are very few laboratories, and almost no hospital that conduct neonates genetic screening. Hence, many suffer from symptoms for so long without knowing the underlying reason. For more details check the write-up.

We were given an insight on the current methods and tests to detect sickle cell anemia carriers (as well as SCA in babies, where the phenotype is often not present). The statistics from his experience as a practitioner in Sidra medicine further enhanced the purpose of our project and the need for a field-ready, non-invasive and affordable genetic (and bedside) screening. check the interview.

The Mine
The South West of England has a long and complicated mining history that only came to an end in very recent history. The remains of the old sites are still dotted around the region today and the entire scope of their legacy is still revealing itself now. Many areas in Cornwall and Devon are beginning to see the negative effects of the metal ions leaching into nearby waters.
Figure 1: Lagoon at Wheal Maid
The Consolidation Mine forms a part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site . After collapsing in 1992, it has been abandoned and currently contains approximately 220,000 m3 of mine waste. Numerous controlled water risk assessments show that the site is causing pollution of waters by leaching of arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, iron, lead, nickel and zinc through the lower lagoon (the site consists of two lagoons separated by three dams) into the St. Day stream. The stream is a tributary of the Carnon River, with potential to carry the harmful metals across Cornwall and even into the English Channel. The mine site is in a popular area for walkers and mountain bikers, whose inhalation, ingestion and dermal absorption pathways are under threat from the toxic contents of the body of water. Although the mine was proven to be a harmful site after an environmental quality inspection conducted by the Environment Agency in 2007, little progress has been made in decreasing its negative influence on the surrounding areas.
The current methods of purification of the mine’s waters are large scale, but inefficient. They rely on pumps located over 60m below the surface, transporting at least 110 litres a second to special tanks. Contaminated water is then treated with lime in order to neutralise its acidity and to precipitate out the metal salts. The waste products from this process are not recycled or cleaned but are essentially dumped into a lined hole in the ground. The operation costs the government about £1.5m  a year to run and the lime itself has to be"
Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html,"V protease. K1319013 + K1319008 did not reach a level of fluorescence as high as K1319013 + K1319008, however, the nearly 10-fold increase in fluorescence after induction is a clear indicator for the TEV protease cutting the fusion protein K1319013. The weaker fluorescence signal is probably due to a lower expression level of K1319013 in the cells compared to the expression level of K1319014.
The fluorescence results of K1319014 + K1319008 was used to fit our model to experimental data.
Summary
The double plasmid systems of K1319013 + K1319008 and K1319014 + K1319008 demonstrate the quenching ability of the REACh1 and REACh2 proteins as well as the funcionality of the TEV protease. The increase in fluorescence after induction with IPTG is based on a functional expression of the TEV protease which proceeds to cut the linker of the fusion protein already produced destroying the FRET system between GFP and its quencher and resulting in a strong fluorescence signal. Combined, this characterization is a validation of the functionality of the REACh1 protein ( K1319001 ), the REACh2 protein ( K1319002 ) and the TEV protease ( K1319004 ).
Determining the Quenching ability of REACh1 and REACh2
In order to further evaluate the quenching ability of the REACh1 and REACh2 constructs in the fusion proteins produced by K1319013 and K1319014, they were expressed alone without an IPTG inducible TEV protease. This eliminated the effect of a potential leakiness of the non induced promoter to reliably assess the quenching ability of the REACh1 and REACh2 proteins.
Comparison of K1319013 and K1319014 with I20260 and B0015
K1319013 and K1319014 show a severely reduced fluorescence compared to the positive control I20260.
In the previous experiment it was established that the fusion proteins K1319013 and K1319014 are expressed funtionally. K1319014 reached the same level of fluorescence as the positive control after being cut by the TEV protease. Therefore the reduced fluorescence in this experiment is completely attributable to the quenching of REACh1. The quenching reduces the fluorescence of GFP by a factor ~ 25 which means a quenching efficiency of ~ 96%!.

Our project has a potential application for future work on antibiotic resistance by understanding bacterial conjugation. Another potential application is in bacterial communication
52 teams have responded to the Macro-ethics email, and are willing to take part in our survey
To do:
We should make a plan for the laboratory work in case things go wrong
For the modelling, we should model parameter ratios rather then parameters
For the lock and key secondary structures, create a program that can automatically modify the sequence of a key to fit into a lock
Make the conjugation modelling compatible with the conjugation lab
Try to think how to incorporate the thermodynamic output from the hybridization mfold program to into the riboregulator Matlab script
22nd July 2009
Today our meeting focused on what we can do in terms of public relations. Some suggestions which came up included updating the first page of the Wiki so it will be more understandable to laymen. One analogy which was raised to simplify our project was that of relay race, where the torch is passed from one bacteria to another. We also decided to give our project a name related to this relay race idea. In addition, we discussed possible applications which we might have, since they would also help our PR. Two applications that were raised so far were:
Kill bacteria with messenger bacteria by conjugation - a problem that arises with antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections in people is that bacteria build resistance to antibiotics. Using a bacteria with a messenger plasmid, it would be possible to use conjugation to send a plasmid into another 'bad' bacteria and destroy it from the inside
Multi-tasking bacteria with temporal control of task performance - conjugation can be used to keep communication between bacteria networks. The messenger plasmid can be used as a signal to initiate a certain task in another bacteria, and after some time the bacteria will stop performing the task (by self-destruction of the messenger plasmid)
Yours in unity, TUD iGEM '09

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," multiplying the average oligopeptide length of 13 (2 to 25 AAs) by the calculated average MW of a single amino acid, resulting in MWoligo= 1779.72 g/mol. (11,12)  Since we have 10 g/L tryptone and 5 g/L yeast extract, this results in a 15 g/L mixture of AAs and oligopeptides. By assuming a 50/50 mass ratio of AAs and oligopeptides, so 7.5 grams of both, we could conclude the following concentrations with the average MW values:              cAAs = 0.05478 mol/L, coligo = 0.004214 mol/L.
We then took the average of these concentrations to estimate the concentration nutrients in the LB we used and thus in the nutrient rich layer we put on top of our patch: cnut = 0.029499 mol/L
Calculation 2
After calculating the concentration of nutrients in LB Broth (Miller) we of course want to put this into the model, however, we will need a diffusivity value for that. We came across an article by Polson, A. where he experimentally determined the diffusivity of several amino acids in water. (13) We will not elaborate on these values, but we took the averages for AAs that Polson, A. determined and took the average of these values to get an averaged diffusivity for AAs: D0,AAs = 7E-10 m2/s
.
Since we said that the mass ratio within the nutrients is 50% amino acids and 50% oligopeptides (see Calculation 1), we also have to determine a separate diffusivity value for oligopeptides. Since we calculated a plausible molecular weight for oligopeptides earlier (in Calculation 1), and with the knowledge that MW scales approximately with the diffusivity, we assumed that a molecule with similar MW as MWoligo had a similar diffusivity (7). We found a diffusivity value for the neuropeptide Cortistatin of rats with MWcorstatin = 1721.0 g/mol. So with MWoligo = 1779.72 g/mol, we determined the following: D0,oligo ≈ D0,corstatin = 3.70E-10 m2/s (14)
.
Just like the concentration of nutrients, we want the diffusivity of the nutrients to have one value and not be split up. So again we took the average, although we discussed"

Abstract
The first week one of our group should choose more than one hundred terminator sequences to be tested. The other group is to learn how to do experiment and design the lab protocol.
Week 1
8.01.2012-8.04.2012
8.01.2012
Paper Group:
1. We learned how to distinguish rho-dependent and rho-independent terminators.
2. We tried to design different terminators from one template so we can simplify the final analysis graph and we can find the relationship between energy and efficiency more clearly.
Lab Group:
1. We tried to make clear of what we need to do if we have got the sequence of the terminator.
2. After we understood the procedure of our experiment, we started to learn how to use these equipments. It was the first time we can touch these precise equipments so we felt excited.
8.02.2012
We contacted several companies to compare their DNA sequence prices and decided to make a purchase from Ying Jun with whom we came to an agreement of ￥1.5/bp. We have never negotiated with any company before. It was a really fantastic experience.
Here are our criteria for terminator selection:
1. It is not too long;
2. It does not have anti-loop;
3. It is a forward sequence.
We spared no pains in this effort-checking reference, searching the web, using web software, and getting advices from our advisor. Almost everyone stayed up late today.
Finally we found 12 terminators meet our requirements and made a synthesis of those sequences at the end.
8.03.2012
We add the restriction enzyme binding site sequences to terminators to generate a list of sequences, then submit the list to the manufacturer by the deadline.
Today is Friday, so we decided to take a break. We saw a movie together.
8.04.2012
Today is Saturday, our team went to the beach together to enjoy"

Basic Construct Design
All designed parts contain the same T7 promoter (BBa_I712074), medium strength ribosome binding site (RBS) (BBa_J61100), the coding sequence with special modifications (which will be explained further on), and double terminator (BBa_B0014).
P22
The coat protein from the Salmonella typhimuriam P22 bacteriophage produces one of the largest known capsids. It assembles from 420 copies of the coat protein and 100-300 copies of a scaffolding protein (SP) to form a PNC with a diameter of approximately 60nm (O’Neil et al., 2011; Parent et al., 2010). P22 is being preferentially used for our toolkit because of its large, hollow interior space that can accommodate larger cargos. Although this capsid protein has the ability to self-assemble, efficiency and stability of assembly is enhanced with the addition of the P22 SP (O’Neil et al., 2012; 2011). For our purposes, because the SP interacts with the P22 coat protein on the C-terminus, the SP has been truncated on the N-terminus and can be fused to protein cargos or other modifiers (O’Neil et al., 2011).  For VINCEnT, the P22 SP has been fused to our three cargos: Cas9, a super-folded GFP (sfGFP), and FitD to ensure encapsulation.
The first cargo, Cas9, is the DNA endonuclease specific to the CRISPR system. This RNA guided protein targets and cuts specific DNA sites for no- homologous end-joining or homology-directed repair. As a part of our collaboration with the University of Calgary iGEM team, we have encapsulated SP-Cas9 and their specific guide RNA within the P22 capsid to enhance delivery of their CRISPR system to eukaryotic cells. This construct was a generous gift from the Wiedenheft lab at the University of Montana (Qazi et al., 2016) and we are still in the process of BioBricking this part for the VINCEnT toolkit (all results were obtained with the gifted plasmids). This part also includes a hexamer Histidine tag for purification.
Our second cargo is the scaffolding protein attached to FitD, a molluscicidal toxin specific to Zebra and Quagga mussels."

Overpowering Obstructive Osmotic Stress
BBa_R0082 Testing
The OmpR promoter ( BBa_R0082 ) from 2004 Antiquity was the part we wanted for our osmotic stress sensing device. To test if this promoter works, we ligated BBa_R0082 with GFP reporter part, BBa_I13504 , downstream of the promoter        , transformed it in DH5-α, and measured the fluorescence with a plate reader after being grown in LB containing varying concentrations of NaCl.
Figure 3. Fluorescence of OmpR promoter-GFP DH5-α cultures when grown at varying concentrations of NaCl.
Fig. 3 shows that at after around OD = 0.2, fluorescence becomes higher in the cultures containing NaCl compared to the culture with no epinephrine with the exceptions of 0.2% and 0.4% NaCl. However at OD=0.5, the culture with 0.2% NaCl started to fluoresce more than the 0% culture.     Overall, the cultures containing 0.05% and 0.1% had the highest amount of fluorescence, suggesting that at around 0.05% - 0.1% or perhaps a lower NaCl concentration, the OmpR promoter is induced at its optimal strength."

Engineering a Biodetoxification Pathway
for Lignocellulosic Feedstock
Codon Optimization
Abstract
Biofuels can be produced from fermenting biomass by bacteria. However, biomass is tough to break down and requires costly pretreatment processes before it can be converted to fuel. Pretreatment produces toxic byproducts, including furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which will kill microbes. To solve this problem, we intend to engineer bacteria with a recently discovered metabolic pathway that consumes furfural and HMF. Koopman et. al. identified the six enzyme pathway from Cupriavidus basilensis and showed that it functions in Pseudomonas putida. In C. basilensis or P. putida, HMF can be used as the sole carbon source instead of costly sugar. However, this pathway does not function in Esherichia coli. Based on our recent experiments, the pathway also does not function in Pseudomonas fluorescens, a microbial relative of P. putida. We want to determine the genomic differences that allow the pathway to function in one organism versus another. We intend to do this using a novel approach, combinatorial dCas9 gene knockdown. The final objective of this research is to engineer the HMF pathway in E. coli and bring us one step closer to sustainable biofuels produced by bacteria.
Abstract
Codon level optimization of genes allows for fine tuning of expression due to differences in translational efficiency between degenerate codons. It is theorized that through this technique expression ceilings due to translation becoming the rate limiting step in protein synthesis can be lifted.  Traditional methods in E. coli rely on the preference for certain codons across the entire genome, yet this is not"

1.2 Trans-Esterification Reactions
The secondary structures, such as P6, formed by group I introns facilitates base pairing between the 5' end of the intron and the 3' end of the exon, as well as generates an internal guide sequence. Additionally, there is a pocket produced to encourage binding of the Guanosine cofactor. The Guanine nucleotide is placed on the first nucleotide of the intron. The 3'OH of Guanosine group nucleophilically attacks and cleaves the bond between the last nucleotide of the first exon and the first nucleotide of the 5' end of the intron; concurrently, trans-esterification occurs between the 3'OH and the 5'phosphorous from the 5' end of the intron. Subsequent conformational rearrangements ensure that the 3'OH of the first exon is placed in proximity of the 3' splice site. In this way, further trans-esterification reactions and splicing occurs.
Retreived June 21, 2011 from Self-Splicing RNAs [1] This diagram shows the trans-esterification reaction and splicing of group I introns from a sequence.
1.3 Fusion Proteins
Fusion proteins are combined forms of smaller protein subunits and are normally constructed at the DNA level by ligating portions of coding regions. A simple construction of traditional fusion protein involves inserting the target gene into a region of the cloned host gene. However, the subsequent project design, in its simple construction, interrupts the cloned protein with ribozyme sequences flanking a stop codon. The method proposed deals with excision and ligation at the RNA level, therefore, the unaltered DNA sequence does not code for a functional protein. The ligation of protein coding sequences can create functional fusion proteins for many applications including antibody or pesticide production; however, this method of production is limited to producing the same fusion protein each time since the sequence is not modified in between the transcription and translation phases of gene expression. One disadvantage of this is the resultant resistance of a pathogen to antibodies or a target organism to pesticides. For example, a specific pesticide (Cry toxin) may eventually not be effective to its target plant if subsequent plant generations inhibit its uptake, overproduce the sensitive antigen protein so that normal cellular function persists, reduce the ability of"

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA sequences     using standard Q30 filter reads (error rate: 10-2) [23] . In     agreement with that result, in an experiment carried out to detect     genomic variations in marine pests, Pochon (2013) was able to     detect one variant out of 150 wild-type sequences [24] .
Reading DNA has become increasingly more accurate. Schmidt     (2012) developed a method called Duplex Sequencing that uses both     strands of DNA to obtain a more precise consensus sequence yielding     an theoretical error of 3x10-10 [25] . That means that we could     transmit a message with a length in the order of gigabytes without     expecting any loss! On the other hand, that also means that they     allow a more precise measurement in decoy-spores mixtures, and a     1:150 spore:decoy ratio might be insufficient in the future. In     fact, using Duplex Sequencing they were able to identify one mutant     sequence per 10,000 wild-type molecules.
Integration in B. subtilis
The chassis B. subtilis 168
The key and message sequence are stored in Bacillus subtilis (B.     subtilis), a gram-positive, catalase positive bacteria, usually     found in soil and gastrointestinal tracts. This rod-shaped     bacterium is about 4-10  µm in length and has a diameter of about     0.25–1.0  µm [28] . The cell is heavily flagellated, allowing the     microbe to move quickly in liquid medium. It is one of the most     well studied gram-positive microbe, and is one of the widely     adopted model organism to study bacterial cell differentiation and     sporulation. These cells are amenable to a wide array of genetic     manipulations, and the ease of transformation has allowed B.     subtilis to be used for selective protein expression to suit our     requirements. Moreover, the integration of DNA sequences into its     genome is well known, which has been an alternative to using     plasmids. The process of integration is demonstrate in figure 8.

We adopted a number of strategies to extend the use of firefly luciferase:
Codon optimisation for increased light output
Use of a luciferin regenerating enzyme .
Mutagenesis to create a number of different colours

Overview
Formation
Whateversisome’s technology is based on using Carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment, as a tool for in vitro manufacturing. For this reason, studying its formation is fundamental for our work. In this section, we describe the carboxysome’s characteristics and the experiments we did in order to study its assembly.  We created a fusion protein between the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and one of the major shell proteins, csoS1A, of the Carboxysome. This was done with the objective of facilitate its observation under microscopy.
Introduction
Bacterial microcompatments (BMC) are protein aggregates that can generate a space or lumen isolated from the bacterial cytoplasm, where key metabolic processes occur (1) . Particularly, Carboxysome correspond to one of the microcompartments most studied and its structure is well known: is based on 12 to 15 proteins, the capsule and the ones associated with it, and the internal enzymes (2) .
The alpha Carboxysome from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus is a good model of study for many bacterial microcompartments. It has an icosahedral structure of about 80-150 nm (cross section) and its mass is close to 300 MDa (2) . Its main function is to be part of the metabolism associated with carbon fixation. Inside the carboxysome are the enzymes Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) and Ribulose -1,5 - Biphosphate Carboxylase / Oxygenase (RuBisCO). Both of them carry out their reactions (1,3) .
Another important feature of this BMC is that its heterologous expression in E. col has been achieved and the microcompartment has maintained its function both in vivo and in vitro (4) . This could be carried out thanks to the characterization of the Carboxysome operon, which contains all nine essential proteins for"

Human Colon Fluid Dynamics
Human Colon Fluid Dynamics
Our genetically engineered bacteria are supposed to navigate towards the cancerous tissue inside the large intestine via the gastrointestinal tract's chyme. As mentioned before, chyme is a fluid consisting of partly digested food flowing through the digestive tract. Thus, in order to determine the bacterial flow characteristics, a fluid dynamics analysis is mandatory.
GEOMETRY
Colon cancer constitutes one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, thus one could easily consider the importance of determining its morphology. More often than not, colorectal cancer emerges as a malignant transition of a polyp, therefore one could assume that they share their macroscopic geometry, particularly in the early stages.
In our Colon Cancer CFD model, we assumed that the polyp, which evolved to cancer, is found in the proximal ascending colon of the large intestine as it is one of the most common colon regions where carcinomas are found (together with the Sigmoid Colon). Thus, the geometry of our model represents the caecum and a major part of the ascending colon. The CAD file for the geometry was designed with the “Autodesk – Inventor Professional” software.
It contains 2D identical structures which were then revolved into 3D objects and unified as an assembly so that they form a 3D solid structure.  The round surface on the left of the solid represents the fluid inlet, thus it could be considered as the final part of the caecum
region close to the ileocecal sphincter. After the inlet, one could see the characteristic “curved cylindrical” shapes which represent the intestinal haustra. On the upper right side of the image is the fluid outlet which could be considered as the section close to the hepatic flexure which then continues to the transverse colon.
After the construction of the outer intestinal geometry, the geometry of the cancerous polyp was added to the structure. By adding a 2D sketch on a working plane parallel to one of the haustra and by constructing a mushroom-like shaped solid, we were able to design the tumor inside the colon.
The tumor is the blue object shown on the diagram. The solid which we created is very similar to the anatomical morphology of a"

Reactions and Mechanism
1.Mechanism
The model for enzyme action, first suggested by Brown and Henri but later established more thoroughly Michaelis and Menten, suggests the binding of free enzyme to the substrate forming a enzyme-substrate(ES) complex. This complex undergoes a transformation, releasing product and free enzyme. The free enzyme is then available for another round of binding to new substrate.
In the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions, the mechanism is often written as:
And the Michaelis-Menten equation is:
(2) Kinetics of multi substrates enzyme catalyzed reactions
We apply two mechanisms of kinetics of multi substrates enzyme catalyzed reactions to our modeling section, one is Theorell-Chance bi-bi (T-C bi-bi), the other is Ping-pong bi-bi.
Sequential bi-bi reaction means that all substrates must bind to the enzyme before any reaction takes place. Now we take two substrates as an example. In sequential bi-bi reaction, a ternary complex is formed when both substrates bind to the enzyme. But the complex is not steady and two products release after new covalent bonds are formed and old covalent bonds are broken in the complex.
Sequential bi-bi reaction can be random or ordered. The random sequential bi-bi means that any substrate can bind first to the enzyme and any product can release first. The ordered sequential bi-bi means that the substrates bind to the enzyme and the products release in a specific order.
T-C bi-bi reaction is a kind of the ordered sequential bi-bi reactions. Now we take two substrates as an example again. The characteristic of T-C bi-bi is that two products can release in a flash because of the extreme instability of the ternary complex. The allosteric process is not obvious.

Flyer of the ""Day of Synthetic Biology""
The main goal of the human practice task in the iGEM contest is to inform the public about the possibilities of the newly developed Synthetic Biology and to reduce distrust. So we thought about how we could reach many people and how we could encourage an open discussion about Synthetic Biology. The first question was of cause: how much does the public know about that topic? That is why we decided to prepare a survey and hand it out in Göttingen as well as distribute it through the internet.
Additionally we decided to organize a “Synthetic Biology information evening” on the 7th of September which should give general information as well as opposed opinions in order to reduce opposed sentiments and enable a forming of an objective view on that topic. But for an information evening of cause we need experts on the field of Synthetic Biology willing to present themselves, state their opinion and participate in a discussion.
Thus we started to invite experts with different fields of studies to be able to present a broad diversity of opinions and we are very glad that three speakers accepted our invitation!

Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," experiment, varying microcystin concentrations did not significantly affect any of our promoters, which we concluded to be due to the inability of the transporter to import the toxin into the cell.
Figure 4. Results of flow cytometry analysis. Effect of microcystin on yellow fluorescence production under different stress promoters in SS328-leu with and without (w/o) QDR2 transporter from VL3.
Discussion
We managed to prove that the transporter replacement had changed the phenotype of host cells through studying its catalase. This would support correct integration of the new transporters. Despite the phenotype change, the transporter did not seem to be functional based on flow cytometry experiments of microcystin induction. Therefore, it must be that the transporter affects catalase activity in some other way than through increasing microcystin transport.
The specific functions of VL3’s QDR2 transporter besides the capability to transport microcystin aren’t known, but it is possible that it does not have a similar H2O2 antiporter function as the corresponding transporter in our lab strain (SGD ID: S000001383). In this case it could be that replacing the transporter allows more H2O2 to accumulate inside the cell, which results in a higher catalase response. This might be the case if the VL3 transporter doesn’t perform similar functions in H2O2 transport. This response doesn’t require the new transporter to be functional, only that the original transporter in SS328-leu is not present anymore. The increased catalase activity in the presence of H2O2 in samples without microcystin also supports this theory. Integrating the transporter into a different locus in the genome or expressing it in a plasmid while leaving the original transporter intact would confirm this theory. In general, this might be a better option, as the removal of the original transporter creates an extra variable that makes the functional verification of the new transporter more difficult.
As we only had time to properly test the strep-tagged transporter variant, it is possible that the other variants would produce better results; the strep tag might interfere with transporter functionality or correct localization. A verification of the correct localization of transporter should be performed to confirm this, as we had planned to do by overexpressing the transporter under the GAL1 promoter.
In addition, it is also possible that the true, functional VL3 transporter has a leucine instead of an isoleucine as the single uncertain amino acid in its sequence. Although this is a small difference, it could nevertheless potentially prevent the transporter from functioning entirely as intended. If experiments could be"

Principle and Mechanism
   The population control system has three statuses:
      1. Reproduction status at 37°C in laboratory
      2. The self-maintain status.
      3. The self-destruction status by AHL administration
1. Reproduction status at 37°C in laboratory
   When bacterium grows in 37°C, the constitutive promoter transcript tetR repressor inactivates the promoter Ptet (BBa_R0040) on strand C, subsequently LuxI andLuxR protein are not transcribed. Accordingly, the population control system is not activated during bacterium growth. This design allows us to amplify the terminators without any potential limiting factors.
Fig. 2:The  reproduction status when bacterium grows  at higher than 37°C.
 
2. The self-maintain status
   When the Terminators are released in the environment at room temperature, the promoter Ptet promoter transcribes the LuxI and LuxR protein.  LuxI protein converts S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) into acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). When external bacteria aggregate, the concentration of AHL will rise pass threshold level and resulting the formation of AHL-LuxR complexes. This complex then becomes a translation factor to Plux (BBa_R0062) promoter and expression of downstream ccdB gene is activated. Accumulation of ccdB protein result in ccdB production and subsequent suicide. Therefore, when the population size of E. coli rises pass the threshold level, ccdB proteins are induced by AHL to restrict the population size (Fig. 4).
Fig.3: The self-maintain status when bacterium grows at less than 37°C.
Fig.4: The simulation result of the self-maintain status. When the population size of E. coli rises to the threshold level, ccdB proteins are induced by AHL to restrict the the population size.
3. The self-destruction status by AHL administration
   After Mosquito Intelligent Terminators have served its purpose, we can manually kill all Terminators by spraying AHL to induce self-destruction. LuxR is a constitutively expressed protein that can bind AHL, which together form a complex activating Plux. ccdB's are produced after Plux is activated and when in combination results in E. coli self-destruction.

Our proposal
There is a worldwide rising concern about air pollution. 2016 WHO report estimates that 6.5 million people died from air pollution-related diseases in 2012. Outdoor air pollution is broadcasted, but household air pollution is less publicized but unfortunately not less deadly. There are many sources of indoor pollution in the domestic setting: smoking, cooking, aerosol cans, paint, etc. These sources produce organic volatile compounds which are among the most dangerous pollutants. Those compounds induce pathological disorders (cardiovascular, cerebral vascular accidents, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer …). We worked on a solution called æther to avoid the accumulation of pollutants in the domestic setting where most people spend about 80% of their time.
Using a sustainable developmental approach, we worked on a compact scalable biomimetic device. Our solution differs from existing air purifiers through three assets:
- it will be energetically autonomous (no battery, no plug);
- not only will it trap the pollutants, but it will also degrade them. Existing devices often move the problem, as the pollutants are trapped and accumulated but not degraded;
- the device will be a DIY kit based on simple material.
By doing so, we hope to make an affordable and user-friendly device which will actually be used by people all around the world, unlike existing air purifiers. Indeed existing tools represent a niche market for now, as they are very expensive.
Our device also includes a web application, whose functions are as follows:
- Allow a better targeting of the filter according to the pollutants present in the consumer's home;
- Allow the management of the life of the filters;
- Raise awareness on good behavior to limit indoor pollution in the household (ventilation, materials to avoid ...)
This breakthrough air purifier is called aether in reference to the Greek goddess Aether who personifies Heaven in its upper parts, where the air is warmer and entirely pure. We conceived aether and thought it out like a real ecosystem. Indeed, we imagined the life cycle of our product from its conception up to the"
