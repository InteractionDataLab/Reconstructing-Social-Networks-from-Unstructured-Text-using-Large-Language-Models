Summary
PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology in order to replicate target DNA fragments. Through the use of specific primers, polymerases, and temperature cycling, exponential replicas of the target DNA fragment can be made. These fragments can then be ligated into plasmids and transformed into bacteria.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform PCR. A solution containing the required substrates for PCR is flowed into the chip and through a mixer, on top of chip a heating element will be placed. The valves at both ends of the mixer are closed, isolating the mixture, and then the heating element performs temperature cycling. The liquid is then pushed out into an output receptacle for future use in the lab.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

Producer cells were harvested and together with the culture supernatant subjected to four cycles of freeze and thaw cell lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes and concentrated in a VivaSpin VS2002 column with 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off to yield two milliliters. Genomic DNA attached to the virus particles was degraded using 250 units of Benzonase (EC 3.1.30.2, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for one hour. The concentrated cell lysate was washed three times with 4 ml 20 mM bis-Tris buffer pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl. From this concentrated sample, 500 µl were loaded on the ÄKTA purifier (GE Healthcare) equipped with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). This purification is also described by Smith et al. (2003). Fractions around the void volume giving a UV absorbance peak were pooled and applied to a Amicon Ultra column (Millipore, size limit 100 kDa, 2 ml loading volume) and concentrated to 500 µl. This purified virus sample was washed four times with 10 mM Tris-buffer pH 8.0 buffer which is recommended for the BirA biotin ligase that was kindly provided by Avidity LCC (Colorado, USA).
The BAP-containing viral vector sample (500 µl) was mixed according to the manufacturer protocol with each 72 µl Biomix A, Biomix B and Biotin. To reach maximal biotinylation, a volume of 5 µl containing 25000 units of the biotin ligase BirA was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 6 h at 30 °C. In order to remove unbound biotin, the biotinylated viral vectors were washed five times with 10 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0.
Biotinylation was verified with an ELISA as depicted in figure A. For the detection of successfully biotinylated viral vectors, MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated with 200 ng monoclonal A20 antibody per well for eight hours at 4°C, and blocked over night with PBST + 0.5 % BSA. This plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 µl of serial diluted viral vectors. After washing the plates three times, the recommended"

One can see a light band at 10 kDa in the slope Red ind. and Red ind. > 10 kDa, which could be the antitoxin mazE. Slope Blue ind. and Blue >10 kDa also show a light band at 10 kDa, this could be the toxin ccdB. At ~25 kDa there should be chromoprotein red and chromoprotein blue, but there´s not a clearly band to see. This is curious because cells that were used for protein isolation were very red and blue. There´s a dark band at ~30 kDa in the slope Blue ind. and Blue ind. >10 which could be DAM methylase. MazF and ccdA had to be under 10 kDa, but there was no band to see. In slope Red ind. < 10 kDa and Blue ind. < 10 kDa there´s no band to see. Reason for that could be the method we tried to isolate proteins that were smaller than 10 kDa. Therefore we used Sarsted centrifugal concentrators to get proteins smaller than 10 kDa, like ccdA or mazF. Unfortunately, it didn´t work.
Because of the fact, that we got in the tenth week Red_mazF with the right insert in our transformants, we decided to control the transformants of this week again. So we looked up for the right plates, picked eight red colonies, streaked them out, made an ONC and cut it with EcoRI. Then we performed a agrose-gel electrophoresis and surprisingly some of these colonies showed the right band size (Fig. 25).
Figure 25: Agarose Gel of eight different Red_mazF colonies from plate X, cut with EcorI. Standard: GeneRulerTM 1 kb DNA Ladder.
Six out of eight colonies showed the right bands (~4000 bp and ~1000 bp). Clone 6 and clone 7 only show one band at ~4000 bp. Seems like there was no insert in these clones. The correct red one was streaked out again (Fig. 26).

Picture of an agarose gel electrophoresis loaded with our pNZ124-T vector. The band is higher than expected but we were able to amplify the vector in E. coli.
To introduce our targets for overexpression into L. johnsonii we planned to use the pNZ124 shuttle vector. We were able to ligate it from IDT part sequences and expressed it succesfully in E. coli. Before cloning the enzymes into the vector we introduced a terminator general terminator sequence right after the multiple cloning site (MCS). In Figure 1 a linearized terminator containing vector (pNZ124-T) can be seen. The expected length of the pNZ124-T is 2866 bp. In Figure 1 its band is higher than expected but it seems to be a suitable vector as it provides an antibiotic resistance to E. coli.
We were able to confirm some of our parts via analytical digest followed by an agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2). Some of those parts were additionally approved by sequencing. These parts were Phosphofructokinase and Ketohexokinase, as well as the parts PezT, the zinc fingers ZF ZFN-L, ZF K230R, ZF-C7C7 and the composite part Kill1 of our side project Clone Wars.

Fructose test
The first Results of Absportion
To prove the affinity of our assay for fructose we had to test various parameters. We were interested in the general sensitivity of the indole reaction. So we generated a calibration curve from fructose in water. This was our starting point.  But since the MRS Broth contains a huge amount of glucose that not necessarily will be metabolized there is the potential problem of interference due to chemical similarity.
To disprove this we also made several conjugations of glucose and fructose in water in different concentrations and measured them. It seems like in water there would be a sufficient accuracy in our assay up to a 40 fold excess of glucose. But we were not"

Our plan was to test our constructs this way, but create BioBrick RFC 10 compatible parts for shipping to the registry. However, because of the issue of optimal eukaryotic translation initiation, we find the BioBrick assembly standard to be inconvenient for yeast BioBricks and protein expression in yeast.
About our final design
Cyanobacteria release their toxins only when they die and lyse. This poses a problem if one would add only microcystinase in water containing cyanobacteria and their toxins; the enzyme would only degrade the toxins that are floating freely in the water, but the toxins inside the intact bacteria would remain whole and potentially cause harm when the water is used. This is why the bacteria should also be lysed to ensure that all possible microcystin is available for the MlrA to be degraded. Based on the Peking 2014 project, hen egg lysozyme could be used to lyse the peptidoglycan cell walls of the cyanobacteria. Our idea is to use the same lysozyme from a commercially available source, at a low concentration so that it is safe for the user. In contrast to the Peking 2014 project, our enzyme capsule is designed for a much smaller volume of water and we expect it to be more productive. As the capsule is designed only for small volumes of water, the amount of lysozyme wouldn’t be harmful even if it ends up in the environment.
Our final product would thus be a capsule composed of microcystinase which we have expressed and purified, and lysozyme. Our product would be used only for relatively small volumes of water, i.e. it would not be used to e.g. purify a whole lake or make water drinkable, but only to detoxify a bucket of water used for recreational activities. From the degradation activity measurements, we would be able to calculate the amounts of MlrA needed to degrade a certain amount of MC-LR.
“ In order to find the conditions where the enzyme is produced best, we designed three different variants of the enzyme ”

The Signalling Cascade
Protein  hoxB and hoxC form a Heterodimeric core(RH) they acts as an hydrogen sensor in  concert with the histidine protein kinase HoxJ . This RH-HoxJ (hoxBC-hoxJ) complex  detects the presence of hydrogen in the environment and transmits the signal to  a response regulator HoxA. The response regulator, HoxA, is active in its  non-phosphorylated form and inactivated by HoxJ-mediated phosphorylation. In  the hydrogen atmosphere, HoxA is dephosphorylated and interacts with a promotor  hoxP, and it is capable of activating downstream gfp gene transcription.
Thus,  our key assumptions for interactions among proteins are:
1.Ignoring the procession of hoxB hoxC and  hoxJ combination.
2. the Law of Mass Action  kinetics is suitable for Hydrogen detection.
3. the Law of  Michaelis–Menten kinetics is suitable for hoxBC-hoxJ catalyst.
4.Because HoxA has been phosphorylated as soon as it’s translated, we assume  there is only hoxA-P before hydrogen induces dephosphorization.
Signalling Kinetics
In  cell signalling, molecule Hydrogen binds to their receptor sites hoxBC-hoxJ  which triggers a conformational change in the receptor. The donor bind to their  receptors with varying rates and affinities depending on the molecules  involved.
We model this rate using the Law of Mass Action kinetics. This principle  governs that the rate of a reaction (d/dt) is proportional to the  concentrations of the substrates [2].
For a particular reaction, for example:
the rate can be written mathematically as:
But most biological reactions are  reversible, so
Applying these principles to the  interaction between hoxBC-hoxJ and Hydrogen yields:

Hi everyone!!!
We are team iBB from the University of Pune. Our institute is a center for excellence in research in biotechnology.
Our iGEM Team consists of 7 undergrads and 2 advisors.

The IBB iGEM story
It all began in July 2008 when Samit read about iGEM and the whole idea fascinated him...it remained a topic of hot discussions and really intense brainstorming in IBB for months together until it slowly waned away due to the exams and normal curriculum.....people forgot what iGEM was until the day a mail was received by Mandar about the registration, and as always the IBB trio; Mandar, Swetha and Samit started the registration process at the eleventh hour....The task was tedious and tiring and there was a lot of red tapism they had to go through... finally the hard work paid off... And IBB got into iGEM.....
Wish us luck!

Hong_Kong_HKU,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#kr_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology all round the world. This map was created at the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
On the map, 5 entries are located in South Korea. Three of them, two universities and one company, are near or in Daejeon, and two universities are located in Ulsan. This map may not depict an accurate picture of synthetic biology in Korea because some institutes such as Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology are not listed in the map. This may be due to the fact that information for the map is gathered from official websites, scientific literature, government reports, and journals etc. If the available information was not in English, it could have been hard for the organization to compile the data (""Synthetic biology project,"" ).
Nevertheless, the growth of synthetic biology in South Korea is still somewhat represented by the map. It had no entries for South Korea in 2009, but that has increased to five entries this year.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Not many Korean universities have been participating in the iGEM competition. From 2004 to 2012, only four Korean universities participated in the competition. Considering that there are 203 universities listed in the Korean Council for University Education website, 4 out of 203 universities is in fact a small proportion (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
The four universities are Chungbuk National University (CBNU), Korea University, Korea Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST) , Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology. Sogang University registered in 2012, but withdrew from the competition (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
Out of the four universities CBNU has been most actively participating in the competition. It was the first Korean university and also one of the first Asian universities to participate. They first entered the iGEM competition in 2006, but did not participate again until 2009. They have participated every subsequent year. Korea University joined the competition in 2009 and KAIST in 2010, and both have competed regularly since. UNIST competed in 2011 and did not return the following year (""Synthetic biology based,"" ).
Biotechnology Industry
A survey about biotechnology market in Korea published by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, and Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization was available on-line. The statistics provided in the review may not relate directly to synthetic biology, but could provide some insight on the potential development of synthetic biology considering the fact that synthetic biology has wide applications in biotechnology industries (Hranueli, 2013).

Education and Public Engagement
The Exeter iGEM team firmly believe that education and public engagement should not be overlooked. Making the sciences more accessible to the public is important if we are to promote responsible research and inspire the next generation of scientists, as well as increase awareness for important topics. As such, we have devoted a lot of time to engaging with the public and creating a dialogue directly through the creation of an app as well as giving multiple lectures and talks on our project and the importance of responsible research. Speaking with academics after presenting at Exeter University's CLES-CON, and with other teams while representing at a UK iGEM meet-up allowed for more in depth discussion of these issues.
The App
We wanted to convey the principles of our project to the general public in a fun, visual and interactive way.    Given that a high proportion of our team members have programming experience, we decided that the most natural and time efficient way of implementing this would be in the form of an app.    The app is a game where the player experiences life as one of our modified bacteria; collecting ions from the water in order to gain points. If you are interested in playing this game for yourself, it can be found on the Play Store from this link: Pili+
Purpose
The primary purpose of this app is to aid in explaining and visualising our project.    In addition to this, the app also serves to educate and inspire people on the topic of synthetic biology.    This is achieved through the use of “fun facts” which pop up on the screen whenever the player starts the game.
Evolution and Feedback
The app has changed significantly since it started development, being influenced heavily by feedback from within the team, academics outside the team, and members of the general public.     Initially the app was intended simply as a device for increasing awareness and understanding of our project, but after some discussion it became apparent that it could be a good opportunity to promote synthetic biology in general.     In response to this, an interesting biology or genetics fact pops up every time"

He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.
Fengzhi LI
The one who thinks differently.
Fengzhi is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Technology in UCAS.
He participated in both China National Biology Olympiad and National Olympiad"

Overview of Bacterial Therapeutics
Currently in the field of medicine, groundbreaking approaches to therapeutics are continually being developed.  With the advent of synthetic biology, bacterial therapy is rapidly emerging as a promising source of therapeutic potential for many diseases, especially cancer. Consequently, bacteria can actually be seen as the ideal vector for the production and delivery of drugs for many diseases.
Why Bacteria are Ideal
One reason bacterial therapies have been proven to be better than many existing therapies is due to the fact that many bacteria already exist in a commensal or even mutualistic relationship with the human body. The reason this serves as an important advantage over other options is that it lessens the chance of a harmful response from the immune system. Introducing foreign entities into the body reduces the chance that the therapy would continue to work after a long period of time, since the body's defense mechanisms would kick in. This is exactly why working with or engineering strains that are part of the various microbiomes of the human body would be ideal. Escherichia coli is an example of a commensal bacteria in the gut that has been engineered to treat cholera. Scientists have managed to program E. coli to express cholera autoinducer 2 (CAI-2), inhabit the gut, and effectively block the quorum sensing system that cholera bacteria use to propagate disease in the gut [1].  Another example of this has been through engineering Lactobacillus L. jensenii, a vaginal strain to produce anti-HIV proteins to serve as a preventive measure again HIV [2].
Another feature that makes bacteria optimal is that they already contain compounds and metabolic pathways that can release or produce drugs. As a result, this helps reduce costs for extra materials by utilizing natural processes. Complete chemical synthesis is very costly, so any efforts that can harness the biosynthetic processes are greatly preferred."

Community Communication
After hearing the community's concern about Biotechnology, we held two lectures to clear their prejudice. Meanwhile, we printed 80 booklets to expand publicity.
In China, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains unknown. Though the question is really hard to confirm, many Chinese have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of Biotechnology, introducing the development Synthetic Biology, the stereotype phenomenon and the great biological applications that have been great contributions.
Then we printed 80 booklets which listed the argument on transgenic and the great biological applications.
What deserves to be mentioned is that most participants of our human practice is from College of Information Technology and we had a wonderful communication through the human practice. They asked us many questions and we also got some inspirations from them. What impressed us most is that a student from department of computer told us that the circuit switching and packet switching in computer network when transmitting information. We got a great inspiration from his words after we asked him for details about the two terms. Then we thought that circuit switching is that transmitting all information through a certain line but the packet switching is that dividing the information into pieces and transmitting different pieces through different lines. Both of the two methods have merits and demerits. Then we thought that why we could not combine both of them and then we designed our experiments that transmitting all information through two certain lines respectively in order to reduce the noises and uncertainty. And the experiments confirmed our views in some degree.
So you can see that we had a very successful human practice and we applied what we got from human practice into our experiments successfully. It helped with our project greatly and met the requirement of gold medal undoubtedly."

David Barilla
You will never meet a kinder, more loyal man than Mr. David Barilla. Although he was extremely busy balancing work, iGEM, and family - he always made time to come to NAIT everyday and work on our project - even if that meant losing precious sleep and workout time.
In our team, David spearheaded the documentation of our experiments and protocols; kept us all grounded and sane; wrote SOPs and logbooks; developed our modified silver stain protocol; and helped in the lab to run experiments (plasmid precipitation, cloning, and mini-prep among many) with Eduardo. David even went as far as learning to code HTML to try and share the load with his more computer savvy team mates.
""Best friends are people who make your problems their problems, just so you don't have to go through it alone."" There is no better way to describe David. He always knows the right thing to say to bring a smile to everyone's face. He has an amazing sense of humor but also knows when to get down to business. Thank you, David. The summer has been an absolutely amazing experience with you in the lab! We will always treasure your random bursts of classic rock and even your incredible (yet sometimes outrageous) ideas.
Johannes Coomansingh
Joe is the light of our team. His incredible sense of optimism has really helped our team stay positive throughout all the speed bumps of our project. Without Johannes to brighten our lab days with his ramblings and non sequiturs, our iGEM journey would have been much more stressful. Thankfully, he was present everyday to keep us lighthearted.
Joe really is Mr. Congeniality. As our ""HR Guy"" he has really gone above and beyond all of our expectations. Throughout the project, Joe was our public voice and was in charge of all external relations such as collaborations, looking for sponsorship and even managing our Twitter account. In addition to public relations, Joe was also heavily involved in lab work. He assisted David in developing our silver stain protocol and helped develop our experimental design with Mattéa.
A day without our friend Joe is very quiet, and almost lonely. His presence (and sneeze) fills the entire room with a kind of light and positivity that many people lack or take for granted. Joe has the ability to see the silver lining in the darkest storm cloud and for that, we are very thankful. Thank you, Joe! May your"

Both the isolation method and the RPA and in vitro transcription reaction were tested on pSB1T3 in DH5-α at 22 °C. To assess the sensitivity of the method, different dilutions of DH5-α transformed with pSB1T3 were prepared in milk. The dilutions are indicated per lane.
Combining Cas13a with our sample preparation
The sample preparation is required to obtain the target for Cas13a. Therefore, It is important to find out if, with the current sample preparation, Cas13a is able to recognise the target and will engage in collateral cleavage. To check whether or not Cas13a gets activated by our prepared sample, we used one of our purified RNA samples in the Cas13a activity assay. As can be seen in Figure 16, our Cas13a was activated by our target. This demonstrates that we successfully prepared the sample in such a way that the target became available for Cas13a to detect.
Figure 16: Cas13a assay with target RNA extracted with our boiling DNA isolation method. (blue) Cas13a with crRNA and target isolated from artificially contaminated milk, containing bacteria with the tetracycline resistance gene. (yellow) Cas13a with crRNA and target isolated from milk without bacteria containing the tetracycline resistance gene. (red) Cas13a without crRNA and without target.
Applying the sample preparation to a biological sample
We wanted to test if our sample preparation could be applied on a biological sample, without knowing the sequence beforehand. We decided to validate our sample preparation on mastitis. While talking to veterinarian experts in our Integrated Human Practices , we discovered that detecting multi resistance genes such as blaZ and mecA would be most relevant. We used our ‘ motif finder ' to find all the conserved regions of blaZ. On these regions, we designed primers for RPA. We wanted to test if our motif finder would work in practice; ie. that the designed primers would bind to the unknown genome of any pathogen containing the blaZ-gene. We were happy to receive three isolates from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research in Lelystad; one was confirmed to contain the blaZ-gene, the other two isolates most likely contained the blaZ-gene as well. The exact sequences of the strains were not provided.
First of all, we wanted to test if our primers would anneal to the unknown genome of the isolates, which most likely contained a variant"

Por que escolheu uma carreira científica? Como sempre estudei em escola pública, quase não tive professor de física. Existe uma carência absurda de professor de física e química no ensino médio de escola pública. Então, durante o primeiro colegial tive um professor de física. No segundo colegial não tive nenhum professor de física... era sempre algum substituto. Mas, normalmente, eles não ministravam aula de física. Fiquei 'frustrada' com isso durante um tempo, e a minha ideia de fazer física, naquela época, era para suprir essa carência. Why did you choose a scientific career? Since I have always studied in public school, I almost never had a physics teacher. There is an absurd shortage of physics and chemistry teachers at high school in public schools. During my freshman’s year I had a physics teacher.  At my sophomore’s year, I did not have any physics teacher… it was always a substitute. But usually they did not teach any physics in class. I was frustrated with it for some time, and at that time, my idea of doing physics was to suppress this shortage.

DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," which means the concentration of metabolites are not changing and in balance. The other constraints are lower and upper bounds on feasible fluxes of various reactions. FBA is the groundstone for all the algorithms we used to conduct the GSM.
Genome-Scale Modeling
The following explains the mathematical basis for GSM. In short, a metabolic network can be modeled as linear equations and optimized by solving the corresponding linear program. The output is the set of reaction rates for all reactions in the network along with the set of shadow prices associated with the metabolites. Both play important roles in the subsequent phenotype phase plane analysis.
A Simple Metabolic Network
Consider a very simple metabolic network with two metabolites, \(A\) and \(B\), where \(A\) flows into the cell with rate \(r_1\), is converted into \(B\) with rate \(r_2\), which is then excreted from the cell with rate \(r_3\):
$$          \begin{split} & \xrightarrow{r_1} A \\              A & \xrightarrow{r_2} B \\              B & \xrightarrow{r_3} \\          \end{split}      $$
Under a steady-state assumption, i.e. where all metabolite levels are constant and no metabolite can be accumulated in the system, the formation and degradation rates for each metabolite must cancel each other. For the network above, this is equivalent to the following set of constraints:
$$          \begin{split}              A:& \quad r_1 - r_2 = 0 \\              B:& \quad r_2 - r_3 = 0          \end{split}      $$
The Linear Program
Now, consider the full genome-scale model of Yarrowia lipolytica with \(M\) = 1683 metabolites and \(R\) = 1985 reactions.
Let \(r = (r_1, ... , r_R)\) be the vector of the \(R\) reaction rates, and similarly let \(m = (m_1, ... ,m_M)\) be the vector of the \(M\) metabolites. The reaction of which the rate is to be maximized, for example the biomass function, is then denoted the objective function and can be expressed as,                $$           f(r) = r_{\text{obj}}       $$                Now, for \(m_i\), the equality constraint \(c_i\) can be expressed as a sum of all \(r_j\) weighted by the stoichiometric coefficients \(a_{ij}\),"

Apart from that there were lectures on current developments on Microbial System Biology & Synthetic Biology by several research groups from the VU, Wageningen University and RU Groningen. In the afternoon we attended a more interactive workshop from a delegate of the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and environment Virgil Rerimassie. The discussion was set on policy making in the field of biotechnology with an eye on the new perspectives form the biotech trend analysis 2016. An important point, which was stressed several times, is that researchers would like to see a more flexible case-to-case evaluation by policy makers. In this evaluation the relevant groups doing the research can assess their own work on safety instead of a generic one-size-fits-all list of precautionary measures. An interesting perspective and seemingly fitting to the fast changing field of biotechnology.
Luckily at the end of the day there were drinks and a buffet so the impressions of the day could be evaluated with the other students from the iGEM teams.
Meeting soon-to-be Biomedical Engineering Students
30-05-17, 13-06-17, 27-06-17
The faculty of Biomedical Engineering organizes several days each year where high school students interested in starting either Biomedical Engineering or Medical Science and Engineering can have a taste of the university. During this day the students attend introductory lectures and have a personal talk about their motivation and capabilities before enrolling in the study program.
On these days we as an iGEM team presented ourselves to the students-to-be about iGEM and iGEM team Eindhoven. We did this to make them aware of the possibility to join future teams and show what kind of research we are currently doing.

BOINC and iGEM - Foundations of a rewarding relationship
The BOINC framework distributes computational tasks to volunteers who provide computational resources in form of calculation time spent by the CPU of their idling personal computers. Volunteers download and install a client software that receives work packages from a central server unit and runs calculations once the computer is not in use. Alternatively users may dedicate a certain percentage of their computing power to destributed computing projects that they like to support. After the successful execution of the computation the result is uploaded to our server.
One of the best known distributed computing projects is SETI@home , a project in which volunteers contribute computing power to the search for extra-terrestrial intellegance. In our case the need for computing power arose from the calculations needed to evaluate the linker model that provides rigid linkers for the circularization of proteins. In both cases the contributors are rewarded with points that reflect the computing time already spent and the dedication towards certain projects. In order to take motivation to the next level we implemented a platform that allows to feed information to the BOINC screensaver (figure 1). Thereby we enable iGEM teams from all over the world to reach an interested and motivated audience with information about their projects, Human Practices activities and iGEM and Synthetic Biology in general. In return users of iGEM@home will be rewarded with informations and insights into one of the most vital communities in science that catch their attention in the very moment they get back to their computers.
Outreach
The need to build a vivid community is key to run a successful distributed computing project. As the project depends on the voluntary support of people it is important to get people enthused about the science behind the project, so they are willing to support the project. Good communication is therefore essential to find support. We therefore used different channels to present and promote our project and iGEM in general to convince people to help us - which in the end turned out to be key to one of our biological main projects!
The Communication Platform iGEM@HOME
The important job after convincing the user to try our software, is to convince them to continuously support us by constantly feeding them with interesting facts on iGEM and offering them ways to influence the project.
Forum: Feedback on Computing and Projects
The first pillar for the communication is an integrated forum software, that serves several purposes: First of all, additional information like status updates or information on the biological projects can be communicated to the community via the 'News' and 'Science' sections of the forum."

There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and a set of quality.
Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme
Clinical management of NSCLC is optimized by NICE. NICE would be in charge of creating management and monitoring plan for our test, were it to be used clinically. Our test would actually free up healthcare staff and facilities. Early detection would reduce the number of cancers diagnosed at later stages where the only option is palliative care, which is more expensive than earlier stage treatment.
This in turn would free up healthcare staff and facilities. [12]
Information about the test and its outcomes must be understood by the individual being screened.
Potential participants should be provided with evidence-based information on the purposes and potential consequences of the programme so they can make an informed choice.
Decisions about the screening interval and sensitivity of the process should be scientifically justifiable to the public
When the individual is being screened, information, similar to that on our wiki, could be presented to them. Evidence for the efficacy of screening could only be given once clinical trials have been carried out. The screening interval could also be optimized from these trials.
All other options for managing the condition with cost effective intervention should have been considered
This is not applicable to NSCLC - early detection is required to reduce mortality rates - when detected late, it can only be treated palliatively.
If people carrying a mutation are identified through screening, their natural history should be understood, which includes psychological implications.
If the test is for a mutation or a genetic variants, the method and means for findings to be kept under review, should be clearly set out

Education
After running a couple of workshops relating to synthetic biology, it was clear to us that genetic modification was seen as dangerous, or unsafe by most younger students. Bacteria were generally seen as risky to work with as many people did not realize there were non-pathogenic strains. Often synthetic biology jargon would cause people to turn off. This was not only the case with younger students, but with adults as well.
We therefore changed our approach to engagement - focusing on making our project more accessible and therefore more exciting. We came up with real world scenarios to pique interest in synthetic biology - from diagnosing disease to reducing the impacts of climate change. We emphasized the real world problems synthetic biology can solve rather than the theoretical biology.
We found a successful strategy was to pose questions, designed to help rect"

This plastic sticker is composed of a plastic film with pores that are too small for the bacteria, but through which our volatiles (EBF and MeS) can escape. However, we need a different mechanisms to contain the BanAphids of our 'spray' or 'honeydew' system.
Kill Switch
The basic mechanism of a kill switch is that the engineered organisms survive until an inducer signal (e.g. IPTG) is added, and this will activate a cascade mechanism that will kill the cells. This induced lethality could, for instance, be used to clean up synthetic microbe spills without harming other cells in the environment (Moe-Behrens et al., 2013).
Furthermore, as suggested by Balan et al. (2005), the use of a nuclease enzyme suicide system disfavours horizontal gene transfer compared to the above suggested suicide system that targets the cell membrane. If a bacterial cell is lysed, that bacterium might be dead but other bacteria in the environment are not dead (yet) and a suicide system that targets the disruption of the cell membrane does not guarantee the degradation of DNA. The lysed bacterium's DNA is now free and available to be taken up by neighbouring bacteria. For this reason we have chosen a 'kill switch' that activates a nuclease system.
Inducible kill systems are not new to iGEM, there are already several constructs available in the database, such as the inducible BamHI system contributed by Berkeley in 2007 ( BBa_I716462 , tested by Lethbridge in 2011). Here, a BamHI gene was placed downstream of an arabinose-inducible promotor.
Unfortunately, spontaneous genetic mutations in this lethal BamHI gene is a central cause of safeguard failure. Spontaneous genetic mutations can deactivate lethal gene expression causing failure of biocontainment. As these engineered cells propagate in the laboratory, or in large bioreactors, disfunctional genetic safeguards can gradually accumulate in the population. If this accumulation is high enough, then the synthetic organisms might survive in the environment after disposal or accidental release (Moe-Behrens et al., 2013).
Next, a lack of tight control is also a big problem within these systems. Leaky systems cannot be controlled strictly. Therefore, the Calgary team of 2012 added a riboswitch, which is a small piece of mRNA that binds ligands and modifies translation of downstream genes; this way the kill switch"

The bold bands observable in fractions A9-A11 are in the line with the expected size of haptoglobin - ~45kDa. B) Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-His antibody to confirm the presence of haptoglobin.
The fractions obtained from nickel IMAC showed production of haptoglobin and so were concentrated down to 500 µl and loaded onto the Superdex 75 10/300 to carry out size exclusion chromatography. Results from this can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6 - Further characterization of human haptoglobin following SEC. A) Chromatogram showing the purification profile of the His-tagged human haptoglobin. The fractions corresponding to the two peaks observed on the chromatograph were further analysed by SDS page gel and western blotted. B) 10µl of the fractions A8-A9 and A9-A10 corresponding to peaks 1 + 2, respectively were mixed with 10µl of laemmli buffer and loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Band A observed on the gel corresponds to the expected size of haptoglobin – 45kDa. However, it is not clear what the bands present at ~37kDa may be. C) Samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with an anti-his antibody. This Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of human haptoglobin.
To further identify the expressed protein at ~37kDa, the band was sent off for analysis by tryptic peptide mass spectrometry. This technique uses the proteolytic enzyme trypsin which cleaves at the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues. The sizes of the peptide fragments obtained after trypsin digestion, represent the peptide mass fingerprint and are characteristic of each protein. The peptide mass fingerprint spectrum of fragments derived through trypsin digest indicated that haptoglobin was indeed purified with good coverage of the amino acid sequence to the expected sequence (Figure 7). This shows that we have purified two forms of our protein, one containing the histidine tag and the other which has lost the tag. An attempt will be made to attach both of these to the fluorospheres.

Apart from iGEM she is also a singer and a geek design aficionado. To her, the beat and melody have the magic power to sweep away all the tiredness and stress, while the fascinating design works are the spring of imagination and creativity.
Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"1). It is therefore important that the concentration within the patch exceeds this concentration there where the patch touches the skin.
A model was designed that estimates the production of lysostaphin for a single E. coli bacteria from experimental data. This model will uses basic physics in order to do an estimate of the total amount of lysostaphin that was produced by the culture. This can be done by combining Fick’s law for diffusion with the mass balance equation and assuming a steady state situation, where there is as much production of lysostaphin as is diffusing out of the system. Such a steady state situation can be observed by a stationary profile of the concentration. This profile will be evaluated in cylindrical coordinates and integrated to obtain a total amount of lysostaphin.
By estimating the number of cells that were present during the experiment we can also get an estimate for production rate of lysostaphin for an individual E. coli bacteria. In later research we can use these estimates to adjust the design of our hydrogel patch, on order to make sure that enough lysostaphin is present at the wound surface, while ensuring that as few cells are present in the cell as possible. This is of importance since a larger amount of cells will likely increase the risk of bacterial escape.
Experiment
Initially an experiment was conducted where an amount of medium containing E. coli cells was added to an agar plate containing S. aureus. Over time the E. coli produced lysostaphin, which eradicates nearby S. aureus. In figure 1 it can be seen that this forms a circle around the E. coli culture. By modelling this region one could obtain the rate of lysostaphin production for this E. coli culture. If the amounts of cells in this culture is known, also the production rate for a single cell could be determined. From the experiments shown in figure 2 parameters were obtained. Those are listed in table 1.
Figure 1: An illustration showing an agar plate seeded with S. aureus in yellow. The inner circle represents the E. coli colony that was seeded and the orange ring the lysostaphin that was excreted by the E. coli. Overtime the band of lysostaphin will grow to a maximum size.
Figure 2: Drops of modified E. coli that produce  and excrete lysostaphin, on a agar plate containing S. aureus. The bands around indicate that S. aureus is dissolved. At the inner band the concentration is set to be equal to MBEC. At the outer band the concentration is set at zero.

It was not until 2004 that the name was changed to Center for Genomic Sciences. As such, in most labs you will always see two sets of incubators at two temperatures, 37ºC for E.coli and 30ºC for Rhizobium species.
The CCG is composed of a relatively small group of researchers, organized in seven Programs or Laboratories, which encompass microbial and plant genomics, ecological research, and more recently, some aspects of human genomics. Microbial genomics includes projects on dynamical genomics in bacteria, evolutionary and functional genomics (proteomics and transcriptomics), genomics and bioinformatics of gene regulation and comparative bioinformatics. Eukaryotic genomics includes plant functional genomics, and more recently, genomic and proteomics research of the human genome. In addition, our research is performed in the molecular biology of interactions between bacteria and plants, microbial ecology and evolution and applied agriculture.
The CCG is strongly committed to education in genomics. It's programs are conformed by researchers, posdocs, technicians, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. Moreover, it is the host for the LCG (Licenciatura en Ciencias Genómicas in Spanish), the program that we UNAM-Genomics_Mexico team are studying.

In order to do so, we had to remove forbidden restriction sites within the gene using primers and the in-fusion PCR technique. Primers were ordered as shown by the image below, to add the prefix and suffix and change the PstI restriction site from CTGCAG to CTGCAA:
The PCR's will be done in the following steps, in order to remove both sites and prepare the gene as a biobrick:
Characterisation
Successful Pigment Production
In order to produce pigment, bacteria transformed with pTRCmelA must be plated on media supplemented with copper and tyrosine.  Supplementation with copper is necessary as copper is a cofactor for the tyrosinase, and tyrosine is a precursor to melanin biosynthesis.  (N. Cabrera-Valladares, A. Martínez, S. Piñero, V.H. Lagunas-Muñoz, R. Tinoco and R. de Anda et al., Expression of the melA gene from Rhizobium etli CFN42 in Escherichia coli and characterization of the encoded tyrosinase, Enzyme Microb Technol 38 (6) (2006), pp. 772–779 [3] )
We transformed Top10 E. coli with pTRCmelA and plated them, using LA supplemented with 15ug/ml copper, 0.2ug/ul tyrosine.  Below is a plate that  was incubated at 37 degrees for 24 hours and then left on the bench at room temperature over the weekend. Pigment was clearly produced, and it appears to have diffused out of the colonies.
Left: Top10 transformed with plasmid containing the MelA gene.  Right: untransformed Top10.
Control Experiments
To show that the brown colour was a result of the MelA gene and not natural oxidation of the LA supplements, a control plate without any bacteria was incubated for the same amount of time and showed no change in colour (data not shown).
Optimization
On pTRCmelA, the MelA gene is under the control of the lac repressor.  The photo above shows leaky expression of the promoter, as no IPTG was not added.  We then experimented with the addition of IPTG and varying tyrosine concentrations to see the effect on pigment production.  As the photo below shows, the greatest pigment production was achieved with IPTG induction and the highest concentration of tyrosine.

Vier Vogel Pils sponsored the beer for the event, while Promega hosted a seminar on RT-qPCR. We had planned everything that by the time the conference came around, we were prepared.
Schedule
The German-wide Meetup was hosted for the first time by the TU Dresden iGEM team. In a 3-day affair, 60 students from 11 universities attended with the aim to practice their presentation demeanor, setup future collaborations and most of all, make new friends ahead of the Giant Jamboree and have fun.
On Friday there were arrivals of our participants and their check-in in hostels, followed by exploring the city of Dresden and getting a chance to meet the fellow iGEM teams. Each participant received a name badge and a brochure containing the schedule of the event as well as some Promega giveaways.
Saturday started off with a few introductory talks, as well as the presentation of “iGEM Goes Green”; part of the project of our iGEM team to push sustainability and environmentally-friendly lab work. Next, each attending team was given the chance to present their own project ideas; with the intent of promoting inter-lab collaborations.
Among the Sunday events there were two workshops, held in smaller groups. The participants chose between the option to take part in speed datings for the last-minute collaboration agreements or an introduction workshop of iGEM goes green with interactive tasks on how to calculate the greenhouse gas emission of their projects and exploring ideas for more sustainable lab work.
Schedule Meetup
Presentations and Workshops during the Meetup
The teams had 15 minutes to present their project and 5 minutes for Q&A. Other teams challenged the presenters with tough questions, much like the judges will at the Giant Jamboree, preparing the teams to be clear and concise for future presentations.
During the pauses, coffee, fruits and vegetables were provided to keep the teams energized and focused for the long days. Beer was provided as well, courtesy of local brewery, Vier Vogel Pils. After a day filled with amazing talks, the teams were invited for a tour through Dresden, seeing the major sites and afterwards we had a Tortilla party and we played different national drinking games. It was a great bonding session and a good way to start the evening before going to the bars in the town.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," staff of our institute in April. These general communication issues appeared once again when we had the chance to be instructors at the pupils academy in june. During guidance through genetic experiments we were able to talk about our project, iGEM and synthetical biology in general. Although the attendees belong to a very educated peer group of young people we had major problems understanding each other.
Florian Helfer
To further evaluate these problems we established dialogue with Florian Helfer . Florian is a cultural anthropologist from Frankfurt am Main, Germany. He helped us evaluating the problems we had, communicating our project and after an extraordinarily extensive skype conference we concluded, that scientific language and the very different vocabulary state the biggest obstacle.
Directed Evolution of educational Outreach
We tackled this obstacle on different levels. First of all we were eager to improve our very own presentation skills. Inspired by our Evobodies we conducted a kind of directed evolution of educational outreach . To do so we held a series of presentations in different high schools in Northrhine-Westfalia and subsequently took a survey among the pupils regarding comprehensibility and presentation style.
Dictionary
Secondly we created a dictionary explaining about 500 different scientific words in a simple yet correct language. This tool enables scientists to reflect possible publications regarding mainstream understandibility and enables non scientific people to comprehend difficult specialized topics.
Postcards
Finally we engaged in a project started by University of Düsseldorf and designed and distributed postcards to share basic knowledge about synthetic biology.
NRW-days
When celebrating the birthday of our district in Germany each year one city organizes a major event. This year's celebration was hosted by D%uuml;sseldorf. iGEM-Bielefeld had the honor to present this years project in front of the local audience. Here we had the opportunity to talk about Evobodies and practice our soft skills.
CeBiTec-Symposium
On 4th of July the 11th annual CeBiTec-Symposium took place in Bielefeld. We were glad to have the chance to present a poster about our project in the first poster session. When discussing Evobody generation we learned a lot about difficult parts within our project and received helpful feedback from experts in various fields.
Providing waffles and information
At June 1st we had an information point in the Bielefeld University and sold delicious waffles! Lots of people came around to talk with us about our project and about iGEM and of course for eating waffles. Thereby we had the chance to give students and graduates of all kinds of courses an insight into synthetic biology.  If"

Overall project
The Idea
Synthetic Biology has been enabling changes in all bio-domains, one such being communication. Cellular communication has relied since time immemorial on chemical messengers to exchange information. As such, these messengers regardless of their scope, are constrained to a chemical system; even far reaching messengers such as hormones are bound within the chemical system that is the human body. But this mode is about to change.
In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by using a non-chemical messenger: photons. These will transport information between cells that have been designed to sense and emit light, thus creating a photon-based inter-cellular communication system.
These messengers are produced through bio-luminescent reactions, and are quite capable of traversing multiple environments. Consecuently, this enables the propagation of information beyond the chemical, biological and even spatial restrictions. As the messenger is effectively decoupled from the chemical layer, it is a natural step in the communications bridge between organic-based and silicon-based systems, such as computers.
The Name
As you might imagine, WiFi is a play on the popular IEEE 802.11 communications standard knows as Wi-Fi. Since our systems achieves the transfer of information without wires, it is thus wireless. As for fidelity, we shall see.
Before you begin wondering on Copyright issues, let us make two things clear:
Our name is WiFi, not the Wi-Fi Alliance 's Wi-Fi (notice the hyphen).
Second, a quick search on the US Patents & Trademarks Office Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) returned that WiFi was a trademark in 2006, but is now listed as ""Dead"". Therefore, we are not infringing copyright issues by using it in our system.

Phillip's notes
Introduction:  Yesterday, Nithin performed a PCR amplication of our PCquad optimized for iGEM 2.0 with the primers to add the his-tag-stop, designed by Tyler.  The reaction was also done on a gradient of temperatures, in order to determine an optimal annealing temperature.  Upon visualization of the gel, it appears that there is a much stronger band around 250bp, though the predicted size around 1.4kb was visible.
An attempt was made at determining what the non-specific band was.  Since a self-dimer/hetero-dimer was unlikely, due the size, the non-specific band was speculated to be somewhere in the middle of the gene. Using clustal omega, a sequence alignment was done using the following: 1.  PCquad Optimized for iGEM 2.0 2. PCquad primer iGEM prefix 3. PCquad primer iGEM suffix #1 It was shown that only the ends, as intended, annealed to the primers.  The source of the non-specific band is currently undetermined.
Procedures:
PCR amplification of construct attempt #2 Melting temperature for the reaction was determined by the NEB Tm calculator, and the part of our primer that annealed to the template.   Nithin prepared the reaction samples for 62C, 66C, and 70C.  0.5ng was loaded instead of 0.25ng.
Protocol for Q5 from NEB:
1. Please note that protocols with Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may differ from protocols with other polymerases. Conditions recommended below should be used for optimal performance.
Reaction Setup:
We recommend assembling all reaction components on ice and quickly transferring the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98°C). All components should be mixed prior to use. Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase may be diluted in 1X Q5"

Future Plan
Desired Dynamics Input
Q1:
How can we characterize the property of our desired dynamics instead of importing time course? I mean I don't care much on the exact behavior the system perform but some key characters of the dynamics?
A1:
It should be referred to the selection of the evaluation function. One possible solution is to convert the time dependent function from time domain to frequency domain. Fourier transform should be introduced for its advantage of simplifying many of complicated periodic functions.
For other common conventions and notations, see Other conventions and Other notations below.  The Fourier transform on Euclidean space is treated separately, in which the variable x often represents position and ξ momentum.
Instead of comparing with target function in real space consists of substance concentration and time axis, one potential alternative for avoiding dilemmas like unmatched phase in oscillation is to move the score function into frequency space after Fourier Transformation.
Q2:
The desired time course for different node are largely different in order of magnitude? Also, some results of my experiment cannot be expressed as absolute values but relative ones. How to keep the dimension of different species?
A2:
The data may vary significantly in dimension. And it is unfortunately true for most real-case reactions' dynamics/thermodynamics constant. Therefore we consider it to be a worthwhile trial to move all calculations to logarithmatic space to overcome the strong order-dependence of initial values of inputs. Related changes are systematical, from the substitution of variables and functions to the transformation of first order deriatives.
Though we are familiar with working at linear space, here it is more convenient and effective to move all sampling and initialization in logarithmatic space, where the step of calculation can easily jump among different orders.
Restriction Input
Q1:
The input box and steps for users is a little complicated and even have some small requirements for the users to be capable of transform rate equations to differential equations. It has confused me a little.
A1:
In fact this is one of the most serious headache we are suffering for now. On one hand, we have to make the input sound and standard; on the other hand we still feel it an urgent call from our users to cut off unnecessary inputs. So far, this input box is perhaps the simplest one after discussing a lot with our USTC wet team. By proposing many possible solutions, they"

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," its impact can no longer be neglected [6-7]. The energy dissipated in a coalescence (merging) of droplets will be related to the volume of drained fluid between two droplets T3, \(E_{dissip} = \pi \eta D T^3 (\dot \gamma)^2 t_c\). Here D is the drag coefficient, related to the Reynolds number:
(25)
The strain rate \((\dot \gamma)\) represents the relative deformation of the fluid flow \(\dot \gamma = (Q_1 + Q_2) / H / (W - 2R_2)\). In the experiments we use high concentrations of surfactants in oil and that is why we have to account for the non-Newtonian behavior of the oil. This means the oil viscosity is not constant with the growing deformation rates. It was shown previously that the solutions of high concentration of ionic or nonionic surfactant have a shear thickening behavior [8-10], which means that viscosity of solution is increasing with the growing deformation. We use the Power-Law for viscosity function:
(26)
Here η0 is the viscosity value with no deformation applied. This is the value given in a manual description of oil and n=1.2 is the power law index. With these arguments the dissipated energy is written as follows:
(27)
It should be noted the power-law description of viscosity of oil is used in all energy terms.
5. Energy balance equation and its solutions
So far we derived all the components making influence for energy balance. We write the energy balance as equilibrium of the total energy. The left-side (LS) of equation represents the total energy of droplet pair moving in a straight channel of the cross-section H×W1. Right side (RS) of the balance equation represents the total energy in a coalescence channel of the size H×Wch. These two terms are written as follows
(28)
(29)
Here in equation (29) we include the energy loss associated with the volume of oil drained between two droplets in the coalescence. Taking together equations (28)-(29), the equilibrium equation
(30)
is being solved numerically for various experimental conditions (droplet volumes and voltage). To find the solutions of eq.(30) we used the package Mathematica 9.0.
Solutions of the derived model

Expression vectors were transformed into E.coli expression strain TransB(DE3). After                     culturing,                     we firstly tested the effect of IPTG inducement. β-tubulin was taken as an example. SDS-PAGE(Fig.8)                     showed that IPTG is very significant in the expressing process.

the molecular weight of target fusion protein is 74.6kDa.                             arrows show the correct bands.
Then we checked the protein expression predicted website http://www.biotech.ou.edu/.

Edinburgh_OG,2018,Team:Edinburgh OG#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," that our schedule did not permit as consistent collection of data. Thus, we may not be able to observe the various phases of microbial growth from the data. However, we may be able to note the maximal growth of the culture in the various media.
From what is shown, it is evident that glucose is the more significant contributor to biomass and growth as was predicted by the model. The conditions wherein M9 was supplemented with 1% glucose and pot ale showed that pot ale was not entirely conducive to growth. This should be verified with a control where the culture was grown only on pot ale. This experiment was initially carried out but terminated due to difficulties.
Growth curve on pot ale vs. glucose in M9 media
Taking a step further, we sought to predict the production rates of the co-polymer PHBV from various substrates. As was reflected in the above data, PHBV production rates among the lowest when the culture was grown on acetate/propionate and pot ale media. However, supplementation of the pot ale with glucose showed a significant increase in the rate of PHBV production, which matches what the data we collected demonstrated.
A study by Bhatia et al. looked into the effect of supplementation by succinate and glycerol. In their conclusion, they purported that glycerol was a strong contributing factor to expanded capacity for biomass growth, while propionate in the presence of succinate influenced the PHV content of the copolymer. However, these observations applied to a strain wherein the gene sucCD encoding succinyl-CoA synthase was overexpressed. We would like to test whether this may be expected in a strain without the over expression profile.
In silico predicted rates of PHBV production with various substrate combinations
We observed an increased production rate of PHBV when acetate and propionate was supplemented with glycerol instead of glucose; however, the projected rate did not increase when pot ale was the main substrate. Furthermore, when succinate was the main substrate with supplementation by glucose, the projected rate of synthesis was the highest. We speculate that this may be because glycerol and succinate may have roles in restoring the redox potential in the metabolism of the organism.
First, glycerol is known as a better carbon source for making reducing chemicals as its catabolism can restore the reducing equivalents in the cell. Also, succinate’s conversion to fumarate by succinate dehydrogenase is also a main contributor to restoring available NADH. From this, we surmise that redox may become a main bottleneck in PHA biosynthesis as pha"

Currently we have no idea whatever our method of using Ferritin to identify and separate DNA of interest will be successful. To have a backup plan, I was in charge of finding alternative reporter genes that will at least indicate the presence of DNA of interest. Specifically Lisa and Rai came up a list of interesting and widely used reporter genes that I should research on, in the hope that eventually a differential equation based model can be developed, to predict their signal strength for any given input conditions of cells etc. This week I mostly did qualitative research, where I found out how they work and what equipment are needed, with a start on kinetics.
Those reporter genes can be divided into two categories: enzymes or proteins. Beta-galactosidase, luciferase and horseradish peroxidase all report promoter activities by react with a substrate that will either emit light or undergoes color change. I have found that between the enzymes luciferase has superior sensitivity and linear response range than GFP and beta-glactosidase.(Nakajima & Ohmiya, 2010) On the other hand GFP, FRET and BRET behaves similarly but themselves don't catalyze substrates. GFP just fluroscence on its own. For FRET two things ("
British_Columbia,2013,Team:British Columbia#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," to allow for optimization of product formation, such as flavouring of yogurt.
Our main objectives were to:
Predict the growth of mono- and mixed- recombinant E. coli cultures under phage predation.
Predict vanillin and cinnamaldehyde production based on initial ratio of phage-to-bacteria, (ie. multiplicity of infection; MOI).
The schematic for the final model is illustrated in figure 1. We considered two E. coli strains, each harbouring two plasmids: a flavouring plasmid and a CRISPR (or ""immunity"") plasmid. Here, the flavouring plasmid is responsible for the production of either cinnamaldehyde or vanillin and the CRISPR plasmid contains unique spacer elements, granting both strains immunity against ""environmental phage"" that may contaminate the bioreactor. Additionally, one strain would be immunized against the ""control phage"", where the other strain would remain susceptible. This construction would allow us to tune the susceptible population in order to achieve our desired flavouring proportions, based on the amount of control phage added.
Model Formulation
Assumptions
Bacteria are grown in a batch culture and follow the Monod growth equation.
Bacteria harbouring the CRISPR assembly are 100% immune to the specific phage infection (based on spacer element).
Bacteria without CRISPR system are completely susceptible to phage infection.
Yield coefficients and phage attachment coefficients are constant.
Bacteriophage do not decrease significantly in number during the course of an experiment.
All considered bacteriophages are lytic.
Deterministic Model - modeling bacterial growth under phage predation
A deterministic model based on Monod kinetics [1] was used to describe bacterial growth. Here, the Poisson distribution was incorporated to model the infected populations based on a starting phage-to-bacteria ratio, or MOI. We trained the model on a set of experimental growth curves and validated it against a separate set. Yield terms were added to account for the production of two different flavours: cinnamaldehyde and vanillin. Next, we extended our basic growth model to include bacterial co-cultures. Using this approach, we demonstrate that by using different virus inoculums, it is possible to achieve different final amounts of compounds from a mixed culture.

About 10% of F1 containing the insertion gene can be rescued (The unc-119 gene on the vector plays a key role in ciliary membrane localization of proteins and is required for the establishment or function of the nervous system). Therefore, the number of injected worms we will get from miniMos injection is:
X * 20% * 60%* 10 * 10%
Therefore, to finally get a stain, at the beginning we need to inject at least 9 worms.
After injection and selection, the total time of getting one inserted worms is about 2 weeks.
In fact, we inject totally 40 worms at 2 times to get the odr-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry insertion, and 40 worms to get the str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP. The total time consumption is one and a half months since we injected worms separately.
Mating for stable inheritance
After getting the inserted worms, our next step is to get the hybrid by mating 2 strains. In this step, the probability of obtaining stable inheritance worms depending on the location of inserted gene on the chromosome.
Fig 2.4 Stable inheritance probability
F0: we use ord-10::CoCHR::GEM-GECO::mCherry as male parent and Str-1::Chrimson::GEM-GECO::GFP as female parent.
F1: heterozygote worms with GFP and mcherry.
F2: Four phenotypes of F2, AABB is what we want.
We use pCFJ909 vector as the carrier of insertion gene. It contains mos-1 transposon that can insert the gene on the chromosome randomly. Worms have 6 pair of chromosomes, so the probability of 2 strains with the inserted gene on different chromosomes is 5/6 and the probability of 2 traits are at the same chromosomes is 1/6.
1) Insertions on different chromosomes :
The probability to get stable inheritance is based on the Mendel’s laws. Basically, F1 have both of 2 traits and F2 have trait segregation in .  9/16 of F2 worms contain RFP and GFP in two different neurons. The number of worms with the stable inheritance of 2 traits consist 1/16 of the total number of F2 worms.  In this step, the time cost is about 2 weeks.

UCL,2016,Team:UCLouvain#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," open this gate but surely thanks to a gating mechanism provided by the phage. However, this last article showed that when using the pIV mutant (pIV*S324G) the bacteria became more sensitive to the action of vancomycin. vancomycin is an antibiotic that can’t cross the outer membrane of bacteria because of its hydrophilicity. So if the bacteria expressing pIV proteins are sensitive to vancomycin it means that the channel pIV is opened. These effects are illustrated on the figure 1.
Figure 1: Graph showing the effect of vancomycin on the growth of E.Coli expressing or not pIV proteins or pIV* mutant proteins. IPTG is here used to induce the production of pIV via the control of the promoter of this gene. Marciano et al.
Figure 2: Primary structure of pIV. The “leaky” mutations are represented in green and are concentrated in GATE1 and GATE2. (Spagnuolo et al., 2010)
Beyond the use of vancomycin to highlight the permeability caused by the pIV*, Marciano et al, used a strain of E. coli with a deletion of the gene LamB. This one codes for a maltoporin placed in the outer membrane. Without this LamB gene, the bacteria can’t grow on maltodextrin (larger than triose) media; The concentration of maltodextrin was determined too (0.2% to 0.6%). Thanks to that method, bacteria with the open channel pIV and only them can grow on this media.
Finally this article estimated the diameter of the hole (6 nm) when the porin is open.
Thanks to all these precious informations contained in this article, we could optimize our selection method and several of our protocols.
Few years after, Spagnuolo et al.(2010) were able to identify residues in the pIV primary structure responsible for the gating mechanism. They achieved this by random mutagenesis of the pIV gene followed by selection for mutants with compromised barrier function, called “leaky”. They identified mutations in 34 residues, 30 of which clustered into two regions located in the center of the conserved C-terminal secretin family domain. They called these two regions GATE1 and GATE2, that span respectively 39 and 14 residues (figure 2). These informations allowed us to choose to target the regions GATE1 and GATE2 with our mutagenesis approach.

Together with iGEM Uppsala and iGEM Lund, we held a whole day event on the theme “Limits of Life”. The event was planned during several months, and it was a great way of getting to know other teams, to learn how to collaborate on a more professional level. The first session was about our limits as humans and how to manage and prevent stress both as students and also as members of iGEM teams. The second session continued on the theme of limits, but this time on the ethical and technological limits of biohacking. The event was open for the public and focused on the dialogue between the audience and speakers. This was kept through an online system where people could write questions directly to the moderator. Open discussions between the audience and the speakers blossomed, and it was a great way of including society in a discussion about life on a individual or societal level as well as on molecular level.
We were able to find sponsors for the location as well as the food provided during the event, with the help of Naturvetarna, a trade union for people working within life science.

Heather and I working hard in the MIT wet lab.
Thursday, 5/30: Today the Wellesley HCI lab headed into Boston for our first experience with wet lab training. At MIT, we met Prof. Natalie Kuldell who walked us through the BioBuilder workshop. There, we received an introduction to synthetic biology and the most fundamental concepts such as standardization, abstraction, and synthesis. It was exhilarating, and definitely a mind-opener to everything that this field has to offer. Before, we had only the readings to provide us background, but the workshop definitely made the topics a lot more clearer.
Later, we were also given the opportunity to actually enter the wet lab environment. Hands-on learning is the best sort of learning, so it was great being in a lab to actually conduct some critical experiments. My partner was Heather, and we gave them our best shot! And while we may not have been the best synthetic biologists, we did make several key observations.
Cassie working hard in the wet lab as well.
First, especially for nonscientists, it’s important to communicate the lab instructions clearly. Often, we found the directions confusing and had to constantly ask for clarification. Part of it was because we simply didn’t understand the terminology or conventions. At one instance, Natalie mentioned herself that she should have included instructions saying “mix the resulting solution.” As scientists, she told us that they always just automatically mix solutions so that repeating them in a lab instruction is repetitive as it’s an assumed action. But as nonscientists, it’s a connection that we would not have made.
In addition, while we were able to conduct the experiments simply by following directions, it was difficult at times for us to actually gauge what it was that we were doing. If there could be some sort of explanation perhaps at the side that you could read to see how all the pieces fit together, I think that would be greatly beneficial. This would be a great application of the “drawer” idea on a surface; when confused, you could click on a symbol or something and have an explanation pop up that then minimizes so that you can continue your experiment after you’re done reading.
All in all, it was an eye-opening experience. We concluded the day with a summary and reflection of what we had learned, and since the project Heather and I are working on is concerned with making synthetic biology accessible to nonscientists, we have a lot of new information to work with and incorporate"

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter1_-_-_TEXT.html,"ymes. -Plan the industrialization and further     development in biological imaging     industry. -Design the projector specialized for     biological imaging
Questions it raises :
Do you wanna try photographic film     produced by bacteria?
What do you care most when using this     product?
How do you like the development of other     fields’ technology into biological system?
Will you believe the future when everything     we use and require is produced by     organism?
This year, our team attempt to combine the photographic film     with biological system triggered by much careful investigation     of bacteria imaging study and light inducible response both in     recent research and iGEM team work.
We would like to call the system as Fast and Accurate Biological     Chromatic Sensing-Imaging System(FABCSIS) by respectively     joint red-green-blue (RGB) light sensing proteins with RGB     florescent proteins into a new pedestal Caulobacter Crescentus,     a kind of bacterium possessing adhesive holdfast which we can     utilize for more stable expression in distinct surroundings like     the water flow. And we are determinant to improve the system     with ribozymes regulation to enhance the accuracy and speed of     perception and response. At last, we will construct a customized     projector to measure the efficiency of system and make a plan for     the possibility of industrialization in the future. The FABCSIS, as we     wish, will realize the chromatic imaging system firstly held in the     media, regarding each individual as a pixel just like photographing.     We believe our work will drive the further study and development     of imaging system in other living organisms and one day biological     photographic films will appear in everybody’s daily life to change     the world for its lowcost and high resolution.
This year, we attempt to improve the technology in biological     system and hope our job could influence the development and     study of biological imaging chromatically. Besides, we seized     many opportunities to introducing genetic engineering and     synthetic biology to students who are intrigued in science, parents     and people who are worried about GMO without any biological     conception. We hope one day in China, everyone could make a     decision scientifically with knowledge and judgement with our tiny     efforts.

ETH_Zurich,2008,Team:ETH Zurich#Tools#Automated Wiki_-_-_TEXT.html," regular wiki editing. Therefore, we had the idea to use some kind of software to overcome the shortcomings listed above. We wanted to introduce a ""middle man"" who performs editing tasks for the user and create a division of content and syntax while maintaining wiki only syntax on the MIT wiki site.
The automated wiki
Software / Progamming Language
The automated wiki is written in C# as a webapplication that needs an IIS server to run on.
As a database it uses Mysql.
The software can be divided into three major parts:
User Interface
Page editing with the automated wiki
The user interface uses the FCKEditor Tool as an input interface. You can test it here and see what it can do.
A short list of benefits compared to regular wiki editing:
regular users don't have to deal with any wiki syntax.
""What you see is what you get"" editor.
Drag and drop available
Image editing in place (drag and drop or via properties dialog)
Formating via pointing
Pasting and converting text from Word or HTML pages!
Selecting/uploading images with automated wiki
Drag and drop editing/resizing images with automated wiki
Parsing Sites
At this point we stopped developing the automated wiki. This part is mainly responsible for adding the layout to the text.
To achieve this, a layout consisting of a regular html page is read out of the database containing various parsing tags.
For every parsing tag the program then enters the correct page content.
That way, the menu or a layout image that is placed on every page can be edited in one place and then updated on every other page.
Our plan was to also parse the text for key words like e.g papers etc. and automatically create the correct links on the wiki.
Writing into MIT Wiki
Menu out of Mysql Database
Finally after all the pages are generated, those which have been changed get updated at the MIT wiki.
To do this the application simply mimics a regular user edit by logging in with a regular user account and editing page per page.
To see an example of a page generated with the automated wiki, click here .
Why we didn't use it in the end
There were two reasons why we didn't use the automated wiki in the end:
Within the team not everyone felt comfortable with the idea that we need an extra tool for editing the wiki, because this also brings an additional source for errors/complications.
For some reason, the MIT wiki team decided to loosen up the allowed syntax again, so now we are back at the situation that everything - from html to javascript and also flash - is allowed. Along with these changes, also the"

Another important fact to be noted is that the fertile plains of Bengal are also among the highest rice producing regions in the world. Hence, arsenic contaminated rice produced here gets exported to other parts of the world as well and as a result, the problem does not stay limited to a small population but shows impact on a global scale. Currently, no techniques exist to combat this pathway of As entry into human body due to lack of feasibility of filtering out As from large amounts of water used to raise food crops and livestock. Also, it is very alarming that Rice and Fish both of which form the staple food of a large population in Bengal, have the highest levels of Arsenic accumulation among all food items and hence pose a great risk to the health of these people.
Assuming on average 450g of cooked rice and 4L of water is consumed daily by an adult in West Bengal, 550 ppb and 110 ppb of As gets ingested daily through these respective sources.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Project Outline
Our ultimate goal is to build a ‘smart’ glyoxylate shunt that burns extra fatty acid when there is energy surplus. To achieve this, we would have to first build the shunt itself in mammalian cells. The shunt comprises two bacterial glyoxylate enzymes, isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB). Tagged with a localization signal peptide, they could be directed to the mitochondria and act on the citric acid cycle, eventually increasing fatty acid uptake. The two enzymes would be initially driven by constitutive promoters (CMV and EF-1alpha promoters), placing the shunt in a constantly “ON” state and burning calories regardless of the energy profile. To improve this, we are developing fatty acid responsive promoters, which, when used to regulate the glyoxylate enzymes, should dispense energy only when it is in excess.

Our Team
The Penn iGEM 2012 Team consists of 4 undergraduates, 3 advisors, and many others who have provided important contributions along the way. Together, we have learned a lot over the last few months. We have taught ourselves different protocols and developed new standards to synchronize our work. Through our participation in iGEM, we have collaborated to learn more about synthetic biology - from the initial days of cloning constructs to the final days of imaging and analysis. Our idea for spatio-temporal control of drug delivery first originated in late May after weeks of reading papers. Slowly we have been able to piece together different components of the system to help the project materialize to the system it is today. We believe our work in optogenetics and drug delivery has a promising future and we are excited to share our results at the World Championships!

Immobilization
Protocols for the immobilization
Immobilization offers the opportunity to develop a degradation system. Therefor we tried to find a method to immobilize the produced lacasses. For the immobilization we tried tow different methods. First silica beads, which were already available in our lab, because they were used the year before. And later CPC-(controlled pore carrier)-beads.

GBB Symposium
On the 6th of september the annual Groningen Biomolecular Science and Biotechnology symposium was organized at the Hamilton hotel in Groningen. During this event, many speakers were invited to present their work. As a special, we were invited to talk about our project. The GBB takes pride in the yearly success of the University of Groningen in the iGEM competition. For us, this symposium was an opportunity to practice our presentation on the way to Lyon. This was a success, we were able to see whether we could communicate our message well to a professional audience. The feedback was positive and useful, allowing for further progress.
Symposium KU Leuven
This symposium was for non-biologists, bachelor and master students.
