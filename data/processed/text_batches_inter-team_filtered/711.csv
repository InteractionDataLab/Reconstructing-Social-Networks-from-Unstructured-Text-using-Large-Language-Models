After PCR-cleanup the N and NutR digestions seemed to have worked but you can't see a difference from digested/non-digested as they are from pcr products. The MG03 digestion looks bad, but the dna concentration might have been too low. The pSB1C3 also had a low dna concentration. Tomorrow we will still attempt ligations and redo digestion of both MG03 and pSB1C3. We should also pcr more linear pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.

Just to give you a little background on what iGEM is all about: The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT. This design course grew to a summer competition, which has evolved over the past ten years to include over 300 teams from all over the world. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts at the beginning of summer. Working at their own schools over the summer, they design and build biological systems and operate them in living cells.
2006 marks the year that Purdue began its journey toward making a difference in the world of synthetic biology, entering the competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisors. Purdue continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost every year but never anything more. Facing some trials and tribulations along this journey, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately, the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team in 2012 but to also receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition at MIT for the first time in the team’s history. Then in 2013 Purdue iGEM achieved an unprecedented success, ranking third in the undergraduate division of North America at the 2013 regional competition.
Now the Purdue Biomakers are back again, better than ever. With more members, increased funding, and a focus on upholding Purdue’s strong legacy in agriculture, conservation, engineering, and technology, you can expect the 2016 iGEM team to continue to redefine success, striving to reach even greater heights in this year’s iGEM competition!

Expression:
1. Inoculate the bacteria and let them grow overnight at 37℃.
2. On the second day, use LB medium dilute the bacteria by about 1/50 and let them grow at 37℃ for 2-3 h until the A600nm reaches 0.6-0.8.
3. Add IPTG till final concentration of 0.1 mM to 2.0 mM and continue growing for another 3-4 h. Alternatively, the bacteria can also grown at room temperature.
4. Temperature overnight after adding IPTG. (Lower temperature and lower IPTG concentration could reduce the formation of inclusion bodies and consequently increase the solubility of the synthesized protein).
5. The bacteria with centrifugation 3.000 g×10 min at 4℃. Wash the pelleted bacteria by PBS and centrifugate in the same way. The bacteria pellet can be stored at -80℃.
6. Resuspend the pellet in Bacteria Lysis Buffer or STE buffer.
7. Add lysozyme till final concentration of 1 mg/ml and leave the bacteria on ice forat least 15 min. Just before the sonication, add 100 μl of 1 M DTT and 1.4 ml of 10% Sarkosyl. Mix thoroughly and sonicate for 1 min.
8. Centrifuge at 16,000 rpm for 20 min to pellet the debris on the SS34 rotor.
9. The supernatant can be stored at -80℃ freezer.
Purification:
1. The Glutathione-Agarose beads should be hydrolyted for at least 2 h by PBS or water. Then use 1% non-fat milk to block the bead for at least 30 min.
2. Wash the bead by PBS for 4-5 times to remove the milk. Add NaN3 to prevent the bacteria from growing.
3. To pull down the GST protein, add 20 μl of the blocked bead to each sample in eppendorf tubes.
4. Rotate the tubes at 4℃ for at least 15 min.
5. Spin the tubes at 6,500 rpm for 10-20 s.
6. Aspirate the supernatant and wash with 1 ml of PBS.
7. Repeat the step 6 for 6-9 times.
8. Use the Elution Buffer to elute the bound GST protein.

3. Do an electrophoresis.
From the picture, we can see there was another stripe. Compared to the previous PCR products, we concluded that the mutation was finished.
Then we use an enzyme named Dpn1 to cut the template into small pieces. Because the template is methylated and the PCR product is not, it’s safe to do so. The purpose of this step is to protect the template plasmid from duplication and transcription. Our next step is genetics transformation. The essence of this step is to put the plasmid into the body of the E.coli. So we put the petri dish into the 37℃ incubator and wait the E.coli’s reproduction.

1. We used PCR to amplificate GFP and RFP.
2. We did an electrophoresis to see whether the PCR is successful.
3. Then we did a restriction enzyme digestion to cut the GFP & RFP.
4. After one hour, we did an electrophoresis to see whether the digestion is successful. However, today’s experiment is different from we did before. This gel is different because it can be recovered.
8.17.2012
We pick up the colony from E.Coli, then did a restriction enzyme digestion to see whether it is mutate.
To be disappointed, the mutation was failed. That is to say, we have to do it again. After all those failures, we realized that we have to face disappointment when doing experiment. We can’t be strong enough until we meet lots of difficulties. But the good thing is we’ve learned a lot of skills which will be very helpful for our future experiments.

We came back to the school on Friday night.
We had a meeting on Saturday, in which we discussed what we did and what we’re going to do. It was very helpful. We felt more united after the meeting.
The freshmen all came to the school over this weekend. It’s our duty to help them. So we got very busy. But that was fun.

POLYENZYME
In the course of our wet lab work we came upon the need for solving enzymatic equations in a systematic manner. Programming each equation separately was slow and tiresome, so we developed a tool that handled the bottom level formulation and calculations, letting us focus on pathway design and parameter tuning. Our software is born of this tool, after ironing out some details and generalizing our subset of equations to encompass the basic Michaelis-Menten framework. The result is a node-based pathway editor for enzymatic reactions that uses Runge-Kutta integration methods to solve a set of self-generated Michaelis-Menten equations that describe the evolution of the system. We focused on making things accessible from the get-go, providing a simple interface and intuitive controls, save and load functionality, and the option to download paths from our Github repository.This software could be of interest to anyone that wants to quickly prototype an enzymatic pathway, or just mess around with Michaelis-Menten reactions.
The software can be run with python 3.4 + kivy 1.9.1 + numpy + matplotlib, or with our standalone executable (windows).
The code and the executable can be found at: https://github.com/polybiome/PolyEnzyme
To execute the compiled code (in windows) download PolyEnzyme.rar, uncompress it and click the PolyEnzyme icon.

1. Introduction
PolyEnzyme is an interactive enzymatic pathway simulator, with a focus on intuitiveness, graphic visualization, and ease of use. It is part of the software entrance of the team UPF-CRG Barcelona, for the international synthetic biology competition iGem 2016.
1.1 Overview
The program consists on a blank canvas on which nodes can be placed. Those nodes represent reaction components, such as inhibitors, substrates and products. Once a set of nodes is present on the canvas, the user can link them in enzymatic reactions. The simulation can then be run in real time or for a desired time, whereupon the nodes will update their properties graphically following the specified reactions.    Additional functionality consists on the user being able to save the created pathways for latter use and revision. It is also possible to choose and download a pathway from examples in the web.
1.2 Scope
PolyEnzyme was originally designed to check and compare the validity of experimental data in the"
Aalto-Helsinki,2016,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Achievements&action=edit_-_-_TEXT.html," - MlrA, MlrAYa - MlrA with mating factor alpha.
Based on the localization we were able to say that MlrA resides in the plasma membrane, but we were unable to conclude the localization of MlrA with the mating factor α. Anyhow, after the enzyme activity assay, we are able to conclude that since both constructs were localized in the P2 fraction (and MlrA additionally in the P3 fraction) and since both had activity, it is most likely that they both reside in the plasma membrane in an active form.
Discussion
In the degradation part of the project, we met our goals partially: we were able to produce the active enzyme in yeast with two of our constructs, but the enzymes didn’t localize as expected and we weren’t able to purify them sufficiently. Nevertheless, we are content with the results we obtained as they show that our project has great potential to be developed further in the future.
When expressing the yeast constructs, we made some interesting observations of the enzymes’ sizes. When the MlrA construct without the mating factor α was expressed in yeast, it was detected on the Western blot as a 28 kDa band. This is the same size as in E. coli, which had been established already by Dziga et al. (2012) who discussed that this might be due to some E. coli specific protease activity, since the calculated mass of the enzyme is 37 kDa and their heterologous production of MlrA in Staphylococcus aureus did not result in a protein of 28 kDa. The results from Dziga et al. also showed that the enzyme was cleaved from the N-terminus, as they had the His tag on the C-terminus and were able to detect it with anti-His antibody in western blot. This was also the case with our results, as we, too had the His tag on the C-teminus; the cleavage happens in the N-terminus. Our results therefore indicate that there might be similar proteolytic activity in S. cerevisiae as there is in E. coli in regards of this enzyme.
Expression of MlrA with the mating factor α signal sequence and propeptide resulted in a protein of about 38 kDa, which corresponds to the calculated size of MlrA. It might be that the secretion tag in front of the enzyme protects it from the proteolytic cleavage, even though the secretion tag itself is apparently cleaved off during processing as it should be; otherwise the protein would have been about"

With this mutation, a so called silent mutation, the amino acid sequence will be the same, but the restriction site will be deleted.
Figure 1| Workflow for the construction of selection marker for yeast. A| Selection of the gene coding for the phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase (TRP1) in the pathway of L-tryptophane synthesis and the gene for β isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (LEU2) in the pathway of the amino acid L-leucine. Both contain restriction sites not conform to the RFC10. B| Amplification of the genes in two fragments. Here, the specific sequence for restriction sites has been deleted using mutagenic primers. These primers contain a mismatch that creates a silent mutation at a specific site in the DNA (base pair is changed - amino acid sequence is not). C| In the last step, we used a set of primers that add prefix and suffix sequences and fused the two fragments of each gene. The obtained genes no longer contain restriction sites (*).
We cloned these genes into the BioBrick backbone pSB1C3 so that it can be introduced into the library.
Composite parts - device to tag proteins in yeast with GFP or mRFP
Furthermore, we intend to create a tool for yeast, which is made out of BioBricks, in order to be able to tag proteins in yeast or fungal cells with different fluorescent markers. We chose two promoters (TEF2 and TDH3) and two terminators (ADH1 and HHO1) from the BioBrick library (full list of used BioBricks in table 2).

The genes for mRFP and GFP were chosen as fluorescent markers and were integrated downstream of and 19 bp long sequence that contain the BamH1/Bgl2 restriction site. The gene of interest (GOI) follows directly behind this adaptor (compare figure 2).

Figure 2. Correlation between electroporation voltage and number of colonies of Bacillus subtilis.
In order to find the optimal electroporation current, electroporation was performed with different voltages. The electroporation was unsuccessful at low currents. The bacteria were not able to take up the plasmids. With too high currents, the bacteria were lysed. The results show that the optimal current for electroporation is at 2.1 kV. At this current the number of successfully transformed bacteria was the highest.

Finally, the KR domain residues which have lost protons are deoxidized to the initial KR domains by other NADPHs.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
Because KR domains catalyzed reactions are involved several steps, it is inpossible for them to be match with any simple mechanism of enzyme catalyzed reactions. After the analysis of equation above, we define that these enzyme catalyzed reactions may be match with [T-C bi-bi + Ping-pong bi-bi] mechanism. In other words, KR domains catalyzed reactions may belong to Ping-pong bi-bi mechanism which include T-C bi-bi mechanism in its former half part.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
(5)DH Part
The leading role of DH Part is DH domain. The function of DH domain is dehydrating the extended unit and enabling it to form the α, β- enol ester bond. In DH domain catalyzed reactions, the oxhydryls in the extended units and the hydrogen atoms binding to the neighbor carbon atoms are removed by DH domains together and form . After catalysis, α, β-enol ester bonds are formed in the polyketide chains.

After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is match with the mechanism of single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions.
The graph of mechanism is written as:

The leading role of ER Part is ER domain. The function of ER domain is deoxidizing the extended unit and enabling it to form the saturated methylene. The mechanism of ER domain catalyzed reactions is similar to KR domain’s. In ER domain catalyzed reactions, NADPHs provide hydride ions and ER domains provide protons for the complexes and deoxidize carbon-carbon double bond to form the saturated methylene.

Nanodropped samples of the TEF primers, and realized that their actual concentration was about 3 orders of magnitude less than the concentration they were labled with.  Perhaps in diluting them the first time, Aaron mistook the number of micrograms of each primer in the tube for a number of micromoles.  In fact, there were only ~20 nanomoles of each primer synthesized.  Based on the nanodrop readings of DNA concentration and the number of micrograms/micromole printed on the tubes, I rediluted them to 20 micromolar.  I checked these via nanodrop.  The 20 uM dilutions of both the TEF primers and the GalKO primers were put into microcentrifuge tubes lables with a $, as I believe that they are on the money.

The purpose of this year’s interlab protocol was to take the absorbance of the              bacterial stain E. Coli (created by transforming the plasmid) and standardize the              fluorescence rate for future use at iGEM.              Our next week of interlab lab work was split into two days: calibration day and              cell measurement protocol day. The team quickly learned the importance of accurate              pipetting as we had our first experiences with the plate reader.
We followed all the protocols provided by iGem, so click here to see the methods and materials we used.
Results:
After overnight incubation, we put out the samples and counted the one that had less             than 300 colonies. After counting the samples, we multiplied with the dilution factor             given in interlab to calculate CFU/mL. We had 6 samples each for positive and negative             controls, and it was categorized by dilution 3, 4, and 5, and each sample had a different             dilution factor according to the protocol. We noticed that there were a samples , so some of             the data had to be left blank. CFU stands for colony forming unit, so the number recorded as              CFU/mL shows the number of colonies present for every 1 mL of sample (similar as concept of              molarity). And the concentration of bacteria is directly related to the fluorescence.              If there is more concentration, it will fluorescence more. The measuring of absorbance also              helped us to see the concentration, since high concentration of bacteria will scatter the              light more than the diluted samples, resulting in the high absorbance value.
In this graph,                 we analyzed the relationship between absorbance and particle count.                 We found out that high absorbance means more scattering due to the                  high concentration of bacteria, and they have linear relationship.
This graph compares                  absorance and the particle count, and we found that slight change in absorbance.                  will change the particle count exponentially
After we analyzed the data                 of fluorscence during the cailibration process, we found that there is a direct                 relationship between fluorescein concentration and fluorscence

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#Achievements_-_-_TEXT.html," it is obvious that the yeast cultured in original product outgrew the sterilized group in the first few hours. Though the two group reach the same level after 19 hours culturing, we could still judge the original blood serum to be better since the reaction time we had estimated for our ATM testing box is around 4 to 5 hours ---- still within the dominant period of original blood serum culturing.
Fig.12 The growth curve of yeast
A: 100% BS  B: 100% FBS
C: 10% BS+ water  D: 10% FBS+ water  G: 1% BS+ water  H: 1% FBS+ water
E: 10% BS+YPD  F: 10% FBS+YPD  I: 1% BS+YPD  J: 1% FBS+YPD
The overall graphic shows that the growth rate of yeast in YPD is faster than water, while during the estimated reaction time, the whole blood serum group also outgrew the water group. The above results suggest that blood serum won’t disturb the proliferation and cell activity of yeast, and even enhance them in water environment. The dominance of original blood serum leads to convenience that users don’t need to filter or heat inactivate complement protein to avoid precipitation.
In conclusion, the modified yeast could survive in blood serum environment provided by users which is the testing environment in our design normally, without any need of further processing.
Future Work
Gα modification
Because human G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) can‘t improperly couple with α subunit of yeasts’ G protein, five carboxy-terminal amino acid residues of the guanine nucleotide binding protein a-subunit (Ga) in yeast Gpa1 can be replaced by human Gα[2]. Human histamine H4 receptor is coupled to Gαi/o proteins [3], so we got the sequence of last five amino acid residues of Gi1 and added it to the primer. Then we used PCR and Gibson assembly to constitute fragment for homologous recombination. Ura3 marker will be recovered after the whole fragment is integrated into yeast genome [4].

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," structure matching
There are two criteria to decide whether two topological structure of regulation can be converted. If the index matrices $R_A$ and $R_B$ only differ in one row, which means only one gene is regulated in a different way in the genetic circuit, we can use two inducible promoters to drive this gene alternately (Fig. 12a). In this case, we conclude that the two topological structures match. Another case is that $R_A$ and $R_B$ can convert mutually by exchanging two rows. In this case, promoter transposition of two genes can swap the ways they are regulated (Fig. 12b).
Figure 12. Sketches of matching topological structure.
So we can use the index matrices to match topological structures that are likely to convert.
5.4 General Steps for designing rewirable circuit
1. List the specifications for the rewirable circuit;
2. Design fitness functions for each function you want to realise based on the quantitative specifications;
3. Scan the topological space to calculate the fitness functions for each topological structure;
4. Match topological structures that can convert mutually;
5. Select a pair of topological structures whose value of fitness function satisfies the specification.

500ml of dH20 (distilled water)
LB Materials

1L graduated cylinder
Filter paper and scupula
Stack of sterile plates (this protocol makes approx 25.)
Bunsen Burner/Ethanol burner
70% EtOH wash bottle
paper towels/wipes
LB Lab Protocol
Part 1. Making the LB broth
This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.
Obtain a clean 1L pyrex bottle
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500ml of dH20 (distilled water) and add to the bottle. Record the amount added.
Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of NaCl, 5 g of Tryptone, and 2.5g of yeast extract on a scale and add them to the bottle. Swirl the bottle in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the amount added. Note that the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before autoclaving.
Part 2. Autoclaving *ONLY DONE BY EXECS*
Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape. Include LB (agar) – your name – date - iGEM. Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps 2 - 5.
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20mins.
The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take necessary measures to prevent burns. After autoclaving, allow the LB media too cool to 55oC before handling.
The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for a 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB is contaminated it will appear cloudy. If the LB contains antibiotics: store in a -4C freezer - (However it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotic will degrade over time)

Our experiments will use a mock-pathogen-contaminated blood sample - a mixture of blood and a liquid E. coli culture containing a known plasmid and gene.
Week 14: Aug 25-29
We have had little success with the synthesized genes in regards to cloning. After multiple attempts it was discovered that the plasmid containing our synthesized gene was not successfully transformed. This was indicated by running digested and undigested plasmid minipreps on a gel, which showed no bands. We are starting from scratch again - transforming E. coli with our synthesized product to obtain viable genes to clone. The construct that was previously apparently successfully assembled was sent for sequencing to verify.
Isothermal PCR appears to work. The positive control showed a smear caused by protein-bound DNA. Cleaning the PCR product with a purification column showed a sharp band at the expected size of 132bp. This was replicated by diluting the PCR products by at least a factor of 10, demonstrating that purification is not strictly necessary. The dilution of the PCR products promotes a dissociation of the protein and bound DNA. When using BioBrick primers to amplify a sequence many small bands <500bp were produced, this was expected as described by the TwistDx manual that optimal amplification occurs for amplicons 200-400bp. The TwistDx resources go on to describe the small bands as ‘primer noise’ that is inherent to the system. Reduction of primer noise is possible namely by screening several variants of primers. We are attempting to reduce the primer noise by synthesizing longer primers 34bp for improved specificity as recommended by TwistDx. Isothermal PCR appeared to work nearly equally well with both whole colonies and purified plasmid as the template (Fig. 2).
Figure 2: Results of isoPCR under standard isothermal conditions using BioBrick primers. Two different sequences were targeted for amplification; C1-λ is a promoter sequence with an expected amplicon size of 406bp; RFP is a coding sequence with an expected amplicon size of 1100bp. Templates used in this experiment were either whole colonies labelled ‘C’, or purified plasmid extracts labelled ‘P’.

As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems. When left unchecked, however, gene modification may interfere with natural biodiversity and lead to irreversible outcomes. Government’s laissez-faire approach to the field of synthetic biology is, therefore, hardly ever seen. Yet the crux of the matter seems to be finding the golden mean as banning GMOs altogether would not necessarily make the world a safer place.

UCL,2014,Team:UCL#Humans#Soci_-_-_TEXT.html," urgency of some environmental issues (Mol and Jänicke 2009). In contrast, the risk society would experience scientific and technological achievement above all as being at the root of many latent environmental perversities. The production demands of industrial societies have brought nature into play as the industrial hazards affected the environment. Consequently, additional political effort and economic investments were needed to manage risk while upholding the initial economic activity. The innovation of science therefore also meant that there were unforeseen harmful effects in terms of how this implicated the state of the natural environment (Rutherford 2009).
With the Goodbye AzoDye Project, the team is in fact piecing together a genetically engineered micro-organism that can help to prevent the spread of hazardous wastewater pollution. In the meantime, it brings attention to an environmental problem that is typical for the industrial society in its ongoing quest to strive for further modern development. Nevertheless, the issue of textile dye effluents was only problematized after it was defined and explained in terms of the existence of actual risks related to what was happening. It was only possible to have the problem recognised as such after it was established that there was a connection between the pathogenic activity of the effluents in rivers and their release from that plants from which they originated. The team therefore needed to base the motivations for their project on studies that could demonstrate a correlation between the two. Some of the most salient studies focussed on the case of the textile dye processing plant along the Cristais River near São Paulo, Brazil, where increasing evidence was found linking the azo dye effluents in the industrial wastewater to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and effects of the water in the surrounding area of the plant.  In the study conducted by Alves de Lima et al. (2007), the effluent was disposed at about 6 km from a drinking water treatment plant where around 60,000 people were exposed to drinking water of which the quality was compromised. The concentrations of effluent in the water (3%) appeared to be highly mutagenic in Salmonella (Alves de Lima et al. 2007; de Aragão Umbuzeiro et al. 2005, 2004).
Hence, in order for the effluent to be considered a risk, the ecological hazard at hand needs to have calculable and predictable qualities. In that way the necessary statistical knowledge can be produced to actually establish the risk through the measurements that have been done. The next step, then, is to develop the appropriate strategy for responsive action to mitigate that risk (Beck 199"

We selected this locus because it has been extensively used in the literature ( 11 ) and it shown to have no deleterious effects on Synechocystis viability. We selected Kanamycin resistance as our selectable marker.
Using this backbone we have decided to put LuxAB under the transaldolase promoter.We have choose the transaldolase promoter to express the luciferase part of the operon, as in the literature the promoter is described as having a peak of expression at 2 hours past dusk, which we believe is just the right timing to ""turn on the lamp"".
We've found 2 versions of the bacterial luciferase which we will use on this construct. The first one is of Photorhabdus luminiscent K216008 from the 2009 Edinburgh iGEM team and the second one is part from the LuxBrick (K325909 from the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team) and originally comes from Vibrio fisherii but has been ""E.coli optimized"".

pSB1C3_IntS
<p>Due to issues mentioned in the results page we designed a new plasmid backbone. This is an integration plasmid which makes Synechocystis susceptible to copper concentrations higher than 0.75 uM 10 by disrupting the CopS gene. We believe that this strategy serves as a biosafety measure to avoid the possibility of having a leakage of recombinant DNA to the environment. The plasmid uses Spectynomycin as a selectable marker.
We plan on expressing LuxCDEG under the control of the promoters Pcaa3 and PsigE (mentioned above). These promoters have peak activities 1 hour before dusk. Based on our modelling we believe that we might enhance bioluminescence yield initially by setting the substrate production/regeneration part of the operon prior to the expression of the luciferase.

Human Practice: The Synthetic Conquest of Mexico.
Objective.
Create a solid opinion about synthetic biology in Mexico, so that it can be exploited best for the country's needs.
Communicate and Conquer
We will soon meet the time when the advance on Synthetic Biology (SB) will touch the everyday life of the world population, as has happened with other technologies on which nowadays we have an apparent dependence, like the internet. However, nobody warned us about the magnitude of the impact such technologies could have upon our society and our decisions. For synthetic biology, if it is desired to change people's lives, it becomes part of the revolution, as well as a responsibility, to:
Extend and diffuse its concept in practical terms for non-science-oriented people to deal with,
Achieve that individuals understand the concept, the potential benefits, and potential risks of SB,
Foment the creation of  well founded individual opinions towards the topic.
These musts will be the objectives to follow in our human practice: The Synthetic Conquest of Mexico, Part I.
Strategy
Since it was impossible to cover the whole range of individuals in Mexico in a statically representative way, we decided to address high school students from the central part of Mexico. High school is a key moment for decisions in life; a moment in which we are open to different conceptions for we have to chose ours. Informing the youth is the first seed in the strategy to inform entire families.
In order to set grounds for the completion of the Synthetic Conquest of Mexico, the strategy we designed consisted of three simple steps:
evaluate what people understand from the SB concept as a first impression (survey 1)
give a dynamic lecture on SB which can inform even  people with no background in biology, with emphasis on:
how biology can be engineered
how biomachines could change our lives in the near future
evaluate what people understand from the SB concept after the talk and when they think it will start changing our lives (survey "
Tsinghua,2011,Team:Tsinghua-A#Modeling#P2A_-_-_TEXT.html," and C6 when (β2,km2)=(30,0.1)
Figure 5 C12 and C6 when (β2,km2)=(120,0.1)
Figure 6 C12 and C6 when (β2,km2)=(60,0.3)
After simulating the system at different parameters, we recorded several critical points for oscillation and made a table as follows.
Table 3 Critical points (β2,km2) for oscillation
Depicting those critical points on an axis, we immediately got the bifurcation line of parameters (β2,km2), which indicates the parameters’ value range when our system can oscillate stably, being marked in ‘bistable’.
Figure 7 Bifurcation Analysis on (β2,km2)
Proportion of cell volume
In actual vivo experiment, volumes of two separate cells might not be the same. We simulate the system by changing the proportion of two types of cells. What we know from the simulation is that cell proportions only affect the amplitude of signal molecules’ oscillation, but no influence to the period or stability of oscillation. The following graphics are drawn under cell proportion 1 and 0.7.
Figure 8 oscillations under different cell proportions
We can find that under different cell proportions, our system can oscillate at different amplitude, and varying in cell proportions may also lead to the change of oscillation period.
Period adjustment
As figure 2 indicates, we expected to adjust oscillation period by adding signal molecule aTc into our system. A small molecule as aTc is, it can easily bind to protein TetR and quickly depletes TetR in cell 2, which results in reduction of TetR net production rate, and indirectly, the protein’s inhibition on promoter5 is crippled. Thus, it would take a longer time for our system to reach each threshold, which is equivalent to prolonging the time delay τ2 in our simplified model. So we can deduce that changing the amount of aTc added into the system in precise model is equivalent to varying the time delay τ2 in simplified model.
Simulation results under distinct τ2 are presented as follows.
Figure 9 Oscillation cycle’s regulation
The result is exactly what we expected, which clearly demonstrates our system can truly be controlled by adding in external signal molecules.
Phase adjustment
In cell 2’s gene circuit, we designed a promoter induced by arabinose, marked by promoter 6 (see in figure 2). Promoter 6 is in a suppressed state until"

Heeello!! =) Today we transformed JM110 with bio brick mRFP generator K516030, cloned before in DH5α. We also transferred DH5α with promoter 1 (K611025) in PSB1C3 and promoter 3 (J23100) in J61002.
To start induced by mercury GFP quantification, we need a positive control. For that we will use DH5α with p26G plasmid (it has a strong promoter for late GFP expression).
p26G plasmid physical map.
So, today we transformed DH5α with plasmid p26G! =)
We also continued wild bacteria’s identification and isolation. Yesterday, on electrophoretic profile of total DNA from these bacteria and we could see plasmids presence! Because of this, we made inoculum today in LB medium to do miniprep tomorrow!
Today... (Phew!! We made a lot of things!) we also had the sequencing results of our first biobricks (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004). We started to process information, making alignments between the sequenced bio bricks and the original sequences!! =)

Type II AFPs are 12-24 kDa homologs that form globular, calcium-dependent lectins and carbohydrate-recognition domains. Two different subgroups of Type II AFPs, calcium-dependent and calcium-independent, have been discovered and differ in regards to whether calcium is necessary for ice binding. Type III AFPs are 7 kDa globular proteins that have unique 3D folds. Type IV AFPs are 12.3 kDa proteins composed of mostly alpha helices (Davies and Sykes, 1997). AFGPs are 3.3 kDa disaccharides consisting of repeating glycopeptide sequences (Ala-Ala-Thr-galactosyl-N-acetyl galactosamine).
The discovery of antifreeze proteins in plants and insects created more classifications because of the differences in amino acid residues and thermal hysteresis activity. Plant AFPs exhibit lower thermal hysteresis than fish AFPs and function to recrystallize ice instead of preventing its initial formation (Griffith and Yaish, 2004). In insects, AFPs are classified into two families: Tenebrio and Dendroides. Tenebrio, also known as Type V AFPs, are found in beetles; Dendroides, also known as Choristoneura fumiferana AFPs, are found in butterflies and moths. Both AFPs have higher thermal hysteresis values than fish AFPs and contain cysteine residues within their protein structures (Graham et al, 1997).
While the specific mechanisms by which AFPs function are unclear, scientists have proposed a variety of different mechanisms based on structural features. They are thought to work by binding water molecules across their relatively flat ice-binding surfaces, maintaining those bonds primarily through van der Waals interactions, with some debate over whether hydrogen bonding or “entropic and enthalipc contributions from hydrophobic residues” keep the structure stability (Davies and Sykes, 1997). To inhibit ice crystal growth, AFPs are believed to adsorb to ice crystals. Normally when ice crystals form in an aqueous solution, the water forms an ice lattice while pushing solutes away. Adsorption restricts the lattice growth of ice crystals to areas between the proteins. This causes the crystals to grow in a way that is thermodynamically unfavorable for water molecules to continue adding to the ice lattice (Raymond and DeVries, 1977"

When both promoters are activated, both sequences (the blue and the red one) are transcribed.  The blue RNA sequence possesses also homology with the red one. But the sequence that can anneal is longer stronger and is therefore more stable than the self annealing of the red sequence. When transcribed, the blue and the red sequences will match together and release the rbs, allowing efficient translation of the recombinase.
Our strategy
These publications ""Genetic switchboard for synthetic biology applications"" and ""Engineered riboregulators enable post-transcriptional control of gene expression"" inspired us. We choose to design different riboswitches keeping some sequences from the original one and changing some nucleotides. This would allow to have one specific riboregulation system for each input, avoiding potential conflicts between riboregulators.
Deeper in the design: RNA secondary structures formation
Here are presented secondary structures of two riboregulators, R0 and R1. The RBS blocking seqence anneals with a strong hairspin to the RBS. The interfering RNA has a free-end sequence complementary to an unlocking sequence of the RBS blocking RNA. When they are both transcribed, the interaction between the two RNAs let free the RBS sequence and the translation is restored.

Xenobiology - The Ultimate Biosafety Tool
The wide use of genetically modified organisms causes concerns on how they will interact in the natural environment. In particular could the genetically modified microbes escape our constrains, and outcompete the organisms found in the natural ecosystem? Could the DNA we inserted into a specific bacteria be transmitted, with unknown spread of information?
Since the early days of genetic engineering we had to reflect on biosafety strategies to control these risks, and synthetic biology is bringing these concerns to another level: the more we tinker with biology, the more our biosafety needs to be bullet-proof.
Xenobiology implements the term ""synthetic"" by creating organisms that are unable to survive in the natural environment and necessitate an artificial intervention from man to exist. It aims to create a synthetic ""man-made"" version of Biology, that respects the definition of life, but is based on entirely different mechanisms to function. The biochemistry of a xeno-organism uses new XNAs, genetic codes and cofactors different from the ones explored by Biology and is therefore incompatible with other forms of life. This allows a much higher level of control: a xeno-organism will not be able to find the xenocompounds in the natural environmentnor will be able to use bacterial communication systems.
We explored this possibility with the longer term vision of creating an X. coli which is metabolically dependent on azo dyes. An alien form of life, different from the one we know, will merge synthetic chemistry with synthetic biology - allowing the remediate the damage that the first one caused and making the remediating agent dependent on the toxic compounds. This system would be completely incompatible and invisible to regular biology, now we can ask: is non-biological life safe enough?
Biological vs. Xenobiological Strategies
Biosafety strategies have so far explored biology to implement clever control mechanisms to control. They investigated various strategies that allow to kill bacteria when needed or that hinder genetic information to spread among different organisms. Our biosafety strategy is exploring the regions outside of Biology, with the"

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Human Practices
Synthetic biology is about more than just slaving away in labs, mixing together tiny amounts of colourless liquids. In particular, our project lends itself well to making an impact on the wider public. Addressing such an important issue as the global energy crisis is a cause worthy of public engagement, which we indeed strived for over the course of the project. It turns out that countless hours spent talking to parents of students at school, writing articles for the school newspaper and presenting talks about our project were not wasted. Mr Zivanic’s Twitter prowess and Jake’s endlessly enthusiastic rambling about our project did not go unnoticed, and by the time Jamboree came around students, teachers and parents alike were engaging with members of our team all the time, asking probing questions about where our money was going as well as raising some of the more serious ethical and moral issues surrounding synthetic biology. Science is meant to be shared with the public and made accessible to everyone, and we believe we have succeeded in this with the human practices side of our project.

Safety
In any successful scientific endeavour, safety is of paramount importance. In order to keep ourselves, our fellow humans, and our environment safe strict biosafety regulations were in place throughout our project. However, from the very start there were two aspects of our project that put us in a unique position in terms of safety considerations. As we wanted to do all the work in our school labs, we had to notify the Health and Safety Executive of our contained use of GMOs. This whole process is set up without High Schools in mind, so the challenge of appointing and training the Biosafety Officer, finding the suitable committee to check on all the policies and finally obtaining the permission to start working was something we didn't initially anticipate. Secondly, given that we didn't have the facilities to store chemically competent cells in school, we had to carry out our transformations at Imperial College. This meant that we had to consider the rules and regulations surrounding safe transport of material across London.
Health and Safety Executive
As our PI had the necessary training he could act as the Biosafety Officer within the school. He scrutinised all the risk assessments"

Cryostock and plasmid isolation of the overnight cultures prepared yesterday by Lycka and preparation of samples for sequencing of plasmids isolated yesterday and today. Sequence of mCerulean was confirmed (although it had a silent mutation). OmpA_Sil_Sdom in pSB4A5 and INP_Sil_Sdom in pSB1C3 had a deletion to be fixed by PCR. The rest of sequences either contained the random GFP sequenced mentioned before (since they are old ligation products) or multiple mutations that could not be fixed by PCR.

Aim: To test the prepared chemocompetent E.Coli- cells.
Results:
Plate with kanamycin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with ampicillin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with tetracyclin: full (as expected, due to natural resistance)
Plate with chloramphenicol: 12 colonies (not expected, should be empty)
The plating on a chloramphenicol containing plate will be repeated, at 37°C over night instead of room temperature over the weekend, because perhaps chloramphenicol is degraded by the bacteria after two days

Trigger RNA-Toehold-GFP System
We aimed to show Toehold switch system’s incapability of protein expression when it is alone, which means the Trigger RNA and Toehold Switch must coexist  for protein expression. To observe  Toehold swtich’s and and Toehold Swtich-Trigger RNA’s coexisting results both, we designed Toehold switch and trigger RNA in different biobricks. Because of origin incompatibility process, we had to clone these two different gene sequences into different plasmids. Thus we cloned Toehold-GFP into ColA originated PColA plasmid, and Trigger RNA into ColE originated PSB1C3 plasmid.
The ordered form of Toehold G-blocks is shown above. We preferred to use T7 promoter, which is a very strong promoter in this gene’s design. Thus there won’t be any difficulty in Toehold-GFP RNA’s production. The RBS of GFP presented in Toehold structure. To clone Toehold-GFP sequence into PSB2C3 and pColA plasmids both, we added RFC 10 suffix region on 3’ end and RFC 10 prefix region  on 5’ end of Toehold-GFP. We also put BamHI restriction sitebetween Toehold and GFP. After GFP expression, which shows that Toehold-trigger system works, any protein could be replaced with GFP.  In our project, GFP will be replaced with TEV protease.
Trigger RNA, which turns on Toehold switch system, is shown above in its ordered form as G-Blocks. In the design of this biobrick, we used T7 promoter, which has a strong mRNA production rate. By doing these, an enough amount of Trigger RNA will be produced to open Toeholds. There is no RBS in this product, because Trigger RNA doesn’t codes a protein. Its only task is opening Toehold switch in order to produce protein. To clone Trigger RNA sequence into PSB1C3 plasmid, we added RFC10 prefix on 3’ end and RFC10 suffix on 5’ end.

Curiositas
Curiositas, held at Orsay, is art-and-science festival that took place on October 4th to 9th. During an interactive debate named ""BioArt in the light of ethics"", our teams talked with Marion Laval-Jeantet, artist and promoter of the festival, the Parisian iGEM teams (Paris Bettencourt and Evry teams) and the audience. The debate was facilitated by a mediator, Alexandre Peluffo, biologist and ethics student.
Every IGEM team described their projects and Marion Laval-Jeantet went back over her bioart project: she has injected herself with horse blood plasma. The ultimate goal is to explore trans-species relationships: the project was more artistic and sentimental-oriented than pure science applications. The theoretical part was done on a French lab for purification of horse blood and separation of all immunoglobulins. She prepared her body to accept different horse immunoglobulins over the course of several months before the real injection of horse blood plasma. This project was a success and this experience has provided data for many studies on immunoglobulin use in medicine.
One of the questions in the debate was the definition of life. The subject was introduced by a quote from biologist François Jacob ""There are no life in labs"". Marion Laval-Jeantet expressed two things: first, definition of life is at the center of bioartists' work. Secondly, different artists' visions create different definitions. So there is not a consensual definition of life nowadays. Other aspects"
BIT-China,2018,Team:BIT-China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," about our own project and                                 started to think a new way to let public understand our project.
Public Engagement
We always want the public to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. We believe that if                                 you want to promote something, you should publicize it in a way which is closer and appealing                                 to the public. At the age of big data, using the popularity of new-media industry to spread                                 ideas is more convenient, more extensive, and more effective. Therefore, we decided to film some videos to promote synthetic biology and iGEM.
Videos about synthetic biology
In order to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology to the public and to publicize our                                 projects, we have taken several beauty blogger-style videos about synthetic biology and                                 published them on several video platforms (Which are most used by young people in China). We                                 believed this kind of way to popularize science is effective. In the video, our team members                                 introduced the knowledge including the pipette and the plate coating in vivid form and humorous                                 tone. The videos are very popular and get many positive influence.
Video about iGEMer
We always want to promote the influence of iGEM, and let more people know how important iGEM is                                 for iGEMers. So we filmed a video to show how an iGEMer find herself by attending an iGEM                                 team(BIT-China) and published it on several video platforms. The video is based on the mv of Taylor Swift`s Delicate. This video not only shows a growing road of an iGEMer, but also let                                 more people learn about iGEM.

We sought to solve a major problem in aquaculture - high ammonia concentration in aquaculture water. High ammonia concentration is resulted from metabolite expelled from fish, which accumulated in pond water and cannot be all utilized by microorganisms in water. This may lead to widespread death of pond fish and cause damage to fish farmers. Therefore, UCAS iGEM developed an ammonia sensor to monitor water quality and a degradation machine to remove excessive ammonia. We hope to save lives of fish and provide people with more delicacies.
We characterized three nitrogen-dependent promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp to report high nitrogen amount in aquaculture water. These three promoters are regulated by NtrC, which composes a two-component system with NtrB is activated under low-nitrogen stress. We tested the signal-noise ratio, response delay to ammonium-starvation and maximal strength of these promoters and selected the best one for our reporter RFP. By expressing RFP from such a nitrogen-regulated promoter, we constructed a nitrogen sensor particularly sensitive to ammonium concentration which emitts red fluorescence in low-ammonium environment, representing safe environment for fish.
We designed two pathways to tackle excessive ammonia in aquaculture water, one of which converts ammonium into dinitrogen gas through a NH3-NH2OH-N2H4-N2 process and the other converts ammonia into uric acid precipitation by introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into"

Therefore waste conditioned media is an appropriate and novel experimental media with which to characterise biobricks within a mixed waste/landfill context. These data are also characterisation of an existing biobrick (BBa_K639003)
Growth and induction assays of our Biobricks in LB
Growth and induction assays of our project biobricks. Several of our constructs contain sfGFP within an operon and therefore fluorescence can be utilised to determine if expression is being induced by either addition of Arabinose or Xylose as appropriate to the construct. All of these characterisation assays were undertaken in LB media.
Bdh2 with pelB secretion tag growth assay. E. coli (MG1655) transformed with pelB-bdh2 BBa_K1149013 were grown with either 0 μM or 6 μM Arabinose to induce bdh2 and sfGFP expression. Bdh2 induction shows reduced growth of MG1655 but after 6h they reach the same OD, the decrease in growth is confirmed as not significant by a two-tailed t-test where p = 0.6964 > 0.05 (critical value). Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.

We see that induction leads to stronger expression of bdh2 than without, although the promoter is leaky as the curve follows a similar pathway. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Bdh2 with no pelB secretion tag growth assay. MG1655 with intracellular bdh2 were grown over 6h to gauge the effect on growth when induced. Graph shows that while they reach the same end point, growth is initially faster without induction for BBa_K1149050 , though this was not significant as a two-tailed t-test gave p = 0.4930 > 0.05, allowing us to accept the null hypothesis.

There were no bands of the correct size in the lanes.  The only band that appeared was a faint, short band in one lane that likely was a primer.  Since the DNA ladder worked, the problem likely was not with the electrophoresis but with the PCR reaction, perhaps due to issues with the primers.

Today we started work on a program to statistically generate possible sequences.
The four functions needed to do this are:
generate(matrix, pseudocounts (lambda), dependency tuples)
takes a matrix of zinc-finger AA position counts, a list of dependent amino acid pairs, and a pseudocount multiplier and generates a list of potential amino acid sequences weighted by independent and dependent probabilities
add_pseudo(dependent matrix row,independent matrix row)
given a matrix row of dependent counts (i.e. how many times 'a' occurs at position n when 'b' is set to some AA at position m) and a row of independent matrix counts (how many times 'a' occurs at n regardless of b's AA) return an adjusted matrix row, based on the dependent matrix row, that has pseudocounts added to the values that are empty in the dependent matrix row but filled in the independent matrix row.

Blog #17 - Open Hardware at the Maker Faire Hannover
Michael 03:55, 6 July 2014 (CDT)
This weekend Florian , René and Michael joined Ansgar on a trip to the Maker Faire Hannover 2014 .
The Maker Faire is an exhibition with things that people built on their own using readily available tools. Dozens of 3D printers and microcontrollers can be examined and there are a lot of devices visitors can interact with. Apart from the fire-spitting dragon, our OD and fluorescence measurement devices attracted a lot of attention. We spoke with hundreds of visitors and had a lot of interesting conversations.
Saturday evening, Carsten Ludwig from the iGEM Team Braunschweig visited us. We showed him the most fascinating stands and afterwards went to the city to walk the Red Thread of Hannover , a track going past 36 very central tourist attractions as e.g. the roofless church:
On this quick sightseeing trip we took a nice panorama of the Aegidienkirche .
When the #NEDCRC soccer game started, we settled for some hamburgers, fermentation broth and exchanged funny stories about our lab experience.
On Saturday the run on our stand had been so enormous that we had to improvise and print new flyers at our hostel for Sunday, the second and last day of the fair. Just like the day before, a lot of people showed interest in our stand and especially René passionately demonstrated our devices and informed about synthetic biology as well as our project ""Cellock Holmes"".
At about midday, Manuel, advisor of Team Bielefeld , visited us and got to experience our measurement device too.
When we left Hannover Monday morning, we decided to"

One simple example of this would be biofilm formation in food   processing  plants  where  they  cause  extensive  losses  due  to  equipment  failure  or  necessary   extensive cleanup. In past few decades detection of quorum sensing signals in spoiled food products has added a   new dimension to study the process of food spoilage. The bacterial phenomenon of cell­to­cell   communication using signaling molecules is known as quorum sensing. Bacteria takes decisive   action  based  upon  assessing  local  cell  densities.  Cell­to­cell  communication  depends  on  the   production  of,  secretion  of,  and  response  to  small,  diffusible  signal  molecules  called   ""autoinducers"".  The  signal  molecules  are  produced  and  secreted  at  a  basal  level  during   bacterial growth. Their  concentration in the environmental medium or matrix increases as the   bacterial population expands, and when it reaches a threshold level (quorum level).  It induces   phenotypic  effects  by  regulating  quorum­sensing  dependent  target  gene  expression.  This   phenomenon occurs without any external intervention and is also referred to as auto induction.  A  very  common  quorum  system  found  widely  in  gram  negative  bacteria  is  AHL  based   communication.  AHL  or  N­Acyl  Homoserine  Lactone  is  an  autoinducer,  a  part  of  quorum   sensing  network  in  multiple  bacteria  and  has  thus  confirmed  the  role  of  inter  cell  signaling   pathway in food spoilage. They are found in milk and other dairy products which are the fastest   among  the  perishable  items  to  get  spoilt.  A  systematic  study  has  discovered  spoilage  to  be   caused by AHL producing bacteria.  This study and its results brought new perspective into how   food  spoilage  can  be  prevented  by  selectively  targeting  this  signaling  pathway  and  thus   preventing microbial action to take place despite their favorable number and conditions. Quorum­sensing  signaling molecules  can be detected from  cell free  supernatants, extracts of   food samples, and spent culture"

Cell Counting: Machine Learning
Our initiative to automate cell culture experiments using GCODe extended itself naturally into a software component — to count cells from images automatically. Haemocytometry — a cell counting technique traditionally used to count blood cells — uses a glass slide etched with a grid to provide a systematic way to estimate cell counts. Analyzing haemocytometer images manually is extremely tedious and some cell-counting programs exist to count these cells automatically, but none use the infinite versatility of neural networks.
One step of the initial image-processing based method
As a result, we tried to develop our own Machine Learning-based cell counting software, using Artificial Neural Networks. To do this, we needed images of cells to train our algorithm to distinguish between cells and background under various conditions of lighting and image quality. We initiated an All-India iGEM team collaboration, in which teams across the country — Team IISER Pune , Team IISER Mohali and Team IIT Madras — helped us to gather images that formed the training data sets for our neural network, following a detailed protocol we sent them. We were not able to achieve the desired results, due to issues with our model. A detailed description of our efforts is given below:

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Essays_-_-_TEXT.html," have the potential to do some amazing things, however if some of the solutions are implemented there is a potential for a large sector of work to lose jobs. This means companies will become obsolete and no longer be undertaking business and this is not good for economic growth, especially in the developing world. For example if Palm Oil is made synthetically, it is possible that the industry for farming Palm Oil may be affected. What will happen to the workers on the plantations?
Another ethical issue to be considered is the ownership of devices and DNA sequences engineered. Recently a law has been passed stating that any naturally occurring sequence of DNA cannot be patented, only human designed sequences can be patented. Therefore none of the naturally occurring genes can be owned by any one person or organisation and anyone can use the sequences as they are open source. Once again there are economic implications to consider because of this. An example is business growth, any two companies could make the same device and neither would make a profit (although not everyone thinks a change in business practices would necessarily be a bad thing) [4,5] .
As mentioned above, most of the DNA sequences in synthetic biology are open source. This means anyone can access them and, if they have a molecular biology lab, can create devices containing these sequences. This means that potentially someone with enough knowledge and interest could take harmful genes and use these to create bio-weapons. This issue hoes by the name of bioterrorism. This concern leads to numerous questions; should all DNA sequences be made publicly available? Should some of the sequences be treated with caution and be regulated? And should these sequences only be available to people who are granted permission on certain terms agreed, ethical terms? [5] .
The issue of Bio-terrorism leads to the issue of regulation. Currently there are not many regulatory bodies around for Synthetic Biology because it is a relatively new field. However, there is self regulation ongoing in the field but many people are concerned that this is not enough. At the moment, Synthetic Biology practises are regulated by genetic modification laws and bodies etc. One of these organisations is the UN Bioweapons convention, which controls the convention of biological diversity on an international level. There are also many directives that apply to europe and a separate set of organisations for the USA. However these are all GMO (genetically modified organism) specific and not specific to Synthetic Biology techniques as such [3,5] .
Furthermore, there are concerns about the safety of the modified organisms that synthetic biology creates. As these organisms are classed as ""new"" it sometimes isn't possible to predict what they will do, or what they will"

For evaluation, the QS-dependent promoters were cloned in front of the lux-reporter cassette of the vector pBS3C-lux from the Bacillus BioBrickBox of the iGEM LMU team 2012.
QS Two Component System
The two component system agrCII-A for S. aureus has been designed as a composite part derived from Staphylococcus aureus N315 gDNA.   The two intermediated parts agrC-II and agrA were amplified by PCR using primers with modified RFC25 prefix and suffix. And then fused by using the restriction sites EcoRI and SpeI for agrC-II, as well as XbaI and PstI for agrA, thus creating the composite part agrCII-A .
The operon encoding for the histidine sensor kinase ComD and the response regulator ComE comDE for S. pneumoniae sensing was designed in two different ways: On one hand, the native comDE operon with its native ribosome binding site (RBS) ( BBa_K1351015 ), on the other hand thecomDE operon with the B. subtilis adapted RBS (TAAGGAGG) in the BioBrick standard RFC25 ( BBa_K1351016 ). Unfortunately, the operon contains two EcoRI and one SpeI restriction site. The attempts to mutagenize these restriction sites were not completed successfully in time as one recognition site remained. Thus, the comDE operon could not been sent to the registry - but this will be accomplished as soon as possible.
QS dependent Promoters
In S. aureus, the AgrA-sensitive promoters P2 BBa_K1351037 and P3 BBa_K1351038 with four AgrA binding sites downstream of the -35 signals were used for evaluation. The intergenic region with suspected regulator binding sites is shown in Fig. 3

After shining blue light on the plate, nothing glowed. We realized that this was because we did not have a spacer between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon, meaning the ribosome would not be able to reach both sites. After doing some reading, we realized that a spacer of 6-10 bps is ideal. We will design this tomorrow.
Re-do minipreps for control backbones with new protocol
We used the new protocol to do a miniprep on the control backbones.
We got (unusually?) high yields using the new technique.
Our yields were extremely high with the new technique--it was difficult to believe. We were a bit wary of the nanodrop readings so we decided to run the product on a gel and  compare the brightness of the band to the ladder in order to determine the actual concentration of DNA present in the miniprep product.
We ran a gel of our new miniprep product.
The first six lanes are our miniprep product. The next four contain serial dilutions of the Zif 268 plasmid. We determined that it looks like our miniprep product actually contains ~80 ng/ul of DNA, after comparing it with the 1650 bp band.
Ligation and transformation of Oligo 5 and 6 and CB Bottom
We decided to try the ligation of our oligos and the backbone, using our previous protocol. We then transformed the product using ChemComp cells, plating 50 and 450 ul.
Cutting the Oligo Pool
We decided to try cutting a pool of our 18 oligos. We used our new recipe, adding 0.78 ul of each oligo so that the DNA takes up a total of 16 ul. We followed the new protocol for one reaction, and the other digestion was left to run overnight. We will compare the results tomorrow.

USP-EEL-Brazil,2018,Team:USP-EEL-Brazil#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," due to its low degree of substrate specificity, this protein is effective in the oxidation of various compounds.
The active site of the enzyme has a cluster of four copper atoms, which can be distinguished by spectroscopic analysis. The first atom consists of a blue copper ion (type 1), which classifies the laccases belonging to the family of the blue copper proteins. The other three atoms are divided into one of type 2 and two type 3 ions.
Source: BARRIOS-ESTRADA et al, 2018
The enzymatic effectiveness in the oxidation of phenols occurs due to the presence of this cluster in the molecule. While copper type 1 oxidizes the substrate, the other three atoms are responsible for reducing oxygen in water. In this reaction, the oxidation electron is transferred to the three copper ions, forming a trinuclear agglomerate, which transfers electrons to the terminal acceptor oxygen. Upon receiving four electrons, the oxygen has its complete reduction.

A variety of studies, in which laccase was used in the degradation of more varied micropolluantes from water and soil, was performed. In these, the enzyme demonstrated the potential of application in the remediation of several compounds, such as drugs, pesticides and the estrogens themselves.
Why Phoma sp. ?
Phoma sp. is a fungus appurtenant to the Ascomicota phylum, Pleosporales order, Pleosporaceae family and has more than 80 species. It’s possible to identify it by its spores found inside the mycelium fungal; this characteristic allows us to identify this fungus frequently.  One of our two genes comes from Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 (DSM 2245):3073 pb – 607 aa. We choose this fungus enzyme because it copes with diverse physicochemical conditions found in aquatic habitat. Besides that, its laccase has a potential in degradation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), our chemical targets. Its studies have shown a promising biotechnological solution for EDCs degradation presents in water.
Why Pleurotus Ostreatus?
The genus Pleurotus, appurtenant to the basidiomycetes class, it’s composed by cosmopolitan, saprophytic or parasites species. This fungus can produce many enzymes, like peroxidases, laccases, cellulases, hemicellulases and xylanases, characteristic that allow it to grow in lignocellulosic substrates"

Valencia,2012,Team:Valencia Biocampus#Results3_-_-_TEXT.html," performed experimental evolution tests. We started by comparing the growth of the original Bac2 strain and the cheaters, at different concentrations of antibiotic.
In all cases the curves were similar: Bac2 and the cheaters grew at a same rate up to 265 minutes, after which a variation in the growth pattern was observed: the cheaters started to grow faster.
Figure 3. Growth pattern of Bac2 and the cheaters in separated cultures.
After that we decided to characterize mixed cultures of both Bac2 and the cheaters (50% each, adjusted in terms of O.D), both let grown together. Under these conditions, the growth pattern was as follows.
Figure 4. Growth pattern of Bac2 and the cheaters mixed in the same proportion
in the same culture.
We took aliquots at time 0’, 165’, 340’ and 24h and spread them on solid medium in order to check which was the predominating population. We performed the same experience at 37ºC and 40ºC and we carried out colony PCR with oligos amplifying the Bac2 insert in order to tell between honest and mutant colonies. We obtained the following results:
- At 37ºC, and after 165 and 340 minutes, Bac2 were clearly predominant over the cheaters (the initial rate honest:cheaters was 1:1). That suggests that at this temperature the growth of the cheaters is not favoured, probably because the larger size of the plasmid of the mutant strain, which is bigger than the original Bac2 (Figure 2), or the presence of un-optimal sequences, such as two replication origins.
Figure 5. Percentages of Bac2 and the cheaters at time 165, 340 and 1440 min
at 37ºC determined by colony PCR.
- In the 40ºC experience, at time 0 minutes, as expected both clones appeared in the same number, but after 165 minutes the percentage of Bac2 had started to slightly decrease (44%) and after 340 minutes they only appeared in a very low rate (4%). These tendency was confirmed after 24 h, when no Bac2 were detected.
Figure 6. Percentages of Bac2 and the cheaters at time 165, 340 and 1440 min
at 37ºC determined by colony PCR.
Taken together, these results clearly indicate that both original Bac2 and cheater clones exhibit different growth rates and, when combined at high temperature, mutants tend to grow faster and/or inhibit the growth of Bac2. This leads to a"

I made our team abstract. My poor English fails me.
Our team project is related to the detection system for heavy metals which are harmful for environment, such as arsenic, mercury, and cadmium. The purpose of this project is to detect the concentration of heavy metals in the waste water with mixed color system. We use several flurosence proteins GFP RFP and amd gene as detection markers. Each heavy metal promoter produce matched flurosence protein. For examples, High concentration of Arsenic could induce the green flurosence with GFP proteins. Such system works very well as accurate as ppb (parts per billion concentration) Finely, the mixed heavy metals produce gradient and mixed colors according to light mixed rules. This system is more effective than previous circuits because of integrated analysis.

Building Success - People Power!
A critical component of every company is the team that stands behind it. Here at FREDsense Technologies, we have a strong team making this possible. We have both a motivated group of founders with significant experience in both the technology and working together as well as a dedicated group of advisors with varied skills and experienece.
Ownership
The team is a critical component of any business and is therefore of critical importance to ensure our success within FREDsense.  FREDsense was born out of the Calgary 2012 iGEM project, which developed the initial ideas for the technology behind our toxin detecting device.  While the team was composed of over 30 students, six key players have joined together to develop this technology into a feasible business.  Because of the number of students and professors which were involved in the previous year's project, numerous tasks were assigned to determine our group's right to operate within the framework of the iGEM competition.  Our approach to IP protection, and how we have collected our intellectual property can be found in the IP section of the wiki .
Company Structure
The founding members have divided themselves into distinct roles based on experience and skills in order to achieve our goals. These include the roles of Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Executive Officer.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Delftibactin#MMCoA_-_-_TEXT.html," didn't contain any DNA, as expected.
Week 11
In this week the whole procedure was repeated again from fragment amplification to extensive colony PCR. This week several different colony types were encountered and one that grew only after 3 days actually gave a band at 1.2 kb, but it turned out to be unspecific.
Week 12
Several possible error sources such as unselective plates were investigated, but all turned out to be fine. The colony PCR was then repeated using yet another primer pair, but it still only gave unspecific or no bands.
Week 13
In order to check whether the cell line used was actually the right one primers against sfp were used and cell from other subgroups were included. It turned out that something really weird was going onwith the cells, since sfp could not be detected. Thus the entirely new strategy of generating a plasmid instead of doing genomic integration was initialised.
Week 14
To be really sure about the sfp a new plasmid preparation was made and cells were tranformed again. In parallel the pLF03 was also prepared and sent for sequencing. It turned out, that there is a deletion in the sequence and thus the primers can't bind properly.
Week 15
A final try on integrating the methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway was made. At the same time new plasmids carrying the pathway arrived and had to be validated first via PCR and restriction digestion. Several PCR reaction were run and also the first Gibson assembly and transformation was done for both plasmids. The positive colonies were sent for sequencing by the end of the week.
Week 16
After finally giving up on the genomic integration we focused on the plasmid strategy, where the sequencing results of the two plasmids arrived. As they were already positive glycerol stocks were prepared.
Week 17
In order to check for sfp expression pMM64, carrying an indigoidine synthetase was cotransformed, but didn't give any blue colonies. Thus the plasmid backbone had to be changed to allow for cotransformation with our own indigoidine construct. One of the new plasmids was sent for sequencing.
Week 18
The sequencing results of pIK1.3 revealed a point mutation in the permeability device. All the other plasmids sent for sequencing also carried some kind of mutation that introduced a stop codon within the permeability device, which is thus non-functional. Moreover there were still no blue colonies even though we now used our own construct.

India
Foundation for Mother and Child Health
Through a connection with our PI, David Bernick, we met Piyasree Mukherjee, CEO of the Foundation for Mother and Child Health in India. According Ms. Mukherjee,  her community possesses differing views on birth control. Some deem birth control a “money trap” because it requires device replacement or multiple rounds of a prescription. Others are skeptical and/or not knowledgeable about birth control because of the lack of information. Our team knows that birth control is expensive, but this was the first time that we heard that women felt gouged by necessary recurrent purchases of birth control methods. We will continue to update this information when their questionnaire responses arrive.
Italy
Aurora, Previous Resident & Student
During her time in Italy, Aurora found it difficult to use her preferred form of birth control and was instead pushed to use an IUD. IUDs, although common, are accompanied by potential painful side effects; Aurora described her first IUD experience as “super painful”. Read More >> IUDs typically last 3-6 years, and when Aurora eventually needed to get her IUD replaced, doctors informed her that her cervix was too small for the second IUD, so she received medicine to soften her cervix. She withstood torturous cramps during the process and relayed to us, “if it hurt that [much] putting it in, I’m worried about getting it out”. We asked Aurora about religious implications of birth control in Italy, and she described Italy is a heavily Catholic country where in most cases, religious leaders discourage use of birth control methods because they view it as sin. Regardless of the fact that Italy has easier access to contraceptives compared to most other countries we’ve heard from, the country’s religious overtones halt many from pursuing birth control for fear of harassment and ostracism. Aurora is yet another individual who proves that a more discrete birth control method like ours would greatly benefit women in countries where stigma on birth control still exists.

Therefore, high-producers will synthesize enough amount of tetracycline efflux pumps to maintain alive while low-producers won’t be able to survive. Consequently, the average intracellular glutamate concentration among the population is enhanced, which will finally lead to γ-PGA yield enhancement in LL3.
Proof of Function
Vector pHT01-PgltAB-LacI-Pgrac-TetA was converted into LL3, and correct transformants were fermented in M9 culture medium with different extracellular glutamate concentrations (0, 2.5 and 5g/L). From the 6th hour, we tested bacteria with several assays every 3 hours. LL3 Δbam strain was chosen as control system.
Expression level of tetA by microplate assay
To test the expression of tetA, we tagged it with the fluorescent reporter GFP-coding gene ( BBa_K2705004 ), whose expression was detected by microplate assay (395nm\509nm). The intracellular glutamate concentration and bacteria concentration (OD600) were also examined, respectively. (See Figure 2.) It could be concluded that with the increasing glutamate in medium, intracellular glutamate concentration went high, and tetA of PopQC was upregulated to express. The results suggested that the system can help individuals with higher intracellular glutamate concentration express more TetA, so that be able to survive in the tetracycline condition.
Figure 2. The relationship of extra- and intra-cellular glutamate concentration and FI of GFP /OD600 in plateau stage. The strains were cultured in fermentation medium with 10 µg/mL tetracycline for 24 hours. Intracellular glutamate concentration, OD600 and FI of GFP were measured in plateau stage. Data indicate mean values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in triplicates.a. The relationship between extra- and intracellular glutamate concentration. The value illustrates the relationship between glutamate concentration in medium and intracellular glutamate concentration. b. The relationship between intracellular glutamate concentration and FI of GFP /OD600 in Plateau stage. The value illustrates the effect of glutamate concentration on GFP fluorescence intensity, which is normalized against OD600. *Significantly different (P < 0.05) by Student's t-test.

USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#develop.php_-_-_TEXT.html," We make their positions now their final positions for arrangement. The parameters of gravitation and repulsion are determined by experiments. The advantage of the algorithm is that it can arrange the graph like a tree and reduce the cross of edges greatly to show the relationships among the nodes more lucidly.
Force-directed algorithm and GPU acceleration: the time complexity of the arrangement algorithm is O(n^2), so it will take a long time if the number of the nodes is large. So we spill the algorithm among several threads (users can still operate while the back end is calculating) and use the powerful ability for floating-point computation and parallel computation of GPU to accelerate the calculation. Taken multi-platform support into consideration, we use opencl as our programming language. The acceleration uses socket communication for data transfer. The front end send the amount of the nodes, the number and position of each node, the amount of the links and the number of nodes each edge connects to the calculation end. The calculation end spill the computation that the computation of each node is done in a single thread. Visit all the nodes and edges only once and we can get the acceleration of each node. When the computation is done, the calculation end sends every node’s position to the front end.

Framework
Our server uses Linux as operating system, MongoDB to manage abundant biological data, including information of millions of nodes, and MySQL database to store data of users and information of projects and species. Our server-side program is based on Django development, and is optimized for multi-node and remote-controlling circumstances, ensuring that your request will be answered wherever you are. When a node breaks down, our server will separate the node from the group and realize automatic failover.
Account System:
Oauth is used as login credential. You just need to provide your Google or Baidu account and use Biopano conveniently without signing up. Meanwhile, Oauth is decoupled with local account system, providing convenience for developers to offer more ways for authentication.
Rapid Server Deployment:
We do not recommend users to build at local Biopano server, for one of the main advantages of Biopano is data sharing. However, for special cases such as intranet, you could use the docker repository we provide to deploy a Biopano server rapidly. We encapsulate basic databases to offer powerful basic biological data support for your intranet server.
Interface Design:
The server communicate with front end based on HTTP protocol. It uses interfaces of RESTful style. It is a kind of completely public and universal interface and offers detailed documentation. You can develop your own applications based on these interfaces."

M13 Bacteriophage
M13 Bacteriophage
The M13 bacteriophage infects E. coli by attaching to the F pilus and injecting single-stranded DNA into the cell. Because the mechanism requires the F pilus, only E. coli cells carrying the F plasmid (F+ cells) can be infected.
The M13 genome takes on two forms: the single-stranded infective form (IF), and the double stranded replicative form (RF).  When the IF form is initially deposited into the cell, the complementary strand is synthesized by host-encoded enzymes forming the RF form. Protein II nicks the RF form and initiates rolling circle replication, producing additional single stranded copies of the genome that are again converted into RF form by host-encoded machinery. During this process, the M13 genome increases in copy number and viral proteins accumulate in the cell. When protein V reaches a critical concentration in the cell, it binds strongly and cooperatively to single stranded IF DNA, sequestering it to be packaged into viral particles and preventing further accumulation of the RF form [1] (Figure 1).

Food Warden
The Food Warden
The Food Warden is a system which detects meat spoilage. It uses Bacillus subtilis cells. Their natural genetic response to the gases of rotten meat has been identified and linked to a pigment production system. In this way, a consumer can easily see when the meat is spoiled: it's rotten and you know it!
read more
How does it work?
Volatiles from rotten meat activate the PsboA promoter, triggering the production of pigments (blue or yellow).
More details can be found on our Data Page .
Stop the food waste!
Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food are thrown away worldwide (one third of total food production), partly due to the fact that best before dates are imprecise. A reliable way of monitoring whether food is spoiled or not could save money and reduce food waste.

4.20---5.19
project planning
Before we decided our project, we brainstormed many times and  put forward ideas with each other. With the help of advisors ,we determined to design our “Enzyme Brick”. To prepare the experiments, we spent days on searching literatures and shared with others. After discussing with advisors, we defined our project planning.
5.20---7.10
constructing carrier
At the beginning of the experiment, we designed the carriers we need.(Scaffolding I，Scaffolding II, Scaffolding III and enzyme). We transformed them for expression in E. coli.
7.11---7.15
Expressing and fermenting scaffolding protein，SDS-PAGE
After expression in E. coli., we fermented to achieve the goal of increasing protein amount. According to the result of SDS-PAGE, we make sure the success of expression of scaffolding and enzyme, we used SDS-PAGE to check out our experimental results.
7.16---7.25
Adsorbing the scaffolding protein  and measuring the efficiency of adsorption
In this period，our work was relatively simple，with three stages.
1、Connect Scaffolding II with Scaffolding I
2、Connect Scaffolding II with Scaffolding III
3、Integrate enzyme with the whole scaffolding
8.1----8.10
Measuring the purity of BCA protein
At the end of experiment, we used BAC protein quantitative kit to measure the amount of protein we adsorbed in order to ascertain the adsorption efficieny.

The α-Hemolysin Transport System
The ɑ-hemolysin transport system is an ABC transporter complex consisting of three proteins, namely the outer membrane protein TolC, hemolysin B (HlyB), and hemolysin D (HlyD) Gentschev I, Dietrich G, Goebel W.

Two 1kΩ resistors were put in parallel with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as Arduino Nano can only provide 5V output. Then we found the working voltage was 1.90V and the current is 1.75mA. (pic3.LED v/pic4.LED a)
To solve the problem of excessive ammonia in fishing ponds, we designed a biosensor and a degrading pathway.
Sensor
To efficiently detect the ammonia in fishing ponds, we employed the nitrogen-sensitive promoter glnAp2. As the results shown by sensor-results , the promoter is able to discriminate the difference of the ammonium concentration in an extremely low level (Fig 1), with a remarkable signal-noise ratio and fluorescence intensity (fig 2, 3).
In terms of our real application, we constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Although after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, it still displays the robust ability to respond to different ammonium concentrations specifically (Fig 5).
Considering the response delay, we found that glnAp2 responded to ammonium-deficiency most rapidly (fig 6), taking less than 5 hours. Since our sensor will be used in aquaculture ponds, where 5 hours is a period short enough for farmers to take actions, we believe this promoter can be used in our device. Furthermore, with future optimization, response delay can be even shorter, enabling more efficient responses to elevate water quality and reduce harm caused to fish.
In reality, however, aquaculture water is a complex mixture of different compounds, including a lot of nitrogenous compounds. One of the main nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture water is nitrate, which reaches a concentration of 60uM. Therefore, to see whether real-world nitrate would interfere with ammonium-sensing ability of our selected promoter glnAp2, we we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Fig 4).

Rice,2016,Team:Rice#Humans Of Syn Bio_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM team. Since becoming involved in iGEM, I have been in charge of ‘Human Practices,’ where I integrate synthetic biology with community perspectives and bridge gaps in scientific knowledge. This year we have been placing a greater emphasis on community outreach, especially looking toward the next generation of scientists. Events such as Building with Biology and the IBB Girls Bioethics Debate are great ways to provide necessary initial exposure to these students. I am excited to see how they may advance the field of Syn Bio and fearlessly embrace its potential. Before coming to college, I could never picture myself as a hard core scientist. Now, I cannot imagine my future career without applying my passion for research. From discoveries in plant molecular genetics to engineering biological pathways using well-characterized molecules, I cultivated a broad knowledge base and gained keen perspectives on problem solving. For me, everything comes back to the cycle of passing knowledge forward. Without the mentorship structures from Rice and iGEM, I would not be who I am today. Seek out meaningful mentorship experiences, and you will learn the most when you least expect it.”
Yenelly Samora
Houston ISD's César Chávez High School
As part of the Human Practices portion of our project, we decided to organize a debate on the ethics of Synthetic Biology for the IBB high school girls. (The IBB Girls STEM Initiative brings high school seniors to Rice for a week of STEM immersion activities.) Prior to the event, the students were given several articles to read in preparation for the debate. Below is a response pieced together from multiple students collectively referred to as “Yenelly Samora”: “This activity helped me have more knowledge on what Synthetic Biology really is, and the argument helped it to be more fun to learn. There was a lot of excitement, and it got people to communicate with each other. It was helpful the way we got to argue as scientists and researchers. We got to put ourselves into other people’s positions and see what they are trying to accomplish, and I think it’s very helpful to gain that insight of something else. In addition to having fun, I was even able to connect [the debate] to real world problems we face today. It made me think about the considerations that go on [regarding] the human genome. I want to be able to experiment and find new innovations for humanity.”
