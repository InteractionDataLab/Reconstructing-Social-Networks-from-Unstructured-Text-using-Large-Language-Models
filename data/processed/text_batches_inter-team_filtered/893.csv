Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," high enough concentration and at a cheap enough          cost to warrant their use as a widescale antibody production platform? Given the need and potential benefits, we believe it warrants additional research.
A Green Safety Net
Within each of us (health and medication depending) is an adaptive          immune system. A major cell in this system is the B Cell. An immunocompetent          B cell is covered in B cell receptors (BCRs). These BCRs respond to          non-self antigens. When a foreign antigen binds to a BCR, it activates          the B cell to turn into a plasma B cell, dedicated to producing specific          antibodies against the antigen that triggered its          response.
Some of the plasma B cells enter secondary lymphoid organs, otherwise          known as “germinal centers.” Here, B cells undergo rapid mutation so that          the selected-for plasma B cell population produces higher affinity          antibodies. The resulting plasma B cells begin leave the germinal center          to pump out high levels of antibody into the bloodstream. [ 9]
This is what the human species lacks with macro-level infrastructure.          Hospitals and care-centers act as an innate response, responding in the          emergence of a contagion to quarantine the sick and provide nourishment.          They are not designed with the capability to rapidly adapt and attack the          pathogen. Drugs for human treatment undergo rigorous FDA          review before approval; the average inception to market timeline for an          FDA approved drug is 12 years (note: this is after the drug has been          developed). This is too long for rapid drug turnaround and represents a          significant threat to human health.
A hypothetical map of distributed          algae-antibody production facilities. Orange dots are          existing facilities that could be repurposed. Yellow dots are          hypothetical potential power plant algae hybrid facilities. They are          smaller in scale but repurposable in a time of need. Green dots are          potential large sized facilities. These too could produce commodity          goods, like food for livestock or subsidized biofuel, until needed for          antibody production.
In industrialized countries with significant carbon taxes, like the UK          and Australia, microalgae facilities might become commonplace alongside          power plants. Sapphire Energy, Sunomix, and Solazyme have demonstrated          the market potential of microalgae products. It would be strategic to          further distribute algae plants near heavily populated areas. Were a          pandemic to occur, these facilities could expunge their          commodity-producing microalgae and replace it with a high antibody          producing strain of microalgae, like recombinant Chlamydomonas          reinhardtii"

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#overview_-_-_TEXT.html," has recently been hard hit by the effects of BCWD. For example, in 2010, Wolf Lake State Fish Hatchery, a Ohio facility associated with Lake Erie, reported an outbreak of BCWD among its stock of steelhead. Mortality rates among its 285,000-fish population rapidly reached 100 individual salmonids per day. By the time antibiotics were administered, mortalities had peaked at 371 fish a day [3]. Rampant BCWD infections in our local area has inspired us to create fishPHARM to help prevent local infections from spreading.
Aquaculture and Fish Farming: Outbreaks of BCWD are very common, observed globally, and can result in harsh economic effects on commercial salmonid producers [4]. Wild salmonid populations are also susceptible and wild fish can easily contract the disease via contact with domestic populations . At principal risk are farms in the United States that grow salmonids in cramped conditions. Aquacultural production of salmonids is one of the the fastest growing and largest food markets globally, producing hundreds of millions of tons of fish and representing a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Fish farming has been a rapid response to the growing crisis of global overfishing. In addition to ensuring that hungry populations have access to a cheap yet nutritious source of protein, aquaculture provides fishermen with a means of compensating for the shrinkage of wild fish populations. Heavily populated countries such as Norway, Chile and Japan are leading consumers of aquacultural products, and rely on farm-grown fish to help feed the masses. Epidemics among fish farms could thus have disastrous consequences. The aim of our project is not only to prevent economic harm to the fishermen, but to aid communities with economies heavily dependent on the aquaculture industry and provide food security as well.
Threat to Wildlife: BCWD is not only a threat to the commercial fish farming industry, but also a concern to the ecology of the wild salmonid fish population. When these fish farms are located in larger bodies of water, the pathogen F. psychrophilum can escape natural or man-made boundaries to infect wild fish populations [4]. Compounding to this problem is the fact that juvenile fish, which are more susceptible to infection, are commonly found in estuaries and bays where the fish farms are usually placed. Since salmon are a crucial source of nutrition for a plethora of secondary and tertiary consumers (bears, otters and ospreys, for instance), mass die-offs among the fish could devastate local ecosystems [5]. Containing F. psychrophilum is thus crucial to both the"

The idea behind the work of the transcriptomics group is to try and detect any changes in the gene expression when E. coli is grown alongside strongyles as opposed to just being grown in a normal lab environment. The aim for this undertaking is to find any and all genes which might be expressed exclusively in the proximity to the worms - giving us a prime opportunity to work some biotech magic and find a way to make a diagnostics tool for the strongyle parasites out of that very bacteria gene.
The way we decided to approach this was by running a full-scale transcriptome sequencing on the entire E. coli genome, both in bacteria grown normally and grown alongside the worms. By doing this, we would be able to quantitatively determine the differences in gene expression.
For this, we created an eight-step pipeline starting from lysing the bacteria to extracting their RNA contents, to refining and finally sequencing the genetic material using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION device - which you plug in to your laptop. That same laptop will then be used to understand what exactly is going on in the bacteria.
1. Cell Lysis and Total RNA Purification
The cultured E. coli cells are lysed and the RNA is extracted using QIAGEN’s RNeasy Kit. Two cultures are purified - one worm group and one control group. The cells are harvested at their log phase when genetic expression is at the highest to ensure the maximum genetic variety. The RNA is quality checked and then stored.
2. rRNA Depletion
The ribosomal RNA - rRNA, does not hold any relevant genetic information for us and consists about 90% of the total RNA content of the cell. Using Thermo Fishers MICROBExpress Kit, the rRNA is removed to get rid of genetic static and to make future steps easier in terms of total material that needs to be processed.
3. Poly(A)-Tailing
Poly(A)-tails consists of adenosine nucleotides that are added onto the 3’ end of the nucleotide strand in mostly eukaryotes for translation purposes. They are added onto the ends of our RNA to work as a primer target in the"

TEC-Chihuahua
The iGEM TEC-Chihuahua team in Mexico has also been working on a project to help save honeybees this year. Though our teams are working on different threats to bees, we saw our common goal as an awesome chance to work together, and reached out to TEC-Chihuahua early in the iGEM season. We shared our first abstract with TEC-Chihuahua, and stayed up to date on their project and goals throughout the season.
In our communication with TEC-Chihuahua, we shared that we were working with live bees in our project. As their team was not keeping bees, our access to bees and the knowledge we gained from working with them became a valuable asset that we could share to help with their project. One question that TEC-Chihuahua had not been able to figure out on their own was how long it would take for a bee to secrete a substance it was fed. Because of the use of bees in our project, our team had made an effort to learn about the care and physiology of bees, and built connections with a bee researcher at our institution, Courtney McInnis. We used our resources to find an answer to TEC-Chihuahua’s question, and were able to send them information drawn from Courtney’s first hand experience. The information we sent to the TEC-Chihuahua team will be used to determine the path of nanocapsules fed to bees at different timepoints.
OLS Canmore Canada
We also collaborated with a local high school team from Our Lady of Snows High School in Canmore. One of our team members is an alumnus of the OLS high school team, so we connected with them to learn about their project and see if there was any way we could help. We were able to meet with them in person at the aGEM provincial meet up hosted at the University of Calgary in September, and learned more about what they working on and how we could be involved. Their team told us they were having trouble determining what direction to take an ethical evaluation of their project. UAlberta team members had an in person brainstorm with the Canmore team at the meet up to share our knowledge and experience of ethics based on what they said they needed. We shared"

Wednesday 10th of August
Minipreparations of the ligated fragments were done, followed by restriction digest to check if there are any fragments that are ligated correctly. We used EcoRI and SpeI as restriction enzymes. No correct ligated fragments were discovered and  we decided to test these ligations again tomorrow with other restriction enzymes. The 3 other biobricks (pHybB, LuxR and MelA) were also purified and restricted.
Thursday 11th of August
A restriction digest with XbaI and PstI was carried out on the purified DNA of 10/08.  There were still no positive clones identified and we decided to do some more minipreparations and  test another 40 colonies tomorrow.
A PCR of the HybB promoter (BBa_K410000) was carried out and  seemed  successful (FIG.9).
Friday 12th of August
The 40 inoculated colonies were miniprepped and restricted and still no positive clone was found. We will switch again to the 3A assembly method  next week to get less false positive colonies and we hope this time we will have some more success.
Monday 15th of August
We started the day with restrictions to make sure that the minipreparation of CrtEBI, CI repressor, terminator and the ribokey3d from the past week had been successful. The bands on the gel were inconclusive. We decided to do the restriction again but opted to put the samples on gel on Tuesday. We also PCRed MelA  and 4 vectors (psB1A3, pSB1K3, psB1C3 and psB1T3). We also ligated all the promoters excluding hybB with GFP.
Tuesday 16th of August
The restriction started the day before was completed by putting the samples on gel. (We decided to make 2 different gels; a  2% and a 4% gel because of low amount of base pairs of the restricted fragments.)  The PCR we did on Monday showed, after loading 3µL onto a gel, no results. We therefore decided to do 2 PCRs: one of psB1A3 and  another of psB1A3 containing pBAD.  After putting them on gel we saw a band in the lane which contained the plasmid which was PCRed from the plasmid with pBAD.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2013,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#HumanPractice:Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," was very potent in terms of phototoxicity, which means that even at very low concentration there was destruction of the cancer cells.
In terms of biosafety, I want to focus on the basic principles of biochemistry and cell-photosensitizer interaction.  In general, my photosensitizer was much more of a safety risk due to its ability to uptaken into individual cells from the extracellular space.  Additionally, it is not heavily altered by spending time in the extracellular space due to its amphiphilic characteristics. KillerRed, however, is a ""genetic"" photosensitizer that is created within a cell of interest and (as far as we know) can only act upon that individual cell.  This is due to the very unique fact that KillerRed is a protein that folds to form a chromophore that produces 10-fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than other fluorescent proteins such as GFP.  All proteins have unique foldings that can be quite sensitive to its surroundings (pH, temperature, etc.) and if a cell containing KillerRed were to lyse and release the photosensitizer, I believe that no other cells would be greatly (if al all) affected due to two main points:
1.)  The KillerRed protein may become denatured (unfolded) due to a change in environment, breaking apart the chromophore and rendering all ROS production to null
2.)  The KillerRed protein maintained its proper folding, but fails to enter any nearby cells due to its size (macromolecule) and inability to be uptaken into other cells (lack of receptors, etc to trigger any other form of uptake)     
I hope this explanation will help to address some of the safety concerns we will be collaborating upon for the iGEM Competition.  Please let our team know if anything further is needed.  Thanks!

Dear Metu İGEM team,
With a great project comes a great responsibility of finding the best solution  to the safety issues we encounter and most oftenly, figuring the main safety areas that needs concentrating on can be pretty difficult. This year iGEM  has introduced strict rules and regulations for safety which is a clear  indication of how much effort and importance they are expecting us to show!
So, why dont we gather and see safety as a way to benefit eachother? Because not only will this open new doors for our future safety plans but will also increase the probability of reaching our aimed destinations. The Lyon jamborees is a great opportunity"

I'm second year medical student. My lessons and medicine are pleasure for me.I find Synthetic Biology really challenging as it is limitless and involved in every major. I joined iGEM to learn more things about this developing branch of science. I take care of me and my team spending useful time in lab. Most of all I like making competent cell. Of course I have hobbies outside of this; swimming, watching movies and discovering new places are just some of them!
Fatma Betül Çevik
Chief Secretary
Hi! I’m second year medical student. I like my lessons without exceptions. I get excited by learning new things, especially in branches of science. I guess that’s why I take so much pleasure of iGEM studies (researches, experiments etc.). Furthermore, I think youths will achieve such incredible points in SynBio and in science as long as they are encouraged. I will try to be together with those young scientists which work with endless desire in every opportunity.

Hi I have just finished second year of medical school. I've been addicted to iGEM since my first steps to university but only this year I have had a chance to be the part of this incredible team. After accidentally burning our precious bacteria while spreading the plate, mates got used to teasing me by calling ‘Bakteri Külbastı Ustası’ which in english means ‘Bacteria Cutlet Chef’. I’ve gained so much experience with iGEM, especially it woke up the spirit of endless research and explore in me. Besides I’m fanatical about astronomy and everything classic; books, music, clothes and etc.

It was during the planning stages of designing our population regulation system, that a minor problem occurred to us. We were looking at genes we could express heterologously which would slow growth when turned on, and while we did find a few, we also kept coming across genes which would have this effect when turned off in the genome. We could have knocked them out, but that didn't seem very… iGEM. Were these genes to be out of reach for us?
No! Why not express an antisense gene against these genes? We came across an interesting method for creating antisense RNAs in prokaryotes involving paired termini. Essentially, in this method, your antisense gene consists of a segment of the target gene which contains the start codon and ribosome-binding site, in antisense orientation, with flanking inverted repeats to give the resultant RNA extra stability (as it is no longer a linear molecule).
We were looking at a number of potential genes to target, and we soon found that manually creating the sequence of the hypothetical antisense RNA was becoming tiresome. It also seemed like a perfect task for a computer – simple but tedious.
And so, version one of ‘AntisenseBot 5000’ was born. It took the DNA sequence of the target gene, worked out the correct frame by checking against the protein sequence, and returned the RNA sequence of the antisense that would knock it out (as well as the DNA gene that would produce it). This quickly speeded up the process of producing hypothetical antisense genes.
With our faithful script at our side, we could now start checking the viability of multiple antisense genes. To do this we used an online tool called ‘RNAserver’ which modelled the secondary structure of a given RNA sequence. We quickly saw that the antisense RNAs we were generating varied widely in how ‘free’ the critical start codon and RBS region was – some of them were quite badly tangled according to these models.
Interestingly, we also spotted that altering the RNA very slightly could sometimes have quite radical changes on the predicted secondary structure. Changing the length, or the specific base at which the target starts, produced very different structures.
So we gave AntisenseBot 5000 a considerable makeover:

B.Interview Report (With Patients)
During the summer vacation, we paid a visit to the In-patient Department of Cardiology Unit, Higher Education Mega Center Branch, Guangdong Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine three times. We interviewed tens of patients with the diversity of conditions and conducted a questionnaire investigation. We found that the three main methods were percutaneous coronary intervention, surgical coronary revascularization and medication, which are recognized internationally as standard therapeutic tools. However, none of them can help patients get rid of lifelong treatment. Although patients with the same disease are treated with the same plan, the levels of physical and mental tolerance and the clinical effect varies greatly from individual to individual. It is hard to say whether a therapy will come into effect.
We tried to promote the concept of synthetic biology and introduced our idea for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. Most of the patients did not have a chance to receive higher education, which makes them not very aware of our research. To our delight, a large quantity of the patients we interviewed show great interests and hope we can make it. Some of them even said they are willing to have a try if our therapy succeeds. More significantly, the experience of the therapy and how their life is affected are what can be told, and that still gave us different perspectives. Certain typical examples are as follows:
Mr. A
Gender: Male
Age: ~80
Disease: Myocardial ischemia , hypertension
Duration: ~15years
Therapeutic regimen: Surgical coronary revascularization , medication
The grandpa we interviewed is one of those who recover well after his operation in 2003. He has continued taking medicine since then. However, hypertension, a common complication of myocardial ischemia, was examined in 2013, so he had to change the drugs he used to take. And now his condition stabilizes. He could have convalesced at home and taken medicine on time, but he had to stay in hospital because he cannot be paid enough compensation from the Public Health Insurance if he is only treated at home. We also learned that the operation cannot cure patients’ disease, and it still relies on medication to extend the time of their physical deterioration. Many expensive imported medicines such as Plavix are not listed in the expense sheet, so only taking medicine has caused a huge financial pressure.
Moreover, the society is not justice as we expect, and many people don’t have any public or commercial health insurance. They cannot afford the overwhelming medical fee, so someone has no choice"

Fig.1-2-1 Entrance of NCHU university.
Fig.1-2-2 Dr. Tzeng's Lab of Entomology.
Explained the Real Function of the Mosquito's PBAN：
The mosquito's PBAN is for developing wings. When the PBAN regulates hormones to induce cell apoptosis, the dead cells of wings will help the maturation of wings. This is another function of PBAN we learned.
A Glimpse at the Mosquito Breeding Cage and Insect Light Trap ：
We took a look at Culex pipiens molestus (the underground house mosquito) breeding cage, and also learned the behavior of many kinds of mosquito. This mosquito breeding cage inspired us many new ideas about our insects testing box. In fact, we consulted the same concept of mosquito breeding cage to test our PBAN effect simply.
Fig.1-2-3 This was the testing box which was filled with mosquitos.
Fig.1-2-4 The box has a special design which allows us inserting hands to touch the mosquitos.
Further Discussion about Our Project：
Fig.1-2-5 further discussion and experience exchanging with each other.
Dr. Tzeng have enthusiasm on discussing our project. To prevent any problem from happening, Dr. Tzeng and we inspected all the probability which may cause our project failed such as PBAN degradation in insects’ intestine (whether we have to use little thuricide to cause some holes on insects’ intestine to make it absorb our PBAN easily) and the restriction of our project (we have to capture the first “female” insect in our device, and proves that our project can actually work.). In the discussing process, we again encounters another problems, and obtain many suggestions from Dr. Tzeng as well. We hoped we can overcome all the problems, and improve our project.
In briefly conclusion, our team and Dr. Tzeng had deep discussion in this visit. Not only experience sharing but also project inspection that made us learn so much and obtains many new ideas which let us realize how to make use of our project to achieve the best result.

This is a separable differential equation which can be solved by separating the             time and concentration terms. There are two cases, either $a_0 = b_0$ or $a_0 \neq b_0$. Starting with the former case, one gets              $$\frac{dc}{dt} = k(a_0-c)^2\tag{11}$$              which can be separated and solved via the following operations:              $$\frac{dc}{k(a_0-c)^2} = dt\tag{12}$$             $$\int_{0}^{c} \frac{dx}{k(a_0-x)^2} = \int_{0}^{t}dx\tag{13}$$             $$\frac{1}{k}(\frac{1}{a_0-c}-\frac{1}{a_0}) = t\tag{14}$$             $$c(t) = a_0 - \frac{a_0}{a_0kt+1}\tag{15}$$              where we have set $c(0)=0$. Similarly, one can solve the case $a_0=b_0$ by separating the varibles, partial fraction decompose the expression             and solving the integrals. One then yields:              $$c(t) = \frac{a_0b_0 - a_0b_0e^{k(a_0-b_0)t}}{b_0 - a_0e^{k(a_0-b_0)t}}\tag{16}$$              The entire solution to the problem is then:              $$c(t) = \begin{cases} a_0  - \frac{a_0}{1 + a_0kt}, & \mbox{if } a_0=b_0 \\             \frac{a_0b_0 - a_0b_0e^{k(a_0-b_0)t}}{b_0 - a_0e^{k(a_0-b_0)t}}, & \mbox{if } a_0\ne b_0 \end{cases}\tag{17}$$

As you can see from the picture there is a unique band at about 6000 bp (Kapa Universal Ladder was used). We think that the band in the ladder at 5000 bp is not present because it remains under the bigger lane at 4000. When one of the 2 ml inocula reached the right OD we splitted it into 5 aliquotes of 400µl tubes and we transformed the three pXyl+EFE+B0015 digestions and two quantities of pSpac+EFE+B0015... tomorrow we will see....

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," strongest constitutive promoter in the Anderson promoter collection (BBa_J23100).
Strong RBS
When designing this construct, we found a paper by Chen et al. that determined the optimal spacing between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon in E. coli, and decided to use their reported RBS sequence (Chen et al.).
Flexible linkers
We know that orientation matters for protein interaction. Thus, we decided to include flexible linkers between the adenylate cyclase subunits and the proteins of interest to enable free movement of the proteins of interest.
Excisable Leucine zippers
Commonly found in DNA-binding motifs, where they serve as a dimerization domain, leucine zippers are alpha helices with a leucine zipper at every seventh residue for eight turns(van Heeckeren, Sellers and Struhl). The commercial kit for BACTH uses leucine zippers as a positive control (possibly also due to their small size of ~100 bp), and we decided to also incorporate the leucine zippers into pT8-O. Flanking the leucine zippers are two unique pairs of restriction enzymes (BglII/KpnI and HindIII/BamHI) so that researchers can work with one subunit without affecting the other subunit.
Codon-optimized coding regions
We codon-optimized the coding sequence for T18, T25 and the leucine zippers to increase expression levels and improve the translational efficiency.
Gvp 3.0
gvp3.0 is an engineered operon consisting of different alleles of gas vesicle protein (gvp) genes, gvpA and gvpC. Both genes encode for  the main structural proteins of gas vesicles, though, the different versions of gvpC (gvpC16 and gvpC20Ψ) allow for the production of varied gas vesicle phenotypes. Expression of the gvp3.0 construct is under control of the lac promoter (pLac), allowing inducible expression using IPTG in the presence of cAMP. Gas vesicles are impermeable to water and entrap ambient gases within their structure. This property leads to an overall change in cytosolic density which has been seen to confer buoyancy to microorganisms which synthesize gas vesicle proteins. Our gvp3.0 construct is based off of the wild-type cluster found in the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens. We have maintained this wild-type sequence of the gvp gene repeats, as"

At the first part we found gene design for converting the PET into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde in iGEM database. The arrangement at the bottom explains the first part:
At the second part, we wanted to go further and researched the gene parts for convertion of 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde into pyruvate. This part will give us the chance of adding new parts to iGEM database. In this arrangement, it can be observed in detail:
Why do we want to degrade PET? As you know, plastic smears into the soil and water easily, although plastic producing companies claim that, they collect the plastic lower quality available again and this way allows recycling , it is possible to see PET in water and soil. Our aim is to separate freshwater(rivers and lakes), salt water(sea and oceans) and the most important, the soil from this carcinogen with biodegradation method which we design with E.coli. Despite of recycling of PET, after a while it would be a substance which is unusable and unrecyclable and because of this reason we want to design an organism to degrade it.
How the PET smears to the lakes? Ultimately, people live close to water resources, at the same time betray water. Plastic smears water at different forms( like bottle,bag or pot) and the damage increases with uncollected years. Derraik, J.B, (September 2010). The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 44(9), 842-852. Retrieved from http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X02002205
How does our project work?
Totally degradation of PET to pyruvate is done by E. coli.
As an analog: The project depends on E. coli that eats PET as we eat sandwiches.
The Circuit of our Project
The Circuit of our Kill Switch Model
We made a design for collected plastic and aim to having a bacteria pool of plastic which our organism degredate PET without producing toxic material. In this design, controlled biodegradation is very important because we can not precise all the risks. So, we made our organism addicted, briefly it works with a kill-switch mechanism with the presence of arabinose.

*Making iGEM known in QIBEBT
“The question that fresh labmen come up with always concerns with the most basic problem,”says Ma Bo,another instructor of us,”and they always unscarred by experimental depression or old sterotypes,that is the most invaluable idea for our lab.”
Performing Experiments in QIBEBT
Through we performed most of our experiments in QIBEBT,which focused on synthetic biology engineering,little knowed iGEM including our instructor,they even thought we were playing house like child!We were depressed and determined to change their attitude,to this end, we showed our enthusiasm and sharpness as an iGEMer,many researchers were impressed by the novel idea of iGEM projects,rigorous experimental design and detailed datasheet!

Although the list is very comprehensive, many people still argue that there is no description nor a complete set of specific criteria that can define life. A reason for this absence of a clear definition is that we do not have the capabilities to create one. We are part of what we assume is life and therefore never capable of objectively characterizing it, is what many people suggest.
The participants have extensively described their thoughts on whether or not we might be able to understand life, and what could be the right approach for achieving that. Remarkably, no one suggests that it is infeasible to understand life without a definition for it. Nevertheless, there are numerous other suggestions why understanding life might or might not be possible in the future. What seems exceptional is that many use human life as the standard of understanding life, most probably of its complexity. The most apparent answers are described here.
The problem of the observer, we cannot define life because we are life. The reductionist approach is limited because we (mankind) are limited.
Some believe that we (mankind) are a complex series of biochemical reactions that lead us to interact with our environments the way we do. Although synthetic biology might help us to understand the mechanisms behind the operation better, it runs the risk of becoming too detached from humanity and ""life"", which could be dangerous in reducing the image of ourselves as ""the sum of our parts"".
Some think that life is the results of molecules bumping into each other and positive and negative charges interacting, which is sublime.  They are not afraid of taking religiosity, mysticism, or magic out of human existence, but rather focus on taking a moment to appreciate the true magnificence that is a human being. ""We are, simply, trillions and trillions of atoms, bumping into each other. How much more magical can you get?"" Different questions are proposed, such as ""Where do atoms come from?"" and ""Why are we here?"".
Science strives to understand life mechanistically, but there is a feeling amongst some survey participants that there will always be elements that mankind cannot understand as we are unable to see the entire picture. The reductionist approach is limiting because there is always ""room to go deeper"". However, as innocent as reducing life may appear to be it also has the ability to"

For us to be able to efficiently process your requests, it is vital that your parts have been processed in conformance with the above guidelines. Input files not conforming to those guidlines would take a lot of work to process, due to the fact, that anything non-standard has to be parametrised by hand, using quantum chemistry software.
We still encourage you to submit your targets, even if they do not fit the guidelines. Currently, the processing of those files will be handled with lower priority, and their processing itself might take a lot of time. That said, we will inform you of all possible complications regarding your submission. Just bear in mind that it could take a very long time to process your request."

About KIT
KIT, Kyoto Institute of Technology, is a national university in Kyoto, which had been the capital city of Japan for more than a thousand years. KIT was founded to do research on silk and textile, important for artistic kimono industries for Kyoto.   Though its name has 'technology' in it, KIT is a fusion of science and arts. KIT has been committed in the genetics more recently. A good example is the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC) , an essential model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. The institute has also collaborated actively with industries in Kyoto and beyond.   KIT's competence is beyond science. It also has arts and design courses.   KIT is a place of robust science and creative arts. We will exert our strength as students of KIT. We are very proud of competing with wonderful students in other universities in iGEM. We will show you what you will get when arts and science merge. See you in Boston!

Chain-Node Model
Figure 1: Logo of Chain-Node Model
In most manual modeling, complex is treated as a whole entity in reactions. Plenty of synthetic biology automatic modeling software treats complex the same way. However, there is a big difference between manual and automatic modeling, that is: Model constructors always know which detail of complex needs to be ignored or preserved, but software does not. So in most software, detailed structure has to be specified by modelers, otherwise will be ignored. In most cases, this requires plenty of manual operations and thus making the software not so automatic. Knowing this, MoDeL chooses to preserve detailed structure in complex and present Chain-Node Model, which view complex as a construction of its parts throughout the modeling process. With chain and nodes, describing large biological complex with a great number of basic units and binding sites becomes possible. It also offers great flexibility in modeling. Detailed concepts are explained below.
Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary"

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Notebook#MiniTn7_-_-_TEXT.html," us that they had sent us a different, although similar plasmid, but unfortunately it is not suitable for our purposes. Instead, restriction analysis confirmed that the transposase-delivery plasmid pTNS2 is based on pUC18R6KT and contains an oriT for conjugative mobilization, so we decided to use this as a template. Unfortunately, our SfiI-bearing primers are not suitable for this plasmid, so we designed new primers to amplify the pUC18R6KT backbone from pTNS2.
The last set of mini-preps I did to purify pTNS2, pUC18R6KT-mini-Tn7T-Km (now discarded) and pBBR1-MCS5 had very low yield. I repeated the process and obtained somewhat more concentrated, but still low-yield preparations.
This week I attempted to prepare several batches of electro-competent cells that I will need for the project. The strains are E. coli DH5α-λpir, E. coli MC4100, and S. typhimurium LT2. The former will be used for cloning into the R6K plasmids, and the other two will be used as hosts for insertion of the miniTn7 transposons. The protocol requires growth of large (500 ml) cultures OD600=0.5, followed by repeated washes with sterile, cold water. Cells are concentrated, allocated in 40 l samples and stored at -80°C. It sounds easy, but I had to repeat the process three times due to beginner's mistakes.
I did mini-preps of two vectors expressing the Flp recombinase: pFLP2, a replicative vector which is lost spontaneously at high frecuency in Pseudomonas strains; and pCP20, which has a termosensitive replication origin that allows replication at 30°C but not at 37°C. This last vector will be used in E. coli and S. typhimurium.
Week 3 (July, 18-22)
This was a less stressful week. We asked the DNA synthesis company about the 1-month delay and they claimed they had problems with the synthesis and still need two more weeks to have it ready. We are getting desperate about this! Still, I keep on preparing material in advance of the arrival of the long-awaited mini-Tn7.

Safety
In accordance to the guidelines of the iGEM committee, we address here the question of safety in our project. Since our project relies solely on expression in bacteria of quorum sensing molecules and fluorescent markers, it does not pose any particular threats to humans, animals or the environment, other than the ones which are encountered in standard laboratory work with E.coli. Therefore, we estimate the risk to researchers, the public or environment as very low. However, we would like to underline the particular attachment which our institution, EPFL, holds for the safety of all parties concerned by research conducted in its facilities.
As referenced on this web page , our school has Biosafety Officers, whose charges are to supervise activities linked to pathogens or genetically modified organisms. They also verify that good laboratory pratice and safety measures are respected. We have not contacted our Biosafety officer for the duration of our tasks, as they did not present any risks. If necessary iGEM teams would be able to collaborate with such safety organisations in the institution.

However, one important part of our project is delayed suicide of  microorganisms, so, in the hope of improving safety of their experiments, we provide them a complete regulatory suicide circuit, along which we also provide the detailed data of promotor's inducing expression intensity.
Collaboration with SJTU
This year, SJTU_Software build a biobrick selection assist system based on empirical algorithm. This system can generalize the heat map of different splicing pattern, based on the history record of its splicing sequence in the database, and provide a experiential score to the user. Experiential score is a score that not associated to certain experiment, so a specific situation is needed, which means it grades the results under different experiment condition.
We cooperate with SJTU_Software on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would set up multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components. These groups are comparable between their designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of our project, and the data extracted from which would meet SJTU_Software’s needs.
Through our cooperation, they can grade our experiment results, then the scores would be compared to our evaluation. To SJTU_Software, the comparison of our experiment results and the design of our plasmids' construction is a case which can directly evaluate their software. And it is also meaningful for us to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve our future experiments.

Communication on Campus
Synthetic Biology is a quickly developing field. If we want to enhance the development of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, communication on campus is necessary. In this year, we communicated with different people, such as the researchers of SJTU in multiple fields including physics and electronics, the biologists in our city, and many new friends in different districts. Through the communication, we gave what we can offer to help people know more about Synthetic Biology and learned a lot from others.
Communication with Physicists
measuring the parameters of LED
As soon as we put forward the idea, Metabolic Gear Box, a crucial question rised up. How can we confirm that our luminous device is valid? To attain accurate data substantiating the validity of our device, we asked the physists of SJTU for help. Though burried in much work of themselves, they still offered patient guidance to us. With the help of them ,espatially associate professor Hong Zhou, we finally assured many parameters of our device, which are important to guarantee the wholeness of our project.
We really appreciate the physists in SJTU. Without their help, we would spent longer time figuring out the parameters of our device. And this also means that our team really achieved the goal of subject cross in the field of synthetic biology.

Communication with Undergraduates in Shanghai
On April 21st 2013, we took part in the Life Science Forum of Undergraduates in Shanghai, which was held in Second Military Medical University. In the forum, we delivered a report introducing iGEM, synthetic biology, our team as well as our project last year to other schools that hasn't taken part in the iGEM competetion. Many undergraduates and teachers proposed various questions about synthetic biology and our 'Membrane Magic' system construction. "
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2016,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Gate Cloning of FeFe Hydrogenase subunits was now possible. The use of the arabinose inducible pBAD vector allowed controlled expression of the FeFe Hydrogenase. Additionally, using pBAD allowed us to get around the reported issues of S.oneidensis not being compatible with pSB1C3. iGEM Harvard 2008 and NTU Singapore 2015 have reported similar issues in conjugating BioBricks into S.oneidensis due to conflicts in origin of replication. This was also reported in a paper “Replication of plasmids with the p15A origin in Shewanella putrefaciens” (Myers and Myers ,1997). The Golden Gate cloning for FeFe hydrogenase (Fdh/HydC, HydA and HydB N-terminus) cluster was successful, allowing us to characterise our construct in S.oneidensis. Only HyaC and HyaB N-terminus were PCR amplified successfully, and cloned into pSB1C3.
Tri-parental conjugation of RFP (J04450) and GFP (K584001) BioBricks into S. oneidensis was attempted but was unsuccessful.
Week 9 29.08-2.09
We obtained the HydABC FeFe hydrogenase gene cluster in our expression vector: pBAD, from the Golden Gate cloning. This was then transformed into E.coli and the overnight culture mini-prepped to obtain DNA, which was sent off for sequencing. Some of the remaining DNA was run on a gel against the pBAD vector to observe correct ligation. HydABC in our expression vector, pBAD, was transformed back into α-select E.coli for more cells. The NiFe gene inserts were transformed and plated, but was unsuccessful. Additional RFP digests showed high amounts of smearing, thus an overnight digest was done and used to ligate the NiFe gene inserts.
Wild Type S. oneidensis MR-1, ∆HydABC,HyaABC (NiFe and FeFe hydrogenase double knockout), LS498 (FeFe hydrogenase knockout) and pRK2013 (E.coli helper strain) were inoculated in preparation for transforming the plasmid containing HydABC into S. oneidensis. Triparental conjugation was then performed to transform 8A5 (pBAD vector with HydABC C-terminally tagged) and 9A5 (pBAD vector with HydABC N-terminally tagged) into all three strains of S. oneidensis.

METU_HS_Ankara,2018,Team:METU HS Ankara#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"ethanol production (Jarboe et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore we analyzed the reaction kinetics of both FucO (NADH dependent) and YqhD (NADP dependent) with the Michaelis and Menten enzyme kinetics and Lineweaver - Burk plot. At first, we looked through the Km values because they indicate the affinity of enzymes which means that if you have a low Km value then the enzyme is more likely to catalyze the reactions faster and properly (Jarboe et al., 2012). YqhD showed a Km of 5.00 +- 3  mM where Km of FucO was 0.4+- 0.2 mM (Wang et al., 2011). It was shown that that FucO has higher affinity to furfural and is more likely to increase the furfural tolerance (Jarboe et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2011). Moreover, YqhD has higher Km for NADPH than most of the key metabolic enzymes such as  CysJ (80 μM), which is necessary for sulfate assimilation to form cysteine and methionine; ThrA (90 μM), is important for the formation of threonine; and DapB (17 μM), required for lysine formation  (Miller et al.,2009; Jarboe et al., 2012). Therefore, the utilization of YqhD inhibits the growth of the bacteria due to the competition with the important biosynthetic enzymes (Miller et al.,2009). Though, YqhD is found in most of the E.coli strains, due to its lower affinity compared to the FucO, it is possible to eliminate the YqhD gene by the overexpression of FucO (Jarboe et al., 2012). Thus we decided to use the FucO gene coding for L-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase that is responsible for the furanic compound degradation. Moreover, because furans’ high reactiveness eventually leads to the formation of  ROS,  the GSH gene producing glutathione synthetase was decided to be utilized in order to decrease the harmful effects and raise tolerance to environmental toxicity.

IMAC Purification, Take Two
2mL of fresh resin was added to the a pre-chilled 50mL Falcon tube. The contents were centrifuged to discard the ethanol supernatant. The standard IMAC Batch Purification protocol was followed, as in previous purification trials.
Observations
The lysate seems quite viscous, and seems to have some stringy, thick and gluttonous strands suspended in the middle. Even when not observed under blue light, the lysate solution appears an obvious light green color. We hypothesize that this may be due to the super-folded GFP being super concentrated in the lysate. Also, when lysate, diluted in 1X binding buffer, is added to the resin and the first wash buffer is added (20mM imidazole), the resulting solutions appears white, and a bit foamy or soapy. This contrasts with our previous experience with IMAC Batch purification, when the solution appeared mostly clear. We also attribute this to our lysate being super concentrated, especially when compared to our previous batch of Tamura, which was suspended in excessive amounts of lysis buffer. Despite these unexpected observations, we proceeded with the protocol, and collected Fractions 1-3. When the final elution buffer was added (250mM imidazole), the resin mixed with lysate was transferred into a column. Two layers appeared in the column, a viscous white one on bottom and a clearer one on top. The fraction collects at a slow pace, one drop every 15-20 seconds. Also, it's interesting that even though the strip buffer hasn't been added, the resin already seems to have been stripped. It is no longer blue.

Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!

Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.
There is not a full-blown industry in China for cultivating bacteria strains that can purify the water
A low-cost device to detect and degrade nitrogen will be very useful.
They advised us to pay more attention on engineering and application.

The results of the survey that 58.8 % of people think that the governing authorities are not   taking up effective measures to check the issue of pollution calls for attention on the part   of the higher authorities like Pollutions Control Boards. And this needs to be focussed upon   mainly in the developed countries due to their many folds energy needs in comparison to   those of the developing or under-developed countries.
In short, the survey points out the requirement of awareness among the public, to encourage their   participation with the authorities, the latter being required to be more responsible on their part to   take actions to deal with the pollution and waste related issues.
Fountain Pen Survey
Our dependency on plastic items has increased manyfolds.   So, recently we passed out a Google Form and asked people to mention the number of pens they   used throughout an year with the typically used brand. We recorded 26 responses to it as shown here:
Average number of pens used in an year : 16
We have extended this data to the world population of 7,530,739,516 taken from here .This turns out to be 120,491,832,256 pens an year. And the amount of plastic generated by these many pens is great but we don't have a good number to represent that.
Hence, we would request you all to please join hands with us in using fountain pens (metal   ones :P ) and saying no to plastic ball and gel pens.

Construction Step 2: Integration of the sgRNA
After digestion of our sgRNA, the ligation was done with the plasmid pK18mob with the CAS9 sequence. The result was transformed in TOP10 strain. We verify the presence of our sgRNA insertion by performing PCR,             and then, after Miniprep, by enzyme digestion for verification.

Step 3: transformation of our plasmid in a conjugative strain
We transformed our final killer plasmid in E. coli S17-1 strain. We used S17 electrocompetent cells.
We have now a conjugative strain (S17-1) carrying a killer plasmid, capable of conjugation and targeting the RFP gene, and a killer plasmid targeting the AmpR gene.
The inserted sequence of the Cas9 and of the sgRNA were sequenced by Macrogen, and are all correct.
To have a better biosafe system, we also have design the same killer plasmid, but in an other conjugative plasmid (pSW23T) which have de R6K Origin of Replication. (See Perspective / Improvement / Biosafety section)
Efficiency of conjugation.
Test #1 conjugation efficiency: transfer of the mobilizable plasmid pK18mob
To verify the efficiency of transfer of the mobilizable plasmid pK18mob, we conjugated the recipient strain DH5ɑ containing the plasmid pSB4A5_J04450 with the donor strain S17-1 containing the plasmid pK18mob (WT). The result of the           conjugation was spread on LB/Xgal/IPTG box without selection pressure. The counting of strains is based on the expressed phenotype. Donors include lactose operon and are blue in appearance, recipient cells that have not conjugated           express RFP. While the transfer of the plasmid pK18mob (WT) restores the lactose operon in DH5ɑ by transferring the intact LacZɑ gene.

Formal Lab Session - 31st July 2009
Introduction
Over the past week we have attempted to transform five BioBricks from the Spring Distributions. Of these BioBricks, E. coli plus cinR ( BBa_C0077 ) and E. coli + cinI ( BBa_C0076 ) have not seemed to grow on LB + kan plates suggesting problems with transforming in JM109 cells. With this scenario, we attempted one final transformation but this time using DH5-alpha E. coli cells.
However JM109 E. coli transformations with the CinR sensitive promoter( BBa_R0077 ), cI coding sequence( BBa_C0056 ) and the double terminator( BBa_B1002 ) have all worked and grown on LB + amp plates. Three colonies from each set of BioBrick transformants were then used to inoculate 9 x 5ml LB tubes and allowed to grow overnight.
Today's lab session will see us make a decision on BioBricks BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076 based on whether our final transformation attempt has worked. Today's lab session will also see the team carry out midi-preps from the inoculated LB tubes (one set of three tubes inoculated with BBa_C0056, another set of three tubes inoculated with BBa_B1002 and the final set of three tubes inoculated with BBa_R0077).
Practical Outline
Here are the objectives for today:
Carry out midi-preps on E. coli cultures containing BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002 and BBa_R0077
Check LB and LB + kan plates for any DH5-alpha cells transformed with BBa_C0077 and BB"

After finishing the brochure, we delivered the brochures to farmers who contacted us online though China. In brief, nearly 400 brochures were sent to twelve cities and counties in China, including Suzhou, Yanan, Yancheng, Jining, Guanzhou and so on.
Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2016 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on)."
Chalmers-Gothenburg,2017,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," type a, the strong constitutive promoter PTEF1 expresses the Cas9 protein after recombination of the loxP-sites, see Figure 3. Transcription and translation solely occurs after recombination of the loxP-sites, as the original direction of the promoter is backwards.
Figure 3. Switch in mating type a. Cre recombinase changes the direction of PTEF1 by recombining the surrounding loxP-sites, which leads to transcription of Cas9.
In mating type α, the loxP site, the ribozyme Hammerhead (HH) and the gRNA will be expressed by PSNR52 after recombination, see Figure 4. The SNR52 promoter recruits polymerase III and prevents the gRNAs from translating into proteins [11]. After transcription, the ribozyme HH starts a self-cleavage reaction and leave the gRNA separated from the loxP site [12].
Figure 4. Switch in mating type α. Cre recombinase changes the direction of PSNR52 by recombining the surrounding loxP-sites, which leads to transcription of the loxP site, the ribozyme HH and the gRNA. A self-cleavage reaction of HH after transcription separates the gRNA from the loxP site.
Output
In the diploid cells created during the mating, the whole CRISPR/Cas9 system is present, as α cells contribute with the gRNA and a cells with Cas9. The gRNA corresponds to a site in ADE2, which is a native gene expressed during adenine synthesis. Guided by the gRNA, Cas9 makes doublestranded breaks in the gene and disrupts ADE2. Mutations in ADE2 cause accumulation of a red pigment during biosynthesis of adenine [13]. The red pigment creates a colour shift from white to red in the diploid cells and gives the final output of the biosensor, see Figure 5. The colony colour change only occurs when both butanone and n-octanal are present, which lowers the risk for false positives when testing for lung cancer. The colony colour change does not depend on fluorescence and will be visible in regular light. No fluorescence microscope is needed leading to simple detection.

As shown in Figure 18, cells synthesizing the mOrange fluorophore protein were highly fluorescent. Thus, the mOrange fluorophore protein, which is part of the BBa_E2050 biobrick can be produced in B. subtilis.

Magnification = 40 X; exposure time 44.33 s; DAPI filter.
To create a powerful glyphosate detection system, which is based on intraspecies competition, we need to have strains in hands having similar fitness coefficients. Strains having a different fitness will not allow to generate a stable co-culture because the strain with the higher fitness will alway outcompete the other strain, even in the absence of a selective pressure. To characterize our strains and to determine their fitness we performed different growth experiments. First, we integrated fluorophore genes into the amyE gene of the B. subtilis strains 168, (wild type), ΔgltT (BP233) and ΔgltT ΔgltP (BP235). The wild type strain 168 is very sensitive to glyphosate (see Figure 2). By contrast, the ΔgltT single mutant and ΔgltT ΔgltP double mutant lacking the glyphosate transport systems tolerate high amounts of the herbicide (see Figures 7 and 8). We used the gfp, bfp and morange genes encoding the fluorophores GFP, BFP and mOrange, respectively, for strain labeling. To drive the expression of the fluorophore genes, we attached an artificial promoter to the genes during PCR (see Figure 16). The sigma factor A-dependent artificial promoter is constitutively active and contains a ribosome binding site for B. subtilis. Next, we cultivated the constructed strains in a multi-well plate reader, to determine their fitness based on the growth rates that are achieved in the medium.

Ordinary resident
Termites are not only in school but also in people's houses. They may live in the interlayer of ceiling, walls or wood floor, eating your clothes, books and furniture. The annoying termites strongly reduce the quality of life.
What you need to do is simple. Walk in the supermarket and pick up the household type termites killing device produced by ZJUTT. Open the package and put it at places where termites can be seen. Avoid direct sunshine and remember to keep your children away from it. 3 months later you will be glad to say goodbye to those little troublemaker termites.
WHY OUR PRODUCT
CURRENT WAYS OF DEALING
Firstly, locating the nest, then people will dig a hole as a trap near the nest and put food mixed with drug in it. Termites will die after feeding in the trap. The trap won't be cleared until no termite will feed in it. Yet locating the nest is one huge difficulty when using this way to kill termite. It requires a lot of human cost in the early days. Special techniques are also needed.
Simply placing the drugs that will kill the termites is also a way we might use when locating the nest is quite impossible or the nest is quite dispersed. We particularly choose the drugs that have long action period. We expect that the drug will attach to the termite and be carried back to the nest, then the whole nest of termite can be killed for one time. However, the drug used in this way is toxic to many species other than termites, and will produces much ecological pressure consequently.
Sometimes we can do precautions by pesticide application or by reinforcing the buildings that might suffer from the termites. But the cost could be huge and in many cases we don't have ways to determine the range of the precautions.
CURRENT PRODUCTS OF KILLING
Beneficial nematodes
These are very small unsegmented worm species which search for hosts, like termites, and burrow into them, causing death within approximately 48 hours. They are not harmful to humans, plants or pets, and are able to kill the entire insect colony.
Timing
Although application with a garden hose and sprayer is relatively easy, gardeners can't simply apply nematodes to the landscape whenever they feel like it and expect them to work. Apply nematodes at dawn or dusk, because high levels of ultraviolet rays from the sun"

Reasoning behind the Dissoi Logoi
As the members of a team of scientists actively participating in research in synthetic biology, we are used to recognising the benefits in studying and developing the field. However, there is another side to the argument.
The practice of “Dissoi Logoi” – literally translating as “different words” is an exercise in rhetoric where the writer or speaker tries to achieve a deeper understanding of a particular issue by arguing the case from the opposite side. Most famously the Wright brothers used this technique during arguments between them; one brother would begin arguing the case for the other brother midway through the argument.
It is all too easy to see only one side in the argument but through this essay we have tried to look at things from another angle: Synthetic Biology in ‘different words’.
Introduction
Since its emergence at the turn of the millennium [1], Synthetic Biology has fast become a controversial topic for debate in both the scientific and wider community. As with any new field there has been much scepticism and opposition to what is a potentially revolutionary field of science. The issues raised are both numerous and entirely reasonable, beyond the usual “Stop playing God” argument which scientist have come to expect from religious groups. Socioeconomic, security and health risks make up the body of those which would be perilous to ignore at a crucial period in future of the science and could, without any degree of fatalism, be the catalysts to a crisis on Earth comparable to a Third World War.
Taking the long way round…
It would be short-sighted of any informed member of the public to deny the potential advances in medicine [2] and energy-production [3] which will inevitably become available after further research and many further years of strict testing have been done on the safety and feasibility of such"
Tsinghua,2009,Team:Tsinghua#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," ends via the ITR (inverted terminal repeats) recombination to form circular, episomal forms which are predicted to be the primary cause of the long term gene expression.
Retroviruses.
The genetic information in retroviruses is saved in the form of RNA molecules, while the genetic material of their hosts is in the form of DNA. When the infection happened a host cell, the introduction of its RNA together with some enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and integrase, were made full use of. This RNA molecule from the retrovirus must produce a DNA copy from its RNA molecule before it can be integrated into the genetic material of the host cell.
Envelope protein pseudotyping of viral vectors
Different from the viral vectors described above, which have natural host cell populations that they infect most efficiently, attachment to and entry into a susceptible cell is mediated by the protein envelope on the surface of a virus. On the contrary, retroviruses have limited natural host cell ranges, and although adenovirus and adeno-associated virus are able to infect a relatively broader range of cells efficiently, some cell types are refractory to infection by these viruses as well[1].
Non-Viral Methods
Non-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods, with simple large scale production and low host immunogenicity being just two. Previously, low levels of transfection and expression of the gene held non-viral methods at a disadvantage; however, recent advances in vector technology have yielded molecules and techniques with transfection efficiencies similar to those of viruses[1].
Naked DNA Naked DNA is the simplest method of non-viral transfection. However, it is a fact that the low expression is a shortage in comparison to other methods of transfection, which became a main limit of this method. In addition to trials with plasmids, there have been trials with naked PCR product, which have had similar or greater success. And the success leads to more research into more efficient methods for delivery of the naked DNA namely electroporation, sonoporation, and the use of a ""gene gun"", shooting DNA into the cell using high pressure gas.
Oligonucleotides. As we all know, synthetic oligonucleotides is mainly used in gene therapy by inactivating the genes involved in the disease process. And several methods can achieve this aim. One strategy uses antisense specific to the target gene to disrupt the transcription of the faulty gene. Another uses small molecules of RNA called siRNA to signal the cell to cleave specific unique sequences in the mRNA transcript of the faulty gene, disrupting translation of the faulty mRNA, then eventually the expression"
Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#5 August 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,". (Added all Bs to As)
We used the Solution I + RNAse that had been ready made and put in the fridge.
After spinning with solution III for 20 mins we pipetted the supernatant into a fresh tube and centrifuged again for 5 mins to ensure less protein and cell extracts were in the supernatant.
After resuspending the final DNA pellet we froze the sample ready for restriction digest on the afternoon.
For the restriction digest:
Jess and Goksel inserting the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI into the samples
We had 6 samples and therefore found it easier to make up 7X the mix we needed for the digest, and add 10ul each to 6 labelled eppendorfs, adding our DNA second. This way we did not have to make up the same solution 6 times. (we did 7X to make sure we had enough.) We used PstI and EcoRI restriction enzymes making sure that they were the last thing we added to the digest.
In order to make some 1.2 agarose we needed to make up some more 1x TAE from the 50x stock solution.
We made up 1L using 980ml distilled water and 20ml 50x TAE in a measuring cylinder
We weighed 2.4g of Agarose and added 190 ml of 1x TAE (we didn't have quite enough left but since have made up some more)
Running the gel
In order the identify the tubes and check if the experiments went right, we carried out gel electrophoresis.
Each tube containing 20ul DNa solution was mixed with 4ul of buffer.
We loaded 8ul of DNA ladder to the first well on the gel.
We then loaded 20ul from the tubes in the order of 1,2,3,4,5,6
Results
We know that CinI is 702bp and CinR is 762 bp long. From the gel, it can be concluded that 1st, 4th, and the 6th columns are CinR, and 2nd, 3rd and 5th columns are CinI.
The cultures were then stored at -80C freezer.

We prepared the remaining solutions:

Harvard,2011,Team:Harvard#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," of 1.4 kb
We saw bands for samples 80.1, 81.1, 81.4, 85.1, and a very faint band for 85.2.  The strange thing about these bands is that they appeared to be right around 1650 bp, larger than our 1.4 kb target size.  We are unsure of the identity of these bands and will send them out for sequencing.
Starting a new plate for sample 85
Since we have been having such bad luck with sample 85, we seeded 2 ml of LB+spec with 100 ul of the transformed bacteria for sample 85.  This is in preparation for making a new plate of sample 85 (the old plate was not a good spec plate and had lots of unspecific growth as well as very few colonies, so if we used this plate for more colony picking our choices would be very limited).  This new plate should also give us more luck with picking colonies and having them actually grow in the LB+spec.
Designing ultramers for Zif268, OZ052, and OZ123
In preparation for designing our 96-well practice plate, we designed ultramers for our three positive controls Zif268, OZ052, and OZ123.  These ultramers contain the Type II binding sites as well as the F2/F3 fingers.  Since the practice plate will contain oligos that encode for F1, we can use these three positive controls to practice and ensure that we secure the technique of using the Type II binding sites to swap in F1 into our expression plasmids.  The ultramers have not yet been ordered.

Friday
A relatively sunny day. Judging form freeze. The caffeine concentration has increased exponentially. Yutong had three espressos in the morning, which to be honest is nothing by Alberto’s standards. Everyone worked the judging form. It was impressive how much stuff a team can accomplish in so not enough time.  Also should we get some more data for the library characterisation ? Diellza came back to Imperial ! We had a urgent meeting with Rodrigo and showed him the heat map with the fold induction. We have orthogonality! Also the PixCell sweatshirt and t-shirts arrived. At 8 pm we had more coffee in the Bioeng staff room. Alberto and Shiv set up a new plate reader to mine more data for the library. They had to hide in the darkroom in Baldwin’s lab to stay in the lab later than midnight. Everybody reveiwd the chapters for the judging form on a collaborative google doc. Everybody review all the parts and added their inputs. Such a productive way of writing. Alberto and Shiv got out from the darkroom at 1 am, but what happens in the dark room stays in the dark room. We submitted the judging form at 2 am (London time). Well done guys !

Overview: The blue light sensor
The blue-light sensor, which is composed of the LovTAP hybrid protein designed by Strickland et al. (2008) and made available by Professor Sosnick, was BioBricked by EPF-Lausanne in iGEM 2009 . It is based on a α-helical domain linker between the Lov2 domain (the photoactive protein) and the E. coli trp repressor, which acts as a conduit for allosteric signals. The effective response of the sensor is at a wavelength of 470nm (as documented by the aforementioned Lausanne iGEM team).
The blue-light sensor (LovTAP) consists of five parts：
Photoreceptor1 (the shared helix between the Lov domain and the TrpR domain)
Dark blue when contacting the Lov domain (dark state).
Red when contacting the TrpR domain (light state).
Photoreceptor2 (falvin monoucleotide-FMN cofactor)
Lov domain-orange (photoactive protein)
TrpR domain-grey （DNA regulator)
Operator DNA

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

Tianjin,2017,Team:Tianjin#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ium Vibro coralliilyticus, could functionally and specifcally deleted genomic DNA fragment via recognizing specifc DNA site vox in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other spices, including mammal cell and bacteria.
Recently a milestone was reached with achieved total synthesis of functional chromosome Ⅴ DNA in yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. This chromosome owns lots of loxPsym sites. In spite of DNA sequence in recognizing site of loxP and vox shares a high similarity, it was demonstrated that activities of the two recombination systems were strictly independent to each other in yeast. Furthermore, the Vika/vox system functioned properly even in yeast cell carrying the synthesized chromosome on which lots of loxPsym sites are encoded.
2) Carotenogenic Pathway
Carotenoids are a class of pigments of commercial interest that have important biological functions. Certain carotenoids can be synthesized by biotechnology, by either homologous or heterologous production. One example is that β-carotene can be overexpressed in S. cerevisiae, by introduced carotenogenic genes, crtE, crtI, and crtYB, from the carotenoid-producing yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. Like X. dendrorhous, S. cerevisiae is able to produce FPP and converts it into GGPP, the basic building block of carotenoids. Conversion of FPP into GGPP is catalyzed by GGPP synthase encoded by BTS1 in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, overexpression of only crtYB and crtI from X. dendrorhous in S. cerevisiae should generally be sufficient to transform S. cerevisiae into a β-carotene-producing organism. Additional overexpression of crtE from X. dendrorhous will increase GGPP levels and thereby enhance β-carotene production.

From instructors
10.07.09
We had a review on our two ideas from Prof.Choi. He told us the ideas are creative and good but not fit for IGEM's concept. We need more feedback and information on our ideas. We need to get more familiar with IGEM's tools. Two additional ideas about Scromboid food poisoning and lactic acid degradation were referred at the end.
17.07.09
Till our next meeting, we should study how systemic biology works and understand related tools. Cumulate ideas. In other words, brainstorm consistently. Hyuk-jin will help with setting up experiments. Lab note opend.
24.07.09
We narrowed our ideas in to two. They are ""Metal Detector"" and ""Bactaeria Compass."" Think about what parts would be used and how you would build the circuits. Visit the former iGEM teams and study how they carried on their projects.
31.07.09
Find out the exact mechanism of metal detection. Look up the parts that are available on iGEM home. See how various metals can be detected by using E.coli.
07.08.09
We decided to detect 4 metals; Cd, Hg, Pb, and Ars. They are all critical to the health if ingested. Think about what the outcome would be after detection. Because there are 4 metals, you can bring out 16 different results by combining them. It seems that the most vialbe instrument would be light.
14.08.09
Study what parts on the registry we can use and how you would build a circuit. Increase your knowdlege on circutis by studying former iGEM teams. Remember, imitation is the mother of creation.
21.08.09
Vacation is almost over. The parts that we have looked for are mostly not available in the iGEM 2009 distribution registry, except for lead. We might have to construct the parts ourselves. Once we have our parts and our circuit models, doing experiments is a piece of cake. It's time to fuel up. Look for sponsors.

Engineering State
Discover Biological Engineering
Engineering State 2013
One of the best opportunities to provide outreach to high school students is during the annual  Engineering State program held at Utah State University every June. This year, our team was  fortunate enough to lead sessions attended by over 140 students from five states. Two separate  sessions were set up to allow the students to learn more about synthetic biology as well as  introduce them to the iGEM competition.
During the first session, students were shown a video of the Dan Rather Reports, which outlined  the recent breakthroughs in synthetic biology, including a section on the 2012 iGEM  competition. The video was stopped periodically to ask the students questions and allow them to  ask questions to our team as well.
For the second session, our team designed an activity to better teach the students the procedure  of creating BioBricks using simple cloning techniques. Paper bracelets, which represented plasmid DNA, were made containing  either a spider silk gene sequence or a GFP gene sequence. The sequence was bookended by the  restriction sites EcoR1/Xba1 and Spe1/Pst1, which were represented by different colors and lines. Scissors were labeled with letters corresponding to each restriction site (E, X, S and P) and represented the restriction enzymes. Tape rolls were labeled to represent  ligase.
The student’s goal was to create a construct with a spider silk unit followed by a GFP  insert. By labeling each of the ""restriction sites"" with different colors/lines, it was much more simplistic to illustrate how these pieces could be taped back together to either regenerate the restriction site(E site with E site yielded the same color and line shape) or create a scar site (S site with X site matched in line shape but were different colors). Once finished, it was explained how this process could be repeated to create longer silk  repeating constructs and how GFP was used as a reporter gene to allow us to tell if spider silk is  being produced.
After this activity, the students were taken on a tour of our lab to walk them through each step of  the cloning process. Each station had preparations that could be shown to the tour group such as  a spun down culture tube and a GFP producing spider silk agar plate.
After each session, a survey with a series of questions was handed out to the students to see what the thought of the activities. Approximately 61% of"

Week 1 - Bootcamp
Training week for all team members
Basic Wet lab planning
Not 3 days after the end of exam season we began, with a crash course in synthetic biology (from a plant biologist). Both student and instructor were a bit nervous - as the first team from Cardiff this would all be learning experience for all. We spent the first 3 days going through all the procedures , the bread and butter that would be essential for all labwork moving on. Having been trained in GMO safety , we could dive straight in and get practice.  Progress-wise, all members got lab experience and we transformed some reference samples for later comparison. We also had an Human practices planning session to work out how to best approach our problem.

Week 2 - First Steps
Rivalry between Chemists and Biologists
Outreach work gets started
The training wheels were off, and we were free to put our planning into practice. Unfortunately delivery issues hampered our progress, so  it was less of a leap and more of a small step, but progress is progress. Miniprep yields were improving, the Chemists finally stopped calling the incubator 'the oven', and we successfully did our first solo transformation (pet16b into C3019H competent cells). Not only this, but we managed to get in touch with the Cardiff University PR officer to discuss ideas about how to promote ourselves. We organised a piece in our University paper, Ghairr Ryhdd (link?), to stir up interest in our project.

The Theory
The PDC consist of three subunits; Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2), Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), there the E1 subunit catalyzes the initial reaction step and the E2 fill the dual role of continuing the reaction and acting as the scaffold of the complex. The E3 subunit catalyzes the final step. This is true for eukaryotes and prokaryotes alike. (Wikipedia)
The purpose of the antisense-RNA's is to inhibit the translation of two of the subunits in the PDC. We choose to inhibit the E1 and the E2 subunit because inhibition of the E1 subunit blocks the reaction from initializing while inhibition of the E2 would prevent the active complexes from forming due to it's function as a scaffold protein. Inhibition of the E3 subunit could cause unwanted build up of intermediates and therefore we choose not to aim at it.
According Ming-de Deng and Jogn R. Coleman in Ethanol Synthesis by Genetic Engineering in Cyanobacteria [1] , the production of ethanol is only one percent of what could be expected from the enzyme activities measured. They conclude in the discussion propose that this is due to low substrate levels (pyruvate) or low substrate levels caused by low carbon flux [in the glycolysis] due to competition from other pathways in the organism. We further know that the inhibition of the PDC causes high levels of  pyruvate in many organisms. If indeed the limiting factor for the synthesis of ethanol is the pyruvate level then the inhibition of the PDC should do the job, provided an increase of the carbon flux through the glycolysis is the result.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," hosted an inspiring public lecture by Kevin Esvelt, the inventor of PACE, sharing his vision of truly socio-scientific projects in context of CRISPR gene drives. Then, we went to TEDx Heidelberg, engaged with the people via the game “evolutionary wheel-of-fortune” we created and discussed their hopes and concerns. In addition, we worked intensively with the next generation of scientists, our high school students. Here, we spread the news on synthetic biology in an iGEM seminar at a local high school and hosted a school class from Berlin for a course on responsible genetic engineering in our lab. For public outreach, we created a set of both educating and entertaining videos bringing the concept of evolution and our project of accelerated, directed evolution right to the interested public community.
Human Practices - Silver Medal Criteria
Collaborations
We collaborated with many iGEM teams during the course of our project. Thereby, we engaged in a bi-directional exchange. On the one hand, we cloned constructs for the iGEM team Freiburg, provided help to other iGEM teams (PCR First Aid Service) and many more. On the other hand, we performed an inter-lab study to validate the performance of our mutagenesis plasmids.
Collaborations
Engaging Experts
High impact projects with consequences affecting whole humanity should always be discussed with professionals from different scientific backgrounds. To meet this goal we talked to theologists, legal professionals, safety representatives, astrophysicists, and experts in the field of medicine, agriculture, information technology and many more. Check out the professionals who shaped our project!
Expert Interviews
Safety
Although phages are volatile and challenging to work with, it is feasible to handle them safely provided that they are handled with good laboratory practice and great awareness. To do so, we informed ourselves about environmental and personal protection measures and created special phage-spaces in the lab to reduce contamination risk.
Safety and Security
Education
Inciting interest of young people to shape the next generation of scientists is a core mission of our Human Practice activities. We held an iGEM seminar at a local high school and hosted a school class from Berlin for a course on responsible genetic engineering in our lab. On top, we educated a high school student for a two weeks internship at our lab.

Global economic recovery continued in 2013 and is expected to strengthen during the first half of the forecast period.
Significant downside risks remain however, due to uneven economic recovery in Europe, political tension in Russia and recent events in Africa and the Middle East.
The global population aged 65 and over will grow faster than any other age segment, and will account for almost 30% of overall population growth in the next five years
Demographic trends will act as a significant driver of global demand for pharmaceuticals during the next five years: increase in diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions and an aging population will drive developed markets, while population growth coupled with improved access to healthcare will drive emerging market growth.
Most countries will experience an increase in pharmaceutical spending per capita by 2018.
Chart notes:
Spending used to calculate spend per capita in US$ at actual and forecasted variable exchange rates.                 Growth in the U.S. market will remain strong, disproportionate to its population growth; this is driven by fewer patent expiries than in previous years, innovative product launches and rising prices.                 Despite high growth in pharmerging countries, there remains a large difference in                 pharmaceutical spending per capita versus developed markets                 Only France and Spain will see a contraction of pharmaceutical spend per capita in 2018, due to policies intended to control spending growth.                 Highest growth is anticipated in China, where per capita spending is anticipated to grow by over 70% in the next five years.                 As the second largest market in the world, China’s spend is expected to be just 9% per capita of that in the U.S.

Background:
Cellulose is the most abundant carbon source on the planet and consequently, cellulolysis is an essential part to the carbon cycle as it replenishes atmospheric carbon. However, the rate of atmospheric carbon accumulation has been increasing exponentially since the onset of industrial age combustion of fossil fuels. Significant changes in global climate can be attributed to increased atmospheric carbon levels, calling an action to start using renewable carbon energy sources. We aim to use waste cellulosic biomass from paper and crop waste as a source of renewable energy by harnessing the catalytic activity of the enzymes responsible for cellulolysis, a class of enzymes known as cellulases, and engineering these cellulases to be tolerant to high saline solutions to reduce the energy cost of the cellulose pretreatment process.  There are three main types of cellulases: endocellulases, exocellulases, and beta-glucosidases; each play a vital role in cellulose degradation. Endocellulases cleave the hydrogen bonds between crystalline cellulose polymers, exposing the free beta-linked polysaccharide chains. Exocellulases then bind the ends of  loose cellulose strands and cleave the beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds between every two or three glucose subunits producing either cellobiose or cellotriose. Beta-glucosidase finally converts cellobiose into glucose, concluding the cellulose degradation pathway.
Methods:
We chose to transform Haloferax Volcanii with a B-glucosidase. Our pipeline was to collect data from different cellulases across various organisms, determine which are secreted, and decide which to try to codon optimize to transform into Hvo.
Future Goals:
Transform Hvo with our - glucosidase(WT) - pTA963C constructs. Then, test each for expression and enzymatic activity.

In the view of Mr. Su, having a sufficient knowledge about not only your company, but your competitors' on the basis of market analysis was the premise of drawing up a good business plan. Given that starting a new business is tough, Mr. Su believed that our team would encounter five “new” threats in the initial stage, that is, new team, new cooperation partners, new capital, new technologies and new customers. Referring to his personal accumulated experience, Mr. Su further gave us some suggestions targeting on starting a new business: considering that China's current intellectual property law system was still imperfect, innovative companies, like ours, who were known for their technological advantages must emphasize the patent-protection. What's more, when our brand was still not so influential compared to those prestigious companies, we should put seeking target customers and broadening sales channels on the front burner, and carefully prevent our technology property right from being infringed. On top of that, he proposed that since our hardware product was based on the ""government + grassroots + personal"" operation mode, it was necessary to work hard in marketing, with clear targets and strategies.
Public Engagement Level:
Working on synthetic biology in a lab is amazing, but sharing our enthusiasms can be even more wonderful. For the science education, we worked with people from all walks of life including teenagers, citizens, freshmen and XMU students.

Laws and Regulations Level:
Laws regulate the human world steadily and sustainably, without which we may fall into disorder. The medical reform policies, together with the reasonable superintendence will promote the rapid progress of POCT（point-of-care testing） in America [3].
America now is encountered with the payment pressures imposed by enormous medical insurance fees resulted from the aged tendency of population and the changes in the spectrum of diseases. According to the forecast by CBO, the expense of health products will reach up to 4,600 billion in 2020, accounting for 20% of the GDP. Besides, it was shown in the OECD report that in 2011, American people's average expenditure on health care was up to 8233 dollars, twice the expenditure of comparatively developed European countries like French, Switzerland and England. In March, 2010, American president Barack Obama carried out the “Affordable Care Act”, aiming at improving the quality of American health insurance service, and decreasing the cost of health care service. The “ACA Act” established the balance sharing plan, which encouraged doctors and hospitals to meet the patients' medical needs by an integral medical service"
