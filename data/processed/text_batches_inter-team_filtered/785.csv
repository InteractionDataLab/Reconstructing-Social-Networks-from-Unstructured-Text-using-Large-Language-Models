UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where"
Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the auxotrophic E. coli strain. In my experience in some situations the auxotrophy can be fulfilled even by the presence of other amino acids in the medium. Hence it would be ideal to test of all auxotrophs that are to be used in the project in the presence of the different amino acids to be used in the project. There should be a clear difference here - growth when focal amino acid is provided, no growth when any other amino acid is provided.
TD: Exactly. Our Auxotrophy system is used in a two way co-culture. We have already added histidine but didn’t consider that it could influence the dependencies. So, Thank you for this tip! Why did you start researching auxotrophies and co-cultures?
Sh: I got interested in studying the interactions between bacteria (in a social or community context) during my studies for my masters degree in microbiology. Then I further read about metabolic dependencies in microbial communities and how this possibly affects the percent of bacteria we can cultivate and isolate. It was fascinating to learn how auxotrophies can lead to interactions and networks between microorganisms.
TD: Interesting! Where can this focus on co-cultures built on auxotrophies lead to in research?
Sh: Auxotrophies can be thought of as the  dependency of an organism on an external source of an essential molecule which in most cases are amino acids, vitamins or nucleotides. These metabolites have to be part of the primary metabolism in a cell and hence essential for growth and proper cell function. A co-culture or interaction based on the exchange of such essential metabolites makes the interaction itself obligatory for the involved partners and hence a good model system to study. Furthermore due to the involvement of the metabolites, especially amino acids, in primary metabolism one can observe direct effects of the interaction (taking place in co-culture) on the behavior of both partners.
TD:  Do you have experiences with amino acid exchange without exporters?
Sh: The cross-feeding system that I used and studied for my PhD did not inherently contain mutations in any of the amino acid exporters. We observed exchange of amino acids via physical structures connecting cells. However we cannot completely rule out the involvement of exporters as a response to amino acid starvation.
TD: In your publication it is mentioned that the exchange took place via nanotubes. Did you modify your cells for this? And if yes, how?
Sh: We used a synthetically engineered cross-feeding system wherein we introduced two mutations in wildtype

1) P23019-r: 45.8 + 3 = 48.8
2) P23019-f: 60.8 + 3 = 63.8
3) J61002-bb-f: 52.2 + 3 = 55.2
4) J61002-term-r: 49.3 + 3 = 52.3
The lowest temperature was 49 (48.8) so we proceeded to do a PCR with these values. The J61002 plasmid backbone was properly amplified.However, the P23019 backbone remained unamplified despite these changes.

Alina and Lilia did MITOMI on tetR-GFP expressed from plasmid, it was loaded on chip in ITT expression mix. DNA was spotted on June 29 in different concentrations for both: consensus (tetO1) sequence and a random sequence ((-)control).
Images: Green fluorescence comes from GFP-TetR and red fluorescence comes from DNA (cy-5 labeled).
This experiment confirms that wtTetR is expressed and correctly folded by SP6 expression system. The TF recognizes tetO1 consensus sequence while the tested random sequence (-)control has a significantly lower binding affinity to TetR.
Gibson Assembly
On the Gibson assembly side of things, Vincent and Irina purified the PCR product of both the J61002 plasmid and the pTet-RFP construct using the standard PCR purification protocol. Then, using NanoDrop, they measured the concentrations of J61002 plasmid and of the RFP construct:
RFP (820 bp) : 28.8 ng/microL
J6 (2334 bp) : 26 ng/microL
Instead of following the instructions on the wiki by Nikolaus Obholzer which has the wrong formula for finding the equal molecular ratio, we determined that the ratio ought to be 80/233 since the length of the RFP fragment is 820 bp and the length of the J6 plasmid is 2334. To make the Gibson mix, we used 2.6 microliters (80 ng % 28.8 ng/microL) of the RFP segment and 9 microliters of the plasmid (230 ng % 26 ng/microL). The assembly was done with a sample of 5 microliters taken"

Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, the plate will be checked for the presence of colonies.  If they are present, then a liquid culture will be started in order to grow more of the Yeate’s bacterial strain.  Aliquots will be taken and glycerol stocks will be made for use in the future.  In addition, colony PCR may be done in order to verify that the plasmid of interest is still in the bacteria that grew.
There were colonies on the plates!
Observation:  Much of the colonies were lawns, as the entire tube was used to plate yesterday.  There were several individual colonies that grew from the later streaks.
Notes for growing E. coli from Qiagen website:
Growth of E. coli strains
Good microbiological technique will always ensure the best yield and quality of plasmid DNA. To prepare the perfect bacterial culture for your plasmid prep, follow the steps below.
1. Prepare a starter culture by inoculating a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate into 2–10 ml LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Grow at 37°C for ~8 hours (logarithmic growth phase) with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).
Tip: Do not inoculate directly from glycerol stocks, agar stabs, or plates that have been stored for a long time, as this may lead to loss or mutation of the plasmid.
Tip: It is often convenient to grow the starter culture during the day so that the larger culture can be grown overnight for harvesting the following morning.
2. Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into a larger volume of selective LB medium, as indicated in the appropriate plasmid purification protocol.
Use a flask of at least 4 times the volume of culture to ensure sufficient aeration.  Do not use a larger culture volume than recommended in the protocol, as this will result in inefficient lysis and reduce the quality of the preparation.

""I believe that synthetic biology holds promise for either solving or reducing the impact of many of humanities greatest challenges ranging from disease, to famine, to pollution which have so far evaded solution using other technologies…One concern of synthetic biology is that there may be people who would use the technology to the detriment of society. Another possible risk is that something is created that has an unintended affect that goes unnoticed for too long. For those reasons, people involved in the field need to have high ethical standards and rigorous testing of products should be completed prior to release. However, I see the potential benefits of synthetic biology far outweighing the concerns.""
Do you have any concerns regarding genetically modified foods?
""I think food, which is very personal, can have a high “worry factor” regarding whether it is safe and that something as complex as synthetic biology is difficult for people who are not in the field to understand. People tend to fear what they don’t understand. Perhaps people in the field/industry of synthetic biology could improve their image through education of the public regarding the products they provide.""

What concerns do you have about genetically modified foods?
""My concerns lie more in how genetically modified crops are tested and regulated. For example, when I take a prescription medication for a disease, or antibiotic for a bacterial infection, I am aware that the drug has undergone extensive research, including laboratory development, animal trials, and clinical trials before I personally am allowed to take it. It makes me feel safer knowing that these protocols are in place to insure that I am being treated in the safest way possible…Like medication, food is something that we ingest daily, and thus any food, genetically modified or not, needs to fulfill certain safety protocols. Genetically modified foods should go through extensive testing before they are marketed for human consumption because their biology has been altered.""

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#human#essay_-_-_TEXT.html," might be that they have emerging properties. This is what we experience as complex. 70% of the participants of our survey have shown an interest to simplify and try to understand complexity instead of avoiding it. Another phenomenon observed was the deviation between languages. Depending on the language spoken, complexity was judged in a different way. This fact may indicate cultural variation. The survey has taught us how complexity is perceived in the public. From our survey we can conclude that in our sample population an interest in complexity exists. A point to consider is that often people are not forced to deal with complexity directly. A cell, a dog and a computer exist as items in our daily lives but most of us do not think about their complexity in relation to other items on a daily basis. Albeit we are surrounded by complexity, it is not easy for us to name and define it.
Our second component involved interviews with experts from different backgrounds. This enabled us to broaden our horizons away from the complexity we are facing in our project to the complexity faced by people of other backgrounds. This exchange has enriched our project, as the professional fields of the interview partners as their approaches to complexity were very diverse. Our human practice has shown us the diversity of approaches of addressing complexity in our daily lives, in our professional fields, in science and when encountering complex situations. From the talk with the priest J. Fuisz we learnt that in his opinion religion and believe help us to find a way away from complexity and towards God. Thus we can live a life in trust instead of confusion and despair. According to K. Chikkadi , a scientist working with mikro- and nano systems, and Mr. Veress, a philosophy teacher, complexity arises from simple phenomena. From D. Garcia we got the following input on the perception of complexity. „Complexity is a property of a system and it can be measured. It can be shown whether a system is complex or not: for a complex system, the sum of its elements is higher than each one of them independently in superposition.“ We learned that it is often useful to simplify the complexity to obtain a more accessible approach. In the process of simplification we should not forget the relationship to reality.
Sharing as our fourth pillar was done in lectures at a high school where we aimed at explaining the fundamentals of synthetic biology and how it can be a way of approaching complexity. A science slam is defined as a scientific presentation competition where scientists present their topics in a predefined timeslot and in a funny, accessible way for the open public.

A lack of developed infrastructure for traditional diagnosis after screening such as high-quality cytology labs, transportation of samples to be observed by a specialist or methods of processing results
A large urban-rural development divide means that although treatment options could be available in cities for the majority of the population it is too far away to be accessed easily
Our tool overcomes these problems.
Our test is cheap and it doesn’t require high-quality cytology labs or complex infrastructure, or trained personnel to interpret - currently interpreting cervical smears is extremely difficult and several years of expertise and education which is not always available in developing countries. This would allow our test to be used by governments with various competing health needs.
It’s portability means that healthcare workers can reach out to rural communities with kits to carry out the screening and deliver results within hours. This means the large administrative task of carrying out any medical screening is streamlined for the less developed country. The early diagnosis provided by our test has the potential to reduce high cancer mortality rates.
Furthermore, developing countries are likely to improve their healthcare provision and a cheap screening test for cancer would become increasingly important. As the population ages, cancers will be responsible for more deaths.
Pre-invasive cervical lesions can currently be excised by the loop excision electrosurgical procedure, which can be carried out in an outpatient-setting, under local anesthetic. It has a cure rate of 80-95% with very minimal specialized equipment.
Cervical cancer also has miRNA biomarkers. [42] For cervical cancer, the lack of a viable screening program, rather than a lack of treatment options or accessibility is a key to the high cancer mortality rates in these countries compared to more developed countries. [41]
In the case of NSCLC treatment is generally palliative since it is rarely detected early enough for curative treatment. In less developed countries, palliative care is expensive and inaccessible since healthcare systems prioritise chemotherapeutic drugs to patients with a chance of survival. [43]
Although there is no low cost, quick and relatively easily treatment to excise NSCLC tumors (patients generally have to undergo a lobectomy to remove part of the affected lung), the development of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lobectomies could cut costs for tumor excision in the long-term. [44] This form of lobectomy uses cameras and surgical instruments used through very small incisions. Whilst it involves equipment that is more expensive to purchase initially and highly trained surgeons, the benefits of a lower chance of infection and a shorter hospital stay eventually outweigh this.

Best composite part: BBa_K2886013
Introduction
BBa_K2886013, composited by BBa_K2886006 and BBa_K2886005 is our best composite parts, which is used to confirm our BiFC system. Actually, our BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) system consists of two chains encoded by two paired parts: BBa_K2886013 and BBa_K2886012.
Structures and BiFC
BiFC, a technology put forward in 2012, is aimed to visualize the interaction of two proteins. CECFP and nECFP are the C- and N-terminal of ECPF (BBa_E0020), which is a classical part that has been used 87 times till 2017. And we split this fluorescent protein at the site A155 into two parts. If these two parts of BiFC bind with each other, and they will emit fluorescence just as complete ECFP.
Moreover, to realize higher affinity and efficiency of ligand-receptor binding, we alter a few amino acids on the binding surface with the assist of Rosetta.
Test results

Figure 7.7: structure Nootkatone
The first milestone to achieve our goal is the separate integration of each of our three enzymes ValS, BM3 and ADH into level 1 vectors (Dueber Toolbox) in yeast and to verify their expression by Western Blot analysis. Therefore, a 3xFlag/6xHis-tag was added to the N-terminus of each of the proteins.  It enables us to use an anti-His antibody followed by an anti-mouse-antibody to make protein abundances visible. Subsequently, the two enzymes ADH and ValS were combined in a  level 2 cassette plasmid.  BM3 is designed as a level 1 plasmid and will be co-expressed with the level 2 plasmid to achieve a nootkatone production. The expression of the enzymes in the cytoplasm is again verified by Western Blot analysis.   The further approach aims to provide the enzymes with C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signals type one, which finally converts the nootkatone pathway into our artificial compartment.
Since the production of nootkatone does not lead to a change of colour we need to apply different methods for verifying substrates. Once we succeed with the qualitative validation via Western Blot analysis, we can verify the presence of nootkatone by using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, respectively.
Model influence on Nootkatone expression
We modeled the nootkatone biosynthesis pathway using ordinary differential equations in order to optimize nootkatone production. We found two hard and an easy problem, all of which we could find a solution for. The easy problem is optimization of the enzyme concentrations of the biosynthesis pathway. According to our model of the Nootkatone pathway we found that overexpression of Valencene Synthase is necessary to maximize the Nootkatone yield, while both alcohol dehydrogenase and p450-BM3 have only minor effects on the yield.
One of the hard problems, as shown in our penalty model is the toxicity of nootkatone and nootkatol. Since the toxicity most likely stems from both nootkatone and nootkatol clogging up the cell wall we present our peroxisome as a solution for this problem. When comparing the cytosolic model to our peroxisomal model we found that, if our assumption that neither Nootkatone nor Nootkatol are able to pass the peroxisomal membrane holds up, we can greatly increase"

TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#Project#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," to produce mature spores. In the ΔSiR1 lines, only one third of the number of sporophytes was formed, the spore capsules cracked open when the spores inside were still immature and these mutant spores did not germinate. Since it takes more time to establish a mature culture with the knock-out mutants and considering the limited time in iGEM competitions, we did not actually use this mutant in our experiments for iGEM. However, the mutant can easily be ordered from the International Moss Stock Center . A consideration for the future would be to design the integration vector in a way that targeted gene knockouts in the disulfite reductase gene are possible, thus inhibiting sporulation and having a targeted integration of constructs.
Horizontal gene transfer
Concerning horizontal gene transfer, the main safety threat would be the spread of transgenes from our moss to bacteria. The transfer of primary transgenes or marker genes could lead to new bacteria strains that express these genes and could pass them on to pathogenic strains. But while this process is very common in bacteria, apart from agrobacterium tumefaciens, there are few examples of natural gene transfer between bacteria and higher eukaryotes [ Commandeur et al., 2003 ].
For the transgene to remain in the bacterial population and thus in the environment, there has to be a strong selective pressure. This could be the case in highly contaminated environments, where the ability to break down a toxic pollutant is beneficial. We are aware that our moss carries transgenes that could be advantageous to bacteria living in these polluted environments. But since all of the effectors that we are testing actually come from bacteria, we do no think that this is the main problem. The genes for these effectors are already present in the bacteria population. Nevertheless, we need to have a closer look at antibiotic resistance genes such as ereB and the selection marker nptII. Antibiotic resistance genes are the focus of attention because of their potentially strong and general selective advantage in human pathogens. But in the case of ereB, which comes from E.coli, the resistance gene is already present in the bacterial population on plasmids while in the moss it is controlled by a moss promotor and integrated in the moss genome. Therefore, it is much more likely that in case of ereB, the horizontal gene transfer occurs between bacteria and not between bacteria and moss.
A possible way to eliminate superfluous DNA sequences such as the nptII marker after a successful transformation is the use of a two-component site-specific recombination system such as Cre-loxP ["
Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," to 3 weeks, which would suit for the needs for a cloning host. For integrating the katG into the genome, we combined introducing katG with the deletion of the second nuclease by utilizing 3000 bp homologous overhangs of the upstream and downstream flanking genomic region of exeM. These overhangs are fused to the katG transcription unit, that is amplified from the E.coli DH5𝛼 genome, by fusion PCR and subsequently transformed via natural transformation as a cotransformation.
The lac operon

The lac operon of E. coli consists of the three genes lacI, lacA and lacY. In the cloning strain, the fact that the β-galactokinase cleaves X-Gal into a blue dye became apparent. The lacZ gene encodes the β-galactokinase which consists of two parts: the lacZ-alpha and the lacZ-omega. It has been shown that if the alpha fragment was deleted, the omega fragment is not functional. By introduced the alpha fragment on a plasmid, alpha-complementation occurs. We also wanted to make the blue-and-white selection possible for our VibriClone, as it is in the DH5𝛼 strain of E. coli. Therefore we checked at first which lac genes are present in the wildtype of V. natriegens. We found the lacA gene on chromosom 1 and the lacZ and lacI gene on chromosom 2.
As you can see, several parts are missing or different in all three proteins (Figure 4). What indicates that the lac genes are not functional in V. natriegens, which makes sense as lactose can not be found in its natural habitat and therefore genes for lactose metabolism are not needed and no selection pressure is present. That's the reason why we decided to amplify the lac Operon from DH5𝛼 that has no lacZ alpha subunit.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Brainstorm ideasecondweek_-_-_TEXT.html,"GEM's project (which was about making bacterias smell banana or wintergreen), saying that the general process was impressive, but the “have fun” point was bad : why didn't they choose to make about it a project more useful?
What kind of misuse?
When we evoke the question of misuse, the main problem pointed by the team wasn't that “bioterrorism fear” but the risk that some innovation permits by life science today could be used by everyone for bad reason. That way, bioterrorism is not dreaded, but “own and home made paternity test”. That point lead us to that particular place life science technology are about nowadays : new form of knowledge take us to new form of control. When that technologies are in everybody's hands, that control can be too.
The Steve Kurtz's case : a way to reconsider DIY politically.
During the debate, I refer to the Steve Kurtz case : Steve Kurtz is an American professor and artist of the Critical Art Ensemble, was arrested in 2004 under the patriot act law, because of his possession of biological materials in his own house, preparing an art exhibition (more info here ). It was, for our talk, a way to wonder about the political element of that kind of DIY practices. Someone in the team reconsider it in that new light of political resistance, thing went more “useful”. DIY is good to protest, not to make science.
To conclude, that talk wasn't about doing crazy stuff in your garage, but about science : aim, methods, places, creativity, professional and amateurs roles in that process. That kind of uncompromising way to perceive alternative practices in their field is obviously about that, because of acceptation of it in other discipline (informatics) or for other goals (protest).

UNSW_Australia,2016,Team:UNSW Australia#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,", but more than likely it was due to some quirk of the sequence. We found out the VR binds two locations (once at its correct site and once in the terminator), but even that accounted for only two of the many bands. As such, we set this aside for now...
But we had other colonies to screen, too. We tested 11 colonies from each of tolR and g3p in pSB1C3, to hopefully submit to the registry. For each we identify one with the correct sized insert, and so we miniprepped, PCR amplified the insert, and submitted for sequencing
At the same time we also began working on isolating our alMGS-bearing cells. For this we took two parallel approaches: using (yet more) colony PCRs to screen transformants, but also redigesting alMGS (i.e. restarting the 3A assembly) as we realised that alMGS has an EcoRI site in its middle and hence was cut into multiple fragments during EcoRI digestion, thus vastly reducing the likelihood of a transformant taking up the full alMGS product. To solve this, we digested weakly with EcoRI, and gel extracted the band that corresponded to a single rather than a double cut. Late in this process, though, we also realised that having an EcoRI site excludes it from being submitted to the registry, and so stopped work on it...
Also, regarding our new Duet Expression Plasmids, we miniprepped colonies, ran these on a gel to confirm their sizes, digested to open them up to our insert, and finally phosphatase treated.

CRISPR Team
We finally decided to pull the plug on the CRISPR side of our project; it'd simply proven too fiddly and tough to optimise. Instead, we ordered KOs of degP and tolA from Yale's E.coli Genetic Stock Centre. As mentioned elsewhere, we acknowledge that the genetic background of these strains will be different to those in which we will test our other parts, which will present somewhat of a confound, but we believe that collecting the data but making that caveat clear is still important

Charlotte managed to take images of the DegP KO that recently arrived.

Restreak results
From 26/8
All restreaked clones (pSB1K3.SOD⋅His 1 & 2 and pSB1K3.His⋅SOD 1 & 3) were able to grow on both Cm 25 and Km 50. This raises the question whether our plasmid actually carries resistance to both Km and Cm. To test this further, new restreaks were made, where colonies from the Cm 25 plate were streaked on a new Km 50, and vice versa. Also, pSB1K3.RFP, pSB1C3.RFP and untransformed Top10 cells were streaked.

RNAT·RESULT
Choose the best RNAT
In the <a href="" https://2014.igem.org/Team:SYSU-China/content.html#Project/Design/RNAT "">RNAT·DESIGN</a>, we have introduced that typical types of RNATs coding for heat shock proteins and virulence factors meet the requirements of temperature control, so we decided to use one common type. Fortunately, the 2008 iGEM team, TUDelft, has modified three kinds of natural zipper-like RNATs: Rose element (for short: ROSE), FourU element (for short FourU) and PrfA element (for short PrfA), which have already been made into basic parts of biobricks (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K115001 "">BBa_K115001</a>, <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K115002 "">BBa_K115002</a> and <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K115003 "">BBa_K115003</a>). We then construct three plasmids containing these three RNATs respectively, between a constitutive promoter (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23119 "">BBa_J23119</a>) and a reporter protein-mRFP (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E1010 "">BBa_E1010</a>), transformed the three plasmids into top10, to test whether these modified RNATs work well. We used the existing biobrick (<a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23100 "">BBa_J23100</a>) in which only the FourU element is replaced by RBS compared to our experimental group, serving as the positive control. According to experiment results done by TUDelft, the temperature threshold of the part we choose is 37°C for FourU"

Figure 2 : Corn Syrup chromatography analysis
Figure 3 : in-lab produced maltodextrin chromatography analysis
Figure 4 : Industrial hexamaltaose  chromatography analysis
First, we can see that the industrial maltopentaose is closer to hexamaltose than maltopentaose. The homemade one is particularly rich in tetramaltose. By comparing homemade maltopentaose to corn syrup, we can assert that the purification we conducted is an enrichment in tetramaltose. We can also see that there are still some DP 2 and 3 in our homemade product. This could be a problem regarding our selection goal, but we observed that petri dishes with maltopentaose (both kinds) never showed growth of our negative control with the wt pIV. We concluded that these DP 2 and 3 were not in high enough concentrations to allow growth of false positives on our selection media. Traces of DP 2 and 3 might even have helped our bacteria to implant on their medium before facing restrictive media with low resources concentrations. Considering these results, we judged this step of maltopentaose production by ourselves as a success.

With the former option, he also warned us that we need to ensure that the operators using it would be able to know how to use them in a simple but effective manner. This is because they are used to using simpler and quicker operation lead detection systems such as taking water samples. Therefore, in order for our project to work effectively when launched, simplicity and performance are two things we have to bear in mind.

In July, we received a request for help from team Uppsala. Team Uppsala wanted to test their microfluidic devices in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, the team did not have a yeast lab at their university and lacked some necessary components in order to work with yeast thus we sent two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, W1588-4A and W1588-4C, in order to help the Uppsala team with the testing of their method in a eukaryotic organism.
Furthermore, we sent the team two shuttle vectors, pRS415 and pRS423, a high copy-number and a low copy-number vector, respectively, which the team has used to perform their tests in yeast.
SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen
In August, the bioinformaticians from DTU BioBuilders, SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen arranged a meeting for discussing ideas on how to apply mathematical modelling to each other’s projects.
SDU-Denmark and UNIK-Copenhagen explained their issues, and the DTU BioBuilders suggested suitable models based on systems of differential equations, that were well-received by both teams.
Furthermore, the DTU BioBuilders explained the genome-scale model (GSM) concept and received reasonable questions and suggestions from the other teams.
Getting help ourselves
Uppsala
We tried to insert chromoproteins into the chlorampenicol backbone pSB1C3, but without success. Therefore, we contacted team Uppsala in order to get some help. Since the team had chromoproteins in stock from prior iGEM Uppsala teams, they helped us moving one of the chromoproteins from the pSB1A3 backbone into the pSB1C3 backbone.

Cas9 in Plants Project
A CRISPR/cas9 system is a large protein guided by a self-guiding RNA, which is capable of targeting specific DNA sequences. Cas9 has been characterized previously in bacteria and mammalian cells. Often targeted to a promoter region, Cas9 acts as highly effective gene repressing tool. The goal of the cas9 project is to make this regulatory tool available to plant genetic engineering.

Introduction
A CRISPR/Cas9 system, which is found in a few prokaryotic organisms allows for very specific DNA targeting.  The system as found is used to cleave DNA or completely cut out certain sections, perhaps as a defense mechanism.  However, scientists in recent years have turned their attention to CRISPR/cas9 systems due to the highly specific targeting abilities.  Mutation of a few key areas of the protein caused the creation of dcas9.  dcas9 is catalytically inactive and can be expressed in controlled quantities and will not cleave DNA. When coupled with a 100bp engineered self-guided RNA sequence the  dcas9 protein can be bound to any 20bp DNA sequence.  This has many implications including gene-specific down regulation, localization abilities via attachment to the cas9 protein complex, and  gene-sepcific up regulation via the attachment of an enhancer targeted to a promoter region.  There are many possible uses of dcas9, and would serve as an excellent new tool in the plant synthetic biology toolkit.
Background
The below diagram describes how the dcas9-guided RNA targeting system works.
Reference:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413002110
Method
To test dcas9 we designed a vector that expressed both GFP and RFP under two different CMV35s promoters.  Transforming this plasmid into plants should show a constant GFP to RFP ratio under florescence spectroscopy.(this vector is identical to the one designed for the promoter project) Once this generic ratio is established we can modify this plasmid to include the dcas9 protein and guiding RNA sequence.  If we target the guiding RNA to the GFP/promoter polymerase binding region we should expect a ratio indicating a decrease in GFP expression. It should be noted that dcas9 and the RNA guiding sequence will both need their"

Moreover, we also confirmed the expression of Mtr CAB. In a word, we successfully constructed a mature Mtr CAB system with the co-expression of CcmA-H

Thought Leaders Meeting
Our team strongly believes that we, as scientists, should always consider and respect the varying faiths, doctrines,                 and perspectives of the general public. As a result, we decided to meet with the Alberta Health Services’                 Spiritual Care Advisory Committee, a group of religious thought leaders from different faiths involved in                 healthcare-related decision-making in Alberta. We explained our project and its applications both as a research                 tool and as a gene therapy tool. Our project received great support from their team, which expressed great                 interest in integrating the core components of our project into their outreach efforts in the community. The Spiritual Care Advisory Committee often works closely with patients in our healthcare system - by reaching                 out through them, we were able to communicate to the general public about the uses of our project.
Conferences
North American iGEM Kickoff
The Calgary team participated in and hosted the North American iGEM Kickoff in July 2018. We were joined in person by several Alberta iGEM teams and video called with teams from around North America. We were able to establish collaborations and learn about other teams’ projects. Specifically, we began planning our collaboration with the Lethbridge team. The Kickoff also involved several workshops hosted by synthetic biology entrepreneurs and iGEM alumni. These were very useful for constructing a narrative, hearing more about the realm of synthetic biology, and wiki design principles.

Our team participated in and hosted the aGEM event at the University of Calgary on September 22 and 23, 2018. Along with 6 other iGEM teams, we presented our project to a panel of judges, who are all involved with iGEM. We were extremely thankful to receive feedback following our presentation, regarding our visual presentation slides, content, and presenting style. This feedback was readily incorporated into the presentation we are preparing for iGEM. We also had the opportunity to learn about and collaborate with other Alberta iGEM teams.

Deeper the color is, the more they know of synthetic biology or the more they are interested in iGame. For example, light pink means they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.

uOttawa,2014,Team:uOttawa#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," idea synthetic biology could help us achieve and a bracelet-making activity that was based on a 'DNA code' where different colour beads represented the base pairs in amino acid codons.
Furthermore, in the context of this partnership, a few members of our Human Practices Team were able to participate in a training workshop offered by Let's Talk Science to improve their skills as youth science educators. This served to enhance our ability to communicate science concepts to the general public, specifically to a young audience.
As an established organization in the Ottawa community, Let's Talk Science had prior contact with elementary, middle and high schools across the city. They were able to advertise our offer of synthetic biology-oriented presentations to these schools and the response was huge and immediate.
Classroom Presentations
In addition to participating in Let's Talk Science and community events, our collaboration with Let's Talk Science also allowed us to extend our outreach to students in public schools. This is profound because the classroom setting allows us to teach students in an environment of learning where distractions, such as those present at community events, are minimal. And the earlier students are exposed to synthetic biology and science in general, the less time they have had to have been influenced by the plethora of misconceptions about science that are circulating in the public sphere. Very often adults assume that young children are incapable of grasping or appreciating the beauty and elegance of scientific ideas but they could not be more wrong. In fact, children's minds are far more open than those of adults allowing them to circumvent the problem altogether.
We discovered that teachers whole-heartedly agree with our sentiments about presenting synthetic biology to students early on, after receiving dozens of requests to give in-class presentations within the first few days of having our presentations advertised by Let's Talk Science. Despite the fact that we were not able to meet an overwhelming demand for presentations, we managed to reach several elementary and middle schools and the response from the teachers and students was resoundingly positive. Students' questions were never-ending and the teachers' feedback always included a request to return and do more activities.
During the one-month period that we had to plan and carry out the activities, we managed to do three presentations at three different schools and received wonderful feedback from all three schools. Once schools open up again this September, we will resume our activities in the classrooms to allow us to reach an even greater number of students.

For more information, please visit our Parts page.
Current clinically-relevant pathogens have not been seen to exhibit resistance against our antimicrobial proteins of choice. Art-175 has been experimentally shown to be not susceptible to resistance development, likely because it targets the structural element of the bacterial cell wall that is highly conserved across species and difficult to mutate [ 8 ]. The mechanism by which Microcin S exerts antimicrobial activity is still currently unknown, but no bacterial strains except for the original strain of probiotic E. coli which produces Microcin S has been shown to be resistant to it thus far [ 9 ].
Secreting the Proteins
The proven secretion of folded, functional proteins across both bacterial cell membranes is a challenge for present day microbiologists. Our solution requires that we can export DspB, DNase, Art-175 and MccS out of the expression host and into the local biofilm environment. To achieve this, signal sequences are fused to the enzymes to target them for export through natural E. coli secretion pathways. Using this mechanism we can direct our anti-biofilm and antimicrobial agents at a biofilm infected surface as they are being produced.
DsbA
DsbA is a oxidoreductase protein found predominantly in Gram-negative bacteria, which functions as a protein-folding factor [ 19, 20 ]. The 2-19 peptide sequence of DsbA is a signal sequence that can direct passenger proteins for co-translational export via the signal recognition particle pathway [ 21, 22 ]. It has recently been shown that the DsbA signal sequence is capable of mediating passenger protein secretion under a selection of different induction temperatures [ 23 ].

Objective: To growth new biofilms for future testing with various means
Procedure: In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µl of RFP, and 21 µL KAN were pipetted into it and the solution was mixed. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.
Biofilms: Bleach Concentration Gradient
Objective: From our work we are able to determine how effective different cleaners are in degrading biofilms. To test the resilience of the biofilms in another mean, we will test how well the biofilms are degraded at different concentrations of bleach
Procedure:
1.Standard solution of 0.252% bleach was made from the stock bottle for a 50 mL volume
2.The following concentrations had been made from the standard solution of bleach and water. Each concentration was diluted by two folds of the previous solution.
• 0.252% • 0.126% • 0.063% • 0.0315% • 0.01575% • 0.007875% • 0.0039375%
3.The dilutions were made for a 15 mL falcon tube using water and standard bleach solution
4.3.2 mL of one of the bleach dilutions were placed in one the Petri dishes containing biofilms from the previous day. This process was repeated for the other six dilutions.
5.The biofilms were then allowed to degrade for 15 mins.
6.The bleach solutions in each of the Petri dishes was emptied and rinsed once with Milli-Q water.
7.LB media tubes were labeled with one of the bleach solutions. 5 µL of KAN was added to each labeled tube.
8.20 µL of LB from one tube was taken out and placed on the edge of one of the Petri dishes.
9.The media was then placed back into the tube it was taken out of.
10.This process (Steps 8-9) was repeated for the remaining six tubes
11.LB media tubes were placed in the 37˚C incubator for 24 hours.

Tacoma RAINmakers Lab Notebook
Week 1
Digestion and Isolation of pSB1C3 Backbone.
The purpose of digesting the pSB1C3/PArsRGFP construct was to separate the backbone from the former GFP insert. Tacoma RAINmakers sought to isolate the pSB1C3 backbone employed in their 2017 construct, as the GFP reporter complex was no longer desired. Apparent disadvantages of GFP indication in biosensors are ultraviolet readings. The RAINmakers prefered a chromoprotein that produces color in the visible spectrum. Enzymes XbaI and SpeI were used to cleave the terminator sites of the vector, freeing the pSB1C3 backbone. NEB resources confirmed that the Cutsmart Buffer 2.1 is the most compatible with these particular enzymes, providing an optimized environment for digestion. Combining the reagents listed in Table 1.0, the reaction was set at 37ºC in a water bath for 1 hour and 45 minutes. This reaction was completed in duplicate to increase statistical probability of desired backbone DNA.
Following completion of pSB1C3 digestion, Tacoma RAINmakers employed a standard procedure listed in the protocol page as “Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.” The purpose of this gel was to confirm if the backbone DNA had been successfully isolated from the undesired GFP insert. As cited in Figure 1, the expected pSB1C3 bands were located at 2000bp. A gel extraction process, also outlined in the protocol section, was completed in order to remove and contain the digested pSB1C3 DNA.

BactWars - a new hope for antimicrobial resistance and global epidemics
Many ideas, one goal: fighting bacteria with bacteria
In today’s world, antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious issues that humanity has to face. At the same time the most vulnerable people have to face epidemics due to lack of medication access and harsh conditions. In this context, we decided to develop a biological tool able to neutralize antibiotic resistance genes.
We designed and engineered a conjugative plasmid that will be able to propagate within bacteria and neutralize targeted genes to re-sensitize bacteria or kill them. To this end, a plasmid featuring high efficiency of transfer and broad host specificity has been equipped with a CRISPR Cas9 system and one or more guide RNAs. Upon expression in recipient cells, the customized CRISPR Cas9 system will selectively inactivate the targeted organisms by introducing double-strand breaks into its genome. This ways we can handle bacterial pathogens that are responsible for serious infectious diseases and epidemics.
The combination of inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and conjugative plasmid for the transcriptional control of target genes has already been described (ref. doi: 10.1021/sb500036q). Relying on this publication, we want to push this forward and check for possible field applications. We plan to first demonstrate that the system works between different gram negative species and secondly, to build a fully equipped conjugative plasmid armed with several guide RNAs, an efficient bio containment system for preventing its dissemination in nature, and a tracking device for monitoring its dissemination in a bacterial population."

A collection of constitutive promoters was also desirable for the toolbox. We decided to use the CP promoter collection and test it in Lactococcus lactis, that was BioBricked by the Uppsala iGEM team of 2013. The CP promoters are registered as CP1 , CP8 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 and CP44 . These parts were ordered from iGEM HQ, except for CP8 as for this promoter the sequencing was inconsistent. The promoters were sent by iGEM HQ using Escherichia coli containing pSB1C3 with the promoter as insert. E. coli was grown and the plasmids with the promoter were isolated.

③The safety of our project
Curli fiber  expressed by the bacterium Escherichia coli is a bacterial form of amyloid.  Amyloid fibers are associated with a variety of disease states, including prion  diseases and systemic amyloidosis. Curli fiber has a strong adhesive  power,?? can combine with the surface  material of many organisms, including fiber mucin, laminin, plasminogen and so  on. Vitro and in vivo tests showed that those bacteria? that be able to produce curli produce more  virulence than bacteria that don’t produce curli, including adhesion, planting  and invasion capacity of the host cell. E. Coli can produce curli fiber in its  mammalian host, which may bring related inflammation like sepsis to its hosts. Luckily, the synthetic curli fiber in our project is  used outside of our body, so it will not bring such safety problem. Besides, in  the intact bacterium, the expression of curli requires the concerted action of  several gene products. Understanding how curli are assembled may help in our  understanding of pathological amyloids in human disease.
Our project could be used to make  bioelectric detection, which could be applied in? the detection of some harmful substances to  the environment or our body. We hope it could make great contribution to some  hazardous substances’ safety problems in the near future.

The first of our diauxic growth models is a cybernetic model developed by Kompala et al [1]. This model shows that glucose (S1) is used up before the secondary carbon source (S2). During this phase, the population (X) is in exponential grow until glucose (S1) runs out. This is followed by a stationary growth phase, and finally the population enters a second exponential growth phase as they start uptaking the secondary carbon source (S2). Another model was developed by Keasling [2] that takes into account the dynamics of the lactose operon.
  About the models and simulations!
Conclusion
We have chosen a strategy of autoinduction to control the initiation of Module 2. Based on experimental data collected by our team, we were able to select 10% casamino acids as the most suitable secondary carbon source for maximal output from the PcstA promoter.

AlkL characterization
Effect of AlkL on cell growth
As shown in literature, the AlkL protein may be toxic when overexpressed and inhibits the growth of its host. We decided to test the severity of this toxicity and compare by using Anderson promoters of varying strength. We chose a gradient of expression strength, ranging from strong (0.7 measured strength) to intermediate (0.5 measured strength), to weak (0.3 measured strength) for this experiment. As a control for comparison of growth rate, we chose E. coli DH5A that was transformed with a plasmid of similar size to our parts plasmid. This is because we wanted to ensure plasmid size was not the factor that limited growth of the host. This plasmid in question contained BBa_I13401 as the insert, which had only 27 extra bp than our alkL-containing plasmids.
The 4 bacterial samples, including 3 parts and 1 control, involved in this growth curve experiment were first inoculated overnight in LB. Then, they were diluted by 100 times in a conical flask and put in a shaker at 37C for an 8 hour period. A sample of 100ul was taken every hour and put in a 96-well plate. Absorbance at 595nm of each sample was then measured by an Envision Multiplate Reader. In total, for each bacterial sample, 2 trials of triplicates were used throughout the 8 hour period.
Of all our parts, BBa_K2764001 had the strongest promoter strength, followed by BBa_K2764002 and then by BBa_K2764003. The control, had the same promoter strength as BBa_K2764001.Taken individually, the absorbance-time charateristics of each strains are as follows:

According to Figure 1., the growth rate of bacteria with BBa_K2764001 rises steadily throughout the 8-hour period and peaks"

About USTC
University of Science and Technology of China, USTC
The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is a prominent university in China and enjoys an excellent reputation worldwide. It was established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 1958 in Beijing, as a strategic action by the Chinese government, to meet China’s science and technology needs and increases the country’s international competitiveness. CAS integrated its resources with USTC, with the aim of educating top talent in cutting-edge, interdisciplinary science and technology. The establishment of USTC was hailed as “a great event in the history of education and science of China”. In 1970, USTC moved to its current location in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province.
From the start, USTC’s mission has been to “focus on frontier areas of science and technology and educate top leaders in science and technology for China and the world”. Central to its strategy has been the combination of education and research, as well as the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. Led by the most renowned Chinese scientists of the time, USTC set up a series of programs creatively encompassing frontier research and development of new technology. As a result, the university has taken the lead in higher education in China.
USTC is a world leader in fields like quantum manipulation, nanotechnology, high-temperature superconductivity, speech processing, fire science and life science. It is always ranked as one of the best universities in China. For example, USTC was ranked first among Chinese universities from 2008 to 2013 by Nature Publishing Index China. In addition, USTC attaches great importance to technology transfer and has incubated dozens of high-tech enterprises. Furthermore, it jointly built the Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT) with Hefei City in 2012, aiming"

Increased production of fragrance for new food preservation method E.coli
ABSTRACT
To innovate the refrigerator without electricity, we invented a prototype of FRAVORATOR that is possible to preserve food by antibacterial volatiles synthesized by Escherichia coli. For the high-efficiency synthetic process of preservation flavor, farnesol, we focused on improving its synthetic pathway. First, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate（DXP）synthase, Dxs, is down-regulated when its downstream material has been produced to some extent. So, we tried to over-express, another DXP synthase, nDXP, that rarely has been used in normal conditions. Also, we created fusion gene for ispC-ribB protein for enzymatic function. Second, to avoid recombinant in the real usage, we tried to knock out synthase that produces unnecessary byproduct by genome editing.

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," new wacky species of animals that are crosses of other species. It was really awe-inspiring to see the young people of our society thinking creatively about science, and furthermore how many of these students wanted to pursue careers in the sciences. Following this brainstorming activity, we held a Socratic seminar-like activity focused on bioethics and thinking about the implications and consequences of synthetic biology and progress. It was impressive how many students were able to think critically about the situation, but also hold positive outlooks and convincing arguments for science and research.
We believe our Human Practices project has had a highly positive influence on these students, and while our direct impact is small, our reach does not stop there. Our education for these students will inevitably prompt further discussion and creativity not only for those we worked with, but those who these students come into contact with. Whether it be at home, when they tell their families and friends about what the learned at school, to years from now when they enter college and embark on the same journeys as we at UCLA iGEM have."

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," our project. When we took our very first steps with protein modeling using Rosetta we quickly               discovered numerous problems and difficulties that occupied us for weeks before we even started using the software.
During our work, we realized how fast the process could have been if there was a guide detailing the               necessary resources and steps needed for a complete beginner in Rosetta. We figured that this might               be one of the reasons why so few iGEM teams have used Rosetta in the past despite its vast capabilities.
After getting great results from the software, we decided to share our experience and write this guide               ourselves so that future iGEM teams can have a better starting point. We were delighted to find that               we are not the only team using Rosetta this year and so we contacted iGEM Eindhoven and asked for               their help with the guide. Their work on the guide – writing, sharing their protocols and experience               was a valuable contribution that made the guide much more informative and comprehensive than we initially expected.

BGU - Prediction of chemoreceptor-ligand interactions
We processed potential variants of chemoreceptors for iGEM BGU using the Rosetta software.
We have used the Rosetta software in order to predict protein structure and to check for ligand-protein interactions.               Running the software and processing both the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the Tar chemoreceptor and               BGU's substances of interest - Protocatechuic acid and Ethylene glycol, yielded dozens of LBD variants.
After the filtering process, a library of variants which should theoretically serve as attractant chemoreceptors, was obtained.
Fig. 1: 3D imaging of the variants in the library with the native receptor (wild type), each color represents a different variant.

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
Best Basic Part Special Prize
To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to Registry sample submission guidelines and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

Limitations
We have characterized TERRA’s accuracy and consistency limitations to help users plan their experiments. During stress tests and other runs with TERRA we’ve identified several key factors that could lead to inaccuracies in either dispensing or well selection. Future BostonU Hardware teams can improve upon TERRA by remedying these issues via better design, but the following recommendations can be used to manually fix issues for this initial prototype. Since our CAD and STL files as well as our assembly instructions are open-sourced, future teams can recreate our system with the documentation on our Wiki.
Sample Volume Limitations and Inaccuracy
One of the main limitations currently with TERRA is the requirement of dispensed sample volumes to be multiples of the TERRA drops, which is 0.0479 mL. To give users greater control over their sample volume, smaller outer diameter tubing that connects the TERRA Adapter to the nozzle is required. The outer diameter tubing used during the duration of the project was 0.0018 m. While our model verification was done with 0.0018 m sized tubing, users are able to use their own sized tubing to better fit their needs.
Another potential solution is to utilize droplet-based microfluidics. If the desired volume is smaller or between such sizes, droplet-based microfluidics allows us to create a smaller droplets containing the experimental output encased in oil within the output fluid. Through this method, the 48 μL droplet
that dispensed from the nozzle is part sample and part mineral oil. The proportions of these liquids can be manipulated through flow rate and microfluidic chip design to achieve the desired volume.
In order for TERRA to accurately dispense droplets into the vessel, the output nozzle needs to be filled to the end with the current output. If not, the system introduces a latency in droplet. Depending on how far off the"

Sydney_Australia,2016,Team:Sydney Australia#KeepFresh_-_-_TEXT.html," must be less than 30ppb. Currently all chemical sensing devices with the exception of a gas chromatographer fail to detect ethylene at a concentration less than parts per million. Any device searching to replace traditional gas chromatography must have the capability to detect ethylene levels at this low level, or will be redundant in this context.
Stability
As this biosensor relies on the function of genetically engineered cells, immobilising them in a biosensor must allow them to remain stable. The immobilisation structure itself must also not deteriorate over time or due to exposure of unfavourable conditions.
Response Time
Biosensors are limited by the amount of time cells take to carry out the necessary processes to express the sensing and detecting proteins. Introducing mutations, or potentially increasing the strength of the promoter can manipulate this.
Technology Selection
Current Technology
There are two main methods of measuring produce ripeness. The first is to use gas chromatography to measure the rate of ethylene emanation as a proxy for the stage of ripening. This is highly accurate and highly sensitive, albeit very expensive, non-portable, and complex to use. This involves manually collecting a gas sample of air from inside a controlled produce storage room or shipping container, and loading it into the gas chromatographer for an output reading to be generated. The second method is on the other end of the spectrum in every way. Cheap, inaccurate, time-consuming and cumbersome, our team saw firsthand during our site visit to Fresh Produce Group clusters of workers manually squeezing samples of fruit from each shipping palette to assess their ripeness
This is a skill, which, according to Avocados Australia, is not taught specifically, but gained from years of experience. Neither methods allow for complete assessment of an entire shipment or stock of produce, and neither are elegant or practical. There is a clear need for a more streamlined, convenient, and reliable method of measuring ethylene levels to assess fruit/produce ripeness.
Product Design Introduction
As explored in the Government section of our Human Practices portfolio, there are many regulations that exist both here in Australia and internationally surrounding the application and production of GMOs. Additionally, our Outreach practices also exposed our team to the widespread concerns and apprehension about GMOs and their potential safety issues.
From curious parents accompanying young children at ‘Science in the Swamp’ to retired professionals at the Ku Ring Gai Rotary presentation, the main point of concern derived from the idea of genetically modified living cells being in such close proximity to fresh produce.
Whilst this does seem like a mountainous flaw in the objective of our project, it need not be. Rather, it provides"

Guest iGEMers
During the process our team member trying to help such education institution building their own team, we really met some difficult, especially in China. Luo Xuefeng, the senior student of South China Normal University, planed to construct an iGEM team in his home university. Unfortunately, the university leader refuted his plan even there are many biology students eager for such team and want to study synthetic biology.
We also received request for sponsorship or assistance from several institutions, like Zhengzhou University and several high schools, declaring the lack of official supporting from their schools, or the shortage of team members. Thus, we have another idea to share our resources and give the students an opportunity accessing synthetic biology by welcome them to join iGEM, join our consortium in a special way.
Then, we made an research about the iGEM knowledge in BGI, as the first picture showed. And the results indicated there are majority of people lack such knowledge and majority of them was resulted by some factors hardly to be resolved in a short time.
That is the iGEM Open Month for Guest iGEMers during summer. Our team is open for high school students all around the world from the beginning of July to about 20th. Training and mini-iGEM projects just like fluorescence protein experiments are available for them to stimulating their interests in synthetic biology. And then, university students are welcome to join from late July to the end of their summer vacation. They will be highly involved in our project so it is great to perform the magic together with them. The names of guys with significant contributions are as listed:

Different species of microorganisms relevant to the field of industrial biotechnology was therefore be made compatible with the system. In this way, the system becomes more flexible and the organism best suited to produce the desired product can be applied.
Lab scale to large scale
Moving from a lab setting into a large-scale industrial process is a long road to say the least. To help us consider the possible issues that may arise with a future scale-up of our project idea, we consulted several experts within the field of industrial biotechnology and microalgal research. Carl Johan Franzén, associate professor at the biology and biological engineering, and industrial biotechnology departments at Chalmers university, provided insight into some of the technical issues that might arise. Eva Albers and Joshua Mayers, researchers at the biology and biological engineering, and industrial biotechnology departments at Chalmers university of technology with focus on algal biotechnology, provided great insight into some of the considerations needed for large scale cultivation of photosynthetic microorganisms.
One of the main technical issues discussed were product separation which would increase in cost due to the lower cultivation density resulting from a photosynthesis based system. The increased cost may however be offset by the absence of cost for a sugar source for the production organisms. To study this further a more complete life cycle analysis is needed to evaluate the cost offset this will result in. This should be one of the main tasks for a continuation of the project to see if the resulting system would could be commercially viable.
The issue of product separation is also related to the problem of water use, since cyanobacteria do require large amounts of water to grow. Since freshwater is also a limited resource on our planet a saltwater living strain may be the better choice for a photosynthesis based culture system. The use of seawater does however bring with it other problems such as salinity and contamination risks and might not be a good choice for a co-culture system specifically, but may be suitable for general culture of phototrophic microorganisms. Since photosynthetic organisms require sunlight for conversion of CO2 into more complex carbon sources, the day-night cycle also becomes an issue. The flow of carbon will decrease or cease completely during nighttime unless artificial light is used. Due to the cost of energy, using artificial light for a large scale cultivation system is not viable.
To achieve a productivity level that is as high as possible increased levels of CO2 is also needed. The co-culture system itself could provide this since the production organism is using the carbon excreted by the cyanobacteria"

Nowadays, fermentation industry is crucial for a country’s economy. In China, fermentation industry output reached 2,000 billion RMB in 2011, and till 2013, this number has increased to 3,000 billion RMB (Fig.1). Fermentation industry’s output accounts for about 3 percentage of GDP in China, and it’s predicted that the output will reach 10,000 billion at the end of 2015. As a result,the optimization and improvement of fermentation process is important.
However, problems concerning fluctuation of pH in fermentation are usually knotty. Firstly, the activity of enzymes can be tremendously influenced by environmental pH. The activity of enzyme will plummet at an improper pH, and eventually the fermentation effectiveness will decrease. Worse still, a different pH can entirely change the microorganism’s fermentation products. For example, Aspergillus niger can produce citric acid at pH 2.0 ~ 3.0, while the product will be changed to oxalic acid at pH 6.5 ~ 7.5. As for corynebacterium glutamicum, the product is glutamate at pH 7.0 ~ 8.0 while at pH 5.0 ~ 5.8 the products are Glutamine and N-aceglutamide. Therefore, a suitable environmental pH is a key factor for higher fermentation productivity.
Fig.1 Fermentation industry output from 2005 to 2013[1].
To maintain fermentation pH range, people have found some methods to regulate the pH of fermentation liquor, such as probe detection technique combined with computer programs, and adding acid and alkali into fermenters straightly. However, environmental interference can strongly interrupt probe detection, and increase reaction time. What’s more, adding large amount of acid and alkali may cause unbalanced pH in different areas in fermenter. Those problems will decrease fermentation productivity and effectiveness. More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered the function of"

I spent the majority of today trying to make sense of Eugene. I finally began to understand some of the basic structure of the language and Kara and I even started to create parts and write properties for these parts. Alongside the Eugene work, Kara, Kathy, and I began to create paper prototypes of the MoClo planner in order to get the ball rolling on the design of the MoClo planner.

We began coding today in Visual Studio. The electronic notebook is all but dead at this point and Kara and my focus has been directed to the MoClo planner. Thank god Kara has some familiarity with coding because I was entirely lost. I really look forward to trying to tackle a new skill but having no idea what I was doing today was quite the humbling experience. Kara was great though in teaching me what she knows and not making me feel to bad every time (and there were a lot of times) I made a mistake.

Interlab Study
Objective
The iGEM interlab study embodies iGEM’s core values of collaboration, the development of an open community, the education of aspiring young scientists, and the advancement of synthetic biology. Thus, for the 2015 interlab study, the objective is for teams from around the globe to obtain fluorescence data from 3 different genetic devices. This aggregated data will not only aid the detailed characterization of these Biobricks, but also promote further joint scientific efforts of the iGEM community in synthetic biology.
Tested Devices
All of our devices were constructed in the PSB1C3 backbone. The chassis for all of our devices was E. coli BL21.
Device 1: J23101+I13504 in PSB1C3
Device 2: J23106+I13504 in PSB1C3
Device 3: J23117+I13504 in PSB1C3
Controls
Positive Control: BBa_I20270 (previously characterized promoter::GFP) in PSB1C3
Negative Control: BBa_R0040 (previously characterized promoter) in PSB1C3
Construction of the Devices
Our team acquired the necessary Biobricks for this interlab study from the distributed iGEM part kits. These Biobricks, each housed in the pSB1C3 vector, were transformed into E. coli K12 DH5-alpha following the standard transformation protocol and incubated overnight on chloramphenicol plates. Isolated colonies were cultured overnight in LB + chloramphenicol.

The important thing for us was to design a product which has a zero-waste approach; meaning that it would leave nothing behind. No greenhouse gas emissions or waste residues was to be released to the environment, causing pollutions. Thus, we’ve considered to make use of the carbon dioxide with a dry ice unit and a greenhouse. In addition, water that comes out as a byproduct is regained with our water purification unit.

""When you can't make them see the light, make them feel the heat."" – Ronald Reagan
To present a scientific project is very educational. It requires a good understanding of the project and might lead to a better understanding of the details. Furthermore response and questions from listeners can be very helpful, as they give an idea of the understanding of the subject as well as show new aspects and reflections on the project.
We think that it is important to practice presentation skills and use all the benefits a presentation might lead to. Therefore we participated in different outreach events, where all team members have practiced their individual presentation skills at least once.
We spend much time on outreach, but we can conclude that the benefit, especially in the form of response, had a big impact on our project.
iGEM meet-up in London.
iGEM meet-up in London hosted by YSB (1st of September - 2nd of September)
We were very happy to participate in the iGEM meet-up in London. Here we got the first opportunity to tell others about our project and discuss our policies and practices with other iGEM teams. Additionally, there were a lot of friendly participants who helped by filling out our questionnaire and giving us valuable feedback.

For this reason, the default vector must be propagated in ccdB-tolerant strains, such as DB3.1 (<partinfo>BBa_V1005</partinfo>). <partinfo>BBa_I50022</partinfo> enables the propagation of this vector at high copy in the used ccdB-tolerant strain.
Like in many other standard vector backbones (e.g. the pSB**5 series), the binding sites for standard primers VF2 (<partinfo>BBa_G00100</partinfo>) and VR (<partinfo>BBa_G00102</partinfo>) are present upstream and downstream of the BioBrick cloning site respectively. These two sequences are sufficiently distant from the cloning site to enable a good quality sequencing of the insert.
Genome integration features:
The four transcriptional terminators <partinfo>BBa_B0053</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_B0054</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_B0055</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_B0062</partinfo> ensure the transcriptional insulation of the integrated part from its flanking genome sequences.
The two FRT recombination sites (<partinfo>BBa_J72001</partinfo>) enable the excision of <partinfo>BBa_K300994</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_K300998</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_G0001</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_B0025</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_G0001</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_K300999</partinfo>-<partinfo>BBa_K300995</partinfo> (i.e. the R6K origin and the Chloramphenicol resistance marker) upon Flp recombinase activity. This marker excision allows users to make multiple integrations in the same strain, always using the same antibiotic resistance marker.
The engineering of the integration guide allows the integration of parts in user-defined genome positions and for this reason this vector supports the integration by exploiting bacteriophage attP-mediated integration as well as homologous recombination.

The 2018 WPI iGEM Team would like to extend a sincere thanks to all those who contributed to the completion of our project! The team started working in late May of 2018 and continued into October 2018.
Team Members
What follows is a summary of the contributions of each team member.
Bailey Sweet:
In the lab, Bailey worked to purify GFP, IAFGP, and ZeAFP from BL21 strains of E. coli. To prove that the purification was effective, she ran concentration assays as well as SDS page gels as a way to verify the size of the proteins that were purified. Bailey then ran two different crystal violet biofilm assays using the purified protein to determine if they reduce biofilm formation on well plates. On the iGEM team, Bailey was in charge of running the iGEM social media accounts. Instagram and Facebook were used to promote our work, art, and the introduction of the iGEM team to the general public.
Kylie Sumner:
In the lab, Kylie performed E. coli transformations, did Gibson assembly cloning, made competent E. coli of various strains, ran more DNA and protein gels than any person should ever have to, and tested the effect of different antifreeze proteins on the formation of biofilm growth. Kylie was also the Collaborations Chair for the team this year.
Arth Sharma:
In the lab, Arth tested the antimicrobial properties of curcumin (the active ingredient of turmeric) in biofilm assays. With subcloning and protein extraction experiments, he aided in preparing cultures, and measuring sample concentrations. Serving as Outreach and Engagement Chair, he aided the organization and documenting of public demonstrations and workshops in our lab.
Alex Rebello:
In the lab, Alex was involved in transforming E. coli strains with different plasmids, including the various antifreeze proteins tested in this project. He performed Gibson assembly cloning and made EMG competent cells. Alex ran agarose gel electrophoresis to visualize DNA fragments from the samples. Alex also helped with the testing of the gene gun using lettuce and GFP. Alex served as the Integrative Practices Chair for the project and was responsible"

Integrating Our Microfluidics Knowledge
As our work on MARS progressed, many of the interactions we engaged in over the Summer had a direct impact on the project. Specific areas that were developed and modified as a result of our synthetic biologist and industry interactions are influencing the structure and content of our MARS chip archive, increasing accessibility to researchers through Microfluidics 101, and building the fluid functionality checklist. Through integrating the feedback, comments and advice received from various sources, we were able to significantly improve and refine MARS as a whole.
Biological Design Center and iGEM Outreach
In order to determine what would make microfluidics more practical and accessible for synthetic biologists we reached out to the Biological Design Center at Boston University. The BDC promotes collaboration between scientists in order to create new biological innovations. We asked the BDC researchers what types of biological protocols are performed day-to-day in the lab. Based on their feedback we were able to identify eight common protocols performed by synthetic biologists:
Cell Lysis
DNA Digestion
Ligation
Transformation
PCR
Fluorescence Testing
Antibiotic Resistance Testing
Cell Culturing
These eight common protocols informed both the layout of our MARS Repository into Isolation, Modification, and Quantification, as well as the chips within it. Of our nine MARS chips, eight were designed to each perform one of these synbio protocols.
We also reached out to the iGEM community via a poll. The purpose of this poll was to gauge how much the iGEM community knows about microfluidics, what procedures they perform every day in the lab, and what would get them interested in microfluidics. In total, we received 42 responses from teams all across the world. The results from this poll are summarized below.
These results validated our educational components of MARS. The introduction to microfluidics and video tutorials serve to educate the iGEM and greater synbio community about what microfluidics are and how to use them. Furthermore, this poll validated our choice of nine synthetic biology protocols to move onto microfluidic devices housed in the MARS archive.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"     atomic part and which are not functional on their own but can be functional,     should be classified as “composite parts”.
For Reporters:
PartID: BBa_J04451
PartName: RFP Coding Device with an LVA tag
This functional part is classified as “Reporter” in the parts registry     database. It is very clear that this part fits the same description     as Protein Generator in Biobrick part registry standards. Although,     this part has specific and known functional role, characterizing this     part as a reporter is unnecessary and contributes to the level of complexity     of information provided. Instead, we suggest that this part should be     classified as “protein generator” and related detailed information about     the specific function of this part, should be provided in the part information     page.
In conclusion, as mentioned above we tried to reorganize and normalize     the information about parts which is provided in part registry for 2010     in order to develop our algorithm for the BioGuide application. During     this process, we encountered some inconsistencies and misuses of the     terminology being used and also inadequacies about the information provided     about parts. First of all, we claim that a standard nomenclature should     be constituted for future use in the field of synthetic biology. Based     on the information gathered according to new nomenclature a professional     database should be constructed to address the needs of synthetic biology.     This will enable easy information exchange and exhibition globally.     Secondly, although there are enough information about parts exists on     parts registry database, the information which is provided for parts     need to be ordered urgently. Furthermore, there should be new experimental     standards which must be introduced to groups in the part submission     process for the subtitle “working condition”. These experimental standards     will be important because the experimental details about parts are not     satisfying the needs of wet-lab biologists for the design and the construction     of new Biobricks.
