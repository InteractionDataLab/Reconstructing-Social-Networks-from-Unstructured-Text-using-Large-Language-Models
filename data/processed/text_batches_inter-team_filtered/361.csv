Plan for restriction digest
I believe the only cuts I am going to focus on are the digests that will allow for a part of a circuit to be inserted behind or in front of another part.
I will also have to start organizing a restriction digest notecard that explains the different restriction sites for a biobrick as well as the types of restriction enzymes. I will also most likely walk through one of the way to cut a part so that it is inserted in front of something and then leave the other way up to them
For the quorum sensing display, I spent time placing the movement script into the bacteria and allowing for controlled replication

Bacterial transformation
The parts R0040, B0015, and J13002 were taken out from the 2009 DNA distribution kit, and were transformed into TOP10 cells. These parts are needed for general construction of our circuits.

The Island Terrain
Today, I worked more in Photoshop and Backhoe to develop a terrain for our island we could use. It still needs some work as the drops into the water are very deep, and although they are smooth in Photoshop, Second Life renders them to be very circular around the edges.

Marketing and Newsletter
I began to write up stories on events and conferences from last month to add to our June newsletter. I also helped to pick our sponsor of the month. This month's proud sponsor of the month is BioAlberta! Congratulations!
I also followed up on 8 different companies, 2 of which are considering our project. I'm having difficulties trying to get a hold of some of these staff. I've left voice mails and sent emails with our sponsorship package. I'll continue to follow up throughout the week.

Plasmid isolation of LuxOD47A BBk from the overnight cultures made last night
Purpose: we have lots of competent TOP 10 cells with transformed LuxOD47A BBk on psB1AC3 in overnight plates, restreaks and cultures. The DNA in the overnight culture will be manipulated, but first it needs to be removed from the cells.
Protocol: Plasmid isolation was conducted in accordance with the procedure outlined on the protocol page for Sigma mini-prep kits. The concentrations of the isolated plasmids in ddHOH were measured with the Nanodrop spectrophotometer and placed"
Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#humanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html,". “What are you doing?” asked a woman. We could introduce them to our friends: bacteria! Then, one of the iGEM team members answered: “Bacteria are little organisms which grow, eat and die like every living being. These bacteria are not always pathogenic and scientists can improve their qualities with the introduction of DNA fragments containing genes.”
So the objective is reached: we aroused the surprise, the questioning and the amazement of people. In this respect, we pointed out the usefulness of SynBio. We decided to focus on medical application of BABS (Bacteria Improved by SynBio) such as insulin, growth hormones, and artemisinin production, and also on the food industry application with food coloring or artificial flavor production that already work.
Of course, we have also presented our project as an innovative solution to kill and disperse biofilm in all pipelines or tanks and to prevent any colonization of bacteria.
Special thanks to our faculty advisor O. Brette for his advice and for his working late to help us and to the UBC team for sharing its poll results with ours.

01.  China iGEM Southwest Union                                     (iSWU)
      To encourage the                                     communication and cooperation between iGEMers and accelerate the development of iGEM                                     competition and synthetic biology in southwest China, China iGEM Southwest                                     Union(iSWU) was founded in 2015. In 2017, aimed at closer cooperation in the project                                     design, the China iGEM Southwest Union meet-up was hosted in April by the team                                     “SCU-WestChina” in Huaxi Campus of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan. This year,                                     the union is composed of iGEMers from Sichuan Agricultural University（SiCAU-China）,                                     Sichuan University(SCU-China and SCU-West China), and Third Military Medical                                     University(TMMU-China).

      iSWU meet-up was held in the beginning of project determination this year, which was aimed at enhancing                                     allied communication and cooperation on project design. In the iSWU meet-up, each                                     iGEM team gave a presentation of respective project, and after the presentations                                     there would be a panel session, where audiences could ask questions about the                                     projects which they are interested in. Via these communications, we knew what others                                     had done, what challenges they had met, what we could do to help them, and what they                                     could do to help us.

In the meeting, team “TMMU-China” and we both raised the                                     question – why use Salmonella typhimurium, a kind of pathogenic bacteria, instead of                                     a kind of probiotic bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis or Bacillus subtilis, which                                     may reduce their workload and enhance biosafety.

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Gold test_-_-_TEXT.html," words are easy to understand. As for iGEM wiki and Magazine, more     technical terms appeared and they are more likely to come up with definition or explanation,
Understandability—Alternative language for technical terms
In this section, nearly all technical terms are appeared with an alternative language (mostly English). And the rate is quite high.
Attitude analysis
In this section, we discover that nearly all iGEM teams are written their description and overview in a neutral tone. Newspaper and magazine perform     equally well. It is worth noted that the rate of negative attitude in newspaper is twice the rate in magazine.
Attitude—Law, Policy and Social issue related information
We discover that Newspaper shares the highest negative transfer attitude (10%). When we investigate into the contribution of each field. we found that when     it comes to social issue and the field of economics, the negative rate goes to 31% in social issue and 23% in economics, market and industry. It is the     technology and development that contribute most to positive rate.
Generally speaking, in information sufficiency, we discover that the iGEM wiki perform worse than Newspaper and Magazines. We speculate that iGEM team     tends to organize and rephrase argument so as to convince the audience, it then, however, fail to inform the audience with other information other than the     one the team is focusing on. As for suggestion to Newspaper, we found that more attribution of responsibility can be provided, or the audience will be     informed only the same idea.
As for the information understandability, we discover that newspaper provides little explanation or definition of technical terms. If more definition is     made, it will better the understanding of the audience.
iGEM wiki is tremendously great for the iGEM community, much information is offered and is tremendously beneficial. It can, however, be a pity if those     project is performed, presented, or transferred in a difficult and harsh way. If iGEM team can write their result in wiki in a clearer and more     understandable way with more information. it can definitely lead people who are science layman into the splendid world of biology.

Quantification
A quantification method by spectrophotometry was tested according to ""m13 bacteriophage production for large-scale applications"", but as the phage titer differed more than 103 PFU/ml from plaque assay results the method was considered as unsuitable.
Protein_Interaction
Week 38: PCRs for primer products that could not be produced in the previous week (PCR product IDs 357; 360 - 372) were repeated under altered conditions. Thereby, all the PCRs except PCR products IDs 358, 369 and 373 were performed successfully. As PCR products ID 369 (AP of Split T7RNAP backbone with GenIII) is not absolutely necessary because it can be replaced equivalently by PCR product ID 370 (AP of Split T7RNAP backbone with GenIII and YFP) all needed PCR products for T7 RNAP cloning were present to start GoldenGate assembly.
In contrast PCR products with IDs 358 and 373 are crucial for the dCas9 experiment and could not be produced in any way. Therefore focus moved on cloning T7 RNAP constructs alone rather than trying to manage both, the T7 RNAP and the dCas9 cloning, to work.
Software
PixelCNN
Adapting the pixelCNN from a 2-dimensional problem with three channels to a 1-dimensional one with 20 channels began. The network itself works but the logistic sampling function that generates the sequence in the end and the custom loss function are hard to adapt.
GAIA
The concept of a genetical artificial intelligent algorithm (GAIA)  that is based on the classifier was developed. Starting from a given sequence it maximizes given labels and minimizes other given labels. At the same time the garbage score of the sequence is minimized. The model starts with one sequence but always works with B sequences. Therefore the starting sequence is in silico mutated B times to yield B different sequences. Those are then classified by DeeProtein and the outputs are used to calculate a sequence score. A given number of best sequences is selected and again mutated in silico to yield B sequences. This cycle of mutation and selection repeats and optimizes the starting sequence.
Additionally it is possible to also use recombination after the mutation to combine good subsequences

Objectives:
1. Understand the content and progress of other outstanding teams' projects;
2. Learn the experience of other esteemed teams;
3. Introduce our team's project this year to other teams, and listen to their suggestions for                         project                         design and                         experiment implementation;
4. Seek cooperation and help from other teams.
Process and harvest:
In this conference, nine teams took turns to showcase this year's project.                         Jilin_China's project this year is also related to gene synthesis. Their modeling this year is                         absolutely                         impressive, which interested us to inquir them about their modeling. We also reached an                         agreement                         with                         Jilin                         University to help them complete the mini-interlab project [along with the link to the mini-lab                         page of                         this year's                         Jilin University.
Under the recommendation of Jilin University, we, too, consulted the Peking iGEM 2018 students                         about the modeling,                         and Peking University students shared their materials pertaining to modeling.
We have reached an agreement with TUST_China to help them examine water quality.
The SYSU-China presentation has inspired us to investigate the public's understanding of the                         understanding and                         recognition of artificial life through questionnaires.

Scientists
During the proceedings of our experiments, we contacted variety of scientists to discuss the contents of our project and question its safety. Prof. Dr. Aladin Szalay, founder of genelux corperation is a scientist who spent many years performing researches using the Nissle 1917 bacteria. Initially we gathered some questions on Nissle and e-mailed Prof. Szalay in which he offered to make a skype chat for a more in-depth talk. The one hour long conversation was based on iGEM following with our project in which we informed Prof. Szalay on our project and questioned him on how safe it is to use Nissle as our choice of bacteria. Prof. Szalay kindly answered each of our questions and also explained his current promising researches which enabled us to think on a larger scale and improve our project. We have also been invited for a two week training in his science research centre.
On the other hand, our faculty’s immunology specialist Prof. Dr. Bulent Bozkurt spared some time off his deadly full schedule to listen to our project where he asked questions that forced us to think deeper and seek answers for the unanswered questions; this enabled us to strengthen our weak points.
University
Three sets of presentations were held in our university where iGEM and our project was explained. Our intention was to enable each individual studying in our university to discover the intriguing contents of iGEM and what it feels like to be a member of such a rewarding organisation. In total, approximately 400 people including 1st, 2nd and 3rd year medical students listened to us. Many students then asked the following questions: What is application criteria for iGEM? How can I guarantee a place in next year’s team?
Congress
FATUBAT is a prominent congress which has a record breaking attendant number of 1,500 participants each year. Seeing this as a valuable opportunity, we introduced iGEM to the congress attendants and acquainted them on our previous project. Additionally, two workshops on Synthetic Biology and IGEM were held. Our intention in issuing the workshops was to gather the more interested individuals, divert and persuade them to become a member of the synthetic biology community.

The European Experience
The Evry and Ionis teams organized on the 1st and 2nd of July, a huge meeting that gathered     more than 11 European teams. In different rooms, each team had a space to hang its poster     and set up flyers and communication supports. We explained our project and discussed with     other iGEM members. Some helped us on different aspects like modeling and confinement     of our bacteria. When we were not on our stand, we walked around the rooms and learnt     more about other brilliant projects. We met a lot of nice people from different teams and     we sympathized a lot with every French team.
The organizers arranged two lectures during the weekend. First it dealt with the challenges     and the risks of synthetic biology and the second talked about a new economic world.     Different people, like CEOs of company, trainees, young workers, or research scientists     animated these round tables. One of our best memories was to meet the founder of iGEM: Randy Rettberg. It was an honor for us to speak with this person and to explain our project.
We thank very much the organizing teams for these amazing days in Paris! It was for us an     enjoyable experience of what the Giant Jamboree will be in October.
Meeting with Itzel from TEC Monterrey team
One day, on our Facebook page, we received a message from Itzel Guzman, iGEM TEC     Monterrey team member. She was in Toulouse for a semester and she asked us to meet us,     the iGEM Toulouse team. We discussed a long time on our project over a drink and we     sympathized a lot!     We decided to collaborate together on the protocol videos (view more).

HUMAN PRACTICES
Both Wellesley College and the Tech Museum have a history of addressing issues of gender, class, and education privilege in their work. Thus, BacPack for New Frontiers was designed with the goal to educate members of the community while remaining cognizant of social issues. We identified several key factors that influenced our design and work process and helped us create an installation accessible to the general public. We separate these factors into two categories: those pertaining to social accessibility, such as gender, class, and education; and those pertaining to raising awareness of synthetic biology, such as public perception and engagement.
Social Issues
There is a well known gender gap in the STEM workspace, with women holding less than a quarter of STEM jobs in the US economy*.  The Wellesley_TheTech Team is committed to working towards gender balance in predominantly male areas.  Our mostly-female team of Wellesley College students and three female interns meant that we designed with this in mind and worked on making an inviting exhibit that could be engaging and exciting to anyone regardless of gender.
There is also often disparity in socioeconomic status in users engaging with products, and often technologies and educational devices are not mindful of this in design.  In response, our team was careful to involve students from a variety of socioeconomic status to prototype, including students from Framingham High School and the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound Program, an educational program serving low-income and first generation high school students from the Cambridge area.  In addition, we were sure that all users should be able to approach and engage with our exhibit regardless of prior scientific knowledge.  As part of this process,  we were careful to label resources in our exhibit such as the flasks or petri dishes that not all users may have interacted with before.
One major goal for BacPack is that it would provide an accessible platform for education and introducing synthetic biology concepts to people of various backgrounds. As it is a museum exhibit, it provides an opportunity for informal education that is more flexible and approachable than a structured academic course, for example. Therefore, more people have access to the project, and there is no requirement for any pre-existing knowledge and education for interacting with and enjoying BacPack.
Looking at public engagement is important because it is the"

Modeling
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

SDSZ-China,2017,Team:SDSZ-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,": I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.
Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate                         your help.
A: No problem! Have a good day.
Q: You too.
Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

Biological Sciences
I have just completed the third year of my BSc. degree.  My favorite classes so far have been in the fields of Biochemistry and Genetics.  I am most interested in human development and embryogenesis and hope to learn more about these topics in my fourth year.  My ultimate goal is to have a career in the medical industry as both a physician and as a researcher.  When I'm not busy with school or work my usual activities are pretty standard.  I like to hang out with friends and family and I crave the outdoors.  This is my first year with iGEM and I'm really excited to learn more about Synthetic Biology.

Molecular Genetics
I am in my second year at the University of Alberta.  After taking a year of engineering, I decided to transfer to molecular genetics in order to fulfill my childhood desire of creating an army of giant bat-rabbits.  I plan on going on through to graduate school to earn a PhD in order to reach my goals.  In my spare time I like to run around, ride my bike, play music, cook delicious food, and pretty much all the other fun things kids are doing these days.  In my first year I helped to build a car with the U of A's Formula SAE fabrication team.  I had a good time building stuff out of metal, and this year I know that I'm going to have a blast building (or at least attempting to build) a novel organism out of DNA parts.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#safety-b_-_-_TEXT.html," be most likely to succeed if we used the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, because it is very good at making the type VI pili we wanted. But, that is unfortunately due to its pathogenicity since the pili are an important part of this, as they are used for the bacteria to stay put and not get washed away. So using P. aeruginosa was immediately out of the question because the risk of personal health (fx. getting a cystitis infection) for the researchers was too high, since they are students and not yet fully educated scientists. Also it would be a potential danger for the surrounding community if it spread. So instead we started to investigate the possibilities of using E. coli, but then found that Pseudomonas putida was a non-pathogenic bacteria with close resemblance to P. aeruginosa, and also with resemblance to E. coli. So we started working with P. putida. Eventually though, we had to discard this project idea on a safety basis: We had serious doubts that we could succeed with P. putida, given that we basically didn’t believe the bacteria would function with all the genes we needed to provide it with (pili are virulence factors, and working with a non-pathogenic bacteria it would be less likely to make enough pili / keep its pili).
Then our thought was to use E. coli and provide it with pili, but this started a long discussion about whether this would make the E. coli potentially pathogenic. The end of the discussion was to give our project a big make-over, keeping the concept of wanting to make mechanical work but changing the type of the actual mechanical work to be done.
We finally decided on the Flow-E project, and the safety issues in relation to this project will be presented in the following. These include issues of researchers’ safety, public safety and environmental safety. We will also look at safety in relation to the specific BioBricks we use and make, and will have a chapter on what the safety-staff at our university think of this project. Now, let us start at the lab.
Risk-assessment for individual parts
Here we consider the safety of each of our parts.
Method
We have used our risk-assessment guidelines to describe the safety of each of our contributed parts. The genes were BLASTed to find their function and known homologs. This function was then reasearched (mainly via PubMed ), described and considered according to the questions asked in the risk-assessment paper.

Erythropoiesis: The Production of Red Blood Cells
With the doping DNA degradation and doping EPO formation determined, the effect of EPO on erythropoiesis, the process which produces red blood cells, is determined. We developed a model using an anemia EPO treatment model by Fuertinger et al. 2012 as reference.
Red blood cells begin as stem cells and progress into different cell stages as they age. As progenitor and precursor cells age, they proliferate or undergo apoptosis at a rate dependent on the cell stage they are in. The resulting growth or decay rates may either be constant or dependent on the concentration of EPO in the blood. Burst-Forming Unit-Erythroid (BFU-E) cells have a very small number of EPO receptors. EPO concentration has no effect on BFU-E proliferation, their proliferation is assumed to be constant. After leaving the stem cell stage, cells stay in the BFU-E stage for 7 days, after which they enter the Colony-Forming Unit-Erythroid (CFU-E) stage. In this stage, the cells divide at a higher rate than in the BFU-E cell stage. The CFU-E cells have a large number of EPO receptors and are strongly dependent on EPO for their survival. Their rate of apoptosis is inversely related to the concentration of EPO. Under normal conditions within the human body, a large portion of CFU-E generated do not survive. As the concentration of EPO in the blood increases, the number of cells which survive increases.
After spending 6 days as CFU-E cells, the cells enter the erythroblasts stage. Here, the number of EPO receptors decline. During this stage, there is no evidence that additional divisions occur when production of EPO increases. For this reason we assume that the proliferation of erythroblasts is constant ( Lichtman et al. 2005 ).
The cells stay in the erythroblasts stage for 5 days until they stop dividing, extrude their nuclei and mitochondria, and become marrow reticulocytes. Marrow reticulocytes no longer proliferate and their mortality rate is inversely dependent on iron concentration in the plasma. Since we assume that athletes have a sufficient iron supply, a constant apoptosis rate for marrow reticulocytes is assumed. The time cells stay in the reticulocytes stage is between 0.75 and 3 days. An increase in EPO concentration shortens the marrow transit time of reticulocytes.

Why are PCBs persistent in the environment?
PCBs are chlorinated derivative of biphenyls which are distinguished by the number and the position of chlorines. Because of those substituted chlorines, the degradation of PCBs releases Cl- which is toxic for almost all organisms. Organisms should be capable to deal with these Cl- ion during degrading PCBs. However, some microbes are able to decompose PCBs by two series of processes: replacement of chlorine by hydrogen known as reductive dechlorination; then use these biphenyl or as a carbon source. But in a nature system, the degradation of PCBs needs a microbial community to eliminate all PCBs, these processes are extremely slow. So in our project, we try to combine these 2 processes in one cell of bacterial.
www.sci-spot.com/images/LIQI/pcbwool.jpg
There are up to 209 individual chlorinated compounds in total. They are chemically fairly inert, being extremely resistant to oxidation, reduction, addition, elimination, and electrophilic substitution reactions except under extreme conditions. According to a guideline of U.S EPA, the incineration for eliminating PCBs demands a temperature over 1200 degree Celsius in order to destroy totally PCBs and prevent some by-product such like dioxin.
PCBs are either oily liquids or solids that are colorless to light yellow, have low solubility in water but highly soluble in organic solvents. This high lipophilicity causes PCBs to stay in animal fats and accumulate in food chain.
Where can PCBs be found today?
Chemically speaking PCBs are extremely stable with very high thermal conductivity, high boiling point (278-415 °C) and high flash points (170 to 380 °C). They were widely used in electrical equipment such as transformers and capacitors before the ban of PCBs. Nowadays, most of contaminated products and materials are sealed in special places like other dangerous chemicals. But the risk of release or exposure of PCBs always exists.
Although PCBs are no longer produced in France, but are still found in the environment. In water of Seine, PCBs are present in substantial quantities in sediments due to the high molecular"

Overview
As an iGEM team, we indeed gain an insight into synthetic biology, but for most ordinary people, any new way to break the laws of nature can’t be accepted easily.
Except for the design and experiments of project, we also have responsibility for promoting synthetic biology around people and solving the problems about biology safety
Start from the every drop, use our ability to affect the new generation, let them know the synthetic biology and related fields, view the problem with scientific vision. take this as a starting point, we hold the science summer camp in college, pass knowledge around Qingdao high school students, leading the students to swim in the sea of synthetic biology.
Exchanging ideas and communication are essential. We keep in touch with Peking University and Beijing Normal University, and we give a hand to Peking University. In order to make further improvement on the quality, we visit Qingdao Institute of Biomass Energy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, taking a series of exchanging activities.
To link theory with practice, solve the applications of biology completely, we turn our attention to fish, and a specific survey scheme is made to perfect our project.
Communication
Qingdao Institute of Biomass Energy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
Our project not only need the experiments, but also the digital simulation. To solve the problems, our team visit Qingdao Institute of Biomass Energy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Institute is devoted to providing a systematic and sustainable solution to the nation’s bioenergy development by integrating science, technology, and engineering in the fields of industrial biology, green chemical technology, and process engineering. So we had a communication with Dr. Huang who is good at digital simulation and applied biology, during the meeting, Dr. Huang made a professional lecture introducing the way we might use in the project, he stressed on the combination of simulation and practice in the lab. What we need most is how to solve the mathematical modeling in project result analysis. We exchanged the idea and"

Day 10 (09/07/14): 
This   morning we discovered that due to an error in carrying out the   transformation efficiency yesterday, cells had not grown on the plates.  
We also began designing primers for the sequences that we have chosen, and discussed using Gibson assembly as opposed to using the Biobrick method and what promoters to use.  
 
Day 11 (10/07/14): 
Today we narrowed down what sequences   we wanted to insert into plasmids to germacrene-b synthase, patchoulol   synthase, R-linalool synthase and zingiberne synthase. We started to   look at removing restriction sites from these sequences and optimizing   the sequences for expression in E.coli.  
Matt and Claire also carried out again the transformation efficiency kit as it had not worked yesterday.  
 
Day 12 (11/07/14): 
This morning we found again that the transformation efficiency had not worked as no colonies had grown on the plates.  
Ellie completed the optimization of the sequences with removal of restriction sites, and addition of prefixes and suffixes.
Week 4
Day 13 (14/07/14): 
Today   we repeated the transformation efficiency protocol again with cells   that we knew were definitely competent, to see if the problem was with   the cells we were using or with our carrying out of the protocol. These   were left to incubate overnight at 37°C.  
We   also carried on working on our sequences, and started looking into how   much it will cost to order our sequence. As our sequences are quite long   we looked into whether it will be cheaper to order the sequences in   parts or as one long sequence.  
As   a group we discussed ideas for the wiki, and Taylor and Alex carried on   working on this. Claire designed a poster for Alex and Ellie to take to   Sheffield on Friday.  
 
Day 14 (15/07/14): 
When we took the transformation efficiency plates out of the freezer this morning we found that once   again we had no colonies. We discussed reasons for this, and prepared   an agarose gel to check that the plasmid was present in the DNA samples   we are using.

Model
To make an effective simulation program we regarded the cell's movement as a diffusion. Therefore we applied the fick's second law of diffusion in modeling the cells movement along with the diffusion of autoinducers. Since the law of diffusion is a differential equation(strictly speaking a partial differential equation) the need for a numerical solution was inevitable. We used the finite difference method. We then applied it and converted it which gave us the equation (1) and (2), each representing the diffusion of the cell(or colony) and the autoinducer. These two equations were the bases of our program.
...(1)
...(2)
Finite difference method-Expicit method
As mentioned above we used the finite difference method (and also the explicit method). Finite difference methods are widely used numerical methods in solving differential equations, by considering the differential equations as a finite difference equations. We also used the explicit method which calculates the future state of a system by using the current state of the system.
Fick's second law of diffusion can be written as
・・・(3)
where C[normalized amount/μm3] is the concentration, t[s] is the time, x[μm] is the position, and D is the diffusion coefficient in dimensions of [μm2/ｓ].(Normalized amount is an amount of cell divided by maximum.)
If we apply the finite difference method to the above equation, fick's second law of diffusion can be expressed in a finite difference equation written as
・・・(4)
where the concentration[C] of a substance at a time[t], and at a position [i,j] is represented as Cti,j.
In this experiment, for convenience we let Δt=h and Δx=1 but for a more accurate result Δt and Δx can be adjusted.
By applying the explicit method to the above equation again we reach the following equation.
・・・(5)
Since the concentration of the substance can not be lower than zero, every term of the equation must be over zero. So we reach the following condition.

Data Analysis Report of
Past Human Practice Projects
Synthetic biology is a newly emerging field that has not yet been sufficiently known to the general public. Therefore, over the course of years, numerous iGEM teams have put in tremendous efforts in human practice projects to promote synthetic biology in the society. This report aims to take the human practice projects of over 700 teams in the years 2008 to 2013, thus to spotlight the change in possible trends and correlations in human practice, in terms of types of projects done, and the regions in which they are distributed. Hopefully, this report can help form an insight into how human practice has been used to as a tool to introduce synthetic biology to the society. Read on to have a look at the report, or download the complete PDF version here .
Introduction
As the iGEM headquarters put effort to bring the topic of synthetic biology close to the society, more and more attention was given to human practice. In year 2008 to 2013, there was a total of 707 teams who joined the iGEM jamboree and received medals, and a total of 1387 human practice projects were conducted.
But how well exactly has human practice developed over the years? How much attribution was made in each region? Are some types more commonly done than others? To answer these questions, HKUST iGEM 2014 team gathered all the information since the year 2008, hoping to see some correlation between regions and types of projects done, and some possible trends over the years. To facilitate better understanding, the analysis is divided into five sections, based on the criteria concerned.

The imprecision is largely caused by Local minimum and initial value dependence. Similar as above, these are also open problems. For we adopt Monte Carlo sampling in our algorithm, the results may vary time to time due to the randomness nature. It also remains a problem for us to solve in the future. We will make effort to modify existing algorithms or even create new one.
Output
Q1:
Is it better to export a graph following SBGN standard?
A1:
Currently, we are working on it. The basic drag-drop function has been accomplished in our software of current version. In the near future, we will complete this function.
It is much convenient for users to locate and combine substances/biobricks with this easy-drag interface.
Output of time course plot.
Q2:
Can you export the robustness analysis along with the SBML model in one sheet?
A2:
It is not easy to implement such information in a single SBML file. In current version, we can realize a robustness analysis by importing a SBML file which two sheets will be generated. In next version, we will try to incorporate such information to a general form. With such change, there is also a need to modify libSBML as a result.
Database
Q1:
Does the database contain too little biobricks?
A1:
Since the concept of standard components that contain enough information is relatively new in synthetic biology. The acquisition to the information is rather difficult for us because we have to learn each bricks in detail. In the current version, we construct one that is suitable for our illustrative examples as well as our USTC wet team’s new submitted biobricks. A relatively “full” database needs collaborations of different teams who should submit information of the same format. Otherwise, we propose a developing standard for such a design.
Q2:
Is the search algorithm fast enough for the database?
A2:
For lager database, searching algorithm is quite important. It is also an open problem in computer science. To our extent, we seek collaborations inside or outside our campus.
Q3:
How do you manage these data efficiently?
A3:
To manage a large database, manage software is needed. Luckily, Berkeley tools team are focusing on this problem. We are expecting cooperation with them.
Q4:
Is it too difficult to obtain the kinetic parameters and reaction type?
A4:
Firstly, in the next version, we will make a web server that makes our database open access. Then users can freely update the database by submitting the data in a general form.
Secondly, we can also apply a"

As shown in Figure 19, all strains had similar growth rates in CS-Glc minimal medium. Thus, the expression of the mOrange gene and the absence of the glyphosate transporters GltT and GltP does not affect the fitness of the strains!
To detect glyphosate by intraspecies competition, we mixed the wild type strain synthesizing the GFP protein with the ΔgltT ΔgltP double mutant synthesizing the mOrange fluorescence protein in a 1:1 ratio. As shown in Figure 20, the amount of wild type cells decreased in the co-culture with increasing glyphosate concentrations. By contrast, the amount of cells of the strain carrying the mOrange gene increased with increasing glyphosate concentrations since the ΔgltT ΔgltP mutant tolerates the herbicide glyphosate. Thus, the intraspecies competition assay, which is based on fluorescently labelled B. subtilis strains seems to be suitable to detect glyphosate!
Figure 20. Green and orange cells represent the wild type strain (gfp) and  the double transporter mutant (ΔgltT ΔgltP mOrange), respectively. The ratio indicates the relative amount of orange cells in comparison to green cells. (A) Merged orange and green channels from culture with 0 mM glyphosate after 4 h of cultivation. There are nearly equal amounts of green and orange cells. (B) Merged channels orange and green from culture with 2 mM glyphosate after 4 h of cultivation. The number of orange cells is 4.21-fold higher. (C) Merged orange and green channels from culture with 3.5 mM glyphosate after 4 h of cultivation. Nearly no green cells were visible. (D) Calculated ratio between the number of orange and green cells with increasing glyphosate concentrations.
To perform a competition assay in a greater scale, we used a platereader for our growth experiments. This device enabled us to measure different fluorophores and the optical density simultaneously. Strains were cultivated in CS-glucose (CS-Glu) medium to an OD600 of 1–1.5.

ATOMS-Turkiye,2015,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Project#Ulcer_-_-_TEXT.html,"xuan Zhou and Baolin Sun).
In quorum sensing (QS) process, bacteria regulate gene expression by utilizing small signaling molecules called autoinducers in response to a variety of environmental cues. QS molecules secreted by bacteria are small, diffusible signaling molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the external environment. When the concentration of the autoinducers reaches a threshold, an alteration of gene expression is induced, allowing the bacteria to adopt behaviors that are only productive when the bacteria are working together as a group [8].
Many quorum sensing molecules have been identified until now. In contrast to other autoinducers that are specific for a narrow range of organisms, the widely conserved AI-2 has been hypothesized to be a universal language for interspecies communication [9]. In every case, AI-2 is synthesized by LuxS, which functions in the pathway for metabolism of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a major cellular methyl donor. In a metabolic pathway known as the activated methyl cycle, SAM is metabolized to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is subsequently converted to adenine, homocysteine, and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD, the precursor of AI-2) by the sequential action of the enzymes Pfs and LuxS [10].
The regulatory network for AI-2 uptake is comprised of two other important components, lsrR and lsrK, which are located adjacent, but divergently transcribed from the lsr operon (Figure 1). LsrR is the repressor of the lsr operon and itself. LsrK is a kinase responsible for converting AI-2 to phospho-AI-2, which is required for relieving LsrR repression. It has also been postulated that phospho- AI-2 binds to LsrR and inactivates it to derepress the transcription of lsr [11].Since LsrR contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain, it was hypothesized that LsrR represses the expression of lsr operon and itself by binding to their promoter regions [12].
Two independent groups demonstrated that H. pylori secretes AI-2 into its extracellular environment by a luxS-dependent mechanism.[13,14] Therefore we planned to use LsrR system to sense AI-2 molecules synthesized by H. Pylori.
In the absence of Autoinducer-2, LsrR repress the LsrR"

After we successfully built this biobrick, we transferred the vectors into E.coli BW25113 to express Bace16 protein. SDS-PAGE was done to testify the expression of Bace 16 protein. The expression of Bace16 was induced by L-Arabinose at the concentrations ranging from 8\(\mu\)M-12\(\mu\)M, culturing was at 26℃ in shaking incubator for over 5h. As the literature indicated [1] , Bace16 is an extracellular secretion protein, so we gathered the supernatant to test the exist of it. According to the SDS-PAGE figure, we failed to expressed Bace16 in E.coli BW25113(Fig.8, 9)

Discussion
The molecular mass of Bace16 mature protein is 28kDa, but the SDS-PAGE analysis did not show the 28kDa band. There are mainly two reasons for this result.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," to detect entero-haemorrhagic bacteria in feces of BBa_K782004 in cattle populations. As sensors, TALEs can bind to specific regions of the Shiga toxin II gene (stx2) and capture the DNA of interest from a feces sample, making it available for a second TALE, whose binding domain is specific for another region of stx2. This second TALE is connected to a reporter, which makes the TALE-DNA interaction visible within a short period of time.
Engineered TALEs
Figure 2.This alignment shows one of the 19bp target sequences we picked in the EHEC Shiga toxin II gene. Notice how it starts with a T and is pyrimidine rich. This is the target sequence for the TALE BBa_K1189033
To design the TALEs that bind to EHEC we had to take a few things into consideration. Firstly, we had to carefully identify regions that would both be optimal for TALE binding and be specific to EHEC species. After thorough literature search we determined that Shiga Toxin, stx2 is a gene found in all EHEC organisms. Additionally, we insured that the TALE binding sequences were not found in organisms surrounding the cattle such as grass consumed by the cattle, the cow’s DNA, or another commensal microorganism in the cow gut. The stx2 gene produces shiga toxin that causes illness in humans. Shiga toxin is an AB5 toxin with 5 B subunits that bind to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and then the A subunit is internalized by the host cell and cleaves ribosomal RNA. Cattle do not have the Gb3 as a surface marker and therefore carry EHEC asymptomatically. Since TALEs do not have 100% specificity we designed a two TALE system to increase the specificity and reduce the false negatives. We designed two TALEs that bind to two different regions on the stx2 gene.
In addition to maximizing specificity, we also tried to design both TALEs to have the highest possible binding affinity. Since our final system will be a strip that will be dipped into several solutions we require the TALEs to bind strongly to the DNA to keep it in place on our strip. Thus, if our TALEs do not bind strongly to the DNA, the system would produce false negatives. To increase the binding affinity of the TALEs, we picked the pyrimidine-rich regions of the stx2 gene.

Introduction
The human outreach activities of this year’s iGEM team from Wageningen UR included different events that have basically one connection. We want to improve the communication between scientists and the public. To do so we started off with a workshop from Paulien Poelarends, who wrote her Msc. thesis about the iGEM teams of 2011 and 2012. What she did was, that she observed them during outreach activities, recorded them and interpreted their way of communication. And what she learned from this was the topic of a masterclass she gave to us. After this masterclass we wanted to get some hands on the topic and decided that a science café would be the right location as it is a quite casual environment.
The science café
On September, 16th café Loburg was the place to be. It was again time for a science café Wageningen evening and this edition was organized by the iGEM team Wageningen with some tips and advices from the science café team. This edition was about “synthetic biology, towards the creation of life?” and we invited two speakers and a side-kick. The speakers were Prof dr. Arnold Driessen (University of Groningen) and dr. Dirk Stemerding (Rathenau institute) and as the side-kick Pieter van Boheemen, who is a DIY biohacker, was invited. This edition of the science café is part of the human outreach of our iGEM team and the goal was to communicate synthetic biology with the general public. To prepare for the science cafe and increase our communication skills a workshop of Paulien Poelarends was followed in advance. She wrote her Msc thesis about last year’s iGEM team and"

Background
The blood that we are using for our experiments in our wet lab was donated by a local butcher shop called The Mad Butcher and it was stored in 1 litre containers. Different amounts of the anticoagulant heparin were added to the containers. We added heparin because we didn’t want the blood to coagulate in the containers before we started to use it in experiments. We chose specifically to use heparin over other anti-coagulants because heparin combines with antithrombin-III which binds to thrombin to prevent thrombins action in the blood clotting cascade.
First Blood Experiment
For our first experiment with the blood, we added 10 mL of blood into 5 standard petri dishes. Two of the petri dishes acted as our negative controls, where there was nothing added to the blood. The results that we expected to see, was little to no clotting after 24 hours. We added 1.0 mL of our viper construct cells into our third dish, 1.5 mL to our fourth dish and then 2.0 mL to our fifth dish. We timed these dishes over the time span of 24 hours to see how much of the blood coagulated. The reason for this lab was to see how quickly the blood would clot naturally (without the addition of our construct) and the effect that our construct had on the blood (meaning, if it speed up the clotting time). The results of this experiment were that the petri dish that contained the 2.0 mL of our viper construct cells produced the largest clot followed by the dish that had 1.5 mL of our construct and then by the one that contained 1.0 mL of our construct. The controls of this experiment had very little of the blood clotted when 24 hours had passed. Because of these results we can infer that our viper construct cells do have a positive effect"

Safety Report and Guidelines
Safety in the scientific environment is an important issue. To begin with, organisms subject to research as well as substances and chemicals used may be hazardous. Since synthetic biology uses modified organisms it is also important to consider possible effects on ecosystems. But safety is not limited to organisms and chemicals. Stress and fatigue of the researchers involved must also be taken into account when designing experiments. To address these issues we reviewed available safety protocols and regulations  and wrote new protocols to fit our needs.
At the beginning of the project, Dr. Gunaratna Kuttuva Rajarao gave instructions on lab safety basics and sterile techniques. In general, we followed the safety guidelines of KTH, Royal Institute of Technology for this project.
Throughout this project, we used E.coli (TOP10, BW25113) which falls under biosafety level 1. Moreover, Chromobacterium violaceum was used as a readout strain in an experiment that falls under biosafety level 2. We performed this experiment in one of our supervisor’s lab which is suitable for biosafety level 2. It has been made sure that our lab has all the precautionary systems to carry out necessary experiments. Workstations were assigned to sub-teams as well as for different common procedures (PCR station, electrophoresis station, station for running gel). Toxic chemicals were kept in the fume hood to prevent or reduce exposure. Contaminated and non-contaminated waste were separated and sorted as plastic, glass or metal. Contaminated waste, both solid and liquid, was autoclaved to prevent contamination and then disposed of at the university facilities. Cleaning responsibilities rotated weekly and persons in charge of knowing regulations throughout the project were designated. Protocols were written for use of lab facilities, rules and responsibilities of each member of the lab and the medical procedures in case of need.
It was important to keep stress and fatigue at a minimum. To do this, general working hours were drawn up and each team member got a scheduled vacation. Good communication between team members and supervisors was important to make this work.
Another occasion where safety was discussed was the Nordic conference, arranged by Stockholm and Uppsala iGEM teams. Eight teams attended the conference. Safety issues were discussed in workshop sessions on ethics and the future of"

INTRODUCTION
It is the second year in a row that our team together with Paris_Bettencourt publishes Newsletter for iGEM Competition. With the addition of Pasteur_Paris, there have been several changes and updates. Last year, Newsletter was mainly composed of Team Introduction and Project Update apart from the special issue-interview with SYSU. However this year, not only do we offer a communication platform among teams, we also turn to long-term relationship between teams and relevant figures in the form of interviews, surveys, argues and so on. Teams all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. We excavate the quintessence of past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further. There are seven issues this year, among which are three special issues.
5.15
Issue 1
The first issue-the first special issue at the same time, which was released on May 17th, is about how to set up and operate an iGEM team. Many teams were at the beginning of the establishment at that time, so we drew our inspiration from that. We really appreciate the contributions from Professor Wayne Materi and eleven experienced teams. Though each situation differs, there is still some important reference value to both old and new teams.
5.31
Issue 2
The publication of the second issue contains two parts: Project Introduction and Ethical Discussions. Eight teams showed their projects and sixteen teams expressed their opinions on a controversial research in April based on ethics. The researchers, headed by gene-function researcher Huang Junjiu at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University, modified in human embryos a gene responsible for beta thalassaemia, a blood disorder that can be fatal.

Team Bordeaux , having used synthetic biology to make curdlan for the purposes of protecting vinyards against Downy Mildew, wished to test how their curdlan would impact the environmental bacterial ecosystem when administered. As we had access to Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Pseudomonas putida, both bacterial species that can be found in the environment, we assisted Team Bordeaux in conducting toxicity assays against said bacteria using curdlan samples which they sent to us.
The work for this collaboration was conducted by our resident lab guru Leon, and his data and report can be found here.

Integrated HP & Gold An excellent project is inseparable from careful and creative thinking about whether your work is responsible and good for the world. To achieve this goal, we actively engaged with stakeholders and professionals to get the best out of our project. We integrated the extensive feedback we received into the design and evolution of our project. This page describes how the investigation of our HP issues has been integrated into the purpose, design, and execution of our project in details. It consists of two parts, Functions Integration and Project Assessment.
Fig.10. Overview of Integrated HP Functions Integration Advancements in metabolic engineering have enabled us to engineer and express enzymes and construct novel pathways for various applications including drug discovery and value-added biochemical production. However, it’s quite a challenge to design and reconstruct a pathway with high yield and productivity in certain organism. So the very initial idea of us is to develop a computational tool for pathway recommendation. However, it is not clear that how to evaluate the pathway, what the general pathway engineering workflow of experimenters and how they think our solution should work. 1.Database integration: Inspirations from Prof. Liu and Peking: Prof. Liu emphasized the comprehensiveness and reliability of data used for pathway searching. He made us aware the importance of data. We obtained data from reliable database online, cleared redundant data afterward and integrated them to our software. “Data is the foundation of your software. Only by ensuring their accuracy can your software work well.” Prof. Liu said. We met Peking on the 5th CCiC meetup. Since they need the kinetic parameters of enzymes used in their pathway to produce β-carotene, it inspired us we can offer comprehensive information of compounds, enzymes, reactions and organisms to users to help them design experiments better.

Safety Questions
Biosafety Handbook
Biosafety handbook is one of most important part of our human practice. Our handbook is based on the iGEM programs, from which we select the teams whose safety parts are beneficial and fruitful. And we also made reference to some related papers.
Biosafety should be the primary concern in the laboratory
At last, we summarized and wrote this biosafety handbook. We hope our handbook can help people with the work of gene pollution prevention. And we believe our biosafety handbook will provide reference to other iGEM teams in the future.
Genetic pollution refers to the unintended or uncontrolled gene flow of native species gene pool. In 21th century, the recombinant organisms begin to spread into the environment extensively. Admittedly, scientists and international groups have already started to seriously consider the safety of transgenosis, but there are still a lot of limitations and a lack of long-term data. Although genetic engineering can bring huge benefits to us, but the potential threats it cause can never be ignored. Like DDT, which won a Nobel Prize in the year when it was created, but caused great injury to both human beings and the environment after 50 years. We can't stop this kind of things totally, but at least we can make efforts to prevent it. Considering the specialty of our program, it can be creatively used in the career of the gene pollution prevention, we will show the possibilities and examples in the third part.  We divided our handbook into three parts:
Operation
Laboratory Practices Followed By Our Team
1. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Feet and legs should be covered; sandals and open-toed shoes should not be worn in laboratories. Wear appropriate gloves while handling infectious or toxic materials and animals. Do not wear lab coats, gloves or other personal protective equipment outside the laboratory. Change gloves when contaminated, and dispose of used gloves with other contaminated laboratory waste.

2. Do not eat, drink, smoke, handle contact lenses, apply cosmetics, or store food for human consumption in the laboratory.
3. Wash your hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and"
TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,", it is possible to have a buyer-supplier relationship. It is, for example,  also possible to have a licensor/licensee relation. Then our company gives permission to an external party to manufacturer the MLAs by themselves. This could be a solar panel manufacturer, but also a manufacturer of traditional MLAs that is willing to change its production method to a more environmental friendly method.
Cost Structure
The most important expenses of our company are probably manufacturing costs. After all, the production of the MLAs will be a substantial part of the total costs. These expenses consist of among other things costs for raw materials, depreciation costs, etc. Furthermore, especially in the beginning, R&D costs will be relatively large. It is expected that the distribution costs also will be significant since it is important to transport the fragile MLAs carefully. Since the company is a Business to Business company, the costs of marketing are expected to be relatively small. When our company beside a manufacturer also becomes a licensor, the so called legal costs will be significant as well.
Revenue Streams
Our primary route to market could be direct selling. The direct sales business model means that we will directly sell our product to the manufacturers of solar panels. Another interesting business model is the so called subscription model that aims to secure the customer on a long term contract, so that they are consuming our product well into the future. This model is especially interesting when we have one or a very limited number of customers. It will guarantee revenues for a long period of time and at the same time it could guarantee them to have a unique selling point for a long period of time.
When we become a licensor, we can have different types of leasing revenues as well. For example, it is possible to agree with the customer that they will pay a fixed amount of money per time period. It is also possible that they will pay a price per produced MLA or per sold solar panel.
Finally, we could apply for grants. For example, many governments support environmentally friendly energy projects.
Solar panel manufacturers
To develop a successful product, it is important to know what the needs of your customers are. Therefore, we have interviewed 4 solar panel manufacturers, respectively three German companies and one Dutch company. To do this, we have developed a standardized questionnaire, that you can find here .
The main key points of the potential customer analysis are:
Micro lens arrays are new and revolutionary in the solar panel industry. Most manufacturers have never heard from them.
Final customers are probably not willing to pay a higher price for environmental produced solar panels.
The manufactures do not have the knowledge and the production facilities to produce the"

The oven temperature was 75°C held for 6 min and then increased to 110°C at 25°C min−1 and held at 100°C for 3.5 min. Results were analyzed with Perkin-Elmer Turbochrom Navigator software.  MeS (Sigma-Aldrich, M 6752) was used as a standard and was detected at 12.832 minutes post injection (A). Cultures of E. coli BL21 and BL21 harbouring BBa_K1060003 with or without 0.1 mM salicylic acid (SA) supplemented to the medium were also analyzed. No MeS could be detected with the FID in the samples when no SA was added (B), while MeS could be detected when SA was supplemented (C).
The results are shown below:
Samples were analyzed with a calibrated Autosystem XL gas chromatograph with a headspace sampler (HS40; Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) and equipped with a CP-Wax 52 CB column. Headspace GC was performed on pure MeS (Sigma-Aldrich) (A), on culture supernatant from a E. coli BL21 strain harbouring BBa_K1060003 without (B) or with 0.1 mM salicylic acid (C). MeS could be detected at 12.832 minutes in (A) and (C) but not when no salicylic acid was added.
GC-MS analysis of MeS in ethyl acetate extracts
To back-up our headspace GC data, we also analyzed our our brick BBa_K1060003 with GC-MS with the help of Dr. Jan Baeten (Centre for Surface Chemistry and Catalysis; Prof. Dirk De Vos). Supernatant of bacterial cultures were extacted 3 times with ethyl acetate. GC-MS analyses were carried out using a 7890A Agilent gas chromatograph coupled to a 5977A mass spectrometric detector. The GC was equiped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm). 1 µl of each sample was injected using splitless injection at a temperature of 250 °C. The initial oven temperature of 40 °C was held for 1 min., ramped at 6 °C / min. to 124 °C, then ramped at 20 °C / min. to 320 °"

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Purified"

UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis_-_-_TEXT.html," from our main project, the cI Lambda problem and the pH sensor project is the realization that our intermediate devices were causing slow growth phenotypes in our cells.  This, and other observations, led us to conclude that we were witnessing the unintended interaction between our device and the host.  This is not only bad, but it is also a critical challenge in general in synthetic biology.  To attempt to remedy this issue in the future, we have designed CPOTATo (Crosstalk Predictive Organism Targeted Analysis Tool), a computational tool that attempts to predict potential cross-talk between a synthetic circuit and its host so that the engineer might know before starting a project what the likelihood of potentially disruptive interactions between the host and the device is.

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Gender Study_-_-_TEXT.html," issues should not apply in synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is a new field. The argument of the heritage of some habits cannot be made. It is a mix of previously existing disciplines and therefore very open and should not reflect preexisting stereotypes. To study gender bias in iGEM and in synthetic biology we decided to follow a data driven approach. Studying in a quantitative manner this subjects had two main benefits. First it prevented us to apply our own biases and stereotypes on this subject. Secondly, it lead us to construct data base that we make freely available and let anyone test his own hypothesis on this controversial subject and form his own conclusions.
Synthetic biology field :  general overview of gender equality in synthetic biology
   Gender repartition in synthetic biology can be looked at from different perspectives. For this study, two main ways were chosen: composition of labs and conferences. The main reasons for those choices were the accessibility of online data
as well as the necessity to get information not only about the general gender balance but also the sex ratio inside a defined category: PhD students, post docs, head of labs...
Synthetic biology labs,  a good representation of gender (in)equality in science
   Teams of 50 synthetic biology labs were studied. The labs were chosen by their presence on the webpage http://syntheticbiology.org/Labs.html . For each lab, several numbers were reported in a table : total number of people in the team, number of women in the team, number of PhD students, post docs, head of labs, number of women PhD students, post docs, head of labs.  From this, the sex ratios  (number of women / total number of people) were then calculated for each of those categories.
The first conclusion that can be made is that women are generally under-represented in synthetic biology labs. 33% correspond to the average presence of women in research in Europe. Indeed according to the European Commission, 32% of researchers in Europe are women (She Figures, 2012).
The second finding also reflects well an already known reality in science : the glass ceiling. In 1995, the glass ceiling was defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, as a ""political term used to describe ""the unseen, yet unbreakable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements"" .  With only 17,85\% of heads of labs being women, synthetic biology is still doing slightly better than the average. According to a European study  done in 2008 called Mapping the maze"

During this time, we were also able to ask the students what opinions or thoughts they had regarding microfluidics and their applications in the wider world. Many students were intrigued by the possibility of automating basic experiments they performed in class as well as applications in medical diagnostics, chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Some students were curious about our manufacturing process and how we were able to prototype and fabricate chips at a fast rate. After hearing our breakdown of the process and the relative prices of our equipment, some girls were excited about the possibility of setting up a chip manufacturing space in their high school. The student’s excitement about our hardware and its various potential applications illustrated to us how our project can go on to impact synthetic biologists in the future.
Industry Connections
While working on MARS we wanted to connect with individuals in industry to understand how they approached microfluidic fabrications and what input they had for us regarding a DIY microfluidics setup. We were also curious to see what potential impacts our work could have on the existing field.
Phenomyx
During the course of the Fall semester the team also had to opportunity to tour Phenomyx, a microfluidics startup located at LabCentral in Boston. The tour was led by Salil Desai, their founder and Chief Technology Officer, who took us through their fabrication and testing space. During the course of the tour we were able to learn from his industry experience in microfluidic devices.
Some key points of the tour were suggestions regarding microfluidic fabrication, for example the extra step of filtering PDMS to minimize dust and other obstructions when setting it. Another interesting topic discussed was utilizing general metrics, instead of protocol specific metrics, when grading a chip using our fluid functionality checklist. This way we can ensure that our system can be applied to chips at large without being specific to individual designs. Besides discussing chip fabrication, we were able to engage in a discussion regarding the potential to use software systems to view and analyze microfluidic functionality remotely. Although this goal is out of reach at present, it provides an exciting new challenge to the next generation of microfluidic researchers.
Aline
Over the summer we were able to connect with the team at Aline, a rapid prototyping and microfluidics engineering firm located in California. Over a conference call we pitched our initial project description and goals to their team, and were able to receive feedback on areas such as metering, primitive design and our repository design. We were also able to learn more about their microfluidics systems, for example their take on volume dispensing"

BioBrick discovery
For iGEM 2016 we designed a high-throughput pipeline for the identification of novel proteins directly from raw genome sequencing data. Given the specificity of our tool and the importance of biobrick discovery in iGEM, we made it publicly available for everyone to modify and use. The tool can be found in this Gitlab repository .
For the purpose of the BeeT project, we use it as a cry toxin predictor, given genomes of selected bacteria.
Toxin Specificity
For this project we need a toxin that specifically targets Varroa destructor. The most well known miticidal proteins are the crystal (Cry) proteins. These are usually found on megaplasmids from Bacillus Thuringiensis and related species. 1
We know Varroa-specific miticidal activity exists in Bacillus thuringiensis and related species,"

Testing the MBR
A process was developed for testing the efficacy of biofilm bacteria to bind to substrates in the flow of water through the metal binding reactor.
Testing the Hydrocyclone
Protocol for testing separation efficiency of the hydrocyclone can be found here .
HPLC protocol
High performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the products of the MBR tests. The MBR run-through had to be prepared however, before entering the machine.
Biosecurity
Despite our first hand observation of the use of ultra-violet radiation as a means of sterilisation in water treament facilities, we wanted to test the effectiveness of this method. We developed a protocol which we used and also sent to the iGEM teams from Cardiff and Newcastle as part of our collaborations with them.
PCR
PCR was used regularly when we needed to amplify DNA, either for diagnostic or functional reasons.
Induction protocol
A number of our constructs contained either the P_Rha or P_Ara promoter or both. These constructs were used in a number of different strains of E. coli over the course of the project. Through experimentation with the conditions of the induction procedure, we determined the protocol most conducive to pili expression. The T7 construct was expressed using an auto-induction media outlined here .

For KillerRed the induced kill switch appears to be more   effective whereas the uninduced switch is more effective in KillerOrange. The leakiness of the T7 promoter has likely  lead to near equal expression in both conditions, possibly exacerbated by the length of time that the cultures were left   to grow in order for the protein to fully mature.
The literature showed that cells had been kept in a cold room at 4   °C for 24 hrs before exposing the samples to light (Sarkisyan et al, 2015), the reason given for this was to ""increase the fraction of mature protein"". We tested the validity of this as cultures were incubated at 37 °C 220 rpm overnight not 4 °C and the phototoxicity of KillerRed and KillerOrange was still evident. The light box itself had a negative effect on E.   coli growth. In our experiment each sample was first diluted to 10-3,10-4 and 10-5 before exposure   to light. The dark condition for the control formed a lawn of bacteria on the agar plate regardless of the starting dilution factor, however in the light condition, the 10-3 dilution produced the same amount of colonies as the dark but in greater dilutions the number of colonies decreased. This decrease was not significant enough to have affected the results but it should be noted that exposure to 1.2 mW/cm2 for 6 hrs slows the growth rate of E. coli BL21 DE3.
The continuous culture of KillerRed showed a 15 fold increase in the percentage of viable cells after 168 hrs. A similar pattern is shown for KillerOrange but with around a two fold increase. Both KillerRed and KillerOrange show greater numbers of colonies forming over time (Fig. 14 & 15). This number approaches the amount produced in the dark condition by 168 hrs. The average fluorescence reading for 0 hr KillerRed samples was 506.3 A.U (recorded at an average OD of of 0.745). After 168  hrs the average fluorescence reading  was 436 A.U (at an average OD of 0.96). It seems unlikely due to the readings being  similar that a mutation has occurred in the kill switch itself. As fluorescence is proportional to the amount of ROS  being produced, up regulation of native E. coli enzymes that mitigate the effects of"

3.1 Summary:  iGEM Berlin 2014 - A remote control for E. coli
As the first iGEM team from Berlin to take part in the competition, we decided to construct a simple BioBrick that enables synthetic biologists to remotely control the movement of the laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli. A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields, which enable a vast variety of applications. In nature, these are already used by several mammals, as well as bacteria for orientation. Remote-controlled E. coli cells could be used as “bacteria-based nanorobots” in order to maneuver them live in the intestine - targeting diseased tissue or even tumors. Combined with BioBricks from other iGEM teams a local, site-directed treatment of intestine cancer is envisioned[1]. Therefore, we work with the probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, which already has an 80 year history as a treatment for chronically inflamed intestine tissue and is sold commonly as “Mutaflor”[2].
Our experiments should enable us to construct simple BioBricks capable to produce a diverse set of nanoparticles, including quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, semiconductor nanoparticles, noble metal nanoparticles and many more[3]. For example, cheap and efficient production of magnetic nanoparticles could be used in hyperthermal cancer therapy. Subsequently, we would like to investigate if our method can also be adapted to the synthesis of rare earth metals, which despite their abundance are not mineable. This would offer an alternative to the environmental hazardous mining operations that are common today.
A remote control for E. coli will enable a whole variety of application relevant for bioprocess engineering. Therefore one can imagine neglecting centrifugation for cell separation - simply use a magnet. Also, it should be possible to use high frequent oscillating magnetic fields for cell lysis or even use rotating magnetic fields for self-stirring cultures in bioreactors solving scale up limiting issues like tip speed.

We explained that we chose harmful substances, according to the WHO, to establish our filter, as we'd like to show the degradation and bioaccumulation of them.  In general he considered our project as basic research and not as practical application. In summary the visit of the UFZ enriched our knowledge in the issue of molecular genetics and gave us an idea how further project thoughts could look like. The guided tour through the laboratories of UFZ showed us execution examples of working phytoremediation concepts.
5) Expert Box: Pieris AG
Figure 11: Expert interview with the Pieris AG
The Pieris AG is a biopharmaceutical company founded in 2001 which is commercializing the anticalin production technology. Anticalins are designed to bind proteins that are a promising alternatives to antibodies. These are mainly used in red biotechnology. They are, for example, used in tumor therapy. As these engineered binding proteins can be directed against nearly every chemical structure, they are also an interesting tool for phytoremediation. Our idea was to apply the successful anticalin technology in a totally different context, namely for the detoxification of aquatic ecosystems. We contacted the Principal Scientist of the Pieris AG and they are confident that a meeting will be possible until the regional Jamboree in Lyon.
6) Expert Box: Prof. Reski (Freiburg University)
Figure 12: Expert interview with Prof. Reski.
When we had chosen phytoremediation as our topic for this year's competition it became clear soon that Physcomitrella patens is a great chassis which could bring iGEM closer to the real world applications we are looking for. For this reason we contacted Prof. Dr. Reski who is a worldwide expert on Physcomitrella patens and especially its biotechnological application. He was very kind and liked our idea from the first moment on. Especially when we told him to introduce his Physco to iGEM. So he offered us help where ever we would need it. In the end we traveled five times to Freiburg (350 km) with different team members to perform the transformations in his lab. Fetching plasmids which are known to be functional in Physcomitrealla patens or just to discuss with him or his co-workers. We could win him as an advisor for our team. That is especially pleasant as iGEM starts bringing together universities and scientific groups from different places and and our iGEM team was"

An Interview about Dermatophytosis in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital
On March 24th, 2017, we interviewed a doctor(a dermatologist of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital) to conduct a survey about ringworm (dermatophytosis).
Firstly,the doctor informed us of the characteristics of dermatophytosis: 1. Ringworm tend to grow in moist and sweaty environment. 2. People with low immunity are more susceptible to ringworm. 3.The main route of transmission is physical contact.
Secondly, the doctor told us about the importance of precaution, People should strengthen their own immune system and improve their living environment. As for treatment, different types of ringworm have different therapies respectively. People usually choose topical agents and oral medicine to treat dermatophytosis. However, present treatments require such a long-term process that most patients can’t adhere to the medication. In addition, drug resistance is now a serious problem. We also obtained the information about public issues. For example, most patients don’t attach importance to ringworm,and most of them discontinue their treatments as soon as the medicine have made certain effect,which may reduce the effectiveness of the medicine.
In the end, the doctor told us that most of the present researches on the therapy of ringworm are the development of medicine for deep infection of ringworm (deep dermatophytosis).
With the professional help of the doctor, we realized that the public awareness of ringworm is unbelievably low and many misunderstandings still exist. Therefore, we were eager to arouse the public awareness of ringworm so that people can get better treatment.

Highlights: 1, Instead of the high cost, high efficiency and poor circulation of traditional methods, we choose a safe and environmentally friendly method with low cost and high catalytic efficiency for trapping CO2 with carbon anhydride. 2,By using the molecular simulation technique, the amino acid as the basic unit, the effect of remnant radical mutation on the two-stage structure of the carbonic anhydride enzyme, and the influence of the molecular conformation, the best amino acid mutation site was obtained, and the thermal stability of the enzyme was improved without affecting the enzyme activity. 3, We obtained the expression of wild type and mutant carbonic anhydride enzyme strains of Escherichia coli, and two kinds of carbon anhydride enzyme in vitro purification, wild-type carbonic anhydride enzyme has a certain CO2 capture efficiency, more importantly, the mutant than the wild type of carbonic anhydride enzyme has better stability and activity, realize the CO2 efficient capture.
Fig.9 Meeting with three other universities
Students from Tohoku University also briefed members of our other schools about their projects, and the Tohoku University project was inspired by the prevalence of fast food and the acceleration of urbanization, with the number of inflammatory bowel diseases (inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) rising in Asia, And the risk of developing colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer, CRC) in patients with IBD also increased. There are no drugs that are better for ibd, so they want to use engineered probiotics to treat IBD and prevent crc,by using synthetic biology. The rest of us were very interested in the project, and our Anhui University of Technology team actively asked them for details about their project, and they briefed them on the background and main contents of their project. The background of their project is that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by inappropriate immune responses, which in general trigger a series of events that can disrupt the barrier when the immune system reacts excessively to the bacteria in the gut, eventually causing IBD when the immune imbalance persists without intervention. There is no cure for IBD at present,and the best treatment now is to use anti-inflammatory drugs such as TNF inhibitor treatment, but the patient's drug treatment effect is of huge difference.And  it is ineffective to more than 50% of the patients . Probiotics are beneficial to the host of active microorganisms, colonization in the human intestinal tract, reproductive system, oral cavity and so they can produce the exact"

UPF-CRG_Barcelona,2016,Team:UPF-CRG Barcelona#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"oMet decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) to produce decarboxylated AdoMet (DcAdoMet). DcAdoMet is then used as an aminopropyl group donor either to putrescine by spermidine synthase to produce spermidine, or to spermidine to produce spermine by spermine synthase. [1]
E. coli has two polyamine uptake systems belonging to the ABC transporters family. One system is a spermidine-preferential system and the second one a putrescine-specific system. Each system consists of 4 transporters: PotA to D for spermidine transport and PotF to I for putrescine transport.  There are also two exporters (PotE and CadB), uptaking polyamines at neutral pH and excreting them at acidic pH. Finally, a spermidine excretion protein, MdtII was recently identified. [1]
Figure 5: Polyamines Pathway
Polyamines and cancer
Cancer and proliferative cells exhibit high levels of polyamines and this is thought to be a feature by which cancer cells maintain their proliferative capacity. However, the exact role of polyamines in cancer is still unclear.
A strategy to study the involvement of polyamines in cancer has been to use polyamine biosynthesis pathway inhibitors or polyamine analogues.
Although the ability of polyamines to induce cancer is still a matter of debate, it is likely that their high levels in cancer cells can help these cells maintain their proliferative capacity. This could happen by the interaction of polyamines with oncogenes. Polyamines have thus been the target for chemotherapeutic agents for a relatively long time. Such potential chemotherapeutic drugs developed are polyamine synthesis inhibitors, polyamine analogues or polyamine-conjugated compounds, as mentioned before. Many of these compounds show no effect during clinical trials, and are currently being studied as a chemopreventive agents rather than a chemotherapeutic ones. [1]
Polyamine concentrations are often increased in the blood and urine of cancer patients, and these increased levels have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis. The increased blood and urinary polyamine levels are attributable to increased polyamine synthesis by cancer cells, since these increases can be abolished by complete eradication of tumors by surgery or radio-chemotherapy. The capacity of cancer tissue to produce abundant polyamines likely contributes to cancer cells’ enhanced growth rates because polyamines are indispensable for cellular growth, which may at least partially explain why cancer patients with increased polyamine levels have a"

Planning
We chose to evaluate 8 parameters, designating high and low values for each. These values were chosen carefully from reading through current literature on P. acnes and other electroporation protocols. The 8 parameters were:
P. Acnes strain
We chose to use two different types of P. Acnes strains to determine if this made a significant difference in the transformation efficiency. We did however restrict the strain to being dam- strains because unmethylated DNA was shown to have greater transformation efficiency (Cheong). In addition, Type I P. Acnes was used because there is CRISPR/Cas system in this class. This system protects p. Acnes against plasmid and foreign DNA.
Lysozyme concentration
Since, P. Acnes has a particularly thick cell wall, lysozyme was used as a cell wall weakening agent. Lysozyme is a common cell wall weakening agent and was readily available. The concentrations were determined from previous experiments in lab with P. Acnes.
Glycine concentration
Similar to the lysozyme, glycine was used as a cell wall weakening agent. The concentrations were determined from a paper which transformed other P. Acnes bacteria. (Fan)
Mass of plasmid DNA
The high and low values for this parameter were based of values suggested by a protocol written by UCLA and a protocol by Cheong.
Source
Electric field strength
The values for electric field strength were chosen based of the Cheong paper.
Culture temperature
We decided to use 24°C because this was the lower end of culture temperature that growth was seen by Cheong. We determined 37°C to be the higher end of the spectrum because this is body temperature.
Post-transformation temperature
We chose the post transformation incubation temperatures for the same reason as the culture temperature.
Source
Presence of restriction enzyme inhibitor (TypeOne)
This particular product was shown to increase the efficiency of transformation by inhibiting type 1 restriction modification systems. Although, there is no confirmed evidence for a type 1 restriction/modification system in P. Acnes
Testing for these 8 parameters required 16 trials, the values of which can be seen below:
Trials
For each trial, the desired P. acnes strain was grown up in approximately 30 mL of A media until attaining an optical"
