Expected results
Finally, we translated the biological system into mathematical equations. As we can see, there is a lot of paramaters for the binding and unbinding kinetics, degradation rates and productions from promoters. However, values for only a few of them are available. This is why we needed to simulate the behaviour of our system.
We want to have an overproduction of XylR in the presence of IPTG, for the STICK option. And an overproduction of LacI when there is xylose in the environment, for the COAT option.
According to the above theoretical model, we should generate the expected toggle switch (figure below), using the appropriate values for all parameters.
Figure 10: Expected results of the model
Experimentations
So far, we can consider the values for the Plac promoter, LacI and IPTG that have been measured in E. coli to apply to our B. subtilis model. We have performed experiments with the Pxyl, xylose and XylR to evaluate whether this promoter can be modelled using similar values. When this step is performed, our model will allow us to determine two important concentration limits:
1) the lowest IPTG concentration for the induction of the COAT option;
2) the lowest xylose concentration for the induction of the STICK option.
We also thought of a way to obtain binding and unbinding kinetics of the proteins. Some methods such as Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) permit to determine the thermodynamic parameters of interactions in solution

Paris_Bettencourt,2016,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Notebook#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,"5 μL of each PCR product inside a different well.
Pipette 5 μL of a 1kb ladder 'purchased to Thermofisher) in one of the wells (better if it flanks the PCR products when there is many of them).
Close the machine and launch the migration with a 100V voltage and wait approximately 20 minutes.
When the migration is finished, turn off the machine, remove the lid and put the gel inside the gel visualizer.
It is here important to check two things:
According to the ladder, the bands should present a weigh of 1,4Kb.
No band should appear in the negative control, so that no contamination during the PCR preparation could interfere with the sample's bacterial identification.
PCR purification
The PCR purifcation was performed using the QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) :
Add 5 volumes of binding buffer to 1 volume of PCR product in a sterile 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube, mix by pipetting up and down.
Transfer in a centrifugation column and centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm.
Throw the filtration product and add 750μL of washing solution (make sure ethanol was added before according Qiagen protocol).
Wait 5 minutes, then centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm.
Throw the filtration product and centrifuge again 1 min at 14000 rpm.
Put the column in a sterile 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add directly to the center of the column 35 μL of the elution buffer.
Wait 1 minute and centrifuge 1 min at 13000 rpm.
Discard the column and stock the solution at 4°C before quantification.
DNA quantification
DNA quantification was performed with the Thermo Science Nanodrop 2000 and enabled to check if our PCR purification product fit with GATC samples requirements.
Notably, the PCR product concentration needs to be between 20 and 80 ng/μl.
Per sample, two 1,5 mL microcentrifuge tubes will be necessary. In both, add 5μL of the purified DNA at the proper concentration ( For instance, a dilution with sterile water is thus possible if the concentration is higher than 80 ng/μL).
Add 5μL of the forward primer in one of the tube, and the reverse in the other tube (we used a concentration of 10 uM).
Interpretation of data
The purpose is here to generate a consensus sequence for each sample,"
UC_Davis,2012,Team:UC Davis#Notebook#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,", 60°C for 50 seconds, 68°C for 1 minute/kb of plasmid length -- repeat this step 17 times, or 18 cycles total
68°C for 7 minutes
4°C hold
Following PCR - save 4µL of PCR reaction.
To remaining 46µLs add 1µL of Dpn1 to PCR reaction (PCR cleanup is not necessary). Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 hours to digest parental DNA. Run 5µL of the digested reaction on a gel and compare to the undigested parental plasmid - there should be some difference in band pattern. Transform into competent cells (PCR cleanup is not necessary).

USTC,2015,Team:USTC#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a systematically modified bactieral machine for antibiotic concentration determination. Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bactiera using simple genetic circuit. Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit and systematic permeability reconstruction.
Systematic Overview of ROSE
In general, ROSE as a community, containing two kinds of bactiera, among which Bactiera I specfically receives antibiotic concentration information from antibiotic substance sensing promoters, which were previously selected by Shimshon Belkin and Sahar Melamed in 2012. Then Bacteria I output information with LuxI, part of genetic expression regulator by quorum sensing, whose information is provided with positive amplification for Bacteria II. Bacteria II itself will automatically produce another part of regulator LuxR triggered by IPTG. Besides Bacteria II has a logically amlification circuit regulated by LuxI-LuxR complex. In this circuit containing two promoter regulaing two protein. The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein. Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but to increase the signal resolution of concentration variation.
The design intention on bactieral membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance. Theoratically, bacteria won't receive antibiotic substance bacause of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system. Thus, we are attempting to modify bactiera in reverse way, that is overexpression of transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system production through CRISPR.
Antibiotic Substance Sensing Module
Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of promoters responding to antibiotic concentration specificallly through the fluorescence signal.
For instance, micF has relatively specific signal response when treated with sulfamethoxazole(255.2), sulfadimethoxine(44.9) and colistin(36.9), soxS is able to sense tetracycline(26.5) and oxytetracycline(26.1) at relative high intense. Besides, recA will effectively detect the existence of nalidixic acid and etc. These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h of exposure.
The mechanism of"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Plant_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Accessible Wiki - The Collaboration
We didn’t want to stop at designing our own wiki barrier-free to make the results of the iGEM competition accessible to everyone. Because, let’s face it, there are many  more amazing and interesting projects out there. This is why we decided to encourage other teams to design their wiki accessible, too. By participating in  this collaboration, all parties benefit. Firstly, people with vision impairment can access the web pages easily. Secondly, the teams create a broader audience for their results. Lastly and most importantly, this collaboration is spreading awareness to the issue of an inclusive society that is long overdue.
For this to happen, we put together a guide containing the basic criteria needed for an accessible website. Click here to get to our accessible wiki guide. After spreading our campaign over social media we contacted over 80 teams in personal messages. Interestingly, the majority of the other teams had never heard of accessible web design. Some did and had already implemented some criteria into their wiki.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," all strains grew in the absence of glyphosate. By contrast, only the gltT mutant strain BP233 grew with glyphosate. Thus, like the wild type also the complementation strain BP237 take up glyphosate via GltT. To conclude, under the tested growth conditions the high-affinity glutamate transporter GltT is the major entryway of glyphosate into B. subtilis!.
Figure 10. Complementation of the ΔgltT mutant strain. (A) The artificial Palf4 promoter (12) and the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of the B. subtilis gapA gene were fused by PCR to the gltT gene. (B) Growth of the B. subtilis wild type 168 (WT), the ΔgltT mutant BP233 and the ΔgltT Palf4-gltT complementation strain BP237 on CS-Glc minimal medium agar plates without glyphosate (0 mM GS) and with glyphosate (10 mM GS). The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C.
1.7. GltT is also involved in the uptake of the herbicide glufosinate
Our structural comparison of glutamate and glyphosate revealed that the two molecules resemble each other because they contain negatively charged groups encompassing positively charged groups (see Figure 5D). However, the structural similarity of glutamate and glyphosate is not very high. During a scientific discussion with our collaborator Dr. Till Ischebeck from the Department of Plant Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen, we came up with the idea that GltT may also transport the herbicide glufosinate, which is structurally more similar to glutamate than glyphosate and inhibits the glutamine synthetase (Figure 11A) (13). Glufosinate (phosphinothricin) is a naturally occurring broad-spectrum systemic herbicide produced by several species of Streptomyces soil bacteria. Plants may also metabolize bialaphos (L-Alanyl-L-alanyl-phosphinothricin), another naturally occurring herbicide, directly into glufosinate (13). The compound irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, an enzyme necessary for the de novo synthesis of glutamine from ammonia and glutamate, giving it antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal properties. Application of glufosinate to plants leads to reduced glutamine and elevated ammonia levels in tissues, halting photosynthesis, resulting in plant death. In the"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Health_-_-_TEXT.html,"obes that you have studied.
Answer: I believe that any material that can disrupt biofilm would be very useful in the management of infections caused by bacteria that produce biofilms. Coupling this with a suitable antimicrobial agent that is capable of killing the bacteria within the biofilms will be novel. A broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that can kill anaerobes e.g. the Bacteroides spp. anaerobic cocci and Clostridium spp. as well as the facultative organisms like S. aureus, and aerobic bacteria like Pseudomonas spp.  Coupling clindamycin (an anti-anaerobic drug and staphylococci) plus gentamicin (for Pseudomonas and facultative organisms) with the spider web that you are trying to develop may be worth investigating. When the biofilm is degraded the antibiotics can then be released into the wound. Another antimicrobial agent that can be tried is piperacillin-tazobactam, as a single agent, or metronidazole plus gentamicin. Of course, when you get to the trails phase ethical approval would be needed.
It’s a very fascinating project – developing a substance that can degrade biofilm and at the same time release antimicrobial agents to the wound environment should hold promise as alternative to the management of wound infections.

The GFP expression levels were measured every hour over a period of 24 hours. The GFP expression levels were compared to a synthetic GFP construct in an E. coli chassis as a positive control and a non-fluorescing E. coli device as a negative control. The E. coli cells were grown in SOC media over 24 hours, at 37ᵒC and 220 rpm. Error bars represent standard error.
Chassis Strain
The BL21 E. coli strain containing the Gibson Assembly construct had a significantly higher GFP expression level than the 5-alpha and TOP10 strains when incubated in SOC media at 37ᵒC at a neutral pH; the BL21 GFP expression was 1.01x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 3.66x104 AFU/OD600 at 24 hours whereas 5-α was 4.08x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 7.32x103 AFU/OD600 and TOP10 was 4.04x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 1.24x104 AFU/OD600 at 24 hours (Figure 2.4). There was a significant difference in mean GFP expression levels between 5-α, BL21 and TOP10 grown at 37ᵒC at a neutral pH in SOC media over the 24 hours (ANOVA, F2,72=15.16, p<0.001). A post hoc Tukey test indicated that there was no significant difference in the GFP expression between 5-α and TOP10 (p>0.05) but BL21 had a significantly higher GFP expression than the other strains (p<0.05).

The overall organization of our team has been the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Roland Eils. Dr. Dirk Grimm, who is a fellow at the Bioquant institute with a strong background in adeno-associated viruses and RNA interference, has joined this iGEM team as instructor. In the spirit of iGEM, the main project idea was designed by the students themselves. The vast majority of the work has been conducted by the students with only minor exceptions, where German law required the inolvement of an instructor or advisor.
Main Project Idea
The initiative for the project idea (i.e. viral therapy with adeno-associated viruses, which is special for its low safety level 1) has been developed by our students. Encouraged by the work of Dr. Grimm and others, we further decided to focus on RNA interference as potent instrument for gene regulation.
In the following we distinguish between students, advisors/instructors, external advisors, and service providers.
miMeasure
The design of the measurement standard construct for shRNA or miRNA silencing strengths has been done by the students with support by advisors. This standard"

Collaboration with Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute “promotes"" the formation of political and public opinion on science and technology. To this end, the Institute studies the organization and development of science systems, publishes about social impact of new technologies, and organizes debates on issues and dilemmas in science and technology. The institute is part of Synenergene, a European project that aims to foster an open dialogue on responsible research and innovation in synthetic biology (RRI). After winning the Synenergene grant for collaboration in Human Practices supported by iGEM, we worked with Mrs. Zoë Robaey from the Rathenau institute, who was a great help for the development of our application scenarios. Indeed, we had the opportunity to contact her by Skype and received her expert advice on anticipating events related to our project in the developed and developing countries. She also helped us to think about a techno moral scenario, with the aim being to anticipate protocols and actions in case of unexpected problems related to our project. Now we are able to answer these questions: • How to provide support to the population in case of panic? • How to provide maximum security for populations? • How to manage most effectively a problem with our kit? We want to especially thank the Rathenau Instituut for all their help during our project. To check out the results from this great collaboration, click our SCENARIOS .
Collaboration with Professionals
Our team was fortunate to have several opportunities to meet with professionals. We had the chance to: • 1) Discuss our vision and project goals • 2) Learn from their expertise and use that knowledge to further develop our project • 3) Share ideas • 4) Make contacts for potential future collaborations. These encounters were valuable to us and greatly helped improve our project.
Civic Drone
Civic Drone is a French company that specializes in designing and manufacturing non-military drones. Among other applications, their drones are currently being used to monitor nuclear power plants. In July, we met with the CEO of the company, Mr. Edouard Guilhot-Gaudeffroy and one of the company’s R&D engineers.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," a sensor system which clears its previous signals fast and automatically, we employed mRFP1 with different ssrA degradation tags, Ba_K1339001, BBa_K1339002, BBa_K1339003.
In the meantime, we noticed that there exists a series of parts composed by mut3b GFP and ssrA tags, for example, BBa_K1339004. Considering that the highly efficient folding capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) should be more exploited, we replaced the mut3b GFP with a superfolder GFP, to see if there is any improvement for this part. This time, we took the part BBa_K1339004, which is a mut3b GFP with a LVA tag, as a try.
By comparing the kinetic curves of these two parts (see methods for more information), we observed that there is no remarkable improvement in total relative fluorescence intensity at the steady state, and the degradation trends are highly similar as well. The minimum fluorescence intensity of sfGFP with the LVA tag is a little bit weaker than mut3b GFP, which may because the set wavelength of the exciting light suits the mut3b GFP best but not the sfGFP. In another word, this may not be seen as an improved feature.
However, when analyzing the gcolumnth curves, we found that the curve of mut3b GFP reveals stronger fluctuation than sfGFP. That is to say, the sfGFP with a LVA tag shows a more stable gcolumnth state (fig.1). This is a significant improvement, because for engineered bacteria expected to work properly in real world, they must have robust viability. A part leaves bacteria gcolumning unstably cannot be further programmed efficiently.

Johns_Hopkins-BAG,2009,Team:Johns Hopkins-BAG#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. Templateless PCR (TPCR) – The TPCR is performed to form a larger construct (the BB) from the oligo mixes.
3. Finish PCR (FPCR) – The FPCR is performed to amplify the full-length BB produced in small quantities during the TPCR.
4. Gel Electrophoresis I - You will gage the success of your FPCRs by running small samples of the TPCR and FPCR on a gel.
5. Cloning BBs – BBs which have been determined to be of the correct size will be cloned into a generic cloning vector and used to transform bacteria.
6. Bacterial Transformation – Bacteria will be transformed with the cloned construct to create a population of clones available for sequencing and future use.
7. Colony Screening PCR (CSPCR) – CSPCR will be used to determine which clones have the transformed plasmid.
8. Gel Electrophoresis II– You will analyze the results of the CSPCR by running a small volume of the CSPCR on a gel.
9. Sequencing – Clones which are shown to contain plasmids with an insert of the intended size will be sent for sequencing.  You will perform sequence analysis to identify “perfect” clones.
Oligos
Oligos will be dispensed in 96 well plates. Each plate will contain two or more complete BBs. You will be given a diagram of the oligos on each plate.
Diluting oligos to the proper concentration for future use
Oligos are delivered to us at a concentration of 60uM. We have diluted them 1/10 to give you a working stock of 6uM. You will need to create a template primer mix (TPM) and an outer primer mix (OPM).
Templateless primer mix
All primers must be present at a concentration of 300nM (the oligos must all be diluted by 1/20)  before use in the TPM. These dilutions should be done in a 1.7ml eppendorf tube, and primer mixes should be stored at -20ºC when not in use.
If you have up to 20 primers in a BB:
* Label your TPM tube with the BB number and oligo concentration (300 nM)    * Add 10 ul each primer    * If necessary (if under 20 primers), add H2O to a final volume of 200ul.    * Mix thoroughly
If you have >20 primers in a BB
* Label your TPM tube with the BB"

Sorbonne_U_Paris,2018,Team:Sorbonne U Paris#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," these characteristics explain why it is an interesting chassis in comparison to other classical model (bacteria or yeasts) which always need an input of energy such as glucose. This microalgae is well-known as a model organism in the research field on photosynthesis and its genome has been characterized[7]. Moreover, growing range of tools in molecular biology have been developed for use in Chlamydomonas, for example a brand new modular cloning tool was created and published in 2018, the MoClo toolkit set by Pierre Crozet et al. This tool offers a new field of possibilities for the use of Chlamydomonas as it is a very interesting microorganism whose biosynthesis and metabolic pathways can be exploited in synthetic biology.  Indeed it was established that this microalgae could be used in the future to produce high value compounds for biotechnology industries[8].
How to make this algae survive in marine environments?
To make use of the marine environment during the sugar production, we needed to have a microalgae that can survive in salty water. So we contacted Josianne Lachapelle who worked with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and adapted some strains to live in high salt concentration medium[9]. And she kindly accepted to provide us with some of these strains that we could use them to make sugar without competing with arable land.
Which relevant sugar to produce in this algae?
The sugar we chose to produce in this microalgae is the trehalose C12H22O11. It is a disaccharide of glucose, that can be metabolized by Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While it is also present in Chlamydomonas, it is, however, mainly involved in stress response to H202 as an antioxidant and not as a source of energy. Without a self-production consumption, Chlamydomonas and trehalose are becoming an interesting combination for energy production. As a result, this source of energy would potentially be fully extracted and used by chassis such as E. coli or S. cerevisiae for the production of molecules of interest by synthetic biology.
Our discussions with professionals and scientists who work with Chlamydomonas or other microalgae, on directed evolution or on regulations played a major role in the further perspective of our project.
One main conclusion we got from our meetings was that algae did not bring an added value for the production of sugar or biofuels because of its high production costs. Indeed, the cost of production will highly increase because of the energy to bring to the photobioreactor, the"
Goettingen,2014,Team:Goettingen#notebook safety_-_-_TEXT.html," lab practices and strict safety measures are followed in the lab. All biological materials are disposed of separately in special waste containers after proper inactivation by sterilization.
About risks of our project in the future
1. What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
In the future, in vivo studies is crucial for designing a therapeutic product. During such studies we may have to work with pathogens belonging to Risk Group level 2, so proper care and precautions have to be taken beforehand. All such experiments have to be carried out in suitable work area designed as per set rules.
2. Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
Currently, our project does not include any design features to reduce risks, as it does not pose any threat / risk to humans or the environment.
As a future perspective, our technique can be developed as a therapeutic tool to fight against fungal pathogens. Even then the peptides we use for such purposes does not have any ill effects / risks that would evoke safety concerns.
But care and caution must be taken during in vivo studies with potentially harmful pathogens.
The Basic safety form in the lab(Due on June 23rd)
1. a) Does your country use a four-part ""Safety Level"" rating system for laboratories? (The system might be called in English ""Risk Levels"", ""Bio-Safety Levels"", ""Containment Levels"", ""Bio-Security Levels"", or some similar name.)
If yes, which level is used for the most dangerous organisms?
• Yes. Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms. (True for most countries in Asia, the European Union, and North/South America. This is equivalent to the WHO system.)
b) What is the Safety Level of your lab? (Use the WHO numbering system, in which Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms).
• Level 1 (low risk, ~= WHO BSL 1)
2. a) What type of work environments do you use to handle biological materials? Please check all that apply.

Mingdao,2018,Team:Mingdao#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html,"-transfection at MOI=10
↓ GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm.
RESULT
The data represented in C6/36 cells showed that GAM1 promoter was not only activated by Gram-negative E. coli but also induced by Gram-positive B. subtilis.
GFP signal increased with bacteria concentrations
To verify the application of GAM1 promoter as a biosensor to measure the amounts of pathogens, E. coli at various concentrations were added onto the mosquito cells transfected with the GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3
EXPERIMENT
↓ C6/36 cells were seeded at the density of 1.8 x 105 cell/well in a 96-well plate
↓ Cells were transfected with GAM1-GFP-polyA or Ac5-GFP-polyA vectors
↓ E. coli at MOI=2, 4, 8, 16, 32 were added on 2 days post-transfection
↓ GFP intensity was measured by a microplate reader at Ex/Em = 480/520 nm.
RESULT
As figures shown above, the green fluorescence intensities driven by GAM1 promoter were increased dose-dependently in the presence of E. coli at MOIs from 2 to 32. The fluorescence expressed by Ac5 promoter was not influenced at the same condition. These results demonstrated GAM1-GFP reporter system can used in the mosquito cells as a biosensor in response of different concentrations of bacteria.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, we created a GFP reporter system driven under AMP promoter by Toll signaling. The expression of GFP can be induced by bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. The green fluorescence observed under microscope further proved the concept of GE mosquito cells as a pathogen surveillance tool.
Glowing mosquitoes with GAM1-GFP reporter and bacteria
To demonstrate in adult mosquitoes, we collaborated with iGEM Team NCHU_Taichung to microinject DNA into Aedes aegypti. We prepared the plasmid of GAM1-GFP-polyA / pSB1C3 and heat-killed E. coli. A member who works in Entomology Department of National Chung Hsing University take us to the mosquito lab and helped us inject the materials to the midgut of Aedes aegypti.
The mosquitoes injected with DNA plus E. coli showed fluorescence signal in Gel Imaging System and Blue LED Box.

September 15 Presentation, Physical Science Class I of Mrs. Collins, 24 Students
We had a powerpoint presentation ready to share with the students. We introduced synthetic biology, iGEM, and then got into talking about the problem we were tackling through synthetic biology. We worked hard to keep it simple, but still explain the process of engineering our yeast cells, before we shared our actual results. We set aside about 15 min for questions. We also walked the students through how we started an iGEM team, and answered questions from how we got funded to our experience with lab work. Overall, the students showed much interest. One student in particular was extremely interested and was definitely wanting to do iGEM! We had another student ask us about our solution and whether it was patentable and how much money could be made. We used this question to explain the benefits to society from science that may not always involve huge monetary rewards and that the work itself is a reward.
September 15 Presentation, Physical Science Class II of Mrs. Collins, 16 Students
We repeated our presentation and took questions from the students. We used question time as an opportunity to give more information about how science had helped us to think more critically and that these are good skills to have even if we may not follow careers in science. We had students ask us if we got paid to do lab work over the summer. But we did tell them that remuneration is a real possibility for collegiate iGEM teams, notwithstanding the work skills they gain!
September 16 Presentation, Physical Science Class III of Mrs. Collins, 24 students
After presenting, we had lots of questions from this class. We almost ran over our allotted time.
When Mrs. Collins asked about how many students were interested in doing iGEM next year when they got to high school, we were so excited to see about 10 hands go up. Way to go !!!!
September 16 Presentation, Physical Science Class IV of Mrs. Collins, 20 Students
Some of the most probing questions were asked in this class; they went from “how much enzyme was being produced?” to “how that compares to the promoter?” Demonstrating a good grasp of what they had heard and a keen interest in the iGEM project, we were super pleased that we had connected with the students.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," a RNA integrity number (RIN) above 9 which means that the total mRNA is pure and does not have any contamination. During the first step of RT-qPCR the total mRNA in converted to cDNA by a reverse transcriptase, which is then used in the actual quantitative PCR to quantify the amount of a specific mRNA was produced by the cells. For this reason two primer pairs were designed. One of them was designed to bind the exact same region in all of the different receptor mRNAs and amplify the same part of the receptor. Contrary to that the second pair was supposed to bind only in the biotin presenting receptor and amplify a part that is unique to this receptor. By this method we wanted to observe if only one part of the mRNA is unstable or if the general mRNA level of this receptor is decreased.
For the evaluation of the raw data we used the ΔΔCP method [22] in which the crossing points (CP values) of a gene of interest and of a reference gene are compared and normalized with a constantly expressed HKG, to get an idea of the relative amounts of the mRNA of interest.
In the following you can see the results of our experiments. We compared the expression levels of T-REx cells which were transfected with our different receptor constructs and with non-transfected (NT) T-REx cells.
Fig.x
As can be seen the ΔΔCP values of the mRNA of the eMA and scAvidin constructs are with a 1,2 x  106 fold increase for scAvidin and 1.5 x 103 fold increase for eMA, significantly higher than those of the BAP construct. The analysis of the different primer pairs in the two regions of the BAP construct also showed similar values and thus confirms the reliability of the measurement. A difference in CP value is tantamount to relative mRNA differences between cells.
Together with the result that the integration of the constuct into the genome was successful we can conclude that our first assumption, that the missing RFP signal in cells, which were transfected with the BAP construct, is caused by a reduced mRNA stability, is correct.
High resolution imaging using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

Communication on Synthetic Biology
While we were working on our lab project for the iGEM competition, we came across very interesting readings about how to communicate on the specific field of Synthetic Biology. This question came again as we started to contact potential sponsors for the team, and to communicate with media about our adventure and the goals we wanted to reach. Obviously, there was a whole kind of associations that the public could make with the simple words of « synthetic » and « biology », and as an emerging field, this technology is raising unique questions about benefits and risks.
What we planned
As this is the first participation of the iGEM-AMU team in the competition, we wanted to increase awareness of the emerging field of synthetic biology at two levels: first for our fellow-students in Aix-Marseille University, and then to a larger public.
We also initially planned to hold a small conference on Synthetic Biology at Aix-Marseille University that would be opened to a large audience, but we couldn’t manage to schedule it before the summer. We expect to present it in January 2015, and to include our feedback experience after the giant Jamboree in Boston!!!
In order to adapt efficiently our message to our public, we first tried to identify the key concepts to deliver an unambiguous and credible message. We are presenting here our feedbacks and the ressources that we think can be useful for the communication of every iGEM new team, when talking to sponsors, media, or a broad audience of non-scientists.
First, essential readings to get prepared...
Here are the some of the resources that were used during our brainstorming phase:

Safety Training in our team
We had taken several experiments training before this very summer vocation during which we spent to conduct our project.
To ensure the safety of people in our lab as well as the goal of protecting our experiment, firstly we invited our academic adviser Jiong Hong, to give us a guidance to use the laboratory apparatus correctly. Besides, professor Hong also emphasized the potential toxicity of chemical drugs we use, such as Gelred when doing agarose gel electrophoresis, but of course our lab ranks Risk 1, which means it’s very safe for us students as long as we follow the rules in the lab. Moreover, we also invited previous iGEM team members to give us more detailed attention when doing experiments, and it’s helpful very much.
Kill Switch in E.coli
This year our safety work is based on E.coli, since some of our work is on light sensing and imaging system in E.coli. To make a wider application in the future, the biosafety of E.coli containing these parts should be concerned.
Anti-LPS factor (LALF) regulated by lacI
We designed the part based on K541545. We found that R0010 would keep expressing genes downstream constitutively rather than being induced by IPTG. And we've thought that reasons may lie in the limited amount of Lacl (Lactose Inhibitor protein) expressed by E. coil. So we inserted parts which expresses Lacl with a strong promoter before the old one to improve the amount of Lacl and make our lactose operator work. Besides, we also found that Twin arginine signal peptide is an efficient protein export signal sequence of E. coli. Adding this segment to the part makes our killing switch work better.
Anti-LPS factor (LALF) regulated by IPTG
This part is a cell-kill system. Firstly,constitutive promoter could express enough Lacl that is useful for downstream. Secondly, the reporter in the middle of our part wouldn't show signal nor the cell be killed by the part behind unless IPTG or lactose added into the culture medium. No IPTG or lactose: LALF won't express ,G- won't be killed. IPTG or lactose existing: LALF will express ,G"

Re: knowledge for the sake of knowledge: knowledge is not enough – we need application, and we have to understand it well before it can be applied. We don’t allow all knowledge to be applied – for instance, knowledge about how to make biological weapons is kept secret because we fear what we could create and value pre-emptive measures.
Arguments:
1) Role of the state: the role of the scientist doesn’t trump the role of the state. The state is necessary to make sure science doesn’t go too far and ensure the population is included in its decisions. The best decision for society can be made by the state, not by scientists.
2) Genetic arms race: others will push boundaries to compete with you. We don’t want these limits pushed in countries whose governments don’t have the ability to react, contain it or understand it like other nations do. Knowledge is so mobile that this is a serious risk.
Fourth Proposition Speaker
Competitor at the World Debate Championships 2009
Two major questions arose in the round:
1)Are genetically modified things good or bad?
Genetic engineering is merely speeding up natural processes used for thousands of years. The negative consequences could happen anyways, but the benefits can only occur if we take advantage of genetic modification. For instance, out of control crops can occur with traditional breeding, but continuing to feed the masses will be difficult without genetically improved strains.
2)What is the state’s role in limiting science?
Science is not out of control – the problems actually occur when the state takes control and doesn’t allow science to take its own course. There are cases of unintended consequences, but genetics also tries to fix them. If we only engaged in science that was necessary, safe and understood, we wouldn’t even have developed fire. We wouldn’t have any science by these criteria. Regarding the argument that the state is needed to ensure societal input in science, scientists are representative of society – the scientific method can be done by anyone, science is open to anyone and is fundamentally democratic. We need to allow science to be science.

Goal: Learn about the general concepts of Q fever. What are the starting points for detecting Q fever? What are problems with the existing detection-methods.
Approach: Via the secretary of the Central Veterinary Institute, we were brought into contact with Dr. Roest. Dr. Roest is a veterinary microbiologist, who is strongly involved in research to Q fever. We asked Dr. Roest about current sensormethods and what problems he encountered using them.
Result: Dr. Roest provided us with information about some substantive questions about the detection of Q fever. Therefore he referred us to some interesting articles.
Dr. R. (René) van den Brom – Researcher working for the “Gezondheidsdienst voor Dieren” (a national institute that focusses on animal well-being)
Goal: Learn more about what the developments in the field of Q fever are and what the most commonly used detection methods are.
Approach: We were brought into contact with Dr. Van den Brom via HollandBio, a national institute that is involved in technical advancements in the field of biology. Dr. Brom works at an institute for animal well-being, where he is involved in research towards Q fever. We asked him some questions about the current status of Q fever research.
Result: Dr. Van den Brom also helped us to answer some of our questions about the development of Q fever, by handing us his thesis.
Detection of intestinal diseases
The application of our device inside the human body, might be one of the most controversial examples of possible usage. From earlier surveys (matchings days and wisdom of the crowds) however we learned that the general public is quite open-minded about the use of GMO’s in the intestines. There arguments mostly result in the statement: As long as the testing has been sufficient, and it is proven to be harmless and beneficial, than what is against the use of genetically modified organisms. In other words: They trust the expert. Therefore it was important to learn more about what experts thought about this application scenario. We contacted intestinal doctors, researchers, institutes and also people involved in regulation. The reactions we encountered were gently called disperse.

Once people have a model they are happy with, they often want to use their models predictively, by conducting ""virtual experiments"" that might be difficult, time-consuming, or impossible to do in the lab. Such experiments may uncover important indirect relationships between the model components that would be hard to predict otherwise. An additional goal of modern biological modeling is to pool a number of small models of well-understood mechanisms into a large model in order to investigate the effect of interactions between the model components. Models can also be extremely useful for informing the design and analysis of complex biological experiments.
In summary, modeling and computer simulation are becoming increasingly important in post-genomic biology for integrating knowledge and experimental data and making testable predictions about the behavior of complex biological systems.
Stochastic Approaches
The most common formulation of stochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation (CME). The analytical nature of the early stochastic approaches was highly complicated and, in some cases, intractable so that they received little attention in the biochemical community. Later, the situation changed with the increasing computational power of modern computers. And finally Gillespie presented an ground-breaking algorithm for numerically generating sample trajectories of the abundances of chemical species in chemical reaction networks. The so-called ""stochastic simulation algorithm,"" or ""Gillespie algorithm,"" can easily be implemented in any programming or scripting language that has a pseudorandom number generator. Several software packages implementing the algorithm have been developed. Differerent stochastic approaches and their interrelationships are depicted in Figure.
<img src=""
"" class=""figure"" />
For large biochemical systems, with many species and reactions, stochastic simulations (based on the original Gillespie algorithm) become computationally demanding. Recent years have seen a large interest in improving the efficiency/speed of stochastic simulations by modification/approximation of the original Gillespie algorithm. These improvements include the ""next reaction"" method of Gibson and Bruck, the ""τ-leap"" method and its various improvements and generalizations and the ""maximal time step method"", which combines the next reaction and the τ-leap methods.
While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realize the CME, analytical approximations offer more insights into the influence of noise on cell function. Formally, the CME is a continuous-time discrete-state Markov process. For gaining intuitive insight and a quick characterization of fluctuations in biochemical networks, the CME is usually approximated analytically in different ways, including the frequently used chemical Langevin equation (CLE), the linear noise approximation (LNA), and the two-moment approximation (2MA).

Finally… there is no 2 kinds of fluorescence anymore… The only fluorescence we will measure is from RFP. There is no BFP anymore because:
→ iGEM’s backbones are not adapted to BFP.
→ BFP needs 10h of IPTG induction.
So there is a filter I don’t need, and I don’t need to change the filter, so the servo motor is useless. Actually it makes everything easier, except that the measures need now to be performed in 2 different pits. And it is quite disappointing, but well, this is how life goes.
07/31/2018
I have the 1st version of the unit. I’ve used it to do some experiments, that are summed up below:
→ I wanted to evaluate qualitatively how efficient my filter is. To do so, I compared the measured voltage at the trans-impedance stage with and without filter, and I illuminated quite approximately the eppendorf support with 7 LEDs. 8 LEDS were foreseen, but one hole was not correctly designed, so it couldn’t be used to make the wires go through it. By the way, all the holes are not correctly designed, as I can’t insert the LEDs into them. Therefore the LEDs are out of the hole, nearer to the eppendorf but with an uncertain orientation, and they are stabilized with scotch.
Without filter, the photodiode saturated (4.60V); without filter, the photodiode did not saturate. The filter indeed filters the excitation light.
→ I tried to measure fluorescence in an eppendorf with fluorescent bacteria. I observed that the voltage was a little lower with the eppendorf in place, which made me think that the bacteria were not fluorescent. A week of holidays later, I tried again this experiment, but this time I saw fluorescence at the fluorescence microscope, and the sample was quite concentrated. However, I saw the same phenomenon. I had 2 hypothesis (with the help of Clément): it could be the LEDs that are not bright enough, or the filter that is too selective.
I used the UV plate to excitate a petri dish with fluorescent bacteria: the fluorescence can be seen to the naked eye, so the filter indeed lets the fluorescence light by. However, when trying to detect something with the photodiode, I am very near to the saturation value. Worst, this value is still lower than the one I obtain with a petri dish with LB-agar. I do believe that both LEDs"

Thermoinduction
Overview
This part of temporal control is responsible for triggering genomic deletion, after encapsulation has taken place.
When the temperature is low, restriction enzymes are inhibited and DNA is protected.
When the temperature is high, restriction enzymes are produced and DNA is digested.
Thermoinduction means using a change in temperature to cause a biological change to the system. One way this can be done is by increasing temperatures of the system. Thermal denaturation will occur and this results in a decrease in  binding efficiency of the substrate with the enzyme. This will induce the intended biological change.
  About the thermoinduction system.
Relevance to our project
We made use of thermoinduction in Module 3 – genome deletion.
Thermoinduction is used to start genome deletion when sufficient drug protein of interest has been produced, and encapsulation is complete. Genome deletion is induced by manually raising the temperatures from 28°C to 42°C. In our case, we have used BBa_K098995 (Harvard 2008). This BioBrick consists of the heat sensitive cI857 with a strong promoter. This temperature sensitive cI857 protein repressor, has a significantly decreased binding efficiency with the cI promoter between 35°C to 42°C. This would cause de-repression of the pLambda promoter. Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI will be produced. They are the ones who carry out DNA restriction, and cause cell death.

What will we contribute with?
Apart from confirming the work done by iGEM Stockholm 2015, we will also elaborate on the work by testing the activity at more bacterial concentrations. While 2015 proved that the activity of the promoter is completely EnvZ dependent and that expression of the downstream gene is increased at rising osmotic pressure, they only tested this at one OD measurement (OD 0.3). We will further characterize the BioBrick by investigating the activity throughout the growth curve. In addition to using the same sucrose gradient as iGEM Stockholm 2015, we will also use a salt gradient with lower concentrations of NaCl, investigating if this will improve the results of iGEM UCL 2015.

Among the constituents, mucins belong to a class of large, heterogeneous, and heavily glycosylated proteins (figure 1). The protein backbone of a mucin is covered with chains of O-linked glycans, which are polysaccharides bound by an oxygen to the protein. The mucins’ glycans prevents protein-protein interaction, forcing the backbone to extend itself. The extended conformation of the mucin enables a larger contact area for glycans to"

Some groups of students were very engaged in the Ethics station, but some groups remained reticent and difficult to engage.
The course director praised the carousel format of the lessons but stated that there could be “more space for informal conversations between summer school students and undergraduates.""
Modifications in light of the feedback:
We adapted the workshop stations to include a more simple outline and introduction and we made sure we adapted our explanations to suit the level of knowledge of each individual in the group.
We reduced some of the content in the initial introductory activity to allow for more time to partake in group activities.
We created more specific questions to prompt quieter groups to start discussing specific aspects of the ethical issues created by each scenario.
We adapted one of our computer-based stations to a discussion-based station (see below).
In light of this feedback, we chose to change one of the computer-based activities (the Snapgene station) to a discussion-based activity that focused on problem solving. In line with ERASynBio’s recommendations that synthetic biology teaching should equip young people with “skills to operate effectively in multi-disciplinary teams”, we focused a station on problem solving involving a range of different STEM disciplines. Attendees of the summer schools had a range of scientific backgrounds and interests, so we encouraged conversations between individuals studying different subjects to develop young people’s ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams. This set up - where team members contribute knowledge on their own area of expertise -  mimicked conversations that occur within multi-disciplinary teams, such as our own iGEM team, and provided young people to develop the “flexible thinking” required for a career in synthetic biology.
Science outreach activities targeting younger school children are necessary to encourage young people to gain an interest in science and consider a career in synthetic biology. We delivered a lesson on synthetic biology and its applications to 13-15-year-old students attending summer schools in Oxford. The presentation for the lesson can be viewed here:

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Basic circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html,"utive promoter J23119 controls the transcription of GlsA. The function of glsA will be activated under acidic environment and it will play a critical role in ensuring bacteria’s survival with the anticipation of glutamine (Gln). The activity of GlsA will be repressed when the environmental pH is below 6.0. The dependence on pH makes it a suitable tool to respond necessarily.
Fig.10 The gene circuits of acid resistance device
○ Experiment Results
Firstly, we cloned the gene GlsA through PCR from the genome of E.coli str. K-12, and constructed it on the vector pSB1C3 as a standard part(Fig.11).
Fig.11 The construction result of GlsA
Adding sequences through designing primers, the promoter J23119, strong RBS B0034 and our functional gene GlsA are combined together. Then we transformed it into E.coli BMTOP10, and selected positive strain from them (Fig.12). We have measured the sequence of No.10 and it turns out to be completely right.
Fig.12 The construction result of JBG (J23119+B0034+GlsA)
After the construction of acid-resistance circuit, we measured the OD600 under different pH to test the efficacy of acid resistance. The growth curve is shown in Fig.13
Fig.13 The growth curve of experimental group(JBG) and control
The difference between the testing group and the control group is not evident. We employed a strong promoter T7 to check whether the protein has been expressed. The functional gene GlsA was constructed on plasmid pET28a and the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3). 0.5% IPTG was added to induce the expression of the protein. The following is the picture of SDS-PAGE (Fig.14). It shows that our target protein has been expressed successfully.

Asr promoter
Asr promoter belongs to asr gene encoding acid-shock RNA. It is a pH-responsive promoter native to E.coli which induces transcription in acidic environment from pH 4.0 ~ 5.0 , and shows low activity at a neutral pH[15]. This year, we chose asr promoter as the base of pH regulation system.

Tsinghua,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.
Highlighting the biological significance of dimerization
Dimerization is only too common in cells. Monomers assembly into dimers for further functions all the time, some interactions strong, some interactions weak. Function-less newborn peptides piece together and get to work, forming so-called tertiary structure; activated kinases reach each other and mutually phosphorylate; transcription factors, when forming homo- or hetero-dimers according to different stoichiometry, leads to varied"

They are able to tolerate deadily UV radiation and osmotic rays [18] , as well as the almost complete dehydration by switching to ‘anhydrobiotic state’, which confer resistance towards various environmental extremes.
What’s worth mentioning is that, anhydrobiotic ability is observed in various invertebrates, tardigrades, arthropods, and nematodes [14] . Trehalose are suggested to have an important role mediating desiccation resistance in anhydrobiotic organisms, however, the accumulation of trehalose is observed when the last two phylum subjected to desiccation, but not in tardigrades [15,16] . With further searching, we noticed that tardigrades’ anhydrobiotic ability are mediated by a rather novel class of protein called TDPs (tardigrades intrinsically disorded proteins)----the protein that our iGEM team is currently focusing on.
About our project
a) Inspiration
Every year, iGEM competition motivates teams from all over the world to devise numerous great project, genetically engineered organisms are designed to serve in wide range of fields. However, when it comes to application, the regulation of gene expression is not the only rising issue, but also the resilience of these engineered organisms that we need to concern. For example, some team’s bacteria have to work in dessert with extremely low water content( .ref ), or when cell components are freeze dried on the test paper to make a paper based biosensor, the system must undergo severe dehydration for storage and transport, and this would probably hamper their effectiveness during work.( .ref ). Our investigationfor the 2016 iGEM projects showed that over 299 entries, x% engineered organisms are facing practical issues related with extreme working conditions or environmental stress. As a consequence, team SIAT-SCIE is focusing on how we can transform the resilience of tardigrades into the engineered organisms. Increasing their efficiency during work and gives them greater potential to be put into real practice.
b) What are we doing?
Our first goal is to test whether TDPs can provide desiccation resistance for enzyme in vitro.
Secondly, we transfer our designed plasmid into DH5α and express TDP in vivo to see if it can confer desiccation resistance, by comparing the engineered strain with the E. coli that didn’t express the TDP gene. Hence a protection mechanism is developed, which can facilitate other iGEM teams engineered organisms to work efficiently.

We have also spent a considerable amount of time brainstorming the process flow: starting from the feces production and collection and finishing with the PHB extraction and purification. The goal of these discussions was to determine the main stages in the process and ensure all members of process development sub-group envision the process the same way. We have also discussed the milestones related to each stage of the process and created a timeline.
VFA extraction from synthetic feces protocols were created, a new synthetic feces recipe was chosen and all the required laboratory supplies were purchased to test those protocols next week. We have also found a sponsor for the PHB samples - PolyFerm Canada has kindly agreed to send us a couple of hundred grams of PHB powder to test the PHB extraction procedures and to use as a standard.
Week 12: July 17-21
This week, the engineering team worked on three major project components: VFA separation from synthetic feces laboratory experiments, VFA quantification titration experiments and the HPLC experiments.
Titration is the industry employed method for continuous testing for the overall VFA concentration in the solution. It is based on the acid-base chemistry: the sample is titrated to the specified endpoints with sulfuric acid and the VFA concentration is found using a formula based on the amount of acid consumed to reach the endpoint. This method worked when the standards of 1mM acetic acid and 1mM of acetic, propionic and butyric (1:1:1) acids were tested. The titration method was then tested on synthetic poop supernatant and the total VFA concentration of about 80mM was found, which is in line with the range of VFA present in the human fees.
Four experiments were conducted to test different VFA separation methods: simple filtration, settlement, centrifugation, and pressure-filtration. It was found that pressure filtration is the most efficient way of recovering liquid from synthetic feces. However, it required quite a lot of pressure and didn’t seem to be the most feasible solution for the solid human waste on Mars. So another experiment was conducted where a staged filtration approach was used - the feces passed through a series of filters which gradually decreased in size. The recovery past 0.2-micron filter was very small"

Heeeyy!!  Today is digestion day! We’ll digest Bioremediation Biobrick with EcoRI and XbaI to linearize, and the Essential Biobrick with EcoRI and SpeI  to release the insert need. We used the following system:
The digestion lasted 2 horas at 37°C.  The amount used in the gel was 10ul for each sample and 40 ul  was  kept  frozen at -20°C  to be purified later.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick not  digested
2. Bioremediation Biobrick digested with EcoRI and XbaI
3. Essential Biobrick not digested
4. EssentialBiobrick digested withEcoRI and SpeI
♥ OMG!!It looks so pretty! ♥
Analysing the profile we concluded that  sample number 2 is linearized (and pretty!) and that sample number 4 released a fragment of 1.234  base pairs (even prettier!).
We ran the rest of the micro liters from the digestion (40ul)  in another gel just to get the DNA  purified.
We isolated the DNA we wanted through agarose gel  0,8%  and purified it. After we analyzed the purification, the electrophoretic profile of the samples of Bioremediation  Biobrick  digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the Essential Biobrick digested with   EcoRI and SpeI.  We applied 10ul of the sample in 0,8%  agarose gel.
Electrophoretical profile of the samples, digested and purified:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick linearized with EcoRI and XbaI
2. EssentialBiobrick digested with EcoRI and SpeI.
We could analyze through  the electrophoretical profile that the samples have the size we were looking for!!! Unfortunately,  we lost a"

The level of fluorescence detected will correspond to the stress experienced by the cell, in this case, the basal stress level and that induced by the module itself.
b, The stress reporter module was co-transformed with a synthetic construct in which GFP was constitutively expressed. The higher fluorescence level detected in b as compared to a would be due to stress induced by GFP expression.
c, As with b, the investigation of the stress induced by our constructs was done by co-transforming them with the stress reporter module. The de novo plasmid (see: Figure 5, De novo Biosynthesis ) is the construct illustrated here.
Using this part, we were able to quantify the level of stress induced by GFP production by measuring the fluorescence level, thus demonstrating proof of concept (Figure 11b). Our constructs were subsequently tested and shown to impose a substantial metabolic burden (Figure 11c). Characterization of the PhtpG1 promoter will hopefully pave the way for stress regulation and the ensuing optimization of the bioproduction process.
CLOSE
CELL-MACHINE INTERFACE
Biomanufacturing involves the introduction of synthetic constructs often with the aim of maximizing flux towards heterologous pathways, placing tremendous burden on cells,  attenuating their growth and curtailing their production (see: Stress Reporter ). Cells’ natural propensity to grow and multiply is thus directly in conflict with synthetic biologists’ desire to maximize their production.
However, prioritization of both growth and production could conceivably be accomplished using dynamic control. This separates fermentation into two phases: a growth phase where cells are cultivated to high densities, followed by a production phase where expression of non-native pathways takes place [27]. Dynamic control can be achieved through these means - chemical induction, autoregulation, and computer-assisted feedback control. As compared to the other two, computer-assisted feedback control is tunable, versatile, modular - it is easier to incorporate additional modules e.g. nutrient- and substrate-sensing module s[28], can perform more complex logic, and places less metabolic burden on the cell. These advantages that comes with giving control over to the user will only become more significant as our system scales up.
Computer-assisted feedback control enjoys a particularly excellent synergy with optogenetics, as light sources are easily programmed to turn on/off. However, using light to control transcription remains a challenge in itself. Even state-of-the art methods are unable to simultaneously achieve precision and repeatability, nor can they withstand changing operating culture conditions [29]. Furthermore, based on"

Then we did the transformation as the normal protocol.

We did the plasmid backbone recovery and competent cell efficiency test, but we failed. We also picked up several colonies on the first ligation and transformation plate and incubate it in LB broth medium, but we also failed. We thought it’s due to the low efficiency of 3A assembly, so we changed our plan to traditional assembly: cut and recover chromoprotein from digested system and ligate it into RBS backbone.
For the molar ration, most chromoprotein is 700bp long and the RBS backbone is 2100bp long. If we want the molar ratio of chromoprotein:RBS backbone = 3:1, we should add exact same mass of chromoprotein and RBS backbone.
9.23~9.25
We failed again
No colony formed again. We thought the most likely reason is our competent cells. So we try to repeat the experiments again with the competent cells of our teacher’s.
9.26~9.28
Fortunately, 8 plates we incubate grew out many colonies, and we picked up single colonies from each plate to amplify and extract the plasmids. Then we did enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis to verify the results.
From the result we could see that all plasmids except for B31+K11 are constructed successfully.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#Networks_-_-_TEXT.html," and methods needed to contextualize the data.
Download the 2015 iGEM Collaboration Dataset here!
Definitions:
The University of Waterloo iGEM Policy and Practices team researched network collaborations of 2015 data, and interpreted how each team’s collaboration affected their finishing result. In this codebook, the Waterloo iGEM team will have clear definitions on what a significant collaboration is, what a registered iGEM team is, and what a team wiki is.
Significant: In iGEM, the idea of significance plays a vital role in determining the validity of contributions and how medal criteria is met.  A contribution is significant if it betters a project or a team, ultimately contributing towards its advancement.  That being said, significance is also largely subjective because what a judge may see as beneficial, another may see as too passive of an effort to qualify.
Medal Criteria: The 2016 iGEM judging handbook explains the reasoning behind medal criteria and the variations of criteria depending on factors such as member age and track.  It states that there are different medal requirements for Standard Tracks (High School teams included) and Special Tracks.  Rather than standard motivations of competition where teams are competing against each other, iGEM teams are ultimately competing against themselves as they strive to meet criteria, with different criteria translating to the attainment of different medals.  While many medal criteria can be assessed by following static wiki page links found in the judging forms, it is also the team’s responsibility to convince judges that they have met criteria.
All iGEM teams are required to deliver a team wiki, poster, presentation, project attribution, registry part pages, sample submissions, safety forms, and a judging form.  Additionally, teams must follow all Laboratory Safety Rules, adhere to the Responsible Conduct Committee’s Conduct Policy, be intellectually honest, and treat everyone with respect throughout the duration of the competition, as well as contribute positively to society.
Registered Team: iGEM teams range greatly in size, origin, and member age.  They tend to consist primarily of undergraduate students from accredited postsecondary institutions, but teams can also be composed of high school students or lab members of the greater community.  iGEM HQ recommends teams to be gender-balanced and have between 8 and 15 members.  It also compares iGEM teams to sports teams in that all members have different roles and responsibilities.  The 3 team sections are Undergraduate, Overgraduate, and High School.
Team Wiki: Wiki pages provide teams with a space to communicate their project to others and make a case for how they have met criteria.  The general requirements"

2.3 MAKING THE CONSTRUCT WITH RFC 53
Figure 9: Making the Construct: Parts were sequenced into PUC57, digested and ligated into PSB1C3.
Figure 9 is a flow chart of the general work flow involved in the construction of our experimental plasmid, as per RFC53 conventions.
1) The insert is isolated through a series of enzyme digestions. One intron (in blue) is shown here as a representation. The insert is isolated for subsequent ligation.
2) Similarly, the pSB1C3 vector is isolated through enzyme digestion. Note that ""N"" indicates that this is the vector portion. The vector is also isolated for the ligation step. It must also be noted that pSB1C3 vector contains a cut site of SacI, an enzyme that is used in RFC 53. Relocating the part in BBa_K371053 resolves this issue.
3) The two components (insert and vector) are ligated together to produce the final construct.
4) According to the experimental design, the final construct will contain self-excising ribozymes, which in the last step result in a non-disruptive ligation scar and, therefore, the expression of GFP.
2.3 Preliminary Testing
Although completion of a preliminary version of the final construct was achieved, lack of GFP fluorescence proved suspicion of questionable band placements during second and third stage electrophoresis. Final diagnostic digestion reaction confirmed abnormalities from designed constructs. Testing via digestion was completed for every intermediate, control and final constructs. Consequently, BBa_K576003, K576004, K576005, and K576006 were the only parts able to be confirmed. All the other intermediates and constructs have questionable band location which disrupted final construct fluorescence.
Figure 10: shows the diagnostic digestion from September 16, 2011: All subclones shown to be correct, however, positive control not correct. Relative placement of GFPs and INTS required further verification and showed incorrect placement. This accounts for lack of fluorescence in final stage.
The above electrophoresis picture describes the resultant bands from the diagnostic digestion. Although bands 5, 6 and 7 (sub clones) have been confirmed, the adjacent positive control (band 8) and all GFP and intron digestions are not consistent with the expected patterns. The GFP-INT and GFP-INT-lox constructions (bands 9, 10 and 11) have been verified as inaccurate."

shTERT
BBa_K1722001
shTERT is short for super human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is improved from hTERT promoter( BBa_K404106 ), a cancer specific promoter. Three base pairs in hTERT promoter were mutated and the drive efficiency of the promoter was verified to be increased significantly.
Rluc(with TAG)
BBa_K1722005
The Rluc was improved from BBa_J52012 ,which was being amber mutated.It can be transcripted to an mRNA chain with one codon being mutated to stop codon UAG. It cannot be fully expressed in natural biology system but can be used as a reporter gene in unnatural amino acid orthogonal system which has a tRNA whose anticodon can pair with the stop codon.
SV40(with Enhancer)
BBa_K1722006
Different from the SV40 promoter distributed by iGEM13_Freiburg( BBa_K1150011 ), the promoter we are submitting this year includes an enhancer sequence(74bp) upstream of the promoter gene. It is a widely used strong promoter that can improve the gene expression level of many host cells. the therapeutic gene out.

We cutchecked our plasmid DNAs that we got from our isolation for controlling of cloning second time with using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes.
WESTERN BLOTTING
After we cloned our genes to pET-45b vector successfully then we did Western-Bloting for showing our proteins are synthesized with using the His-tag on the N-terminal of our proteins
SOFT AGAR PLUG ASSAY
For understanding that our proteins that produced are functional or not, we performed a chemotaxis motility assay which is called Agar Plug Assay.
We chose 2 different points on the soft agars that have 2 cm distance between them.We put the filter paper that is immersed in specially prepared liquid culture on the first point and then we put another filter paper that immersed in 0.2 mM HCL solution on the second point. Then we incubated our bacteria on 30C and examined their growing process on plates
The results are below
Increased Motility
In this section, the basic goal of the parts that we are using is to ensure that E. Coli can move from the acidic pH of the stomach fluid into the basic pH of the thick mucus layer and be able to move around within this area with ease. In this manner, the bacteria will have reached the region of the stomach where Helicobacter pylori is found. . Unlike normal fluids, the mucus layer is very thick and the flagella of natural E. Coli does not have sufficient torque or speed to allow it to enter.. In this project, we aim to give E. Coli the ability to enter the stomach’s mucus layer by increasing both of these characteristics. In order to achieve this goal, we plan to use 2 different strategies. . First, we will use a knock-out mutant form (HNS T108I) of the NHS transcription factor found in E. Coli.  This mutant form has been shown to have a positive effect on the speed and torque of the flagella. The difference between the normal NHS and mutant NHS is a single amino acid change from threonine to isoleucine at residue 108 of the protein.
As for the second strategy to reach this goal, we aim to increase the torque power and flagellar speed by replacing the MotA and MotB proteins which make up E. Coli’s rotor (they form a H+ channel) with proteins PotB59"

Safety/accidents:
We have considered the implications of an accident, or incident occurring with relation to our project. For example we considered what may happen if a spillage were to occur, and the damaging effect this could have on the environment. The antibiotic resistant plasmid we are using could potentially be transferred to other organisms in the environment, passing on drug resistance. We also considered how biological waste from the production of the fragrant compounds would need to be handled correctly to ensure safety.
Tourism:
Many people are attracted to areas of natural beauty when on holiday, and this brings in valuable income for many people who rely on the tourism industry. Removing many areas of land that are currently planted with a variety of flowers may have a damaging effect on this industry in some areas.
Economic damage to third world countries:
Loss of crop sales in poorer countries, and the moving of the production of fragrance compounds from poorer countries to first world countries could have a damaging impact on the economy of some third world countries. This could result in a greater gap between the economies of first and third world countries.

Simon Langton Girls Grammar School
As part of the human practices we went to a local school: Simon Langton Girls Grammar School where we interacted with students between the ages 15-18. We gave a 30 minute presentation to explain synthetic biology, iGEM and the basis of our project, followed by a short question-answer session. Additionally we discussed life at university in terms of academic daily routines.
The students were very interested in synthetic biology and were keen to know more. They asked us about our results, a day in the lab as part of the iGEM team, and the techniques we used. Some students were keen on suggesting ideas such as the
- 'synthesis of Nicotine using bacteria.'
-'synthesis of oestrogen.'

Our iGEM team is highly diverse in terms of age, interests and scientific experience. To push these norms and the element of teaching, we adopted three elite high school students onto our team. They all study at Bagsværd Kostskole og Gymnasium, being a collaborating partner with the DTU Systems Biology. With a background of biotechnology, they became an active part of the team. Importantly for their development, they got involved in diverse activities, such as brainstorming sessions, workshops, and technical- and practical tasks in the laboratory. Moreover, they shared their experience and knowledge about the DTU iGEM project by giving a lecture to broader audience at their school. 
 
Contributions, experiences and thought of reflections
The best way to understand the extent of their participation is to read their own personal accounts so we asked them before joining our team, and after a maturation period of months of intense work. They were asked: What do you want to learn by taking part in iGEM? Why do you want to participate?
""I hope to get some academic knowledge, which primarily is the reason why I want to participate. But I’m also looking forward to following the process from idea to product and to experience the atmosphere in a group of passionate people. MAJA (format this to quote). I would love to see how a research project goes from all the way from being just an idea to being realised and presented. I would also like to become much more comfortable in a lab."" Thea
“As a high school student, being a part of the DTU iGEM project has been a challenging, educational, and worthwhile experience. It has given me the opportunity to become acquainted with a new field within science - synthetic biology - which is rarely given attention in school. But this project has not only taught me scientific things; it has given me a lesson that I can use in other contexts as well. I have learned that Google isn’t the answer to everything – using your brain, analysing and discussing your mistakes with team mates sometimes provides greater results. Furthermore, this project has made me even more aware of the importance of patience and perseverance while doing research – piecing pieces of knowledge together takes time and so does lab work. It has been a fun process which I’m looking forward to seeing the result of in Boston!” Maja

Amsterdam
Amsterdam is our most significant collaboration. We skyped together early in the summer and realized that both of our projects had an important connection. The Amsterdam iGEM team worked on making E. coli to produce fumarate, which reduces methane emissions in cattle when fed in certain doses. As a result, the UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team and the Amsterdam iGEM team joined forces to come up with a way to reduce methane emissions. Methane emissions have a huge impact on climate change. UNL and Amsterdam explored the possibilities of feeding fumarate to cattle in order to reduce methane emissions. We can conclude that fumarate is a promising molecule for this application. The result of our collaboration is shown below.
On top of this, Amsterdam was also able to give us comments on our safety case page. Using their suggestions, we further modified our information. Their comments are found below.
“Introduction:
The introduction is actually very clear, it is well written and raises ‘the need’ very well.
Safety Case Units and Structure:
This part is clear as well, except for the actual meaning of a diamond. I don’t see a diamond anywhere. Also the last line of this part could use an extra figure, in which you can see the standard form of what every safety case must have. Actually this is figure 4. I might place it a bit up.
Modularity of Safety Cases for iGEM:
Smart idea. However did you consider the statement: ‘could help change the views of those still skeptical of the safety involved in synthetic biology’ This makes it sound like the safety case is meant to change people's mind instead of making synthetic biology safer. Implicitly saying that the concerns of these people are invalid, I don’t think you want to go into this, since it is quite sensitive. Maybe just leave this sentence out.”
Above is a picture showcasing our successful skype session with the Amsterdam iGEM team.

We collaborated with Methungeny about safety cases and general research questions. They posed us a question about their experiment, and we gave them suggestions on how they could solve their problem.

Enhanced GFP is a modified version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) derived from Aequorea victoria with enhanced fluorescence properties. These enhanced fluorescent properties of the eGFP dramatically improved the spectral characteristics of GFP, resulting in increased fluorescence.
The part was cloned into the expression vector pJAM1786 in E. coli, by using the Gateway system. Colony PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to ensure the insert was in the vector (shown in the seven leftmost lanes of the figure 5 below).
Figure 5: Colony PCR and gel electrophoresis was performed to ensure the insert was in the vector. The figure shows clear bands at around the expected size of 800 bp.
The restreaks of those seven colonies were inoculated into liquid culture and grown overnight alongside three E. coli cultures containing an empty plasmid (pBBR1MCS-2). Fluorescence was measured in an opaque ELISA reader plate.
The mean values of the fluorescence can be found in the table (Tab.2) below. Standard error for both groups (Total SE) was assessed using a Satterthwaite approximation.
Table 2: Showing fluorescence measurements on eGFP.
All dilution showed significantly more fluorescence than the control cultures except for the 50X dilution. The mean of the difference to the control cultures is shown as a function of dilution below (Fig.6).
Figure 6: Plot of the fluorescence of eGFP in relation to a negative control.
To further show the expression and functionality of our eGFP a western blot with an anti-GFP antibody was carried out (Fig. 7).
Figure 7: Western Blot analysis of transformed E.coli cultures with anti-GFP antibody. Shows expected band of eGFP next to the positive control sample (GFP)
The western blot shows the expected band for eGFP at around 32,7 kDa and next to the GFP sample that was used as positive control. Thereby supporting the authenticity of the protein.
As a next step E.coli cultures carrying the eGFP construct were observed under the confocal microscope for fluorescence (Fig.8).

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," business world as a whole, we must first understand what kind of an impact it will have on specific sectors. The goal of the industry analysis was to pick specific industries that we felt would be heavily impacted by the emergence of synthetic biology and attempted to understand their current situation as well as opportunities and threats facing each industry.
Biofuel Industry
The oil industry has become an integral part of the society we live in for, transportation, food, healthcare, and communication. However, there is a dire need for alternative sources of energy and the world is beginning to turn towards biofuels for support in this area. Although there is immense promise in this area there is also many challenges to overcome such as reliance on environmental factors and adequate feedstocks. Although emergence of biofuels created through synthetic biology does not have the market potential to shift the whole method of biofuel production, politicians are optimistic that it has the potential to make an impact and have therefore taken measures to support the infrastructure of its’ development. The emergence of a viable synthetic biology biofuel would serve to excel the development of synthetic biology, particularly on the business stage.
Pharmaceutical Industry
Our knowledge of diseases and treatments has advanced to an exciting point as has society’s perception of health problems and issues. However, as fast as our knowledge advances, diseases like H1N1 and HIV provide a pressure for the pharmaceutical industry to advance further and faster. In addition, aging populations and growing urban centres poise pharmaceutical companies for significant and meaningful innovation over the coming decades. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow to an $800 billion industry by 2011, expanding as a global force. Thus, synthetic biology, although faced with challenges in terms of legal and social concerns, is poised to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Not only is there promise for curative treatments that would change how we view illnesses like HIV, there promises to be significant implications in the social, technological, and political realms. Unanswered questions about the handling of intellectual property issues will challenge the development of synthetic biology in the pharmaceutical industry as will ethical, safety, and political issues.
Bio-remediation Industry
Unlike other industries, bio-remediation is an industry that has incorporated the use of genetic engineering and synthetic biology since the 1970’s. Based on the research conducted, there is a definitive understanding that this field poses an optimistic approach in achieving results that are environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The major setback with the field of bio-remediation is the intricacy of the techniques that are involved. Aside from the general publics qualms about bio-remediation procedures, even"

As a result, a group of experiments from module 2 was changed to use GFP as an indicator of successful communication between IODs. The use of color indication in the further research proved advantageous (at least partially), and the use of color indicators will always be considered in later experiments.
A recommendation was made to test the agglutination on a slide. As a result, since we had the possibility to perform our experiments in microfluidics, we listened to this advice and used microfluidics as well as microscope slides in our agglutination experiments.

Multinational general public vs. biologists GMO survey
Team Chalmers Gothenburg offered us to participate in their GMO survey. We asked 63 biologists and 50 respondents from the general public to fill in the survey. Same thing was done in Sweden. Thanks to this, we had the opportunity to compare GMO knowledge in Sweden and Czech Republic. Big thanks belongs to the team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of all data.
Key outputs
The positive attitude and further interest of many respondents delighted us.
However, although anticipated, the difference in opinions between biologists and the general public is disturbing. On that account, we are going to arrange more lectures about synthetic biology at our university and also for the general public in Czech Republic.

Safety
We did not only wholeheartedly followed standard lab safety techniques and complied with the national GMO laboratory regulations but also considered the broader safety assumptions of our technology. We discussed our idea with non-biological specialists as well as experts, which enabled us to improve the design and get a better grasp of the notion our project idea transmits.
