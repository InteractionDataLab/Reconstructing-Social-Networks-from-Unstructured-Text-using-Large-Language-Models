Wageningen_UR,2014,Team:Wageningen UR#overview#solution_-_-_TEXT.html," be simple, regulations concerning an engineered soil bacterium for bio-control are complex and different in most countries. With the current regulations in Europe, for example, application of BananaGuard would not be possible in the near future. Luckily, however, our main target area, South America and Asia have far less stringent rules about the use of GMO products. Combining the acceptance of GMO bacteria in most banana producing countries and maintaining availability of a “GMO free” banana makes our product a strong candidate for introduction into the global market.
As inter-species diversity in commercially-grown crops decreases resistance to pathogens will become weaker. Even though it will not be as dramatic as is the case with bananas, crops will become less diverse and therefore weaker against threats. Fusarium ssp. has been known to also infect other crops such as wheat, cucumbers and tomatoes. If successful, our system could be rapidly changed to work with other crops or even other fungi. By combining the modularity and rapid modification time possible in bacteria but not plants, our system can be an efficient way to safeguard the crops of the future.

Motivation
At the beginning of our project planning phase we were thinking about how to deal with the wiki. One major shortcoming showed up when we were browsing the wikis of previous iGEM competitions - a lot of them simply didn't work anymore.
The problem is that large parts of the old wikis are stored on external servers - e.g. JavaScript menus that are stored on students' private homepages.
A good example for this is last year's ETH team wiki:
As you can see, the .js file is stored on an external server. As soon as this file is gone, the whole wiki page won't work anymore, because the navigation is gone. And if you browse through wikis of even earlier years, you can see that this has already happened to a lot of pages.
This year's situation
When we then started to think of ways how to design the wiki, it turned out that the people responsible for this wiki are aware of the situation - embedding external content into a wiki page did not seem to work anymore.
While this solved the problem of missing content, it gave rise to a new problem. Wiki syntax is very simple and therefore easy to handle. While this appears as a benefit when editing pages, it goes along with a lack of flexibility concerning design- or a lot of work if you want to have a nice design anyways. The wiki syntax makes it harder to separate design and content - like it is the case for our wiki page right now. Since we have a lot of people responsible for the content and only few work on the design, we agreed on editing pages like this:
<!-- PUT THE PAGE CONTENT AFTER THIS LINE. THANKS :) -->
your text goes here
<!-- PUT THE PAGE CONTENT BEFORE THIS LINE. THANKS :) -->
How to overcome this situation
While the reasons why external content should not be allowed on the wiki were obvious, we still didn't want to settle with ""just"" using the regular wiki editing. Therefore, we had the idea to use some kind of software to overcome the shortcomings listed above. We wanted to introduce a ""middle"

Introduction
Biosurfactant - Rhamnolipid
PCB Degradation
Future Directions
Abstract
     Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread, cancer-causing pollutants left-over mainly from manufacture of capacitors and electric motors. There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.
Motivation
     From 1955 to 1987 in Pickens, South Carolina (the neighboring town to Clemson, SC) Sangamo-Weston Inc. had multiple factories, where they built capacitors. The dielectric fluid used in these capacitors contained Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). Due to improper land-burial of off-specification capacitors and wastewater treatment sludges that were built both on-site and off-site, PCBs contaminated the water supply of Lake Hartwell and its tributaries. Since PCBs have low water solubility, they remain mostly in the organic sediments and as particulate matter. Furthermore, PCB sediment concentrations are within the range of injury for benthic macroinvertabrates and exceed healthy levels in the fish of Lake Hartwell – an 87.5 square mile recreational lake that serves both South Carolina and Georgia areas.
 
Introduction
     Overall, our project goal is to create a three-component bacterial system: signaling, biosurfactant, and PCB degradation. First"

However, Cyanothece 51142, a non-heterocyst, fixes nitrogen in the same cell as photosynthesis by relying on a circadian metabolic process, when there is less oxygen byproduct from photosynthesis. This process is both fascinating and necessary since the key enzyme in nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase, is poisoned by oxygen. Our goal this summer is to engineer the regulation of the proteins necessary for nitrogen fixation so that they are highly repressed when activated by broad spectrum light (such as the sun), and are highly active when there is no light around, mimicking the cycle where photosynthesis occurs during the day and nitrogen fixation occurs at night.

-Pipette 4 mL sterile LB/CM into four 14 mL culture tubes, R0010-RFP (in BL21 and MG1655) and K314100-RFP (in BL21 and MG1655). Also pipette 4 mL sterile                                   LB to two 14 mL cultures tubes, wild type BL21 and MG1655
-Place the cap on the culture tubes to the first position to allow aeration.
-Place the tubes into the incubator and allow them to grow overnight (16 hours) at 37 deg C and 250 RPM
Next day...
-Make frozen stock for all cultures grown
-Measure OD at 600 nm in cuvettes for each culture (OD O/N) (900 uL water and 100 uL culture well mixed)
-Dilute cultures to OD of 0.1 in a total of 4 mL fresh LB/antibiotic (just LB for the BL21 and MG1655) in new 14 mL culture tubes
-Volume of overnight culture = (0.1*4)/(OD overnight)
-Volume of LB/antibiotic (just LB if negative control) = 4mL - V overnight
-Incubate 2 hours at 37 deg C and 250 rpm
-While waiting for the incubation to complete, label eighteen 15 mL conicals, cm-1 through cm-9 and wt-1 through wt-9 to create 5x dilutions.
-Add 10 mL LB and 10 μL cm to conical cm-9.

The reaction involves two enzymes                                 paticipating - glpk and glpD. We assume that the reaction concentration of these two enzymes                                 is 0.01 mM, assuming that the initial [Gly] concentration is 10 mM, the initial concentration                                 of ATP 10 mM, The concentration of Gly-3-p 0 mM and the concentration of DHAP 0 mM at the                                 same time.
In this reaction, we make the following assumptions about our model:
1. The ATP of the E.coil system is given externally completely, assuming that the culture                                 conditions given externally are sufficient and ATP maintains a stable constant.
2. Assume that the substrate involved in the reaction does not participate in other reactions.
In order to determine the yield of the target product, we chose to observe the efficiency                                 of the DHAP yield estimation system in view of the lack of basic ceaS2 enzyme data.
We can observe that the DHAP stops growing close to 50 minutes.
Then, we need to test the carbon pathway through the modified pathway, And add a metabolic                                 pathway enzyme-catalyzed by GlyDH enzyme and DAK in the original path, while the need for                                 NOX enzyme and CAT enzyme from the role of NAD + supplement, resulting in DHA, and finally                                 Phosphorylation produces DHAP.
metabolic flow after the transformation of the reaction model. According to the actual situation                                 of the reaction, we make the following assumptions:
1. In the reaction , due to the process of hydrogen peroxide to the production of O2, that                                 is, the process of generating acceptor, is faster, we will regard the reaction of NOX enzyme                                 NADH catalytic as an ordinary Michael's equation, rather than ordered sequence reaction.
2. Random pairs of sequence reactions and ordered sequence reaction equations are identical.                                 So we substrate which is identified as the [A] substrate depending on the integrity of the                                 data.
Metabolic pathways after transformation
We can see that the rate of DHAP is faster after changing the metabolic pathway, which means                                 that the higher the output per unit time after being put in use, the sooner the reaction                                 is done. Compared to the pre-improved pathway ,the reaction finishes roughly five minutes ahead.
Sensitive analysis
In the previous pathway study, we noted that the Kcat values of glpK and GlyDH enzymes are                                 unknown (we do not have a large deviation in the absence of a"

We know Varroa-specific miticidal activity exists in Bacillus thuringiensis and related species, as shown in: ""In vitro susceptibility of Varroa destructor and Apis mellifera to native strains of Bacillus thuringiensis.""  by Alquisira-Ramírez et al. 2 In this paper, several isolates are described that cause a mite mortality of up to 100%. Importantly, the strains also showed no miticidal activity against bee larvae. Because of this we started several sub-projects in parallel to maximize our chances of finding a viable V. destructor-killer. The specificity part of our project focuses on creating V. destructor-gut binding Cry toxins and finding V. destructor-specific miticidal proteins.
There already exists a publication about a tool called “Bt Toxin Scanner” 3 . This tool does not fully support local deployment, which is needed for high-throughput analysis. Also, because of the relatively basic analysis done by the tool, we decided to develop our own tool that is fully open-source and improves upon the analysis techniques used in Bt Toxin Scanner. Our goal with this tool is to run raw sequencing files, and deliver potential Cry proteins with just the click of a button.
This tool was made in preparation for results of the latter, finding V. destructor-specific miticidal proteins, which we assume to be of the Cry protein family.  These Cry proteins are a diverse group, but are known to be highly specific for individual insects, acari, nematodes and various other eukaryotic taxa. Cry proteins are not necessarily a group of proteins that all perform the same function in the same manner. The distinction between Cry and non-Cry proteins is defined by a committee: Cry Protein website Based on 45% sequence similarity there are over 70 groups. This high amount of diversity makes it hard to predict when something is or isn't a Cry protein. Despite this diversity, many of them have the same three domain structure. The N-terminal domain I is involved in membrane insertion and pore formation, while domains II and III are involved in receptor recognition and binding to them.
Testing the tool

As Told by Emily Hicks
Overview
From June 14th to 17th Patrick and Emily attended Synthetic Biology 5.0, the 5th International conference on Synthetic Biology, at Stanford University in Pal Alto, California.  The first day started with the 1st annual SynBio Slam, where participants each had 5 minutes to share their ideas on synthetic biology.  There were talks on subjects as diverse as education, synthetic biology art and even some poetry!
Places, Posters, and People
From there started 3 days of intense talks and poster sessions.  Presenters were from around the world and subjects ranged from photosynthetic eukaryotic cells to electrochemical E. Coli cells.  Highlights included a talk by Steve Benner on GATCZP: the use of synthetic base pairs to make new amino acids and a presentation from Pamela Silver on photosynthetic organisms.
Our own team presented their poster from last year's iGEM project, which featured a toolkit to detect problems in protein expression.  On the second night was a trip to the NASA Aimes center for a night to talk to researchers there about what synthetic biology could do in terms of Space. It was a lot of fun and sparked some interesting conversations.
As well as many researchers, there were also several iGEM teams in attendance. On the last day, there was an iGEM meetup where members of these teams got"

A protein destabilization sequence for yeast
This biobrick can be fused to any protein of interest and enables careful control of protein level by increasing degradation rate.
This destabilization sequence for rapid protein turnover consists on the C-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin 2 (CLN2) gene. It has been shown that this region of the protein, which is rich in PEST motifs, leads to a destabilization of a protein. Hence this Tag can be used to increase the turn-over rate of a protein. In the article by Mateus and Avery: ""Destabilized green Fluorescent protein for monitoring dynamic changes in yeast gene expression with flow cytometry"" they show that addition of these 178 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues changes the half-life of a GFP from 7h and down to 30 minutes.
Registry id: BBa_K194000
Yeast optimized Green Fluorescent Protein (yGFP)
Now the parts registry also offers a GFP for yeast - codon optimized and enhanced. By expanding the host organism, this is an improvement of an existing biobrick: BBa_E0040
This constitutively expressed GFP, originally from Aequorea victoria was codon optimized and developed as a reporter for gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae according to Cormak et al (1997). In addition, two amino acid changes were included enabling a far more bright florescence compared to the wild type in E.coli.  Maximum absorbance: 490 nm.
Registry id: BBa_K194001
Destabilized GFP for yeast
With a degradation half life of only 30 min, this is a fast reporter signal for yeast. It is constructed by the combination of the two above described biobricks (yGFP and Cln2 PEST signal), and is thus a further improvement of the existing biobrick for GFP: BBa_E0040
A fast degradable GFP that has a half-life of 30 min. This variant of biobrick BBa_K194001 has been destabilized by fusing it with biobrick BBa_K194000. In the article by Mateus and Avery: ""Destabilized"
TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Project#Philosophy_-_-_TEXT.html," cannot justify conservation of human existence. Confronting Kant´s category imperative stands Jonas ecological imperative. The basic of this imperative is that you should act in that way that the consequences of your acting are confirmative with humans living permanently on earth. This claim cannot be seen as a universal principle like Kant´s category imperative cause it only fits for special conditions. Not every action can be a danger for human life on earth.  In a first step we will now look at the philosophy of Hans Jonas. What does responsibility mean for him? Responsibility is a moral term. It means that actions are made responsible, that duties are fulfilled, that rights of others are respected and that the good will be saved and enhanced. New technologies which act on a global level force mankind to act responsible. The questions here are what is for what and to what extend is someone responsible for something. Often Jonas ethic of responsibility is identified as ethic of conservation but this statement is wrong. Jonas ethic is part of a transcendental ontology and his scope is the bottom of being. Therefore Jonas ethic has two sides, one is the subjective one and deals with responsibility for the Being, the second, objective one looks on the being as thing and for this thing somebody has to take responsibility. Or in other words axiology is becoming ontology. One trial to build a categorical duty is to preserve nature. The goal is to set objective validly over subjective judgment.  The main result of Jonas philosophy is that, if there is an ethic decision needed future aspects have to be evaluated. An implementation of a new technique should only be allowed, if human survival is guaranteed. What can happen if we look at a worst case scenario? If bacteria are used for the degradation of PET in nature the consequences are not predictable. Even natural organisms can have massive effects on an ecosystem when they are inserted by coincidence. If bacteria start to mutate nobody knows what might happen and therefore there is no limit for worst case scenarios. Everything can be possible even if the risk might appear low. Human survival is not guaranteed if for example bacteria start do digest fatty acids like they did in experiments (see chapter two) or other bio substances.
Chapter two - Examination of the tools
A fictive vision into the future gives us foretell about new ways of techniques. But even so, to make a precise choice it takes first of all an understanding of the matter. In this chapter the used tools will be discussed not only concerning the technical criteria, but also from an ethical point of view.
Technical criteria
a) Biological and biochemical basics

Alkaline cellulase Deinking
What we do
Super Dream Factory of Cellulase
We have made a super bacteria-Super Dream Factory of Cellulase.The factory has four parts. They are alkaline cellulase, Mdfa antiporter, kil   protein and ccdB suicide system.
To enhance the effects of decontamination in various fields, we use an alkaline cellulase as detergent additive. The alkaline cellulase gene was introduced into the Escherichia coli and the target enzyme can be highly produced with the help of Kil, which is one of the core elements of our project. What’s more, MdfA, a proton pump across the cell membrane, was added to transport the proton into the cytoplasma, and release Na+/K+ at the same time, resulting in cell survival in alkaline industry wastewaters as high as pH 9.5. Another highlight of our project is that we also added a ccdB suicide system to our e-machine, by this we could remove the biological machine whenever we need for biological safety.

Linkoping_Sweden,2018,Team:Linkoping Sweden#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," By getting invited by the local team of TEDxNorrköping we found a golden opportunity to let the public hear what we want to convey.  We provided also with help finding three other speakers for the event that went well with our theme.  These speakers were Peter Påhlsson, Andreas Eriksson and Jenny Hagenblad.
About 70 people were in the audience during the TEDx-event.  A video will be uploaded to TEDx:s website and with that, hopefully reach many more.
The video will soon be available on TEDx:s YouTube-channel:

Integrated Human Practices
Why We Chose to Do Integrated Human Practice
The idea that is presented here on our wiki has evolved a lot since we first started the journey towards the Giant Jamboree 2018.  Through involving different stakeholders, experts, and the public we managed to get the best out of our work.  During the process of evolving our project we frequently asked the following questions:
Is our project useful?
Who can make use of our end product?
Where are the limitations and the potential bottlenecks?
What does the the public know about Synthetic Biology and how should this affect the way we present our work?
What is the most important aspect of Synthetic Biology according to the public?
Since we started asking these questions, our project has changed focus.  Our idea changed from gaining insight into how chaperones in E.coli can be used to study protein folding in neurodegenerative diseases, to focusing on increasing protein production by facilitating the folding process.
This development came from a number of steps taken within the project. By continuing reading, we will do our best in order to guide you through these steps.
Survey - Letting the Public Influence What We Do in The Lab
During the course of the project, we became interested in finding out how much the general public in Linköping knows about the field of Synthetic Biology and also what opinions they have about how it should be applied. In order to find this out, we decided to conduct a survey.
The survey answered by randomised people in Linköping. We conducted the survey by walking around in the city core and asking people to participate in the survey. This would make the survey more randomised than doing it digitally. In other words, the survey would give a better view of the public opinion.
The survey was constructed with the help of Marie Berlin, who has much experience within the field of social science and writing surveys.  Marie Berlin is a PhD student in sociological demography at the Department of Sociology at Stockholms University. Marie Berlin"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". This had a great impact on my well-being.
How are your experiences with continuous wound care?
The pain and discomfort caused by the treatments are limited. Except for the consequences of antibiotic treatments.
How much discomfort do your wounds bring you?
A lot, since my wounds are large. Furthermore, they are pretty deep and cleaning them may make cause them to expand.
How long have you been suffering from your wounds?
Since February.
Do your wounds have an impact on your life?
They have a large impact. I can barely walk due to the wounds on my feet. Heel erg veel. Omdat het wonden op de voet zijn kan er nauwelijks op gelopen worden. In February, dead tissue was removed, causing a big hole. After that, my blood circulation reduced, which has been solved by means of a bypass. On August 21st, the wound was cleaned for another time, which has helped the wound to start curing.
How satisfied are you with your current treatment?
Since the wound has started to cure, it has been fine. Every now and then, I am coming for a check-up.
What are your thoughts on the use of living bacteria for the treatment of wound infections?
Considering grubs, living material on wounds is not a bad idea. If it is safe and it works, why not? I think it is better than antibiotics, which cause resistance and a lot of side-effects on the liver and kidneys when used systemically, like in my case.
Insights
The wound care process itself is not too bad. However, the wounds are usually large, resulting in a relatively large infection. This means that it takes a lot of antibiotics and a lot of time to resolve this infection. A large, systematic antibiotic treatment has a large impact on the body. A more local, surface solution would thus be better.
Karel is fine with the idea of using living bacteria as a treatment.
Follow-up
We will do everything we can to prevent systemic side effects of our treatment.
Karel’s positive feedback motivated us to work even harder. 😊 We are glad he is not taken back by the concept of adding living bacteria to the wound.
Conclusions
The discussions with experts and stakeholders were a valuable part of our iGEM trajectory. Thanks to their continuous input, we learned for which applications our living material would be most relevant. This made it much easier to settle on a wound healing patch as an application for Gelcatraz. A further set of interactions with medical doctors, experts on infectious diseases and others helped us to get a clear overview of the problem at hand. This helped"
Valencia_UPV,2018,Team:Valencia UPV#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"artist entire disposal
Thus, our main concern was how to fulfill the different stakeholder demands. Following our interdisciplinary spirit, we searched for continuos input from professionals with different backgrounds and non professionals, so we could ensure we were designing a useful synbio device.
This year we have decided to divide Integrated human in three parts:
Kano model
An engineering way to integrate feedback.
Expert dialoge
How experts point of view changed the way we did Printeria.
Safety desing
How safety specifications changed Printeria
Kano Model
Kano model is a methodology, which supports the development of products taking into account the needs of the customer. It helps you to understand the importance of functions or features to a customer[1]. We have used it to improve Printeria and we want it to be a guide for future iGEM teams, thats why we are going to present our work as an example of using it.
Kano model is made up of three stages:
Pick up the user's voice
In this phase you have to present your project to an audience and then ask them for criticisms or suggestions. We did it in the Mustang Art Gallery (MAG) in Elche (Alicante). After showing them Printeria we gathered all the students and teachers and we asked them for demands, improvements or criticisms.
Create your paired questions quiz
With those demands that we will call necessities you have to make a questionaire based on paired questions. This questions have the next grammar: ¿How do you feel if (a necessity exists on your device)? and ¿How do you feel if (that necessity did not exist on your device)? As you can observe, it is the same necessity but expressed positively or negatively. Check out our questionnaire to see an example:
QUESTIONNAIRE
Classify your demands
Once you have all the answers, you have to complete a series of tables to conclude if that necessity is really important or not. If it is, you should include it in your design because that will increase the satisfaction rate of the user. If it is not, do not waste time and money implementing something no one will appreciate!
Study case: Kano model in Printeria
When using the Kano model you can easily combine public engagement with integrated human. Taking advantage of the fact that we went to MAG (Mustang Art Gallery) in Elche (Alicante) to present our project in front of students and teachers, we decided to demand feedback. The most important necessities were included in the questionnaire we described above, and then we sent it to the students and teachers who filled it. The questionnaire and the results"

Helena is a co-director of Human Practices for the Purdue iGEM team. She is a Biology student entering sophomore year, currently doing research in Dr. Meng Deng’s lab with Notch Signaling in relation to human mesenchymal stem cells. She thinks stem cells are the best and wants to continue with Regenerative Engineering in the future. Helena is Cypriot Greek and loves cupcakes, donuts, and Diet Coke. Helena is also a Science Ambassador for Purdue and enjoys recruiting new students to dedicate their lives to science. She loves research and also medicine, and is hoping to pursue an MD-PhD in the future. One time, she met Taylor Swift. That was pretty awesome.
MELISSA ROBINS
CO-CHAIR OF HUMAN PRACTICES
Melissa is a Biological Engineering student entering her sophomore year. She is co-director of Human Practices Policies and Practices Human Practices, and has whiplash from the number of times iGEM changes its mind. While she finds spending hours in a lab extremely fun, Melissa also enjoys watching Game of Thrones, playing soccer, and reading Dostoevsky. She aspires to work for/start a company that works on creating sustainable energy solutions, and if that doesn’t work out, she will live her life as a happy hermit.
Hana Kubo
CHIEF LIAISON
Hana is a sophomore in Genetics, so you could say she enjoys being part of iGEM. Originally from Tokyo, Japan, she has also lived in New York for 7 years and Sydney, Australia for 3 years. If you ask nicely, she may even do an Australian accent for you (her favorite phrase to say in an Aussie accent is “Oi mate can you get me a bottle of water”). In her free time, Hana enjoys breaking the bank by online shopping makeup on Sephora, as well as having an existential crisis every so often. She plans to pursue a PhD in order to lead a research lab in the field gynecology with a concentration in genetics. If that doesn’t work out, she’s content with becoming a trophy wife, or maybe working at MAC cosmetics.

In the summer of 2010, arsenic levels, nearly ten times the accepted level by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is set at ten parts per billion, were found in the Coachella Valley, California water system.  Although the long-term effects are slow to manifest, they can be devastating, including several forms of cancer. Already, several families in the town of Thermal have shown symptoms of poisoning and many have untreatable rashes. Arsenic can be very deadly and costly for a small community like the Coachella Valley. After the contamination was discovered, the town had to plan into its budget nearly $2 million for arsenic removal.
Arsenic contamination can happen nearly anywhere. Arsenic comes from natural deposits in the earth and pollution from industrial plants and agriculture. Some water systems can reduce arsenic levels but, overall, the best method to keep water safe from poisoning is to avoid sources that contain it. Currently, tests are expensive and bulky, being best suited for use by water utility companies. Our project was to develop an affordable, easy-to-use arsenic detector using the yeast platform. An e. coli test kit has also been developed but by using yeast our detector is less expensive, more durable and less harmful than that method. Compared to other test systems, it is also faster, easier and eliminates the issue of a temperature requirement.

As for last week, the teacher we’ve been contacting from Ithaca High School, Ms Arti Jewett, was awarded the grant “Biotechnology in the Classroom”, which will enable us to carry out lab workshops more easily in the future.
The members of our own iGEM team come from a variety of backgrounds. Some of us had excellent science programs in high school, getting involved with research and entering science competitions at the national level. However, others of us had less exposure and wanted to provide greater opportunity to the students in our community. We understand the importance of early exposure to up to date science technology in high school education. We wanted to show the students that they had the ability to take their own ideas and run with them, to innovate, and to explore in synthetic biology.
The mentorship project with Ithaca High School provides them, and us too, a long-term partnership which actively enriches our community.
THE GREAT NY STATE FAIR
An American tradition of over 175 years.
An annual attendance of over a million visitors.
These factors made the Great New York State Fair, a thirteen day celebration of New York’s agriculture, entertainment, and technology, the perfect place for Cornell iGEM to reach out to a large and receptive audience. Our aim was to bolster the fun and festivity by exhibiting our hydroponics synthetic biology application, and discussing the myriad of opinions surrounding genetic engineering.
Situated at the New York 4H building, we joined a wide range of education and technology exhibits targeting youth of all ages as well as parents. During our time there, we enthusiastically broke the ice by asking fairgoers a simple question, “What does synthetic biology mean to you?”
We encountered many families who had no idea what ""synthetic biology"" meant. But by discussing and engaging their curiosity with activities from Building with Biology which illustrated synthetic biology as a way to put different pieces together to solve a problem, we were able to describe the essence of synthetic biology. Afterwards we asked them to participate in our photo campaign, called Humans of SynBio.
It was not always a consensus. During some of our conversations, we had fairgoers who were convinced that genetic engineering is dangerous for human health. Rather than immediately refute them, we listened and facilitated dialogue to resolve misconceptions and hear these various viewpoints.
Ultimately, our goal was to engage in discussion with all that came to our booth, who were curious, uncertain, or apprehensive of the prospects of synthetic biology. By the time we left"

4. Validation of audiogenetics
We designed both ultrasonic and audible sonic simulation hardware to quantitatively test stimulated cells.
Audible sonic stimulation
Buzzers, balanced amatures and speakers were used as sonic stimulators. Only buzzers induced obvious cell response in high frequency conditions (15kHz and 20kHz). A buzzer was attached to the bottom of a cell dish. When the buzzer was working, cells around the buzzer boundary was observed under microscope. Strong fluorescence intensity increased immediately after the buzzer was started. Cell fluorescence intensity increased greatly when stimulated by 15K and 20kHz sound. While no obvious fluorescence intensity change when GECO cells (without MS channel) were stimulated (Fig.8 ).

Fig. 8 (A) R-GECO+Piezo1 cell fluorescence intensity increased greatly when stimulated by 15K and 20KHz sound. While no obvious fluorescence intensity changed when GECO cells (without MS channel) were stimulated (B).
Ultrasonic Stimulation
Ultrasonic transducers can transform electric energy into ultrasonic radiant energy. There were four kinds of ultrasonic transducer tried. Pressure fields of 108kHz and 1.1MHz transducers were simulated for different power and distance. The pressure field distribution changes smoothly, while the pressure distribution was quite chaos in condition of 1.1MHz. Only strong cell response was observed in condition of 108kHz stimulation as shown in Fig9. No obvious cell response was observed for 1.1MHz"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," The DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio) was extracted and sequenced with the nanopore. By applying data preparation and analysis pipeline, the mean methylation scores arising from reference nucleotides for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type enzyme version and K227R mutant (it had the lowest activity).
Figure 1. Comparison of In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity. In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to in data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the lower methylation score is assigned, due to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing approach and standard sized reactions (Figure 1) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq as a biomolecule activity to reading method. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the kinetic measurement data perfectly. The activity of each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove that CAT-Seq approach enables to screening the activity of millions of enzyme variant sequences and accurately assigns the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.

Inhibition of TetR expression by anhydrotetracycline(ATc), a compound that is not normally found in nature, is necessary of expression of LacI. LacI directly inhibits expression of a lethal toxin or indirectly prevents inhibition of the expression of our target genes. Removal of ATc from the enviroment activates the expression of TetR, which leads to cell death.

Ampacet Visit - 7/3/18
On July 3rd, Emilie and Liz spoke with a representative from Ampacet in Terre Haute about our project. As a plastics expert, Dr. Jared Tatum explained the processes that are done at Ampacet. While discussing our project, Dr. Tatum offered the team PET plastic samples for our experiments. He will be giving us pure PET bottles, PET pellets, and PET powder. After explaining our experimental protocol ideas, Dr. Tatum advised us to change our procedures. Our original idea had been to let the bacteria eat the pellets as their only carbon source and observe the change. However, Dr. Tatum advised that we use the powder instead of the pellets because of the greater surface area to volume ratio. Additionally, he informed the team about the effect that humidity plays on the characteristics of pure PET. He encouraged us to monitor the humidity during our experiments and note any change in results based on a difference in humidity. Because pure PET is so susceptible to changes based on humidity, PET used in disposable water bottles contain a great amount of additives to stabilize the plastic and ensure long shelf life. Based on this new information, we began designing an experiment that would determine the effects of these additives on the ability of the bacteria to breakdown the PET.

Another important part of society that is heavily intertwined with water and pharmaceuticals are hospitals. Although not accounting for the majority of pharmaceuticals in water, they are accounting for a more concentrated release of certain pharmaceuticals.
We met with Project leader and Environmental coordinator Sofia Svebrant at the Academic Hospital in Uppsala to talk about laws and regulations for hospitals regarding pharmaceutical release at point sources. Since hospitals are a point source of wastewater containing pharmaceutical residues, they are currently working on investigating options to clean antibiotics and resistant microorganisms from the wastewater, together with Uppsala University. Important to note is that hospitals are point sources of directly harmful pharmaceuticals, such as cytotoxic compounds. Sofia gave us valuable information about how hospitals are involved in the situation, and how we could potentially target their problems. Since they are currently investigating enzymatic treatments, Biotic Blue was thought of as a positive addition to the emerging field.
When pitching Biotic Blue to Staffan Rosenborg (Head of Clinical Trials), Karin Sonesson (Environmental and chemical administrator) and Ewa Frank (Environmental waste administrator) at Huddinge Hospital,  we got confirmation that we are on the right track with the Biotic Blue design and implementation process. They explained that there is a rising demand for removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater and that hospitals are adopting a new way of thinking by connecting pharmaceutical treatment of a patient with environmental risk information. Our Biotic Blue has a bright future, but it will also need to meet more complex requirements to make an impact in the future.
Influences from the market
×
There are different types of wastewater treatment plants, and we had the opportunity to both meet municipal as well as private plants. Process engineer Peter Gruvstedt from the private plant at AstraZeneca thought that Biotic Blue could be implemented in their fungal process step of purification, if an additional system was built on the side of the compartment, and if the enzyme was optimized for their pharmaceuticals. AstraZeneca’s treatment plant was especially interesting for Biotic Blue since"

We have created theoretical kill switches for each of the situations that our engineered bacteria might find themselves in, to allow us complete control over when they die. Since the kill switches are based on the lac operon, if there are any concerns about the action of the bacteria, we can kill the whole population immediately, by introducing IPTG through the catheter. Furthermore, the kill switch is also sensitive to other elements which could be present (AI2 for free-living bacteria, valine for bacteria in media) to allow extra degrees of control. The kill switch options were another aspect we surveyed the public on. The results were that they were happy to use them, provided their healthcare professional ensured that it was safe. For more details, check out our safety and questionnaire pages.
Outreach
In an attempt to improve the general public's understanding of Synthetic Biology, we used a variety of approaches. We thought we could help certain members of audience, who represent the 6% of pessimists we found in an earlier survey, to fully understand the concepts of genetic engineering, and realise the incredible gains that can be made from projects like ours in the field of synthetic biology.
We asked the public: Which of these do you think is the most common infection acquired in hospitals?
Most of the public (45.5%) thought that MRSA is the most commonly acquired infection in hospitals, showing that they think that antibiotic resistance is a problem. However, with UTIs coming in quite far behind this (19.5%), it seems that the public are not aware of the risk of getting UTIs in hospital due to urinary catheterisation. This could be due to the fact that UTIs are advertised less than MRSA, but since this is an important issue, we looked into educating the public through sessions with summer schools and school students, as well as getting in touch with local media, such as BBC Radio Oxford, and promoting our project across social media. We believe that this has helped raise awareness of problems associated with catheter-based infections, not only in the urinary tract, but also with infections in other catheterised parts of the body.
BBC Radio Oxford
We were invited to talk about antibiotic resistance on BBC Radio Oxford. We went on the Kat Orman's morning show, alongside Monty Python's Michael Palin, and spoke about the increasing threat that antibiotic resistance poses, and what we're doing to combat it. We were asked questions about why we chose this area to pursue, whether our project was likely to be l"

Safety
Collaboration with the ETH Departement for Safety, Security, Health and Environment
Integrated
The main concern raised during our Human Practices efforts was the biocontainment of our engineered bacteria. For the identification of critical components in our robotic design, we cooperated with the ETH Department for Safety, Health             and Environment. As a result of this discussen we revised the design of our robot and included safety precautions to prevent             contamination of the environment by the genetically modified organisms.              Have a look a the before and after design in the picture below.
Keypoints of the Interview
Robot parts containing engineered bacteria should be made from non-fragile material to avoid breaking in case of an accident.
On the robot, bacteria are either operated in standard plastic lab ware or specially 3D-printed parts made from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, a durable polymer known from Lego bricks.
Bacteria need to be stopped from escaping from the robot. Mechanically this could be solved by placing a tub, which contains an absorbent or antimicrobial reagent under the robotic platform.
We designed a 3D-printable double-walled case for all parts on the robot containing bacteria. The case has only one opening for the influx of bubbled medium, where a unidirectional valve can be placed. The compartment between                       the two walls of the case can be filled with any antimicrobial reagent to ensure the elimination of any bacteria in the unlikely case of a container breakage.
Before moving the robot outside of the lab, removal of any operated GMOs is required. Especially when bringing our robot to the U.S., we were recommended not to bring any material that was brought in contact with GMOs. For cleaning, we were recommended to use a strong antiseptic like H2O2 as it causes no damage to the electronics.
When bringing our robot to the U.S., we are going to replace all parts that were possibly brought in contact with engineered bacteria. All other non-replaceable parts are going to be cleaned with H2O2.
For our project, we were interested in finding out which components would be interesting to sense but primarily, which ones would be easy to use in a biosafety level one laboratory like ours. We were recommended to work with                   non-toxic compounds in a proof of concept manner to minimize any risk to human health and the environment.
For the experimental part, we worked with the natural aspartate sensing system from E. coli. Our attempts in evolving the Tar receptor were carried out with"

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the"

Public speech for iGEM
Time: May 20th 2015
Location: Science Building SA236
Participating member: team members in XJTLU-CHINA, staffs in the department of biology, students interested in synbio and iGEM.
Purpose of this event: we hope more people could know about iGEM competition and have an interest in synthetic biology. Also, we hope for support and permit from our university.
In the beginning, Jodie introduced synthetic biology and iGEM competition. She talked that: ‘Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems and the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. Also, Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology. This engineering perspective may be applied at all levels of the hierarchy of biological structures – from individual molecules to whole cells, tissues and organisms. In essence, synthetic biology will enable the design of ‘biological systems’ in a rational and systematic way’ It gave general information about synbio to some biology freshmen and students from other department. She also talked about iGEM, the main process during the competition, and modern biological technologies used in iGEM. This was the first time professors in biology department know about iGEM and realized its importance.

Grätzel – Solar BioEnergy’ project from TU-Darmstadt, ‘Membranes from Bacterial Cellulose’ project form Imperial, ‘Magnetic E. coli’ project from Berlin, ‘Engineering a synthetic microbial consortium’ project from Braunschweig University of Technology. All people were surprised about those creative ideas and work from undergraduates. Dr. Meng said these project were amazing and beyond his image. He was hard to believe biology students can finish such excellent work, while maybe scientists could not have those great ideas.

FHB is caused by a range of Fusarium fungi, which infects the heads of the crops when they are growing in the field. The disease is often associated with contamination by mycotoxins produced by the fungi which can cause severe economic losses .
According to literature review, we know that FHB is responsible for significant grain yield reduction world-wide. In China, wheat scabs affected areas are about 7.5 million hectares, accounting for the 1/4 of the total area of wheat. The annual loss of damage caused by scabs is about 2 million to 3 million Ton.In the U.S and Canada, Fusarium ear blight emerged in the 1990s as a widespread and powerful threat to cereal production.[1] From 1998-2000 the Midwestern United States suffered $2.7 billion in losses following a FEB epidemic.
Fusarium toxins have negative effects on the immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems of animals.[2]DON is a protein synthesis inhibitor, which also called vomitoxin, due to its negative effects on feed intake in pigs. Pigs are the most sensitive to DON, while ruminant animals such as cattle have higher tolerance.[3]Many countries monitor Fusarium mycotoxins in grain to limit negative health effects. In the U.S there are advisory levels for DON in human food and livestock feed.[4]The European Unionhas legislative limits for several Fusarium mycotoxins in grain aimed for human consumption[5]and recommended limits for animal feed.[6]Extensive research has been put into the development of control measures of Fusarium ear blight. Scientists, growers and food processors aim to develop effective control measures, including"

Health-aspects of the final GMO:
Bacteria not exposed to antibiotics will discard the plasmids within a very short timespan.
The bacteria are modified with plasmids, and will return to a non-GMO state within a short time-span. The modification is not infective/self-reproductive in humans. It is not believed to pose any threat towards human health.
We have at no point worked with any self-reproductive or pathogenic material
Final Assessment: We cinclude that it will be entirely safe to work with our GMM in a level 1 laboratory.

We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not killed by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter we put inside warrior I. (More details can be seen at Orthogonality test )
V Killing test
Because we use RFP to indicate the level of LacI inside the cell during Orthogonality test, we are not sure if the results will be the same when we use a complete circuit. Therefore, we designed two warriors and beggars as below to verify results got from Orthogonality test.
(Fig.5 Gene circuit designed for killing test to verify Orthogonality test. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.)
According to results of Orthogonality test, the warrior I will be killed by itself when it is cultivated without warrior II. Furthermore, warrior II doesn’t kill itself but can kill E.coli from another side successfully. All results we got here are consistent with our Orthogonality test! They greatly enhance the reliability of our previous data. (Fig.6)
(Fig.6 Killing test results)
More details can be found at Killing test
VI Improved orthogonal gene circuit
The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by himself. Our model tells us if we design the warrior I as below (Fig.7), we can make it only be killed by warrior II by just regulating the RBS of TetR to an appropriate intensity.
(Fig.7 Improved gene circuit. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II.)
See more details at Design of characters
Results are shown below:
(Fig.8 Performance of improved gene circuit)
See more information at Improved gene circuit
VII Regulation of killing ability
Sometimes, to mimic the situation we investigate in real world, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level, like making two warriors have the same killing ability. What can we do to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggests that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of the two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins! (Fig.9)
(Fig.9 Regulation of killing ability)
See more details at Regulation of killing ability
VIII Fluid and Solid model
Because of our limited time, we have not constructed all characters and used it to investigate some interesting questions, but our model can help us study the behaviors of this system.
Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model has"
EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ated sequences that code for the neoantigens we have selected for our vaccine. More precisely, we seek to quantify the presence of these sequences in the bloodstream through ctDNA. This gives us the opportunity to monitor tumor remission directly by studying the patient’s blood.
Cancer relapse detection through chromosomal rearrangement
As part of any cancer therapy, there is always a need to be vigilant against any recurrence, since it can occur at any time: indeed, although the targeted cell populations have been eliminated, other cells may have survived and resurface after some time. To address this problem, we want to detect the sequences of the individualized junctions identified using our bioinformatic pipeline directly in the blood, using our CRISPR-Cas12a based assay. The detection of such sequences will alert the patient of a potential relapse and the need for a closer follow-up, which can have a lead time of up to 11 months in detecting relapses over clinical established methods in some types of cancers, according to Olsson et al., 2015 .
Cancer relapse detection through miRNA
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (18-24 nt) non-coding RNA molecules which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Over the years, miRNAs have been proved to play a critical role in a variety of different diseases, including cancer ( Larrea et al., 2016 ). Moreover, miRNAs are remarkably stable in human plasma ( Mitchell et al., 2008 ), and several miRNAs circulating in the blood have recently been shown to be dysregulated (either over- or under-expressed) in patients with certain cancers, including melanoma, with respect to healthy subjects ( Mirzaei et al., 2016 ). For these reasons, miRNAs have been proposed as potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for melanoma, which makes them suitable candidates for the follow-up part of our project as well.
Previous iGEM teams (e.g. NUDT China 2016 team) have shown promising results with Rolling Circle Amplification of miRNAs by means of dumbbell-shaped probes (details in “Amplification”). Our aim is to investigate whether is possible to combine this dumbbell probe design with a Cas12a system to achieve a sensitive and specific detection assay.
Cas12a
To answer the need for a fast and robust detection method we chose to work with the newly characterized Cas12a (Cpf1) protein.

Our modelling is based on the following signal transduction network of TOR protein. As we discussed before, the major part of signaling transduction is regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex either via the Tap42-Sit4/PPA2c or the recently identified Sch9 branches. Nevertheless, Sch9 branch appears to have overlapping functions with cAMP-PKA pathway,and be additionally regulated by proteins not contained in central TOR pathway. Besides, as most of the downstream transription factors are definitely regulated to Tap42-Sit4/PPA2c, we decide to simplify the modelling part to this branch only.
In normal yeast cell, TORC1 (Tor complex 1) with phosphorylated Tor2 is in a functional state, which is able to phosphorylate Tip41 and Tap42 which would bind together when dephosphorylated.
PP2A1 and PP2A2 belong to a PP2A family that has the ability to dephosphorylate other proteins. PP2A1 consists of Pph21/22 and Cdc55/Tpd3, which are catalytic and regulatory subunits respectively. PP2A2 consists of Sit4 and Sap, which are catalytic and regulatory subunits respectively.
However, phosphorylated Tap42 is more likely to bind catalytic subunits of PP2As, like Pph21/22 or Sit4, which means phosphorylated Tap42 suppress the activities of PP2A1 and PP2A2.
PP2As could dephosphorylate some transcription factors, like phosphorylated Rtg1/3, Gcn4, Gln3, etc, as well as phosphorylated Tap42 and Tip41.
The activity of TORC1 can suppress the activities of PP2As.
In our project this year, multiple inhibitors ”FAP”, which are short for furans, acetic acid and phenol could inhibit the activity of TOR protein. When FAP exists in vivo, TORC1 (Tor complex 1) will be dephosphorylated, leading to an inactivated state without the ability to phosphorylate downstream proteins (Notice: The equilibrium constant
can reflect the resistance of Tor2 to FAP to some degree). Another simplification here is that,"

In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
4. As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Identify the level of risk.
Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
Good hygiene of workers.
Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.
In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.
5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required"

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project#future_-_-_TEXT.html," are highly specific or directly over-expressed on tumor cells. Nowadays,  the set of potentially interested ligands for the specifically targeted anticancer agents is remarkable large but only a few class of these markers appears to be promising as a targets for the new generation anticancer drugs. Nowadays plethora of proteins that are responsible for cellular signaling pathways are known, involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation in neoplasms with the targets amenable to therapeutic interventions in cancer therapy. Membrane-bound human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER), c-MET, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) mediate mitogenic signals from extracellular ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and insulin growth factors (IGF) are the most popular ligands.
Abnormal expression of integrins in tumor
It is strongly believed that the most promising type of tumor-specific markers are vascular receptors mainly involved in the neoangiogenesis of the solid tumors and the promotion of cancer cells migration and their invasiveness. Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood capillaries are formed from preexisting vessels, is a hallmark of cancer. The process is a common feature to many solid tumors and angiogenic targets are easily accessible for systemic treatments and are genetically stable. These targets are also could be exploited for imaging and destructing tumor blood vessels.
Integrins are the crucial family of receptors for for cell-matrix adhesion and are also involved in various cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, integrins create transmembrane connections to the cytoskeleton and are pivotal for working of many intracellular signaling pathways. Therefore, integrins and their ligands play key roles in development, immune response, cellular hemostasis and cancer. Equipped with these various functions, integrins are desired targets of effective therapeutic drugs and are objects of intensive continuous research in the area for development and targeting of drugs.
Until now, 18 α and 8 β integrins subunits are known in mammalian cells to associate non-covalently forming 24 integrin heterodimers. Each type of subunit is a peculiar glycoprotein which consists of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix and a short cytoplasmic tail. It should be remark that each of the 24 integrins appears to have a specific, nonredundant function (this can be concluded both from their interactors specificities and from phenotypes of knockout mice).
The relevance of α5β1 integrin as a proangiogenic factor arises"

Different species of cyanobacteria produce different toxins, but there can be some variation between different strains of a given species. It is also possible that some cyanobacteria produce toxins while other individuals from the same strain do not produce any at all. In addition, the cyanotoxins are released only as the cells die and lyse. (WHO, 2003) This makes it difficult to quantify the toxin concentration in the water. According experts from SYKE (Finnish Environment Institute), who we interviewed, at the moment there is no affordable, easy way to measure the microcystin concentrations in waters. Detection of algal blooms is done mainly by satellite images or indirectly by measuring other factors such as phosphorous concentrations, which give a rough estimate of the amount of cyanobacteria. Other ways to detect the cyanobacteria are for example optical sensors, cameras, DNA analyses, chlorophyll analyses and fingerprint matrixes. These methods, however, do not give any indication of the amount of microcystin or other cyanotoxins. Methods for measuring the concentration of cyanotoxins require laboratory facilities, and are based on antibody detection.
For the degradation of microcystin, there are no existing methods. In the bigger picture, microcystins and other cyanotoxins are a result of eutrophication, as that is the reason for cyanobacterial blooms which then lead to the production of the toxins. Therefore, to permanently reduce the problem of cyanotoxins, the causes of eutrophication must be controlled. Examples of measures that have helped in the prevention of eutrophication include restrictions on the use of different fertilizers and preventing factories from letting their waste waters get to natural water systems. Even though algal blooms have reduced over the years, in many places the toxin concentrations still rise above the safety limit every summer. This is why we want to provide an easy and affordable way to detect and degrade microcystins.
Why we are using yeast
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a unicellular eukaryote, and as a such, it has certain advantages compared to e.g. Escherichia coli . It has several benefits that make it an easy chassis to work with, such as a fully sequenced genome, fast growth, and available protocols. However, as an eukaryote it has the additional advantage of sharing many similar cellular functions with higher eukaryotes.
In iGEM, S. cerevisiae is not a popular chassis"

2A  peptide Sequence
In foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and some other picornaviruses, the oligopeptide (≈20 amino acids) 2A region of the polyprotein mediates ""cleavage"" at its own C-terminus to release it from the 2B region. 2A is also active when placed between reporter proteins and in all eukaryotic systems tested - it acts as an autonomous element, making it an important tool for co-ordinated synthesis of multiple proteins from one open reading frame and making a ribosome jumping. (Fig.3)In recent years, there was little report about 2A peptide that is active in prokaryotic systems, even some papers stated 2A sequences can’t work in prokaryote. But Indian Scientists Dechamma et al. have found the F2A peptide could work in E.coli[1], which gives us creative advice.
Fig.3  the picture comes from http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_protein/914.html.
In our project, at first step we constructed that F2A peptide sequence linked gene ''LinA'' and ''LinB'', and P2A linked gene ''DhaA'' and ''HheC''. (Fig.4)

Figure 1: By coating cells in polysilicate using the enzyme silicatein, the bacteria might function as a lens.
Experiments and Results
In order to confirm whether we can influence cell shape, we overexpressed the gene BolA and investigated the change of phenotype under a widefield microscope and SEM. Also, we investigated whether the cell shape changed and whether we were able to produce homogeneous cells. Then, before we could use our cells in a real-world setup, we had to find a way to sterilize the biolenses, since we could not take the cells out of the lab. Important here is that the technique was non-invasive, since the optical properties of the cells should not be disturbed. We experimented with autoclaving and UV sterilization. After we had found a way to sterilize the lenses, we tested them under real-world conditions. We applied the cells on solar cells to see whether this had any impact on the efficiency of the solar cells. We did this in a solar simulator to simulate real-world conditions as good as possible.
Influencing cell shape for round lenses
Introduction
When making biological lenses, the shape of the lens is of crucial importance. E. coli is a rod-shaped organism, so it’s not symmetrical along all axes. Shining light on the round parts of E. coli has a different effect on the focusing of light than shining light on the long sides, see figure 1. More information on this can be found on the modeling page .
Figure 1: Different ways of focusing light by rod-shaped lenses and spherical lenses. The rod-shaped lens has various directions in which it can break the light, therefore the orientation of this lens is extremely important. The spherical cell only has one orientation, so the orientation of the cell does not matter. We do, however, observe some spherical aberations in our model for spherical lenses.
When we want to use our microlenses in more advanced optical systems, such as microscopes or cameras, we need to make sure that the variation between the different lenses is minimized. Manufacturers of optical systems do not accept a high aberration between different lenses, so it’s crucial for us to be able to control the shape of our lenses. We have decided to engineer E. coli in such a way that it becomes spherical. This way we are able to create spherical lenses. Apart from the fact that it is crucial to be able to control cell shape, round cells offer the advantage of being sym"

Week 2: May 12th - May 16th
This week we focused more on getting familiar with Arduino Uno microcontroller.  One of our team members wrote several programs for Arduino to make the light blink in different patterns. In order to program the microcontroller, a programming language very similar to C++ is used; all of the members of the modelling team have C++ knowledge. We also found out that if we have to measure the input current, we would not need a sensor as analog in on the Arduino Uno can measure the input voltage so we would be able to calculate the current. We also looked at the prices for different sensors and where we can buy them, most of the sensors can be purchased for under 5-7 dollars (solarbotics) . The Arduino Uno microcontroller costs 35 dollars (solarbotics) . We also checked resources left by last year’s engineering and modelling team and found resistors, capacitors, op-amps, instruments and additional resourceful items that we can use this year as well.  We did an inventory of these items, so when we are coding and creating circuits we are aware of what components are available.  Part of our mission is to produce an economically feasible and low cost device for developing countries, and therefore we plan on researching how to adjust our design to reduce cost in the following weeks.  It is important to consider the economics of the device if it is to be considered for practical use in multiple areas of the world, not all of which have access to the same resources.  As a team we determined that we want to have the end goal of potentially producing a working prototype.  Although this is an ambitious goal, planning and research on how this is possible will help us achieve this.
Week 3: May 19th -May 23rd
This week we started looking into what kind of software we can use to visually model our biological system and genetic circuit. We decided to use Autodesk Maya to model the processes that are occurring within the device. We have access to Autodesk software and connections with knowledgeable advisors who would be able to help us we have any issues that arise. There are also plugins for Maya that can be used for modelling biological parts such as proteins or enzymes. This week we also continued exploring and researching the Arduino Uno's functions as well as continuing to look into different designs of a device and how we would improve production to produce"

NKU_CHINA,2018,Team:NKU CHINA#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html,"ized vectors identical to each other (15 bp∼20 bp, excludes restriction enzyme cutting sites).
Firstly, design the forward and the reverse primer of insertion according to Fig. 2.
Forward primer of insert: 5' - homologous sequence of vector-upstream end + restriction enzyme cutting site (optional) + gene specific forward amplification sequence of insert -3'
Reverse primer of insert: 3' - gene specific reverse amplification sequence of insert + restriction enzyme cutting site (optional) + homologous sequence of vector-downstream end -5'
Notice: If the primer length exceeds 40 bp, PAGE purification of synthetized primers is recommended, which will benefit the recombination efficiency. When calculating the Tm of primers, the homologous sequence of vector ends should be excluded and only gene specific amplification sequence should be counted.
Secondly, Inserts can be amplified by any PCR polymerase (i.e. conventional Taq DNA polymerase or high-fidelity DNA polymerase). It will not interfere with the recombination efficiency whether there is A-tail in the PCR products or not. To prevent possible mutations introduced during PCR, amplification with a high-fidelity polymerase are highly recommended.
3. Recombination
Firstly, calculation of the amount of vectors and insert. The optimal amount of vector for the recombination with ClonExpress II is 0.03 pmol, while the optimal amount of insert is 0.06 pmol (molar ratio of vector to insertion is 1:2), as roughly calculated as follows:
The optimal mass of vector = [0.02 × number of base pairs] ng (0.03 pmol)
The optimal mass of insert = [0.04 × number of base pairs] ng (0.06 pmol)
Secondly, set up the following reaction on ice. Spin briefly to bring the sample to the bottom before reacting. See Table 1.
Table 1
4. Transformation and plating
Add the entire recombination products to 200 µL of competent cells; flip the tube several times to mix it thoroughly and place the tube on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the tube for 45∼90 sec at 42 °C and then place the tube on ice for 2 min. Add 900 µL of SOC or LB medium to competent cells and leave the tube in 37 °C water bath for 10 min to let the competent cells fully recovered. Then, shake the tube at 37 °C for 45 min to culture the bacteria. Take "

1. Introduction
The assembled PA2652 construct ( BBa_K515102 ) and non-codon optimised mcpS (in pRK415 backone vector), have been inserted and tested for functionality in E. coli DH5α obtained from New England Biolabs. We carried out several tests in an attempt to characterise the rewired chemotaxis towards L(-)malic acid. We separated testing of chemotaxis towards malate into behavioural, qualitative & quantitative analyses.
To test bacterial uptake into the roots of the plants, we worked with Arabidopsis thaliana to replicate the experiment by Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al[6]. Arabidopsis is a common plant model organism. Its genome has been almost completely sequenced and replicates quickly, producing a large number of seeds. Many different mutant strains have been constructed to study its different characteristics[1]. While Arabidopsis may not represent plant populations naturally occurring in arid areas threatened by desertification, it is a useful model organism which we will be using to study the effect of the auxin plant hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) on roots, observe chemotaxis towards them, and observe them taking up bacteria as nutrients.

2. Bacterial chemotaxis towards malate
2.1 Behavioral analysis
Bacteria perform two types of movement, smooth swimming and tumbling. In the absence of attractant the result of the two movements lead to random walk without directionality. In the presence of a concentration gradient of attractant, the probabilities of the two movements change and lead to the directional movement known as random biased walk.
Video 1: Mixed population of GFP-expressing control and non-GFP labelled PA2652 expressing E. coli. The bacteria have been placed in motility buffer without attractant and therefore there is no observed difference in behaviour between the two. Since no attractant is present, a majority of the bacteria perform tumbling, however there are individual bacteria that perform smooth swimming, a rapid movement. In this video, bacteria decide randomly between tumbling and smooth swimming, which is known as random walk. When bacteria perform chemotactic behaviour towards a concentration gradient(not pictured), the probability of"
