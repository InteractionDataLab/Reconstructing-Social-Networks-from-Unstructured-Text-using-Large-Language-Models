Biosafety
Biosafety is defined as the prevention of the unintended exposure or accidents involving genetically modified organisms or pathogens. It is the responsibility of scientists and companies to follow working policies that will guarantee that the biological sample will not cause harm to the workers, the public or the environment. Currently there are many projects focused on developing biosafety tools for synthetic biology, mainly motivated by the concern that society, institutions and organizations have expressed, but whose aim is to create a safe technology and not to please some sectors of the population [1]. The present efforts are a reflection of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, which was held in 1975 at a conference center at Asilomar State Beach to discuss biosafety and ethics issues related to genetic engineering.
On the other hand, a related confusing term to biosafety is biosecurity, which deals with the intended theft, misuse or release of harmful biological agents [2].
Synthetic Biology is a relatively new technology that can be still modified to make it more open and safer [3]. To achieve this, key stakeholders such as governmental institutions and the general public will have to engage in a public conversation with scientists and companies in order to develop the field.
Moreover, the synthetic biology tools have themselves the potential to make synthetic biology safer through the application of safety mechanisms on the biological devices developed. As synthetic biology is based on engineering principles applied to biology, the safety engineering applied in the usual technologies will be able to be applied to synthetic biology. This gives a base to"

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 Notebooks Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," overnight 3 more plates in addition to TP gained color. Colored colonies were also seen on VP, CP, and PP.
○
These 4 colors (TP, VP, CP and PP) all used the same primers for both the vector and the his-tag and chromoprotein so there may be something wrong with the other 8 primers that we need to fix to get them to show color.
●
We will start liquid cultures from the colored colonies and also run the colony PCR from the colored colonies. We used VF2 and VR as our primers in the PCR because our backbone is a iGEM backbone and VF2 and VR should amplify the region in this backbone which should be our chromoprotein and hi-tag. We ran out of chloro when making the liquid cultures so only 8 were made. LO, SO, DM, and VV did not get made into liquid cultures but will be once we make more chloro. We put the liquid cultures in the incubator for today but will take them out before we leave and put them at room temperature to incubate over the weekend. We made more chloro and were able to get all 12 chromoproteins in the incubator to grow up in liquid culture
●
We ran the colony PCR on a gel to see if the correct region was amplified with our chromoprotein and his-tag
○
Gel order: Ladder, DM, VV, SO, LO, DT, VP, SP, CP, TP, PP, MP, BB
●
Our gel showed our colony PCR was successful as the fragment amplified was around 1000 bp.

This is the gel scan of the colony PCR we ran. The order is Ladder, DM, VV, SO, LO, DT, VP, SP, CP, TP, PP, MP, BB.

We then ran a PCR clean up on the four that showed color and did a PCR clean up
Tuesday, 9/6

TU-Delft,2011,Team:TU-Delft#Team#Janneke_-_-_TEXT.html,", we decided what we’ll do. It was still a bit vague….We would like to do something with specific characteristics of mfp5. From now on we were thinking out of the box and find a real clear idea of our project.
Week 17
This week we converged the ten ideas into three main ideas. We gave on Friday a presentation for the advisors, supervisors and some experts-guests from companies.  After the presentation we decided to take into account the advice of all the advisors and decide after the weekend which real topic we’ll do.
Week 16
The focus this week was mainly brainstorming. We had 150 ideas, and we wanted to converge these ideas to maximal 10 ideas.

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#Experiment-LB media preperation (500mL;25 plates)_-_-_TEXT.html," is used. If the LB contains antibiotics: store in a -4oC freezer.
However it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the antibiotics will degrade over time
Part 3 Pouring the plates (if you are making LB agar)
*** While pouring the plates it is crucial to maintain a sterile environment. This should be done in room WB 303, with a sterile environment provided by a lit bunsen burner.
Note: While you are waiting for the autoclave, steps 1-3 can be done in the meantime, in addition to the clean up from Part 1.
Sterilize the workspace with 70% EtOH before depositing your materials. Light the bunsen burner.
Obtain a stack/roll of empty plates. The plates should still be in their plastic sleeve/wrapping, as they should be sterile. Dont throw out the wrapping as it can be used to store the plates. It is essential that you minimize any chance of contaminating the plates. Make sure that you open the package at the top and expose the plates as minimally as possible.
Note that this protocol makes approximately 25 plates.
Once you take the plates out, store them upside down on your lab bench. Label the plates with ""your name-IGEM 2016-date prepared- designated stripe* (if using antibiotic) - media number. Once labelled, you may stack the plates to free up workspace.
Allow the LB media to cool before pouring. The LB will start to settle at about 30oC.
If you are preparing selective media, add antibiotic to the mixture. Use the recommended antibiotic concentrations (see table below). Swirl the flask in a circular motion to mix. If you dont know whether or not you are preparing selective media, ASK.

One stripe along the sides corresponds to CAM, two stripes corresponds to AMP
Take an empty plate and open it slightly. You do not need to open it all the way to pour the agar. When pouring the agar, pour until 2/3 of the plate has been covered, or approximately half of the plate has been filled when viewed from the side. Pour the agar slowly, to prevent the formation of bubbles. Swirl the plate in a circular motion to distribume the media evenly on the plate.
If you pour too much LB, you will only be able to produce <25 plates"

Cell Lysis
Cell Lysis
Summary
Cell lysis is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology. It can be performed through a variety of different methods, however we had focused on chemical cellular lysis. Cell Lysis is used to extract and isolate DNA from a specific type of cell. This is an extremely important step in building genetic circuits in order to utilize specific coding regions in a cell's DNA. Chemical cell lysis involves introducing cells to a series of buffers in order to degrade the cell’s outer membrane and collect the DNA that is released.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform chemical cell lysis. Suspended cells and an lysing buffer would be mixed inside the cell. This mixture of buffer and cells would be then mixed with a neutralization buffer to prevent DNA degradation. The mixture would then move to the diamond chamber where the DNA binds magnetic particles. Lastly, an elution buffer would be input and to clean and release the DNA from the magnetic particles.
Note that the control layer is used as a region to mill a space on the opposite side of the flow layer for an electro-magnet to be implemented.
This chip has been milled, tested and deemed fully fluid functional. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#AntiTermination Section_-_-_TEXT.html,". The fragments created by PCR amplification were purified using a PCR clean-up kit. The amplicon and the linearized backbone plasmid pSB1C3 (containing a chroramphenicol resistance marker) were digested , resulting in sticky ends. This was achieved either by the standard assembly or the three-way ligation approach (3A assembly). Both the digested PCR product and the digested plasmid were run on a gel in order to estimate DNA concentration. T4 ligase was used for ligation with a 5:1 ratio of insert to backbone. After the ligation, the plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent DH5α E. coli cells. After an hour of recovery in LB medium at 37 °C, the cells were plated on LB plates containing chloramphenicol (Cam) and left overnight. Several colonies from the plates were then selected and restreaked on LB+Cam plates in order to assure pure colonies. Overnight cultures of the transformants were made by taking one colony from each restreak and inoculating it in LB+Cam at 37 °C over night. Minipreps were made from the overnight cultures and a verification PCR was run on these in order to make sure that the plasmid had the expected insert.
Construction of BioBrick K374005
This part contains the lambda nutR site, inserted into the backbone plasmid pSB1C3. The lambda nutR site was sythesized by Integrated DNA Technology. In order to construct this part, the standard assembly ligation approach was used. In doing so, the nutR site was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and Pst1 and thereafter ligated into pSB1C3. The nutR site was verified by PCR using primers IG201 (VF2 forward primer) and IG004 (lambda nutR reverse primer). The following parts were taken into consideration when calculating the size of BioBrick K374005:
IG201 + nutR + IG004 tail = 140 + 118 + 26 = 284 base pairs.
Construction of BioBrick K374006
This part contains the lambda N-gene that is responsible for the suppression of transcription termination downstream of part BBa_K374005. The lambda N-gene was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology. As with the construction of K374005, the standard assembly ligation approach was also used in the construction of this part. For size verification, the lambda N-gene was amplified by PCR with primers IG201 and IG006 (lambda N-gene reverse primer)."

Evaluation of the different possibilities is not so simple. The only thing which is clear that there has to be a change and doing nothing is no possibility because the situation is getting worse every day with enormous consequences for marine and terrestrial beings.  When we look at the result it seems that setting bacteria free into marine environment is the only possibility where the situation can directly become better because PET is degraded. The consequences of this action are not predictable and even if the risk is low that bacteria might become harmful for mankind this scenario is non-waivable. Cause of this lack of knowledge it is not responsible to choose this possibility. The use in sewage treatment does not reduce the amount of PET in oceans but it slows the enrichment of PET in rivers. However a semi-open system cannot guarantee that there will be no outburst of bacteria. If this possibility is chosen, it has to be clear that high security standards have to be fulfilled. The only technique which is rated with positive option and bequest values is the use of synthetic bacteria in an industrial facility. Since there is no direct reduction in marine PET concentration, this possibility is only useful in a combination with other techniques which can be used to extract PET from marine environments. Due to its low risks in bacteria outburst and the possibility to use already existing transport and logistics infrastructure this possibility seems makeable.   Like already discussed in previous chapters the option of reducing the amount of PET in marine environment should also lead to a behavioral change in the use of plastic. So a combination of converting PET to Catechol in industrial facilities, filtering PET from sea water and a behavioral change is recommended. Since human behavior is not always grounded on rationality there have to be certain kind of conditions to change this behavior. Two major motivations for humans to change behavior are the improvement of convenience or the reduction of costs. Some attraction can be set to trigger these motivations like increasing the costs of plastic. There is no reason why clothes are packed in plastic bags if these bags are only used by the consumer to transport these from the shop to his home. Paper bags would be enough here. What if salespersons have to pay penalty if they give away plastic bags? Small steps may change a lot here. Looking at the underlying problem a huge amount of PET is used for package. A focus on regional products would help to prevent ecologic cost"

PBS was used because it did not have any color, thus preventing any possibility of autofluorescence. I then add the following to both the LB and PBS tubes: 0uM, 5uM, 10uM, and 50uM of arabinose. After the arabinose have been added, these tubes were incubated for 4 hours. Then, 200uL liquid from the tubes that represent one fluorescent protein was aliquoted into a petri dish. A 2x4 grid was drawn on each petri dish to allow a better observation on the correlation between arabinose concentration and the fluorescent intensity. Despite such efforts, nothing was observed under the UV light.

Summary
GFP devices have been made with 4 different promoters
UV and restriction mapping are done to verify the GFP devices
pBad-GFP device did not fluoresce after being induced with arabinose
pCat-GFP device did not fluoresce at all times
After the weekend transformation of the ligation reactions (each containing GFP and a unique promoter), I found out that 2 plates (E0240_I13453 & E0240_R0040) contained numerous colonies while the other 2 plates (E0240_R2000 & E0240_I14033) only contained a few colonies. The plates with pTet (R0040) and R2000 had colonies with green tint. These colonies were then grown in liquid culture with the corresponding antibiotic added into it (plasmid preparation). Four tubes of liquid culture were prepared for four colonies from each plate. This step was done to assess if the parts were ligated correctly or if there is any false positive that results from plasmids religating to itself. In the meantime, I figured out that fluorescence protein will shine under the UV light. While you could see the green hue of the colonies, UV will allow the fluorescence to have a more intense visibility. It appeared that only GFP with pTet and R2000 fluoresced. It made sense that a device containing pBad was not supposed to fluoresce unless it was induced with arabinose. Nevertheless, the device containing the pCat constitutive promoter did not fluoresce either. At this moment, I assume that maybe pCat did not work with GFP although it worked very well with RFP. All the plasmid preps were found to be cloudy on the next day, signifying proper bacterial amplification. From the"

An infection related to an implant has big consequences for the patients, and the surgery has to be redone. There is no way to remove the biofilm caused by the infection, and a new implant is needed.
A biofilm consisting of non-pathogenic bacteria provides a hospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria.
Summary of interview
We met Marthe Lind Kroknes, a biomedical laboratory scientist with a master in molecular medicine, at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim. She gave valuable information about infections in hip prosthesis and where she believes biofilms increase the risk of infections.
In 2017, about 750 prostheses surgeries was performed at St. Olavs hospital in Trondheim and 19 of the patients had an infection after the surgery. Those infections did not necessarily occur because of biofilm formation, but it might very well have been a contributing factor.
Kroknes told us that in some cases where infections around prostheses are untreatable with antibiotics, they usually remove the implant and redo the surgery. It is unfortunate for the patients to redo the surgery as it is a huge burden to go through another procedure.
Biofilms are not only a problem because of the pathogenic bacteria, but it also makes it difficult to run diagnostics. Even when the biofilms consist mainly of non-pathogenic bacteria, it makes a very hospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria. Thus, it could be difficult to kill even a small part of pathogenic bacteria in the biofilm. Those bacteria are even more dangerous considering that some of the patients have a somewhat weakened immune system.
An efficient method for prevention of biofilm formation would be of great benefit for both doctors and patients. From the interview we learned about how biofilms can increase risk of infections and how big the consequences can be for patients. This gave us new insight about the possible applications of our project.

RecA Project Sensor Project Reporter Project
Abstract
     Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor or the Chernobyl reactor. Penn State’s team project will focus on using a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to develop a robust and reliable biosensor which utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch coupled with a fast-acting reporter capable of producing an easily visible effect. We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.
     Our hope is that the basis of our biological dosimeter system will prove to be an effective genetic system capable of detecting harmful levels of radiation and relaying it to those working in the field or affected area. We envision our system not only being useful in such applications, but also being capable of further expansion and evolution through the expanding field of synthetic biology.
Overall project: Bacterial Dosimeter
Radiation of one form or another is a constant presence throughout our every day lives. Radiation, or the transmission and absorption of energy over a given distance, has proven an invaluable technology useful in applications for everything from heating our food to diagnosing and treating diseases. Some forms of radiation, however, can be detrimental to the human body, as they are a common cause of such diseases as radiation poisoning and cancer.
All types of radiation can be divided into two categories: non-ionizing and ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation (consisting of radio, micro, infrared, and visible electromagnetic waves) contains less energy and has a relatively small effect on living organisms that has only recently been studied. Ionizing radiation, however, contains a much greater amount of energy capable of ionizing atoms which can lead to harmful effects on living tissue. This category of radiation encompasses alpha and beta decay as well as neutron, X-ray, and gamma radiation.
Our project focuses on detecting the degradation and damage of DNA associated with ionizing radiation. The initial proposed design is shown below. It consists of two parts: a sensor based on a lambda phage bistable switch, and a fast-acting reporter similar to the reporter designed by the Imperial College of London 2010 iGEM team.

This calculation is assuming 100% catalytic efficiency of conversion from perchlorate to oxygen. This provided us with a benchmark of what the goal would be for oxygen production.
Over the course of the last 4 months, our team was able to clone and express a synthesized form of the Cld gene in E.coli. The cloning was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. We have shown preliminary data to suggest that our recombinant bacteria are capable of producing O2 from chlorite added to pure culture. Although the efficiency of oxygen production was low, we believe that there are multiple ways to optimize our production using a variety of means.  Additionally, we have also developed a method for the recycling of Martian colony biowaste into a highly enriched media and have demonstrated its capability to support bacterial growth. A detailed description of our data is presented in the results section.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"ens there are two exonucleases homologous to those of E. coli and V. cholera. They are called Dns and ExeM.
Figure 1:Alignment of dns with the exonucleases dns from V. cholerae and endA from E. coli. The alignment was created with the program ClustalX 2.0.10.
In the alignment of the V. natriegens dns with the V. cholerae dns and E. coli endA you can conclude that the three proteins are highly conserved among the three strains. The intermediate region and the C-terminus are highly conserved in all three proteins, while the N-terminus is variable. This suggests that the parts that are highly conserved are important for the function of nucleases. It can be concluded that the dns of V. natriegens has a very similar function to the two exonucleases of the other two organisms.
Figure 2:Alignment of exeM with the exonucleases xds from V. cholerae. The alignment was created with the program ClustalX 2.0.10.
The most parts of the two proteins ExeM from V. natriegens and Xds from V. cholerae are conserved, but both the N- and the C-Terminal vary a lot from each other. This suggests that the function of these two proteins has a similar function. Thus we can assume that it is very probable that the ExeM protein in V. natriegens behaves like the Xds from V. cholera. Because of this it is very important to delete this protein otherwise the DNA would be degraded.   In 2016, Matthew T Weinstock showed that the quality of isolated plasmid DNA could be improved by deleting dns in V. natriegens (Weinstocket al.2016) . In addition, the growth and viability of cells with a deletion of dns in rich medium should not be impaired (Daliaet al.2017) .
After we made all these thoughts, we were able to start and plan the deletion of the exonucleases Dns and ExeM. We constructed cassettes to erase the genes. To first get to know the method and to check whether the natural transformation works as it has already been shown in our hands, we have started to knock out the dns. For this we constructed a cassette with a chloramphenicol resistance and the upstream and downstream region of the dns gene. To use the natural transformation it is enough to use"

It is to be noted that it is written that the dilution is 10^(-1). This is an annotation mistake. At the beginning we did not counted the initial dilution of the soil sample in water. We have considered that our original sample was 1g of soil in 9mL of water.
Results after a week in liquid medium
With dilution of 10(-2) and 10(-3), in quercetin glucose and in M9 quercetin, there was fungal growth and as the medium was less yellow, it seems that quercetin was partly degraded.
Tube with quercitin
Tube with fungal growth (dilution 10^(-2),medium M9Q)
As our laboratory didn't have at this moment a working experience with fungi, we decided to keep the plates at 4°C before working with them, hoping to find bacterias meanwhile.
Week 8th-14th August
Filamentous fungi lab practice
We looked for protocol to work safely with fungi. We found a quite complete fungi protocol book ""Laboratory protocol in fungal biology"" (M. Ayyachamy and al). There was a safety part. The more important was to prevent spore contamination, knowing that ethanol is not sufficient to kill fungal spores.
A way to disinfect the hood needed to be found. It was said in the book to disinfect with bleach between every experiment and , at the end of the day, to disinfect during 20 minutes with a strong disinfectant like those used in hospitals.
We were able to obtain the disinfectant SURFA’SAFE preminim of the laboratory Anios from the microbiologist of Cochin.
It was decided with our advisor to disinfect with bleach between each work with fungi.
Disinfect during 20 minutes with anios was performed each time a member had finished to use fungi.
Quercetin analysis
We still tried to solubilize quercetin. In fact, quercitin was almost insoluble, even at a concentration of 1mg/L, the quercetin precipitated. We tried to heat it but after 1 hour, the quercetin was still not solubilized.
We thought that the solubility of the molecule was of 200g/L so we were very surprised. We looked again on Sigma Aldrich information and that was actually the solubility in DMSO, an organic solvent, which explain our negative results.
The insolubility of quercetin didn't seem to be"

BioLector
To characterize our constructs we have used BioLector apparatus, friendly provided by the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at DTU. BioLector is an innovative device allowing up to 96 fermentations simultaneously, also of aerobic cultures. Utilization of multi-parameter plates allows measurement of various biological parameters. OD and fluorescence in our cell cultures is detected through the transparent bottom of the plates. Detection of pH and DO (oxygen partial pressure) is also possible through optodes (optical sensors) positioned in the bottom of the wells. All of these parameters can be monitored and visualized for further analysis. In our project the BioLector has been used to measure the levels of expression of GFP and RFP in bacterial cultures over time. The biomass of the cells has also been estimated by measuring scattered light.

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," helices and the regulatory C-terminus. This mutant of AtNHX1 is more efficient and is not negatively regulated, resulting in higher sequestration.
AVP1
To increase the efficiency of this channel we will additionally integrate the protein encoded by AVP1 into the vacuolar membrane of S.cerevisiae.
Cation antiporters like AtNHX1 or NHX1 mediate the transport of solutes from the cytosol into the vacuolar lumen against their concentration gradient using the proton gradient over the       vacuolar membrane (or prevacuolar compartment membrane in case of NHX1) [37].  In yeast, this proton gradient is generated by the membrane bound H+-ATPase that uses ATP to       translocate protons into the vacuole and thus acidifies this compartment [38]. In principle, by increasing the availability of protons through an enhanced expression of the      vacuolar H+-ATPase the sequestration of ions in the vacuole should increase [39]. But the overexpression of vacuolar H+-ATPase would be difficult because the yeast vacuolar       H+-ATPase is a multi-subunit protein [40]. Each of the subunits would have to be overexpressed exactly at the right level at the same time to get an increased activity of the       complex protein [41].
Fig.9: AVP1 uses pyrophosphate to pump protons into the vacuole thus causing acidification of this compartment. The proton gradient can be used by secondary active transporters like AtNHXS1 to pump ions into the vacuole against their concentration gradient.
In contrast to yeast, the proton electrochemical gradient across the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) of Arabidopsis thaliana is generated by two proteins, the plant vacuolar H+-ATPase and AVP1,       the vacuolar membrane bound H+-pyrophosphatase, which is encoded by only a single gene [42]. AVP1, as a vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase, hydrolyses cytosolic inorganic pyrophosphate       (PPi) to orthophosphate (Pi) to use the derived energy to actively pump protons into the vacuole (Figure 9) [43–45]. This process not only reduces the cytosolic PPi concentration, but more       importantly acidifies the vacuole [46,47]. The difference in electrochemical potential for protons across the tonoplast, generated by the vacu"

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," cells binds to target beads, this still us allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of our detection approach, which is a significant result (see confocal data).
In the assay containing Device 2 with beads, there was an increase in the percentage of Population 3 (coloured in blue), from 0.1 to 2.2. This is suggestive of representing our Device 2 cells bound to silica beads. In contrast, the assay, which contained only Device 2 cells, had an insignificant percentage of Population 3 (0.1%).
This suggests that our Device may successfully be binding to the silica beads, utilizing the INP+Si4 construct, however not in all cases. This could either be due to not having enough time for binding totake place, or that our Si4 binding domain is not as effective as it should be - due to either under expression, or a weak binding domain.
Confocal Microscopy
Cells expressing Device 2 (which includes both pCpxR+GFP and INP+Si4) were grown either overnight (18 h) or to mid-log phase (4 h) either in the presence of 5 micron diameter beads or without beads present. Cells and/or beads were then analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, the results of which are shown here. For each panel, the image on the left is a fluorescence image acquired through a 500 nm long-pass filter under 488 nm excitation and the images on the right is the corresponding bright field image that has been overlaid with the fluorescence image.
For cells grown to the mid-log phase (5 h), GFP expression resulting from pCpxR activation is observed in both in the -beads control sample as well as the +beads experimental sample. Dividing bacteria are highlighted in magenta in the confocal images for the 5 h -bead control sample, highlighting that the likely source of membrane stress and pCpxR activation at this growth stage: membrane dynamics associated with cell replication.
At 18 h incubation relatvely little GFP expression is observed in the both the +bead experimental sample and -bead control sample. However, in the +bead experimental sample has higher levels of GFP expression and highly fluorescent cells are occasionally observed bound to the surface of the silica microbeads (magenta highlights in the +beads, +device sample). The low fraction of observed successful devices is probably due to issue with the Si4 binding, a conclusion that agrees with both flow cytometry, which showed only 2% binding, and SEM, which yielded only a few cases of mineralized"

Molecular Dynamics modelling
We used molecular dynamics methods, in particular umbrella sampling, to identify a priori which strains of B. subtilis would be more susceptible to spirofloxacin. Thus, when the antibiotic was in its active state it would have a higher wild-type vs mutant killing ratio. However, due to the lack of consistent results in its experimental phase we decided not to continue with the photoswitchable antibiotic approach.

Encryption and Decryption machine
The encryption and decryption machine can convert data into strings of DNA. Furthermore it can encrypt and decrypt the data using the Rijndael algorithm. It can also consider forbidden sequences such as restriction enzyme cutting sites. For now, extremely long datasets take up significantly longer. Further code optimization can fix this inconvenience.

Belief-desire-intention model (BDI)
The BDI model simulates the behavior of the potential users of CryptoGErM. Computational Agents are programmed according to an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) architecture and placed into a virtual scenario where they compete for saving and sending a top secret message. By observing their A.I. behavior we understood how to make CryptoGErM as safe and effective as possible. We obtained a concrete proof that creating the whole system around multiple security layers was the best strategy to follow.

Random mutations modelling
This model explores the role of random mutations in the Bacillus subtilis bacteria. Considering how the encrypting and storing works, we have created a software which is able to virtually replace parts of the bacteria's DNA and check if the stored data would have been affected by a mutation. Out of 1,000 simulations this happened only 3 times, so we deduced that our system is 99.97%"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html,". The low cost energy solution is a good alternative for CFPS. A cost estimation revealed: When Hexametaphosphate and maltodextrin substitute for PEP and Na-oxalate, the costs for a 15 µL reaction (reagents only) are reduced by about 20%.
However, the output signal obtained with the low cost energy solution can not compete with the signal from our fully optimized PEP-based system, as you can see in the nearby graph. The advantage is that one surely can optimize the low cost energy solution system as well ( Caschera and Noireaux, 2015a ), albeit this was not the aim of our project.
Result Summary
Our CFPS Achievements – At a Glance
We established CFPS methods and protocols for the iGEM community.
We managed to produce high amounts of superfolder GFP in self-made E. coli extract.
We optimized our extract in terms of performance, that is: It is robust, fast and even works on paper.
We successfully modelled the cell extract in simbiology.
Our extract contains vanishingly low amounts of living cells. However, after a final treatment of the extract, we did not observe even one living cell.
We tested the effect of various heavy metals and date rape drugs on cell-free protein synthesis.
CFPS builds the basis for our functional and extensible cell-free biosensor.
Our CFPS Achievements - More Detailed
Based on literature screening and hints from experts, we combined cell-free protein synthesis methods and protocols to a functional setup. Cell extract of different E. coli strains can hereby be easily tested for CFPS suitability in high-throughput manner, like pioneered by Kwon and Jewett . The methods and protocols are available for everyone in our protocols section .
A translation enhancing 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) was designed based on literature. With 5'-UTR employed, reporter expression increased drastically, as well in vivo as in vitro.
At a scale as little as 15 µL, we managed to express sfGFP in vitro in no time at high efficiency. The accessibility of this cell-free system towards optimization was exemplified by addition of the protein RraA to the reaction. RraA addition lead to an increase in final fluorescence signal of 33.8 ± 4.5 %, what was consistent with the literature ( Airen, 2011 ). Our CFPS setup builds an open environment that easily can further be optimized depending on purpose.
When we used our optimized self-made cell extract, in vitro sfGFP production was superior to commercially"

Ashlee picked 12 colonies from the dCas9-Plasmid 1 ligation for overnight.
Designed new Reverse inverse PCR primer and put it into the cart to order.
Sunday, July 13, 2014
Ashlee plasmid prepped the 12 dCas9-Plasmid 1 colonies and digested them with AclI and EcoRI-HF. These two restriction sites are only present in the dCas9 system, and so only successful ligations will result in two bands on a gel. Any self-ligations should result with only one band on a gel.
Back to Top
Monday, July 14, 2014
Ashlee ran the dCas9-Plasmid 1 digestions on a gel to confirm that dCas9 was inserted. We were expecting bands around 8 kb and 1 kb, but instead all 12 colonies showed bands around 8 kb and 3 kb. This is very odd, and we are hoping that there is some other restriction site that is not reflected on our plasmid map or the backbone is larger than we originally thought, as plasmid maps are often inaccurate. We talked with Dr. Salis and he advised us to proceed and digest the plasmid with the restriction enzymes we will use to excise the cassette containing dCas9, run an analytical gel to determine whether our cassette is the right size, and then attempt homologous recombination in P. putida. We digested the plasmid with AvrII and PacI. We will send 7 colonies for sequencing tomorrow. Ashlee and Emily edited the presentation for Center for Science and the Schools.
Investigated method of using PCR assembly to create a strand of ds DNA containing the dRBS. This method requires a long top strand and a primer, which would be used in PCR to create the ds DNA. Problem is that the top strand is longer than 50 bp and very expensive. Designs are completed, but tentative decision reached to stick with the annealed oligos method unless it proves to be difficult.

Tsinghua-A,2017,Team:Tsinghua-A#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," trial within university. We let the project step out from our discipline. We held a cross-discipline seminar delivering lectures on cutting-edge scientific discovery related to synthetic biology and introduced our project, through which we harvest massive creative ideas and comments. Click to see in detail.
Figure 2: Seminar on campus
    Then we made our way to the public. Before it, under the guidance of biotechnological company’s planning staff, we got fully prepared by making related resources including exhibition boards, leaflets, souvenir stickers and postcards ready. What’s more, to make the activity more interactive and engaging, we took fully advantage of our visualization tool, the two games derived from project idea and modeling results. We optimized their function under the guidance of professional game designers from ‘Perfect World’. Click to see in detail.
Figure 3: A visit to Perfect World
    Finally, we made a hit at China Science and Technology Museum by holding a workshop named “Deciphering Life” that targets both adults and children. We propagated synthetic biology to adults by displaying exhibition and delivering explanation. For children, we had playful workshop activities including engaging art design, DNA model building and web game section with the hope to inspire their affection towards science and research. We got precious feedback from different groups. Staffs from the museum reminded us about the rigorous nature of science and we should balance between rigorousness and joyfulness when we choose the methodology in our activity. We were also inspired by children for more possibility in considering the influence of spatial factors on population interactions that may be helpful for our future work. Click to see in detail.

    On campus, we also discussed our project with professors in the field of microbial biology. We finally confirmed three characters (farmer, warrior and beggar) for our project together. We especially want to express our appreciation for Professor Xie and Wang who provided us lots of advice in introducing and completing the character beggar whose prototype in nature is “cheater”.

So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share. The most likely progression of dNANO would be first to patent the technology. Once we own the exclusive rights, TEC would then suggest connecting with industry partners who we would licence our toolkit to. Alternatively, TEC also suggested an option to a be likely route, where we would give the company exclusive rights to our technology for 1-2 years. In this time, logistical aspects would be dealt with the company such as scaling up production or further developing the technology in house. We would then licence out the technology to company once the option expires. TEC has also given insights into how other factors can play a role in whether startup is successful or not. For example, does the technology in question address a market need? If not, then demand for such a technology will not exist and the startup will fail. Other pitfalls, are that start-ups fail to recognize how long it takes for technology to become commercialized and end up bleeding themselves out financially. At the moment, the market share for nanotechnology has been slow, however most efforts are focussed on drug delivery. Perhaps, future innovations in DNA origami should be directed at novel drug delivery methods?
As a project that originated from the university, share of the venture would be divided in a way where a third is assigned to the university, a third is assigned to the inventors and the last third is assigned to the party that is responsible for commercialization. So if the inventors choose to commercialize their technology independently, they would have 2/3s of the company share."

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project"
Stanford,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,", Ganoderma Lucidum mycelia growth over 4 different temperature conditions
Mycelium Glue & Mycelium Based Bio-Filtration
In addition to developing mycelium as a material for habitat construction in space, we were also able to functionalize the material by synthesizing fusion proteins that linked a chitin binding domain (CBD) to various different functional proteins. The CBD binds chitin, which makes up the outer cell wall of fungus and our mycelium material, thus allowing CBD fusion proteins to bind to our mycelium. Among our most successful fusion proteins were the CBD fused to three copper binding domains and the CBD fused to the bacterial biofilm adhesion protein csgA.
When the CBD-copper binding fusion protein was applied to our mycelium, it allowed it to act as a scalable, completely biodegradable filtration system for waste metal recovery from aqueous solution. Copper was used as a proof of concept for metal binding, as it is a metal of significant biological and economic importance, as well as a part of many circuit boards and a known contaminant in water. We demonstrated the copper-binding capacity of our mycelium filter system using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a Phen Green copper concentration assay (Figures 5 and 6). These quantitative tests demonstrated our mycelium filter’s ability to bind 92% of the available copper in 30 minutes.
Another successful CBD fusion protein we synthesized the was CBD-csgA protein, which yielded an effective and mycelium-specific bioadhesive. We demonstrated this by conducting lap shear adhesive strength tests and comparing the relative strength of the adhesive on different materials like mycelium and cardboard (Figure 7).
Figure 5: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1.

The Macquarie Australia team is far from your typical iGEM team. Our team consists of a total of 33 undergraduate students who are required to involve themselves with the iGEM competition in order to complete a Biomolecular Sciences major. This allows the students to experience the hands-on approach to the whole scientific process; from funding, to wet lab, to documentation and reporting. Macquarie is one of the few teams to continue the work of previous years by building on the achievements of past teams.
Our semester kicked off to a late start on the 1st of August, 2016. Not only was this the first time our team had officially met but it was also the first time that most of our team had ever heard of the iGEM competition. All students that participate in Team Macquarie have the opportunity to choose the extent to which they would like to be involved with the team. This fact, along with the short time we have known each other, makes communication and collaboration a constant but rewarding challenge.
The way we participate in this unit, means our team itself is essentially a form of outreach and engagement because it is not only educating students about iGEM but pushes students to actually participate in the competition. Alumni from our past iGEM Macquarie Australia teams actively participate, having experienced it themselves the years before. Some of these students have moved on to post graduate studies in the department, such as our advisor Edward Moh (2011 Macquarie Australia team) who had been instructing our iGEM teams since 2012, during his PhD candidature. To further continue this legacy, we have started educating second year students who are enrolled in biomolecular science units. If these students decide to complete a major in biomolecular sciences, they will already have a basic knowledge of synthetic biology and the iGEM experience."

Side (left) and bottom (right) views of Mtd monomer in yellow with variable repeat region highlighted in purple.
It is important to mention that the screening methods will vary depending on the nature of the desired target – a different setup can be used to screen for binding against free-floating proteins than proteins fixed to a surface.  A pre-clear (negative selection) step may be necessary if a pre-specified target will be bound to beads or a defined matrix. For example, if beads are to be loaded with the desired target, the sample should first be run through the beads alone as a control. The flow-through can then be collected and used in the final screen. There are multiple approaches we can take to test binding of our library to E. coli and determine which screening method is most efficient. These include applying our sample over a lawn of E. coli, into a liquid culture solution, or to a target-immobilized bound to a scaffold

VIVATECH
Viva Technology is a commercial fair dedicated to technological innovations in Paris. On may 24th, we attended the “welcome to the bionic age” conference hosted by David Aguilar Amphoux, Moran Cerf, and Ernesto Martinez Villalpando. During one hour, they spoke about bionic prosthesis and how to make, use and connect them directly to the human brain.

Biofilms 8
Members of our team flew to Denmark to attend Biofilms 8 conference held in May 27-29 in Aarhus University. The conference gathered experts from all around the world in the field of bacterial communities and biofilm way of life. We presented our poster during poster sessions to biologists, doctors, and engineers. This conference allowed us to further exchange with Françoise Van Bambeke, Doctor in Pharmaceutical Science at the University of Louvain, Belgium, who has been working for years on the pharmacological fight against biofilm. Exchanging with her confirmed us that acting on Quorum sensing to avoid biofilm formation could be an efficient approach, and she advised us to try to investigate on the advantages of our synthetic biology approach compared to classic pharmacologic solutions.

ICOE Bordeaux
Few members of the team also participated in the 14th International Conference on Organic Electronics being held on June 18-22 in Bordeaux. ICOE brought together the most excellent researchers from the academy as well as industry to discuss fundamental aspects of organic semiconductors, demonstrate their vision of the road-map of organic electronics and to exchange ideas on future materials, technologies and applications. You may ask yourself why our team attended this conference full of physicists and chemists. For our system, we were looking for a membrane capable of confining our biofilm and conduct a signal at the same time. During this 3-days conference, we presented our project during a poster session and met many scientists who advised us to use PEDOT, a conductive polymer and who also advised us on the type of cells we should use, such as Dr. Sahika Inal, assistant professor at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and Dr. Róisín M. Owens, currently engineering for developing in vitro biological models.

Edinburgh,2010,Team:Edinburgh#Bacterial#Red light producer_-_-_TEXT.html," major points that need to be emphasised when using this BioBrick are the temperature sensitivity of the luciferase, and its pH sensitivity. During the first part of the project, the cells were grown at 37C. When we tested growing them at 30C, the temperature sensitivity of the protein became evident, since the cells were a lot brighter - rather than waiting 10 minutes in the dark room to get our eyes accustomed, they were visible before the door was closed.
pH sensitivity of the Photinus pyralis luciferase has been reported previously (Seliger and McElroy, 1964) . The cells were usually suspended in citrate buffer, pH 4.8, as this allows the luciferin to enter the cells faster. This has an effect on the colour emitted, though not as marked as for the wildtype.
Figure 4: The light emissions of our S284T mutated firefly luciferase, BioBricked as BBa_K322246 .
Figure 4 above shows the distinct red colour of the S284T mutated luciferase (taken at pH 4).

It is indicated that the liquid crystals are still mostly                             arranged                             vertically. The critical concentration for changing the liquid crystal from the vertical                             alignment to the parallel alignment was not found, but it was found that the antibody                             concentration of 10 ng/mL or less did not cause a change in the color of the liquid                             crystal.

Explore the appropriate antibody concentration
Time:
23 Aug: Antibody concentration 125ng/ml. Antibody concentration 2000ng/ml.
Since the preliminary experiment for exploring the appropriate antibody concentration did not                             find a critical value of the antibody concentration that can change the alignment of the                             liquid                             crystal, it is known from the search that the concentration of the antibody below 10 ng/mL                             does                             not affect the liquid crystal alignment, so we refer to the literature and related research.                             It                             is recommended by field personnel to select a concentration of 500 ng/mL as the initial                             antibody concentration for detecting the antigen. Since the amount of antigen (β2-MG) in                             the urine of our                             current patients with chronic kidney disease is 125 ng/mL in unit conversion, we hope to                             determine the optimal antibody critical concentration by antigen concentration so that the                             concentration is lower than 125 ng/mL. The antigen does not allow the liquid crystals to be                             aligned in parallel, while antigens at concentrations above 125 ng/mL just align the liquid                             crystals in parallel.
Therefore, our team selected 125 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL antigen concentrations for                             experiments. The number of bright spots in 0.125 ng/mL-2 ng/mL parallel light images                             increased                             accordingly, but the overall color was black, and the difference was not large enough                             (Figure                             3). Not enough to determine the standard line of detection. (Note: due to 1000 ng/mL data                             file                             corruption, not shown in the figure)

Time:
25 Aug: Antibody concentration 500ng/ml.
Since the previous experiments used high antibody concentration or high antigen                             concentration,                             the liquid crystals could not be arranged in parallel to discolor the observation. We                             reflect on                             whether the concentration of DMOAP in the"

Then moving on to a more informed audience during conferences and scientific events (such as the Zika summit and the “Festival Vivant” where we presented our project in front of the public, generating a constructive discussion. And finally, we did our best at sparking the public’s interest by reaching out to them through polls, both online and on the street. We would like to believe these exchanges resulted in a win-win situation, since both our team and the public learnt a lot from these interactions. (evidence) Entrepreneurship: The cross-track entrepreneurship prize recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges! participation to a summer school on management/creation of start-ups, discussion with IP and technology transfer service of IP and with Civic Drone about how to setup a start-up. (evidence) Applied Design: Teams of art and design students with input from scientific advisors can use art to drive their iGEM projects, while also making scientific contributions. We are looking for projects that use art and design to consider and explore current and future implications of synthetic biology (including stakeholders, communication, pedagogy, thinking outwards). ideation (brainstorming, debates, discussion, bibliography, creation) of effective traps and analysis kit. Imagination of functionalization of a patch to transform it into a detection device : design of a fusion protein, a biosilica cellulose composite nanomaterial, an immunological assay to detect viral antigens. Design of a trapping system, an analysis device, a simulation of a mapping application. (evidence) Software tool: Computers have been around for a long time. Why don't we have more, great software tools to help everyone engineer synthetic biological systems based on standard biological parts? creation of a user interface to report data and access to data base.

Goals
To screen soil samples from around the world for microbes that naturally degrade anthocyanin.
To identify enzymes linked to the most efficient anthocyanin eaters.
Results
We collected species from all around the world through iGEM collaborations.
186 bacteria were tested for degradation of quercetin.
174 bacteria were identified by 16s rRNA sequencing.
4 promising species were selected for whole genome sequencing.
Candidate enzymes were identified from genome sequence, and passed to the enzyme group.
Methods
Microbe cultivation
Anthocyanin purification
Anthocyanin & quercetin measurement
16S rRNA sequencing
Whole genome sequencing
Phylogenetic analysis
Abstract
Anthocyanins, the key pigments found in red wine, are abundant in grapes, berries, flowers and many plants. Like all naturally ocurring metabolites, they eventually biodegrade and re-enter the carbon cycle. In this project, we search nature for enzymatic pathways that can break down anthocyanins into simpler, unpigmented molecules. We reasoned that microbes living in the soil near vineyards were likely to catabolize and consume anthocyanin. Therefore we collected soil samples from 10 vinyards around France, Europe and the world, notably with the help of our fellow iGEM teams. In total we isolated 186 strains through selective and non-selective plating on different media. All of the strains were identified by 16s rRNA sequencing, then characterized for their ability to degrade quercetin, a compound structurally similar to anthocyanin. By phylogenetic analysis, we were able to connect quercetin degradation to specific bacterial phyla and genus including Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Lysinibacillus and Oerskovia. The most effective strains were further characterized by whole genome sequencing to identify enzymes linked to natural quercetin degradation. By bioprospecting with the help of the worldwide iGEM community, we were able to find the best stain fighting enzymes that nature has to"

While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

Tongji-China
Late in August, Tongji University hosted a Community Open Night for iGEM teams in Shanghai, which was a workshop for us to communicate with each other. The night was a great success and gave the Shanghai teams a chance for collaboration and communication.

4. Knock-out acs + insert pta
The purpose of the final knock-out and insertion construct (Figure 5) is to increase the acetate production in Synechocystis by knocking out acs and overexpressing pta [3].
Figure 5. Construct for simultaneous knock-out of Acs and insertion of Pta.
All the primers used for this construct are shown in Table 5. The fragments are almost the same as in construct 3, expect the overhangs of the fragments and the pta gene (amplified from genomic DNA of Synechocystis) which replaced the mRFP1.
Table 5. Primers used for generating the fragments for the acs knock-out and pta insertion. Uppercase characters hybridize to the template, while the lowercase characters contain the overlapping overhang to the fragment within the parenthesis in the primer name. The numbering of the primers indicates which constructs it can be used for.

Our high school student Furkan Bestepe who has undergone a training period of two years has become a member of our team Atoms Turkiye. Below: AUC Turkey Project Description.
Big budgets and significant amounts of energy are annually allocated to cooling systems. Also, these cooling processes are one of the factors of environmental distruption. The aim of our project, BactoCooler, is to accomplish a highly efficient and low cost cooling without distrupting nature’s magnificient balance through the usage of the most common form of life on Earth, bacteria. BactoCooler contains a special RNA Thermometer which allows translation after a specific temperature. This initiates the production of the urease enzyme which is responsible in the breakdown of urea. This organic endothermic reaction results in the significant cooldown of the environment.
