In this explaratory analysis we could also observe that in the past Wikis were composed mainly of different sections than today. We observed a descrease in the use of the headers (“abstract”,“lab notebook”, “wet lab”). This may be because iGEM standardized the structure of the Wikis at some point during this period. Now, wikis contain sections like (“summary”,“overview”,“notebook”,“collaboration”), that belong tot his new structure. Of note because of this changes, we observed a lot of new terms appear because of the presence of references in the wikis.

BCCS-Bristol,2008,Team:BCCS-Bristol#Notebook-Progress_-_-_TEXT.html," the bacteria adhered to the bead will stop chemotaxing. Indeed, bacteria that adhere to the bead because of short or long-range co-ordination will also stop chemotaxing soon after they reach and adhere to the bead. There would be two ways around this problem: either we stop CpxR switching off chemotaxis by knocking-out the two binding regions that allow CpxR to downregulate the two operons downregulating the chemotactic genes, or we place these genes (eight of them) under the control of an activating CpxR region. In the time remaining, neither of these are achievable. Furthermore, it is likely that there are additional unknown genes required for chemotaxis, that are also downreguated by CpxR upon adhesion, therefore there is a good chance that neither strategy would work initially. As our experimental work has not yet confirmed whether bacteria adhered to beads, and able to chemotax, can actually direct bead movement towards a goal chemoattractant, at the least we would require the modelling work to suggest that this was indeed possible before any effort was made to maintain chemotaxis upon adhesion by either of the above strategies.
In light of this, the focus of the lab work will move towards producing proof-of-concept BioBricks that will allow us to demonstrate the communication of an adhesion event from an adhered to an unadhered bacteria. This can be achieved  making extensive use of the available BioBricks. Specifically, sender cells (cells that have adhered to beads and are trying to communicate with unadhered cells), will contain the LuxI-GFP portion of BBa_J37015, fused downstream of a CpxR responsive promoter (modified from current version fused to LacZ provided courtesy of T.Silhavy, Princeton). Upon adhesion to beads, LuxI will produce AHL, which will diffuse into the medium, while GFP will give confirmation that the transcript is working. For receiver cells we will test both BBa_T9002 and BBa_I731014, which produce GFP and mCherry respectively upon activation by AHL. We will also BioBrick the CpxR responsive promoter itself, and aim to fuse BBa_E0840 (GFP) to the CxpR responsive promoter, creating a nice visual assay for adhesion (the CpxR-LuxI-GFP BioBrick will also do this, but producing AHL in addition may not be ideal for certain future applications). Therefore in total we aim to produce 3 BioBricks in total.

In our E. coli acetosyringone sensing system several parts derived from different organisms were assembled.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens
Figure 1: Image by Martha Hawe
The model organism A. tumefaciens is a soil bacterium and can be found at nearly every place in the world. Agrobacteria became known as a phyto-pathogen leading to the crown gall disease in dicotyledonous species ( DeCleene M and DeLay J, 1976 ). The infection is caused by a gene transfer system located on an extrachromosomal element, the Ti-plasmid. Furthermore, the infection can be divided into several steps: The first step is the localisation of the hurt plant by the bacteria. Predominantely A. tumefaciens senses phenolic compunds from hurt plants, but also aldose monosaccharides, low pH and low phosphate ( Palmer AG. et al.2004 ; Brencic A and Winans SC, 2005 ). When A. tumefaciens recognizes phenols with the VirA receptor, a signal transduction cascade is initiated leading to the expression of virulence genes. The next step is a physical interaction with the host plant. A type three secretion system is responsible for the DNA transfer of the Ti-plasmid from the bacterium into the host. The DNA is translocated to the nucleus, leading to the gene expression and the production of opin. A. tumefaciens uses the reprogrammed plant cells for metabolite production and therefore as a nutrient supplier.
For biotechnological purposes the Ti-plasmid was disharmed. Instead of the native transfer region (T-region) and a gene of interest could be easily introduced into the Ti-plasmid. Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer is one of the most commonly used techniques of plant transformation ( Ziemienowicz A, 2001 ).
Native receptor
A. tumefaciens needs a precise recognition system for potential hosts to gain an evolutionary advance. The native sensing system is a two-component phospho-relay system in which VirA is a transmembrane-bound sensor while VirG is the intracellular response regulator ( Wolanin PM et al., 2002 ). The two genes for the sensing system are virA and virG ( Stachel SE and Nester EW, 198"

When asked about when we improve the effective ingredients of natural medicine program, about 80% of people backed, think this is raising the popularity of natural medicines, conducive to disease control and prevention, and promote the positive role in drug development.
Ⅱ. Questionnaire survey shows that people support the development of biotechnology, think life science research should be more focus on two aspects of medical and health and environmental protection. But for synthetic biology or IGEM, but not many people know about. At the same time, on health, the vast majority of people have awareness of disease prevention, but not for all kinds of diseases and health knowledge too much understanding. When people is choosing drugs more trust in natural medicine, think they have a lot of advantage. And about our project to increase the effective components in natural drugs output, people is more of a support attitude.
MOOC
The number of students who accessed our mooc study platform has reached to 70,000.
Our courses consist of seven major sections—iGEM’s introduction, modern molecular biology, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, current protocols, wiki web making and iGEM’s information search. We have created a comprehensive course system which is good at deepening students’ understanding of our courses.
Our MOOC videos consist of iGEM’s introduction, basics of synthetic biology and design of WIKI making with the view of letting more people be involved in iGEM by learning our online courses!
iGEM was founded by MIT in 2003. It is a top international academic competition in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims to re-design the current natural biological system and build artificial biological parts and system to create a new biological system. The design and making of WIKI has given us the most humanistic vision experience and offered us an optimal project display platform with the interaction of science and humanity.
Besides our teaching materials, we have also made our teaching videos to help people get to know more about our project. Some relevant questions have also been given to assist students to strengthen what they’ve learned.

Creating the TERRA Adaptor
Check back soon for our design of the TERRA Adaptor!
Designing the XY-Plane
In order for TERRA to select for specific locations to dispense fluids, we needed a method of either moving the output tube or the vessel, such as a 96-well plate. We ultimately decided to move the vessel, as that would minimize the length of and amount of dead volume in the output tube. Our team designed an active XY-plane, which would allow us to move the platform in the X- and Y-direction to target a specific location. This XY-plane needed to have the following functions and features: the ability for translational motion; a homing system; a control system; a manufacturing method; material; and motors.
The following morphological chart illustrates our potential means of accomplishing each function or feature and the chosen options are written in green.
Translational Motion:
Homing: Our team chose to utilize contact switches in order to home our system as they were the easiest to integrate into the existing design of TERRA and were low-cost . We had briefly considered manual, user-controlled homing, but realized that it would result in a great amount of human error, as the user would need to approximate the distance from the nozzle to the well A1. Optical sensors and ultrasonic sensors would result in accurate locations, but would increase the cost of TERRA and are harder to integrate to our system.
Control: We decided to use the Arduino Mega to control our XY-plane and syringe pumps, as the addition of Arduino shields allowed for more motors, and therefore syringe pumps, to be connected per microprocessor. Our team also considered the use of a Raspberry Pi, but it would have been harder to integrate into TERRA and it contained more functions than needed for our project.
Manufacturing Method: TERRA is composed of 3D-printed supports, as 3D-printing is more accessible, lower-cost, and allows for quick prototyping. While traditional machining, such as milling and turning, would result in tighter tolerances and more accurate"

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," reporters could be three different fluorescent proteins whose excitation spectrum overlaps as little as possible. Alternatively, a LacZ reporter system could be used. The response of each different reporter system would be measured regularly during a several hour experiment. A second experiment would measure the dynamics of the system and evaluate, how fast and reliably it is possible to switch between the active genes.
Lastly, as one may note in our simulation , we have also planned to include a red light sensing element to our system. A good candidate for the light receptor would be engineered version of Cph8. The role of the red light would be regulating the rate of transcription of the the three target genes whereas the blue light defines the gene being transcribed. The purpose is to have control over both the rate of transcription and the gene being active. The red light response could be mediated by CRISPR/dCas9 system by associating the complex with light activated Krüppel-associated Box (KRAB) as described by Freiburg 2013 team. The system would identify a sequence associated with each target gene. Therefore, we could regulate the rate of transcription at each three genes using red light. However, the exact mechanism of such a system is yet to be designed and tested.
Conclusions
Our experiments show that our light response element works very well. Based on the observations we can conclude that the system is capable of fourfold repression with blue light at 470 nm wavelength and its response time is likely to be less than 20 minutes. In addition, the system is resistant to perturbations in light intensity which makes it robust and applicable to conditions in a bioreactor, including non uniform light intensity. These are very good results and they form a good basis for our three channel switch. In addition, we were able to build an excellent device to control the light intensities during the incubations. However, as a consequence of not being able to ligate our lambda repressor element together before wiki freeze, the gene switch system at its entire form remains to be evaluated at a later stage.
The system is resistant to perturbations in light intensity which makes it robust and applicable to conditions in a bioreactor.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Press_-_-_TEXT.html," be overcome on the path to printing complex cell structures. “And this is exactly where this year's project began, in which live cells were printed into a biocompatible matrix using a 3D printer,” project head Skerra explained. For this purpose, a conventional plastic 3D printer was converted into a 3D bioprinter.
Layer by layer, biological tissue is created in this manner. In the past, hydrogels were used for such purposes — they provide a gelatinous scaffold in the first place and are populated with cells thereafter. However, the students from both Munich universities followed an alternative strategy because the ‘scaffold’ approach makes printing more complicated and the cells are held together in an unnatural manner. Instead, they developed a special bio-ink, a type of biochemical two-component resin for directly printing living cells in 3D.
The main component of this system is biotin, commonly known as vitamin H or B7, with which the surface of the cells was coated. The second component is Streptavidin, a protein that binds biotin and serves as the actual biochemical glue. In addition, bulky proteins were equipped with biotin groups to serve as cross-linker. “When a suspension of the cells is ‘printed’ into a concentrated solution of the protein components,” Professor Skerra explained, “the desired 3D structure forms.”
Hence, with this bio-ink a moldable tissue made of live cells is created in the biotINK tissue printer — more or less ready for transplantation. In light of these results, the team led by Professor Skerra and his doctoral students Andreas Reichert and Volker Morath at TUM, whose motto for the competition was “Let’s take bioprinting to the next level,” delivered what they had promised.
Already in 2013, a team led by Professor Skerra participated in the finals and won the second prize in the category ""Undergraduates"".

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," designed to uptake landfill gas under the ideal conditions to facilitate the degradation of methane by our final bacterial construct(s). Based on the testing we have done so far, this would entail the need for some of the same conditions used in previous bioreactor tests including a controlled temperature and the ability to agitate/shake cells for proper aeration.
Unlike the simulation of a landfill gas environment experiment, we would plan to incorporate a fair amount of oxygen into the gas input of our system for two reasons. First and foremost, oxygen is necessary to facilitate faster growth rates in our constructs. Additionally, oxygen is required for the oxidation of methane to methanol. As such, we plan to have a gas input into our system of about 20-50% oxygen and 50-80% landfill gas. The ideal oxygen to landfill gas ratio will need to be determined through testing of system efficiency.
The final integrated reactor system would involve the landfill pipe system bubbling a mixture of landfill gas and O2 through a liquid culture of cells. The cells will be maintained in continuous flow liquid culture, similar to industry standards of large scale protein production. The continuous flow culture would constantly be resupplied with fresh media containing necessary nutrients, likely standard tryptone powder and yeast extract, and possibly recycled biomass from the culture itself. Cells would be removed from the culture to maintain a stable culture OD, as well as to harvest the biomass for energy or to feed back into the culture system. Overall, implementation and maintenance of this system will definitely be costly, but the energy returns will help to offset the cost, and the product of almost entirely removing methane emissions from landfills is enticing enough to pursue this project.

Throughout our entire project, we have thought about commercialization of some aspects of it. Consequently, we decided to file a patent for the newly developed coacervate-based detection method for the detection of specific RNA sequences ( CINDY Seq ), described on our measurement page . In the process of writing this patent application, it became clear that this method could have a whole range of applications besides RNA detection, and we have identified multiple options on how we could commercialize the method for these applications. Furthermore, we have already received interest from multiple companies to further think about commercialization of the results of our research.
Value proposition
Antibiotic resistance among pathogens causing life threatening infections is rapidly increasing. Ineffective antibiotic treatments are in the worst case detrimental. The rapid detection of, for example, MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in hospitals is essential to guide crucial decision-making. For the patient this means a safe treatment and healthy hospital environment. Hospitals have to be enabled to fight the challenges MRSA poses. Even in the case of a more innocent bladder infection, on-site disclosure of viral or bacterial pathogens can be very beneficial to avoid the frustration of patients, that typically comes with missing treatment success. By rapidly and simply detecting genetic material of pathogens, such generic problems can be solved.  However, current detection methods for viral infections require highly specialized equipment and trained personnel and cannot be used in case of emergencies. In addition, these methods are time consuming and often indirect via antigens. An indirect detection is the distinguishment between for example viral infections caused by the Zika and Dengue virus ( Trafton 2017 ; Grandien 1996 ). CINDY Seq is the direct RNA-based detection tool that offers a solution for rapid, cheap and direct detection of genetic material. This allows to detect potential pathogens which have not caused an immune response yet. Patient treatment can thus begin already during the incubation period of the pathogen. CINDY Seq saves time and enables users such as doctors to provide rapid and specific service. It facilitates ad-hoc decision-making and reduces costs on ineffective treatments and complicated protocols for detection. Therefore we aim to develop CINDY Seq as a versatile detection tool for relevant genetic material and expanding the impact beyond the scope of this iGEM project.

Collaboration - Cell Viability in Tailings Pond Water
We were asked by the Calgary iGEM team to to test the viability of their chassis to survive in tailings pond water. If E. coli DH5α cells containing one of their constructs can grow normally in medium prepared with tailings water, we can be confident that the chassis can be applied to tailings pond water in general.
Materials and Methods
50 mL of LB medium was made with tailings water and filtered through MILLEX filter Unit GS MF-Millipore MCE Membrane 0.22 µm in order to sterilize it and appropriate antibiotics were added. The tailings LB was inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 to an OD600 of 0.1. The flask was incubated at 37˚C with shaking for 7 hours, during which photometric readings were taken every 30. Photometric readings were taken using the Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 3000, as the OD600 readings reached 1.0 the solutions was diluted with LB media to keep the OD600 reading between 0.1 and 1.0. The same protocol was used to observe cell growth of E. coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K331009 in 50 mL of LB medium made with MilliQ H2O.

Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," legal considerations?
With the advances in modern DNA manipulation technology, humans can modify bacterial DNA, thus affecting human health. Many bacteria have been modified to synthesize molecules needed by humans, such as hormones, interferon, and antibodies. So we can say that after the transformation, bacteria can become a cure for disease medicine, to make greater contributions to human health.
The reasons why biotechnology companies have such high risk is that there are many biotechnology industry-related regulatory laws and regulations. Common legal risks in the biotechnology industry are the risk of intellectual property right and the risk of daily business activities.
Intellectual property rights are the basis for the survival and development of biotechnology enterprises. Relevant legal risks often occur in areas such as: early R & D contractual agreement, rights attribution, patent and trademark acquisition, use, maintenance, transfer, license, infringement, cyber squatting, fraudulent use and so on.
Risks of business activities. The biotechnology industry is heavily regulated. For example, individual consumers of the product efficacy and side effects of different reactions, easily lead to product liability complaints, litigation and claims, and even lead to public relations events, improper handling will lead to significant losses.
Critical Thinking about Law Related to Gene Technology from Professor Zhipeng He.
Zhipeng He, an excellent professor of Jilin University School of Law, who has written books in law, and is good at teaching and scientific research of Law, shared with us three law principles.
From his perspective, which is profound and thought-provoking, firstly, while there are phenomena in the society, it is not to say that there must be some law concerning the very kind of phenomena. It is the maturity of the society and the consensus we reached contribute to the forming of law. Any kind of radical law is not mature response to the society phenomenon.
Secondly, it is the development of life that leads the development of law. No vice. Thirdly, genetic research is a matter of hot dispute, however, the focus of law should be concerning relevant technology and social more. All in all, the law is passive.
Who can tell how the law will be in the future? We guess no one.  However, Chinese scientific research needs a more effective ethical regulation urgently. The more we human being have in technology, the more we are exposed to danger. We need the law so that we prevent mistakes happening again after we have done something wrong. But only the practice and real situation in the near future can better promote the development of law of gene technology. And when that day comes, the development in gene editing and therapy techniques may have greater breakthrough"

TUST_China,2017,Team:TUST China#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"ocompatibility. This means BC can be used in medical products and cosmetics. However, these types of products fail to widely appear on the market because of its cost. Producing BC medical products and beauty products is very strictly controlled, which requires professional equipment and workers, so it is costly. In contrast, BC food products such as coconut production is very simple and inexpensive. That is why BC mainly produced into some low-value products such as food. Therefore, if you can optimize the pathway of Acetobacter xylinus to increase BC production, you may reduce the cost of BC products in the future.
Q: What is the focus of future research on BC materials?
A: BC composites can make up for the deficiency of natural BC, but there are still problems of high producing cost, low performance and low level of industrialization. To solve these problems, the future research focuses on:
Obtaining stable and high yield strains through efficient genetic engineering.
Exploring the new BC industrial producing methods, including the design of efficient                                 and inexpensive biofilm production device.
Use BC structure of light-based easy to combine and synthetic biology, improve product value and expand the scope of product applications.
Q: What is the current situation in BC production?
A: BC production is slow, so the fermentation cycle is very long. In addition, the producing process requires sterile conditions. Thus, the production requires a lot of labor cost and capital investment. Therefore, the study now focus on accelerating the speed of fermentation so that BC could film quickly.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Project#lungRanger_-_-_TEXT.html," cenocepacia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
One of the most problematic of CF pathogens is B. cenocepacia, which accounts for between 50% and 90% of all Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) infection diagnoses in CF patients5. B. cenocepacia is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen which presents by low responsiveness to antibiotic therapy and the ability to cause significant reductions in lung function, additionally it includes strains exhibiting a high virulence potential as well as strains with a high patient to patient transmission5.
S. maltophilia is a Gram-negative bacterium that occurs ubiquitously with P. aeruginosa in the environment and both can co-infect the CF lung. The treatment of S. maltophilia infections is problematic as isolates are also resistant to many clinically useful antibiotics6.
Communication in Pseudomonas, Burkholderia and Stenotrophomonas
The signalling network of P. aeruginosa consists of multiple interconnected signalling layers that co-ordinately regulate virulence and persistence of infections. The master virulence signalling systems in P. aeruginosa are the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) responsive systems Las and Rhl, which together control the expression of multiple virulence factors in response to cell density. Another group of signalling molecules related to virulence factor production are the quinolones, including Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), a quorum-sensing (QS) signal that regulates numerous virulence genes and genes involved in iron scavenging7.
In addition to producing AHL signal, B. cenocepacia produces a diverse set of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones (AHQs), including the PQS precursor 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ), but does not synthesize 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone8. B. cenocepacia also produces cis-2-dodecenoic acid, a molecule structurally related to the diffusible signal factor (DSF; 11-methyl-cis-2-dodecenoic acid) found in Xanthomonads5. S. maltophilia also possesses a DSF-mediated cell–cell signalling system that was first identified in the related plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris6.

XMU-China also made a relevant introduction about the design of microfluidic chips. What's more, our team additionally answered questions about how to control liquid flow in the centrifugal force-driven microfluidic chip.
Figure 1：The design of microfluidic chips of SUSTech iGEM(left) and XMU-China(right).
In terms of the project, we believe SUSTech iGEM team's using chips to study the interaction between cells is very innovative. From our professional perspective, we gave some advice on cell signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions, and recommended several related articles to them, hoping to help them. Based on our project, they raised some questions about whether our cell-free system belongs to the field of synthetic biology. We put forward our views, and the two parties had a futher discussion. We believe that synthetic biology is not a simple use of biobrick to construct gene loops. Instead, it should be a broader definition. We think that standard components are like building blocks, but it is up to people to decide what items should be joint together, rather than building blocks themselves. Therefore, biobrick can be used to build systems outside the genetic loop.
In addition, both of us exchanged ideas on the Art&Design. We carried out visual design communications with SUStech on aspects involving poster, Wiki and PPT. We showed them our methods and ideas in visual designing, including drawing graphics of experimental process and other details.

At CCiC, we are very delighted to find that BIT projects have a lot of intersections with us. We have similar representations.Therefore, our team communicated with them in the following three aspects.
The first is the exchange of ideas on the subject. We have had a two-hour telephone conversation with them. On the phone, we exchanged the purpose of the project and some detailed designs, introduced our own project to them and proposed some questions for each other.
Secondly, we asked the BIT team about a difficulty in the experimental program. I am very happy that they are effective. We proved that our aptamers and complementary chains are combined. We gave the results back to them and gave them suggestions of improvement. In addition, we also exchanged some experimental methods and protocol.
Finally, in order to prove the feasibility of their respective experimental designs, we mailed some materials to each other and successfully verified the effectiveness of the other's combination, which is also a very effective part of our cooperation.

We will go through the genetic design of the system, module by module. If you are unfamiliar with the symbols used, then check out our key to familiarise yourself with each circuit symbol and what it means.
This diagram makes up part of the Module 1 genetic circuit
Under normal circumstances (without IPTG), the Lac inhibitor (LacI) is constitutively present in the system. This means that the promoter is repressed, and blocks the expression of the downstream genes.  When IPTG is added, it binds to LacI and cancels the repression on the promoter. This allows for the expression of the downstream genes, and therefore for the start of Module 1.
Induction with IPTG
IPTG is an allolactose analogue. Allolactose is the lactose metabolite that triggers the transcription of the lactose operon in natural systems. Allolactose and IPTG activate transcription of the lac operon by binding to the LacI protein. When such binding occurs, the LacI protein changes confirmation, which renders it unable to bind to the operator region. This allows the RNA polymerase to continue reading beyond the operator and transcribe the downstream genes, thus removing the inhibition.
Results
Wet Lab
Different experiments were run using the chemoinduction module.
Firstly, we did a preliminary test on the toxicity of IPTG, and whether this affected cell growth. We grew our cells in varying concentrations of IPTG and monitored the growth by measuring optical density.
IPTG, as expected, does not have a negative effect on cell growth.
This provided us with a good starting point for our experiment. We then ligated the IPTG induced promoter to RFP, and tried to investigate the effects of IPTG on red flourescence. Unfortunately, we had problems with getting this construct to function, and we are still troubleshooting as of the wiki-freeze deadline.
Dry Lab
Taking into account the experimental data from the wet lab, we can then draw a relationship between different input IPTG concentrations and the amount of polypeptide produced.
When we introduce IPTG into the system, it temporarily removes LacI from the system. Hence, during this period of time, we produce the drug of interest.
When the effects of IPTG wear off, the system returns to equilibrium.
The more IPTG we add in, the higher the amount of output protein.
Conclusion
Chemoinduction is the most widely used means of inducing a promoter. By using this well characterised IPTG induc"

Bacteria containing positive control
Emission spectra of induced (green/red) and uninduced(black) positive control BBa_K494002 ; green: eGFP fluorescence ex: 501 nm, red: mCherry fluorescence ex: 587 nm
Due to the time limitations of the iGEM completion we had to focus our efforts on few switches after designing the screening system. Relying on the functionality of systems occurring in nature, we choose the HisTerm as well as the TrpTerm . Both switches are based on known natural [ [1] ]. Testing synthetic and none-naturally switchable terminators in vivo are goals for future work. Delorme et al. reported the His-Terminator to be a remarkable effective Terminator with more than 99% termination efficiency. [12] The exemplary measurement below on the right confirms the high terminator efficiency. In fact, we could not detect any mCherry fluorescence in any cells containing the HisTerm . Even induction of the corresponding signal transmitter RNA via IPTG did not alter the Terminator efficiency. Again time was the limiting factor and prevented us from testing more than one corresponding transmitter, although the Modeling highly suggested the necessarily of finding an optimized transmitter length. Thus, the results are insufficient either to prove or to disprove the functionality of the HisTerm or our concept in general.
Bacteria containing HisTerm
Emission spectra of induced and uninduced screening plasmid BBa_K494002 containing HisTerm ; green: eGFP fluorescence ex: 501 nm, red: mCherry fluorescence ex: 587 nm
Attaining only 90% terminator efficiency, the natural Trp [ [2] ] is known be less effective than the HisTerm . [13] The graph on the right depicts our designed TrpTerm characteristic efficiency of about 40 %, notably below the natural standard. Allowing 60% transcription in the “off” state excludes the TrpTerm from possible candidates for a scalable network of logic gates, due to the mentioned required ""yes or no"" function (see Implementation and how to connect Biobricks ). Thus the TrpTerm is inoperative as intended, but may still be useful in other contexts. Similar to the HisTerm , the TrpTerm also did not react to the induction of the corresponding signal. Under circumstances, termination efficiencies altered by the transmitter are on a low range and not resolvable within observed 40% basal transcription.

Future Directions
The CHOP System can be used to improve the affinity and characterization of the fluoride riboswitch.
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) system may be used for detecting presence of fluoride; at a certain level of fluoride, it can trigger gene expression of the GFP as the fluoride riboswitch releases terminator.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Lethbridge_Entrepreneurs,2013,Team:Lethbridge Entrepreneurs#comp media_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM Regional Jamboree held in Toronto. Moreover, the first-place finish secured the team – made up of Dustin Smith (BSc ’13), Graeme Glaister, Jenna Friedt (BSc ’11, MSc’13), Suneet Kharey, Harland Brandon (BSc ’12) and Zak Stinson – a spot in the international iGEM competition, which will be held at MIT in November.
Providing students with the opportunity to compete against teams from around the world is just one way iGEM benefits its participants, says U of L biochemistry professor Dr. Hans-Joachim (H.J.) Wieden. Considered the driving force behind the U of L’s iGEM teams, Wieden serves as the students’ advisor and coach. He is also a highly respected researcher in his own right.
Director of the Alberta RNA (Ribonucleic acid) Research and Training Institute at the U of L, Wieden was also recently appointed the Innovates Centre of Research Excellence (iCORE) Chair of Bioengineering. Funded by a $2-million investment from Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures, the role enables Wieden’s research team to study how biological systems can be engineered to achieve breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry, biochemistry, health and nanoscience.
“iGEM enables students to get their first taste of research,” says Wieden. “They understand the goal of the project, and learn how to think outside of the box, troubleshoot and apply their knowledge to create scientific discoveries. All of this unlocks students’ creativity.”
What’s more, he continues, iGEM cultivates students’ entrepreneurial potential. The teams manage their own projects and raise funds to support their work, as well as learn how to communicate effectively and connect their work to real-world needs. Finally, as young researchers themselves, they come to realize the importance of supporting the forward-thinking scientists of the future: high school students.
To that end, U of L students have started iGEM teams in high schools in southern Alberta. And those high school students are following in the success of their older counterparts. Earlier this year, in fact, a team of Lethbridge high school students representing schools from across the city, won the Green Brick grand prize at iGEM’s international High School Jamboree at MIT, as well as trophies for Best New Biobrick Natural for their engineered DNA part and Best Wiki, the website used to display their project.

Les tests en environnement ouvert
Depuis la création des OGM et leur utilisation en agriculture, de nombreuses variétés de plantes ont été cultivées dans la nature, c'est-à-dire dans un environnement ouvert alors que la grande majorité des espèces sont seulement testées en laboratoire.
En théorie, deux types d’effets négatifs peuvent avoir lieu après le test d’un OGM dans un environnement ouvert. C’est donc à fortiori le cas pour les Organismes Génétiquement Synthétisés (OGS) :
Le microorganisme peut bouleverser le biotope local en créant un environnement compétitif qui peut dans le pire des cas conduire à l’extinction de plusieurs espèces.
Il peut également, après avoir colonisé le milieu, devenir impossible à éliminer.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2017,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Design1_-_-_TEXT.html," What's more, C.elegans has fixed ‘genetically determined number of cells’ [5] .These characteristics are of great help to accomplish our project.
Caenorhabditis elegans, a classic model organism, is widely used in scientific researches. In our project, we also choose it because its whole genome has been sequenced, and it has its own connectome(neuronal ‘wiring diagram’) completed by 2012 [6] [7] . Adault C.elegans is about 1mm in length, 45μm in width and it is easily to observe and manipulate under stereomicroscope [8] [9] . What's more, C.elegans has fixed ‘genetically determined number of cells’ [10] .These characteristics are of great help to accomplish our project.
Compared with other model organisms like Mus musculus, which needs approximately two to three months to mature, C.elegans possesses shorter life span. A self-fertilizing hermaphrodite can maintain its genetic information and live for two to three weeks [11] . Meanwhile, worms can also propagate sexually to get genetic recombination offsprings.
Fig1. The Connectome of C.elegans.
Why AWM AWM neuron?
Normally, the formation of a new ability is coordinate with the specific environment signal, so in our project we need the specific stimulus to train worms form new abilities. We hope to localize the target neurons directly by stimulus in C.elegans for the demand of accuracy and efficiency. Different behaviors of worms are controlled by different neurons, and due to their sensitivity to odors, many behaviors, such as attraction, avoidance, feeding, or mating, can be induced by different chemicals.
In our project, we choose the olfactory neurons ( AWA &AWB) to accomplish our design. The attractive odorant diacetyl is normally sensed by the AWA olfactory neurons. The repulsive odorant 2-nonanone is detected by the AWB olfactory neurons. With the expression of CoChR and Chrimson(photosensitive proteins) in these neurons, worms can develop attractive and repulsive responses to blue light and red light, so we can use lights to induce their learning behaviors.
What is Skinner Box?
Skinner Box, invented by Burrhus Frederic Skinner(1904—1990), is a laboratory apparatus used to study animal behaviors. It uncloses the secret of the operant behavior and deeply influenced American education at that time. Skinner divided the behaviors into two types: respondent behavior which induced by some known"

Foundational Advances
Synthetic Biology is a promising field of science, but to make these promises real we need to continue improving it. The UPO-Sevilla team wants to contribute to the advance of SB with two new tools, one for the bench and another for in-silico design. The miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit will allow for first time the integration of BioBricks into microbial genomes, thus extending the use of Synthetic Biology to multiple bacterial strains other than E. coli and without the necessity of antibiotic selection. And the BioBrick Creator software tool will make easier to design and register parts, including other possibilities as computational assembly and codon optimization.

Keith Kozminski, PhD
Team Advisor
A molecular cell biologist with 25 years of experience, Dr. Kozminski received a Ph.D. from Yale University. He joined the Department of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Department of Cell Biology in the School of Medicine at the University of Virginia in 2002, where he studies the molecular basis of cell shape and division and teaches courses in cell biology and synthetic biology.
Jason Papin, PhD
Team Advisor
Dr. Papin is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia who received his Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego. He came to UVa in 2005. His research interests include the integration of high-throughput data into predictive, computational models that can be used to interrogate metabolic and regulatory networks in microbial pathogens and human disease. We are grateful to have Dr. Papin as an advisor.
Kay Christopher
Ms. Christopher has been an invaluable resource to us in the lab. Always willing to help,    Ms. Christopher makes sure our packages are delivered to our lab, shows us how to use new equipment, and orders common chemicals for us.    When we are in a pinch, she is even kind enough to lend us buffers and lab supplies from her own stock. In general, Ms. Christopher has made wetwork    much easier for Virginia iGEM 2016, and we thank her for everything she has done for us. She also works to provide us a lab space.
Rich Smindak
A graduate student in Dr. Kozminski's lab, Rich has been a saving grace whenever we encounter technical problems in the lab.     Need a 250mL centrifuge tube?    Rich probably knows where it is.     Having trouble with the sonicator?  Odds are good that Rich is willing to help you out.    Thank goodness that Rich is willing to put up with all of our badgering.     If not for this congenial man, we would have gotten stuck in the middle of our protocols more than once.

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWIO_-_-_TEXT.html," then call SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() for checking the model against the SBML validation rules.
As mentioned above, SBML uses ASTNode(binary tree) to store the formulas, we still need to find a solution for connecting between the binary tree and calculation, considering of the rename part of WriteSBMLFile. in-order traversing binary tree seems the best way to measure this problem. The function ""getformula""; ""judge_opreator"" and ""output"" are used to accomplish the traversal work. The output of the function ""getformula"" is the value of the formula based on the initial amounts of all the variables.
Assitant Input Plug-ins
In order to simplify the input procedure of the data file describing time course which sometimes gets really redundant, we also program a small .exe file to help convert *.bmp file to *.dat file based on following assumptions.
The x-axis and y-axis are already unified to the range [0,1], while any other range could be realized by multiple additional factors on the unified range.
The program will only identify black pixels on the picture, and for any given x value, the y value is decided by the average of all existing points corresponding to that same x value.
Color depth sould be no less than 8 bits.
Sampling step length is determined by 1 divided by the horizontal pixel numbers.
Following is a small demo of this tool.
Arbitrarily draw a curve in painting tools under windows xp
There are definitely quite a lot to improve, including
1.Rescale-able range of x-axis and y-axis
2.User designated step length
3.Function of ‘smoothing’
4.Identify the curve based on contrast rather than requiring the effective pixel to be black.

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," determined that a minimal of 70 bp is required for homologous recombination to take place. Furthermore, it was determined that a linear relationship exists between target sequence length and recombination frequency (Khasanov et al) .  The target sequence length and transformation efficiencies we obtain using the supercompetent B. subtilis strain will play a significant role in our sample preparation. We can use our results from this experiment to determine how long our primers need to be for the target sequence within the pathogen(s) during isothermal amplification.
Currently, we have been optimizing transformation efficiency using the thrC vector digested with ScaI. When we digest the thrC vector with ScaI we have approximately 700 bp of “buffering DNA” on one side and 1800 on the other.  We have designed several primers for different sites within the thrC and thrC’ regions for the thrC vector (ID K823022).  These primers will give us products containing 500 bp of homologous sequence down to 50 bp. By using these primers we hope to determine how much buffering DNA and homology is necessary.
Week 17: August 18 - 22
We made the first batch of spores of the supercompetent B. subtilis strain this week using a standard sporulation protocol and stored them at 4 C for short-term storage and -20 C for long-term storage. In order to visualize the spores under the microscope, we performed Gram stains. Theoretically, spores should stain clear, vegetative B. subtilis cells should stain purple, while E. coli cells should stain red. This is because the Gram’s iodine reagent fixes the purple dye (crystal violet) to Gram positive species, while the purple is unable to adhere to Gram-negative species. Thus, B. subtilis, which is Gram-positive, will stain purple, while E. coli stains red (from Safranin). Spores lack the membranes that bind the colour, and so will not stain at all, and we see them as round, clear entities under the microscope.
A majority of the cells from the sporulated tube were in the spore form, being round-shaped and clear. Although E. coli stained red, vegetative B. subtilis cells also stained red instead of purple. However, the B. subtilis cells were rod-shaped so we assumed that the reagents we used for Gram staining were contaminated or out-of-date. We are planning on obtaining new reagents to try the Gram stain again"

TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consist of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help from our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most out of our time. We learned, grew and bonded over the (most of the times) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people whom we celebrated with when we found out the digestion release bands with right length. These are also the people who patted us in the back when we saw no GFP expression under the fluorescence microscope. We wanted YOU to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knew, maybe we could end up doing research together in the future!

Egg yolk extraction
In contrary to popular belief - it is actually possible to extract the membrane separating yolk from the white. However, some practice is needed beforehand and a specialized tools which are not part of the standard laboratory inventory.
First step is to separate the white of the egg, which can be done by simply cracking the egg and carefully pouring the white of the egg out. Once the intact yolk is obtained it should be submerged into water to allow for easier manipulation afterwards.
Next, the membrane should be carefully cut - there are many ways that this can be done, but the best results are usually obtained with sharp scissors and a pincet. First a hole should be made into yolk carefully to serve as a starting point for cutting. The hole should be ideally on the top of the yolk to prevent excessive spilling which quickly clouds the water and makes any further operations much more difficult.
Starting from this hole a line can be cut in any direction. The easiest way seems to be by making (almost) 180° circle cut from the side and allowing for yolk to ""open"" and spill to the opposite side. It is worth noting that movements should be relatively slow and gentle, since we don't want to spill the yolk and cloud the water before finishing the cutting.
Once the desired cut is made the yolk will spill out. Careful exchange of water either with syringe or any other method will gradually return the visibility in the media to initial levels. The purification should be done gently, though, as membrane may very well rupture or be flushed out with exiting water. It is advisable to hold membrane gently with pincers where membrane is the strongest i.e. on the ""poles"" or on ""chalaza"", the white membrane structure on the ""poles"" of the egg yolk. Chalaza can be seen on the figure 3.

After some purification relatively pure membranes can be obtained. White"

Last year, Paulien Poelarends studied the communication of IGEM teams with the public. The knowledge she obtained was combined into a workshop What can we, as IGEM members, learn from our own conversations with the public to improve the dialogue between the science and society. This is an introspective approach to human practice that will let us learn how to communicate with public instead of having a one-way conversation about synthetic biology.
The knowledge we obtained was also applied  to the Science cafe, an evening where the public was invited to discuss with experts about synthetic biology.

Project Overview
Introduction
Microbial fuel cell
Electrochemical devices, such as batteries and fuel cells, are broadly used in electronics to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. A Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is an open system electrochemical device, consisting of two chambers; an anode chamber and a cathode chamber, which are separated by a proton exchange membrane, as illustrated in Figure 12. Both the anode and the cathode in an MFC can use various forms of graphite as base material and in the anode chamber, microbes are utilised as catalysts to convert organic matter into metabolic products, protons, and electrons Khanal YLaSK. Microbial Fuel Cells, Capter 19. In: Khanal. EbYLaSK, editor. Bioenergy: Principles and Applications. First Edition ed: Published 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 2016. . This is carried out through metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, thereby generating ATP needed to maintain cellular life. This metabolic pathway also releases electrons, which are carried by NAD+ in its reduced form, NADH.
Figure 12. A microbial fuel cell utilising glucose as substrate. The glucose is consumed to protons, electrons, and CO2. The electrons are transferred to the anode while the protons diffuse over the proton exchange membrane. A gradient causes the electrons to flow through an external load to the cathode, which generates an electrical current.
Under aerobic conditions, the generated NADH will deliver its electron as part of the electron transfer chain, thereby returning to its oxidised form NAD+. Under anaerobic conditions the electron transport chain will be unable to continue, which will cause the generated NADH to accumulate, and as a consequence, the concentration of available NAD+ for glycolysis will decrease. This will drive the cell to carry out other metabolic pathways, such as fermentation, in order to maintain its ATP levels. Instead, the accumulating NADH generated under anaerobic conditions, can be utilised to drive an electrical current by depositing the retrieved electrons to an anode coupled with"

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Apply iodine on the plate with 0.1% starch and spectinomycin. Incubate the engineered bacteria and non-engineered bacteria onto the plate at 37℃. See if there are hydrolysis circles on the plate.
11.Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Weigh agarose powder and TAE buffer according to a proper portion, and add them to a 100ml conical flask (we usually make 1.5% Agarose Gel). Melt the mixture in a microwave until the solution becomes clear (don’t leave the microwave). Let the solution cool down to about 40-50℃ and add DNA gel stain (usually we use EB), pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appropriate comb. Let the gel cool until it becomes solid. Pull out the comb carefully. Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber. Add enough TAE Buffer so that there is about 2-3mm of buffer over the gel. Pipette DNA samples mixed with appropriate amount of DNA loading buffer (the dye/GeneFinder is in the loading buffer) into wells on the gel. Run the gel at 135V for about twenty minutes.

The International Division of the 2nd High School Affiliated with Beijing Normal University was founded in 2008. With a boarding campus, the international division is independent from the main campus of SHSBNU. It serves about eight-hundred students, including students from Project Global Access (PGA) and the Nacel International Exchange Program. PGA is a Sino-US Joint Program, introduced to the International Division in 2008, approved by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission and registered with the Ministry of Education. There are about 360 Chinese students enrolled in the PGA program, from grade 10 to grade 12. Teachers in PGA are also well-qualified, with a total of 53 Chinese and foreign teachers. The faculty includes experienced educators from China, US, Britain, The Philippines, and South Africa, some of which are alumni of international institutions such as Northwestern University, University of Michigan, Messey University, etc.

Experiment help to a high-school team CIEI-BJ
This summer CIEI-BJ aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiates biosynthesis of tanshinone, a famous Chinese medicinal herb, by building a plasmid transformed in Escherichia coli. However, for a brand new high school team, they are lack of parts and devices to practice, which is essential for their plasmid constructions. On the contrary, we have took part in iGEM competition with our own independent laboratory for at least six years, perfectly storing a wealth of parts and devices and inheriting proficient technology from our last iGEM team members. With great sincerity, we took an initiative to send them some parts (J04450 with backbone pSB1A2 and the splicing vector J23106 and I13504 with pSB1C3) for their daily practice and pre-experiments.

Nina: Their CPP called LMWP has many arginine (R), thus the peptide is very positively charged making it easy to go through lipid layers.
""Secondly, unlike other CPPs, the toxicity profile of LMWP has already been thoroughly established. LMWP was shown to be nonimmunogenic,[4] and its use in dogs did not elicit acute toxic responses.[5] Lastly, while other CPPs must be chemically synthesized, LMWP can be produced in mass quantities direct from native protamine with limited processing time and cost.[6]"" - Synthetic Skin-Permeable Proteins Enabling Needleless Immunization p. 2724

However, the experimental data shows great difference from our prediction model. Some genes are supported to be strong expressed in our model while few expressions were detected actually. Therefore, we believe that there are relationships between different genes we mentioned. For example, gene PSY controls the expression of phytoene synthase, which is determinant transformation from pre-phytoene diphosphate to phytoene and phytoene is substrate of the following reaction, which is catalyzed by phytoene desaturase (encoded by gene CrtI/PDS). In this way, gene PSY and CrtI/PDS have strong relationships so the expression of one gene affects the other one.

Interviewing the Vice-President Materials of a Toy Multinational (16th October 2018)
Creating a bioplastic that is able to compete with conventional plastic means tapping into a market with unlimited potential. For example, 19 billion Lego elements are produced every year. This equals 2.16 million elements every hour, or 36.000 per minute. This premium toy-giant with an annual revenue of 4.8 billion USD (2017) is highly interested in swapping their current ABS feedstock to a more sustainable non-crude oil derived source. The Vice-President Materials of a Toy Multinational made time to sit down with us, despite a very full agenda. We discussed what drives companies when making transitioning decisions, what toy companies look for in materials and what to take into account throughout development.
While diving into the many applications of styrene, what most interested us was an application of styrene as raw material for a non-single use plastic. This was one of the drivers which pointed us towards Lego bricks: durable playing bricks for playful development. It turns out our visions align. During the course of our project, Lego has published various articles and press releases about their ambition to produce plant-based plastic playing bricks. The mentioned Vice-President Materials was happy to sit down with us to share views on the future of biobased plastics, as well as discussing some opportunities and limitations with regards to their production. Our discussion was highly insightful. Some highlights which will shape the future of our project:
Your choice for a 2G feedstock highly excites me
From 1G to 2G feedstock: the Vice-President Materials is enthusiastic about our choice of a 2G feedstock: highlighting circularity, and also addressed a challenge we proposed, the loss of biomass to oxygen, stating that because our feedstock is 0-value this is not a problem!  Being a second generation feedstock, “sludge” (our toilet paper waste stream) does not compete with food supply.
“Side effects” of transitioning to bio-based plastic: to guarantee trusted product characteristics for injection moulding playing bricks, every mould is tailored to the specific properties of the plastic used to inject the mould of the individual bricks. Transitioning for a multinational like this does not just mean searching for the right material. It means transforming the entire production process"

Lethbridge,2017,Team:Lethbridge#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," in response to conversations with the Public Health Agency of Canada . They recommended that students need to understand how to interact with microorganisms at an early age to ensure lab safety and proper procedure in the future. Using Next vivo as a protein expression system the students could mimic working with a microorganism while getting the same results as working directly with a living cells. Additionally, our Next vivo system was designed to be safe for use anywhere as cell-free systems lack the ability to propagate and thus lowers the biosafety risk. Combining our transcription and translation protocols, biosafety module, and Next vivo system together would provide teachers an ideal tool to teach their students the principles of synthetic biology, protein synthesis, and proper laboratory techniques. With that, we are happy to announce the creation of the Next vivo Education kit!

Biosafety Module
We are currently developing more experiments that can utilize our cell-free Next vivo system. Further development is required to fully align our Education kit experiments with STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) initiatives to complement the Lethbridge High School iGEM Team's proposal . Additional development toward introductory and intermediate level kits to suit the DIY Biology community based on their feedback have also been a priority for our team.
Professional Development
Within education, Professional Development (PD) days are defined as a variety of specialized training sessions to help administrators and teachers improve their ability to teach [3]. To better integrate synthetic biology concepts within the existing Alberta curriculum, the teachers we spoke with suggested that training sessions during PD days would be an effective way to ensure that teachers understand the concepts to effectively teach students. Our team paired up with SynBridge, a makerspace located in the University of Lethbridge, to begin the process of hosting these workshops. Our team will work on designing these workshops, with SynBridge providing the space to host them and acting as a resource for teachers after our iGEM season has ended.
We met with Emily Wilton, the coordinator for SynBridge, to discuss the design of the PD Day workshops and the content taught. Emily told us that they would like to provide the workshops free of charge or at a subsidized rate for the schools, which helps to accommodate the limited teaching budgets schools have. Initial experimental designs and We would also work on the design of experiments to teach, while keeping in contact with teachers to ensure they would meet the curriculum needs.
When we discussed our plans with the Winston Churchill Science Department, the best direction to have the PD days instilled was discussed. They suggested forming"

UNAM-Genomics_Mexico,2011,Team:UNAM-Genomics Mexico#SafetyQuestions_-_-_TEXT.html," if one or several bioparts change their function or stop working as intended (e.g. through mutation)?.
The hydrogen production pathway is composed of a hydrogenase, two hydrogenase maturases and a pyruvate-Ferredoxin OxidoReductase (PFOR). None of these proteins are expected to change their function through mutation. If any of them stops working at all (either by a missense or a nonsense mutation) they will only shut down hydrogen production. Proteins would still be produced, consuming resources and decreasing the organism’s fitness. Competition with other bacteria would either kill the mutated organism or lower its reproduction rate.
Other parts in our system include two promoters and transcriptional terminators. The first promoter controls the expression of the hydrogenase and PFOR in hypoxic conditions. The latter regulates the expression of both maturases in a constitutive fashion. If any promoter loses its function all the system is shut down because both the maturases and the hydrogenase are required for hydrogen production. If the first promoter loses its capacity to detect hypoxia, and becomes constitutive, a slight decrease in fitness is expected, since hydrogenase would be produced in an aerobic environment that renders it useless. Any defect in a promoters leads to a reduced fitness phenotype since proteins regulated by the other promoter would be expressed, spending metabolic energy.
As of transcriptional terminators, each construction will contain two of them. If the first one fails or is deactivated by mutations, the second one stops the transcription of our operons. This is very important to ensure that our system doesn’t interfere with adjacent ORF’s and their transcription, maintaining its modularity.
How would the whole device or system change its properties and what unintended effects would result thereof?.
We have analyzed two cases that seem plausible with our system. The first one is our system deactivation. Under this scenario the organism would have a reduced fitness both producing unnecessary proteins that fail to complete the system and consuming metabolites in the produced proteins reactions.
The second scenario is the excessive consumption of metabolites by our system. This would probably kill our bacteria since we will be utilizing reduction potentials, which play a central role in the bacterial metabolism.
What unintended effects could you foresee after your engineered organism is released to the environment?.
It is possible that our strain infects other plant species, harming or poisoning them. However it seems improbable because the interactions between Rhizobium etli and Phaseolus vulgaris are very speciffic and have been affected by co-evolution processes.
Try to think outside the box. What is the absolute worst case scenario for"

From Bedside to Bench and Back Again
Overview
From the very beginning we have engaged the experts who have a deep understanding of Cystic Fibrosis in order to ensure that our project is addressing a genuine need as defined by those who know best.
Who are these experts? They are the patients, doctors and nurses who deal with this disease every single day. This also meant that patients were acutely aware of the limitations of the project, which we believe reduces the chance of giving false hope to people with a very serious condition. As you look through this policy and practices section you will meet some of these honorary team members. In addition, by presenting The Lung Ranger at the national UK CF trust conference we have explained to a wide audience of funding agencies, clinicians and researchers that synthetic biology is a powerful new tool to help with long standing problems in the management of this devastating disease.
This culminated in an appearance on Scottish Television (STV) News where we could reach an even wider audience with our synthetic biology project. All of these activities were crucial in informing the design of our product, the L.A.S.S.O. . We interacted with our experts regularly throughout the duration of our project taking The Lung Ranger from the bedside to the bench and back again. After all, communication isn’t just important for bacteria in polybacterial infections!
Successful implementation of the Lung Ranger and the L.A.S.S.O. could provide quantifiable benefits to the CF community, the National"

The picture shows the colony PCR result for the cloning and subsequent transformation. The gel picture shows the expected length around 2300 bp including verification primers (Fig. 1).
pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis)
The literature suggested Source: Y. Zhao et al. Biosynthesis of isoprene in Escherichia Coli via methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. that dxs from B. subtilis performed better than its E. coli counterpart. Therefore, a colony PCR was performed on the B. subtilis strain 168. USER cloning was used to produce the construct pSB1C3-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis). Our tests of the construct unfortunately showed four restriction sites within the coding sequence (Fig. 2).
Site directed mutagenesis was performed to remove the restriction sites, which ensured that the gene complied with iGEM standards. The gel picture shows the expected length around 2000 bp (Fig. 3). Full confirmed sequence can be found by following this link ( BBa_K1088011 ).
pSB1C3-lacI-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis)
Then, our focus moved to expression control: Subsequent testing proved that the inherent amount of LacI (the repressor of the lactose promoter) in MG1655 was insufficient in the presence of our construct in a high-copy plasmid (see characterization). Therefore, lacI with an LVA tag was taken from parts registry ( BBa_C0012 ) and cloned into our construct with its own promoter and terminator. pSB1C3-Pcon-lacI:LVA-term-Plac-dxs (B. subtilis) was born. The gel-picture shows the result for the test digestion. Linearized plasmid has the expected length around 5500 bp, and the EcoRI and PstI cut plasmid has expected lengths around 2000 bp and 3500 bp (Fig. 4). This, too, was sequenced and may be found here ( BBa_K1088013 ). The brick allows us to overcome the first rate-limiting step of the MEP pathway in a regulatable manner.

Main Goal:
Our project consists on achieving bioluminescence controlled under circadian rhythms with long-term functionality. Our aim is to produce a bioluminescent cyanobacteria which lights up during dusk hours and  regenerates the substrates during the day.
Rationale:
The importance of Biological context in Synthetic Biology has been largely underestimated. We have addressed this issue by centering our project on enhancing functionality of a previously characterized Biobrick, LuxBrick, by placing it in a context which allows new features.
Bioluminescence
In 2010 the Cambridge iGEM team Biobricked the LuxBrick, a collection of genes from the Lux operon that incorporate both the Luciferase and the substrate production enzymes without regulation, allowing endogenous bioluminescence on E. coli.
Chassis
We have chosen to work with a model cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC. 6803 because it exhibits autotrophic metabolism and circadian rhythms.
Coupling the endogenous circadian rhythms of this organism to the expression of the Lux genes will enable high-level functionality, through an automatically switching system that turns on bioluminescence only when needed.
Strategy
The limiting step for the bacterial bioluminescent reaction is the substrate (n-decanal) concentration, therefore, to control light emission over time we decided to control it´s abundance in the cells, which in our model is a function of the substrates"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

VLP FORMATION
I. Purification of the Various Amplicons Proteins
Purpose: To purify all various gag protein constructs and prepare them for VLP assembly. We will store these proteins in the designated VLP assembly buffer in -80 C.
Attributions: John Banasihan was the primary lead on the VLP formation experiments. Ryan Shontell assisted him in the imaging of the VLPs.
Materials and Methods: ON cultures of each protein construct were prepared and each was induced in 100 ml cultures for 2 hours at 28oC. Insoluble protein purification was performed under denaturing conditions. Each proteins was washed with denaturing wash buffer and denaturing elution buffer three times. Each wash and subsequent elution were ran on a 15% PAGE gel to confirm the presence of the target protein.
Results and Discussion: The following images are SDS PAGE runs of the purification process. The now purified proteins were used for further experimentation. All of the previous amplicons stated above were successfully purified. Each construct had bands corresponding to the correct protein size. The following figures represent the constructs 1, 2a, 3, 3a, and 3.5a purified proteins.
Figure 1. Construct 1 purified from BL21 culture induced at 28℃. Expected size of 48.90 kDa matches with the observed bands of protein on the gel. This was run at 70V stacking for 20 minutes and 100V resolving for 60 minutes on a 15% PAGE.
Figure 2. Construct 2a purified from BL21 culture induced at 28℃. Expected size of 36.98 kDa matches with the observed bands of protein on the gel. This was run at 70V stacking for 20"
