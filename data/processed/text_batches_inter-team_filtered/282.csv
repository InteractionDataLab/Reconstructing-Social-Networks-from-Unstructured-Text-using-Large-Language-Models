Leicester,2012,Team:Leicester#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," even after trying to get an article on the American Plastics Association news site. Not only that, but we just missed out on the Sci-challenge event at RocketHub which had a large number of scientific projects. It seems that we may have launched a little too late to reach our target audience.
    GENIE
GENIE (Genetics Education Networking for Innovation & Excellence) is the University’s Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Genetics, and they have been supporting our competition entry from the beginning. Their much appreciated support has ranged from letting us use their equipment to advertising the Leicester iGEM team to schools through their Dynamic DNA outreach day.
The RocketHub video was shot on a SANYO camera that GENIE lent us and this has also been invaluable in documenting some of our experiments on video. As well as the camera  we were also able to borrow GENIE laptops as and when we needed them  - for example for editing the wiki at home or in clean areas of the lab, and when advertising iGEM at the University's Open Days. On these occasions we used a GENIE laptop to allow visitors to sign up to our blog to get more information.
Another way GENIE has helped is by distributing our Citizen Science kits to schools all over Leicestershire through the Dynamic DNA event for Schools. In early September 600 year 9 school children came to the University to learn about Dynamic DNA and iGEM had material and CSE kits for distribution to  the teachers accompanying the children. Finally the GENIE team placed  news articles about the iGEM team in their quarterly News Letter and gave us great social media coverage by tweeting  (and re-tweeting!) information about our events, fundraising and progress.
    E-Quiz
We Launched a E-Quiz allowing people to take part in a fun quiz that taught them a little about iGEM as well as to see how much attention people pay to blog entries. At a cost of £1.50, bought easily though paypal on our blog, we expected a large amount of people to be interested, but so far only a few entries have been bought. The quiz was designed for all ages and ability levels with rounds on Science, Geography, Music, Riddles, and ""Name the Sweets"" as well as rounds  about the blog and iGEM in general.
The E-Quiz has an innovative design allowing everyone in the world to be able to participate as it is distributed vie email with people being able to pay over paypal. This makes it accessible to everyone who has an internet connection. However as the quiz"

From the inception of this project, it was apparent that we would need some way of making our genetically engineered cells easier for farmers to use. After all, not everyone has access to microscopes or plate readers to detect fluorescence. We decided to pursue a field capable fluorescence detector to be used by farmers, researchers, and government officials. It had to be able to adapt to different users and purposes. Our final product is a device that incorporates the feedback of farmers from Ethiopia and Uganda, government officials, NGOs, professional engineers, an agronomist, and other iGEM teams to achieve these goals. We received inspiration from the 2017 Wengingen iGEM Team and the 2017 Munich iGEM Team.
Procedural Overview
In order to detect airborne fungal spores, they first need to be captured. 3 in. diameter circular thin scratched polyethylene disks will be hung above crops in a farmer’s field, Approximately one an acre will need to be tested each day. These disks are taken down at the end of the day, inserted into a tube with rehydrated cells, which contact the disk and any spores germinating on it. First, a blank solution that only has the cells in it is poured into the observation tray and inserted into the device. The switch is turned on to take a blank measurement, and a light will flash green, the switch turned off, and the tray removed by the user. Then, the liquid"

Our Part BBa_K2024000
Our part encodes for a protein derived from Idonella sakaiensis first discovered by Yoshida et al. This protein contains 3 domains. The first, a functional domain, has the ability to cleave polyethylene terephthalanie, the main plastic used in bottles world-wide, into a monomer ethylene terephthalate. The second is a linker domain which is able to be selectively cleaved the TEV protease. The third and final domain is a polyhistadine domain allowing for easy purification of the protein by affinity chromatography.
This part was expressed using the T7 promoter (part BBa_1719005) under the control of the lac operator sequence (unpublished).

As a student-led start-up team we decided to approach the Taiwanese teams NTCU and NYMU, who had gone through multiple rounds of iGEM competitions in the past years, to receive some tips and tricks of the competition process and team system development.
NTCU Formosa team
Both teams in Taiwan are working on pesticides that are targeted to a specific agricultural epidemic that has caused great loss in Taiwanese farmlands. These teams emphasised raising  awareness for the implementation of safe biotechnology into daily use, to elevate the quality of human lives , and the environment. The NTCU Formosa team kindly presented their work to us, as well as sharing details of their past iGEM projects and meet-ups, to give us more of an idea how the iGEM competition works. They elaborated on their human practise projects, which included working closely  with the Ministry of Agriculture in Taiwan, and showed their dedication on making the agriculture sector a more biotech/engineering- friendly place. We shared with them the different policies and regulations of New Zealand regarding to GMO products as New Zealand turn out to have stricter regulations on this matter.

How long have you been fermenting?
In this part of the project we have achieved great results. However we are still working with our yeasts in order to improve their response and to perform a better characterisation of the constructions. To sum up, we have successfully transformed a delta-yap1 strain with the two constructions pADH2-Yap1 and pTRR2-GFP and pTRR.GFP (links), and what is more, we have observed a very neat and marked fluorescence in the transformed yeast.
Read below to follow us through fantastic results of our experimental work!
Transformation
We have successfully transformed  yeast with two constructions, pADH2-Yap1 and pTRR2-GFP . We used a methionine, hisditine, uracil and leucine auxotrophic strain, to grow it up we needed a SD medium supplemented with this essential compounds. After the previously described transformations, our yeast became capable of growing up in methionine and histidine supplemented SD medium, due to we have used the two yeast plasmids Yeplac181 and Yep352 with leucine and uracil  complementation, respectively.
In this figures we can see the leucine and uracil complementation wich confirms the presence of our two constructions.

Comparison with existing methods
5h30 after toluene injection, our biosensor is able to detect environmentally relevant toluene concentration (10ng/L). This way of pollutant detection is environmentally friendly as the bacteria only required the appropriate molecules in its culture medium to grow and quantify pollutant. In addition, the use of a biosensor, even if it requires an expensive machine (a luminometer) for results analysis, is cheapper compared to others physical chemical existings methods.  Find out more informations about existing methods of pollutant detection here However, our biosensor is only a prototype and we present below the different improvement that should be made.
Perspectives and improvement
Based on the results present above, we though about improvement and future experiments that should be realize. First of all, the standard curve drawn is based on few toluene concentration. We can improve this standard curve by focusing on low toluene concentration and realize bioluminescence assay for more low toluene concentration.  Then we have to determine the lowest concentration that our biosensor can detect while ensuring precise and reproductible results.Moreover, CelloCad software can be use to optimize our genetic circuit.
We have pointed out the variation between our different replicates for bioluminescence assay. Those variations are due to metabolism variations of living organisms. Several measurements have to be realize for each toluene concentration and the reproductibility of the results have to be assess on more experiments. Also, we did not have the time to optimize our bioluminescence assay protocol and to test the different parameters of the luminometer.

Integrated human practice is about integrating human practices considerations into the design and execution of the project. In this part of the wiki, we will illustrate our work to improve our project with the idea we gained from the activity mentioned on the ‘human practice-general’ page
A guide on presenting an iGEM project
--An interpretation of the Bloom’s Taxonomy from an iGEM perspective
For both integrated human practice and public engagement & education, the first step is to let your audience outside your laboratory—your industry stakeholders or the residents from your neighborhood to understand what your project is about. In that way , the presenting of the iGEM project, serving as the start point of a successful communication, is the basis of a successful human practice.
As an active participant of iGEM conferences, our team this year gained a lot of experience in presenting an iGEM project to a larger audience. So we decided to go further in this part and develop a a theory around it, so that all the teams can benefit from it. During our preparation for presentations and also audience for other teams, we have felt the strong resemblance between presenting an iGEM project and education practice. So, with the hope of finding the perfect model for a typical iGEM presentation, we explored education theories and finally came up with a ‘iGEM presentation taxonomy’ briefly illustrated in the figure bellow.
The iGEM presentation taxonomy is an interpretation of the original version of the Bloom’s taxonomy and also a revised version of the Bloom’s taxonomy by Robert J. Marzano . We carefully dealt with the difference between presenting an project to people from different major background and teaching classes in a classroom by revising the highest level of the taxonomy.  At the same time, we adopted the first several levels from the original cognitive domain, with the belief that these basic principles of how human beings know about the outside world can be applied to any information processing procedure at the onset. We also rewrote the situations defining each levels of the taxonomy, giving it a completely new interpretation aimed specifically at iGEM project presentation.
We hope that these works may lead to a better understanding of"
Cambridge-JIC,2015,Team:Cambridge-JIC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," much of the material used can be recycled or reused directly. The thermoplastic PLA used to make the majority of the microscope chassis can be recycled to be made into many different products. PLA is derived from renewable resources such as corn starch and sugarcane, and is also fully biodegradable. The other main components of the microscope are the printed circuit boards used in the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. These are modular and open-source and so when no longer needed for use in the microscope can be reprogrammed to carry out other tasks in a different product.
There are further ways to increase the sustainability of OpenScope that were not implemented within our project. The RecycleBot is a piece of open source hardware which has the capability to recycle plastic waste and make it into 3D printing filament [11]. The main power consumption for our project was in fact from the 3D printer (not accounted for in the manufacturing process report). In order to improve sustainability in this case there is the possibility of using renewable energies. The first community-scale solar powered printer was developed by White Gator Labs and was based on a Mendel RepRap variant running RAMPS1.3 [12]. This would also allow for printing in developing countries and isolated regions where access to electricity may be limited.

We had trouble assembling these constructs, which we put down to poor quality competent cells (assembly became considerably more reliable after the creation of a new batch).
Finally, these constructs were built and sequenced, and Marchantia transformation attempted. However, this failed at the stage of transformation of Agrobacteria, and was eventually abandoned due to time constraints. We leave them as a legacy for future users of Marchantia/Mösbi.
Some other experiments we did:
Overcoming the indole smell of E-coli through two different techniques and their comparison.
Problem
E. coli cultures have a pungent odour due to the production of indole and other tryptophan derivatives. We were afraid that the strong smell of E. coli would mask any other synthesized volatiles. We therefore decided to look into ways to reduce their production of indole.
Summary
We overcame the odour issue by trying a new protocol to make normal E. coli strains produce less indole. We compared the efficiency of our technique in terms of both odour and growth rate with an indole synthase free strain of bacteria. Our technique produced pleasant smelling E. coli, indistinguishable from indole-free bacteria. However they required 6h more to reach similar population density.
We also produced E. coli with equal growth rate as standard bacteria in standard media which smelled significantly less.
Story
1- We located an indole free strain of E. coli from a nearby lab. This mutant strain has a non-functional version of the TnaA gene for indole synthase so can no longer metabolize tryptophan into indole.
2-  We also learnt that normal bacteria grown on a tryptophan-free medium and minimal salts have been shown to produce insignificant amounts of indole and still grow at good rates. No data had been recorded on smell or growth rate.
Experiment
We created three flasks of growth medium:
-minimal medium [M9 salts, Mg]
-minimal medium + Casamino acids (which don't contain tryptophan)
-minimal medium + Casamino acids + tryptophan
With each medium we grew up two cultures, one with wild type E. coli, the other with the TnaA knockout strain.

you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
--Bob Dylan
The last years have seen a renaissance of research into Vibrio natriegens, the world’s fastest growing bacterium. V. natriegens has a lot of potential to become the next universally applicable chassis organism, challenging E. coli’s dominance. To fully realize this potential, several steps have to be taken. We intended to contribute to this coup d’état by providing the research community with open source strains, tailored specifically to cloning, protein expression and interaction. Additionally, we conducted basic microbial research, establishing procedures and protocols for cloning and molecular biology research.
Metabolic engineering relies heavily on iterative testing. To shorten the duration of these iterations means to enable broader and more in-depth acquisition of data.
Traditional cloning methods are limited by their rigidity and the time it takes to assemble constructs from multiple fragments. Recently, cloning methods based on type IIs restriction enzymes have addressed these issues. The synergy generated by combining these with V. natriegens would result in the world's fastest cloning platform, the Marburg Collection.
Vibrio natriegens, a review
Science is a collaborative effort, we all build on the work of others. Sometimes, finding all relevant sources can be difficult, so we wrote a short review of the research into V. natriegens from the last 60 years.
When we first started research about V. natriegens, we only came across the latest publications, as well as the original descriptions. Only very tentatively, we became aware of the full body of research that had accumulated since its discovery. In order to make it easier for the scientific community to become familiar with V. natriegens, we thoroughly collected all available publications about it. You can find the complete list of publications on our wiki. The following text is meant to give a first impression about what is known and what has been done so far regarding V"

When gene VIII is induced on the messaging phagemid, we should have gene VIII complementation and DNA message transmission. When gene VIII is not induced, there will be no gene VIII present and no complementation will take place.
When gene VIII is induced on the messaging phagemid, we should have gene VIII complementation and DNA message transmission. When gene VIII is not induced, there will be no gene VIII present and no message transmission will take place.
The choice to control gene VIII was made based on several factors:
Control over bacteriophage ϕX174 particle production was accomplished using the same approach [2].
Gene VIII is the last gene in an operon on the M13 genome [1], so its removal is unlikely to affect transcription of other genes.
Gene VIII is not known to have regulatory function, so regulation of other M13 genes should not be disturbed.
Monica Ortiz (co-author on the original DNA messaging paper [3]) suggested the choice of gene VIII over other genes.
Using this design, we expect DNA messaging to be controllable through regulation of the M13 major coat protein, which is required for message transmission.

Regulating transmission of a DNA message.
To accomplish our goal of controlling DNA messaging, we sought to control M13 viral particle production by removing M13 gene VIII from the helper plasmid and placing it under an inducible promoter on a separate construct (See Figure 0.1). M13 protein VIII, the product of gene VIII, is the major coat protein of the M13 bacteriophage, so viral particle production and DNA messaging should be possible only when gene VIII is expressed and protein VIII is present (refer to the Design page).
As a step toward this goal, we first sought to demonstrate that viral particles could be produced when a helper pl"

The results of the Mass Spectrometry gave us insight into the composition of the different TXTLs. We were able to identify 1771 proteins in all the extracts. The results indicate a high homogeneity between all three TXTLs, as illustrated in the heatmap. Based on the LFQ values (Label Free Quantification) a volcano plot of two samples (Arbor/E10, Arbor/P15 and E10/P15) was generated. In general, there is no protein more frequent in Arbor TXTL in comparison to E10 and P15. In contrast, some translation related proteins were slightly more abundant in E10 and P15 like certain tRNA ligases (PheS and PheT). The RecBCD subunits (the dsDNA degrading complex) is of similar abundance in all TXTLs, showing the importance to consider its negative impact on the assembly. The results were further validated with DAVID, a tool for finding metabolic pathways based on proteomic data. The identified pathways indicate no correlation with transcription/translation related pathways (data not shown).
We concluded that the performance difference is most likely due to decreased activity during TXTL preparation rather than a change in composition.

Total protein injection amount was 0.5 µg. Gradient length was 1h. The data was then analyzed using MaxQuant and the Uniprot E. coli K12 FASTA file. The LFQ data was filtered for proteins that occur in both duplicates of at least one cell lysate group (Arbor E10 P14).

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project Chemotaxis Modelling_-_-_TEXT.html," starts at radius = 0.015 m (in between 0.012 m and 0.028 m), green: 2×105 seconds  chemotaxis starts at radius = 0.008 m, which is less than 0.012. This shows that the chemotactic response of the bacteria is inefficient when they are placed between 0.0028 m and 0.0012 m from the root tip. The green line shows that the bacteria can be maintained close to the seed when it is placed at a distance of less than 0.012 m away from the root tip. Therefore, the model suggests that the bacteria should be placed at a distance of less than 0.012 m in our project implementation.
In conclusion, the threshold chemoattractant concentration for bacterial detection is 1x10-8 M and the level where the bacterial chemoattractant detection becomes saturated is 1x10-5 M. And we also demonstrated that the detection threshold and saturation level are independent of number of chemoattractant receptors, however, in order to enable maximum sensitivity, the strongest promoter should chosen for Phyto-route module . Furthermore, with malate concentration equal to 3 mM, the threshold detection concentration is at a distance of 0.028 m from the root, and the saturation concentration is reached at 0.012 m (1.2 cm) away from the root. From modelling the chemotaxis of the bacterial population, we observed that the chemotaxis to the root is slow if the bacteria are initially placed in between 0.012 m and 0.028 m, while, when placing the bacteria within 0.012 m from the root, the bacteria are likely to stabilise and remain close to the root. The distance for stable bacterial localisation (1.2 cm) is greater than 0.25 cm (the distance where nutrients can be effectively taken up by the root), therefore it is suggested that for our seed coat implementation, the bacteria should be placed at or closer than 0.25 cm away from the root.

Expression of GFP in theory should make the color of medium brighter thus luminance value will be lower compared to E. coli which did not express GFP. Tube no. 1, and 4 has higher luminance value than tube no. 3, which is as expectation. But tube no. 2 showed low luminance value too. The reason may be because the color differences are too small (luminance value range < 5), thus accuracy of the results was low. In our project using mRFP (data not shown), the difference of luminance value between expressed and non-expressed mRFP were about 50.
Finally to validate the expression of GFP, we used the only equipment available in our Lab, which can visualize specifically fluorescent protein including GFP ((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein; accessed on Sep. 24th, 2014). Two observations were made, in liquid and solid states. As shown in Figure 4 (top), observation of the culture medium showed that tube no. 3 has bright yellow color compared to other tubes. The color should come from GFP expressed by E. coli BL21(DE3)/BBa_I13522 cultured with auto induction reagent. However, the color was not very significant. Thus, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and once again observed. As shown in Figure 4 (bottom), tube no. 3 showed much bright yellow color compared to other tubes. This result concluded that this tube really containsE. coli BL21(DE3)/BBa_I13522 expressing GFP.

In conclusion, our measurement system using mobile phone camera could not detect GFP expression in liquid medium because of small differences observed by naked eyes. Thus, we used mRFP instead for our iGEM project.

At about 11:00 am, we met Teacher Xinrong Zhou and introduced iGEM and our project this year briefly to her.  She showed great interest and claimed that knowledge in books is traditional and out of date, iGEM could make students get in touch with the cutting-edge knowledge of synthetic biology. In the afternoon, we gave a  lecture to students about iGEM and synthetic biology. They asked questions with great enthusiasm and felt curious about the knowledge out of books. Although the speech was over till 5:30 pm, some students were still asking about synthetic biology and the procedures for the enrollment to iGEM teams. We are very delighted to bring students some new knowledge and meanwhile we invited them to visit our laboratory and conduct some experiments.
OUR VISIT TO Nankai University
We visited professor Cunjiang Song in Nankai University. We asked some questions and acquired the strains and plasimds we needed from him. We needed the strain pseudomonas putida KT2440, however, we lacked the related protocol for it. Then we found that professor Cunjiang Song had had a in-depth knowledge about it. After the corresponance, Song agreed to present us the strain we wanted. Besides giving us the strain, Song gave us some valuable advices about the improvement of enzyme activity. We were also pleased to talk about the strain with senior Ting Gong who is Song’s student. At last Song gave us the plasmid we needed. We are so grateful for the strain and plasmids Song gave us.

Prof. Liu
When constructing a controllable inducing lysis system in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we need the P22 genes 13,19 and 15.But to synthesize them is not an easy work. Fortunately, we got access to Prof. Liu from East China University of Science and Technology, who used a plasmid containing those genes according to her paper “A controllable bacterial lysis system to enhance biological safety of live attenuated Vibrio anguillarum vaccine”. Interested in our project, she would like to give the plasmid to us. But it’s a great pity that the strain and the plasmid were lost because of the removal. Though failed to get the genes in this way, we are grateful for Prof. Liu’s help. Here are the screenshot pictures of the e-mail records.

We concluded that something had gone wrong. The stochastic switch team also used a well on the same gel, which worked, so we concluded that the gel was not the likely cause of the error. Therefore something went wrong at either the preparation for the PCR stage, or during the PCR. The gel image can be seen below:

Summary
Goksel adding digested sspB DNA to the gel - this band will be cut out and cleaned
Today we froze our strains into the TPA collection, by freezing them down in DMSO in the -80 freezers both in the lab as well as duplicates in the stock freezer.  Goksel did a digest of the sspb PCR product that was cleaned up yesterday.
Yesterday a PCR was done of CzrA, sacA, ara, and sspb. The products of these were run on a gel, the results of which are shown below. It seemed that there was no PCR product for both the CzrA, and ara, however there is a shadow from all of the wells at around 200bp that could be contamination of PCR product- we are unsure.
Despite inconclusive gel results a PCR product clean up was done on all four reactions.  Restriction digests were done on the sac and sspb purified products, which had reasonably clear bands on the gel. These were cut with EcoRI and pstI ready for ligation into the plasmid backbone.
sspB digest and DNA extract
Digested sspB
We digested sspB and run the final 70ul of the mix + 10ul of loading buffer on the gel with large wells. We used the ingredients below to prepare the 70ul of the final solution

qPCR Assay
To test the efficacy of gene silencing in vivo, we designed a qPCR assay around the target genes of interest (secA, mecA, ddl), Hfq, and two reporter genes: 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). These reporters were chosen as they are part of crucial metabolic function, and expression levels are expected to be constant, even if gene silencing is occurring at other sites. Furthermore, these genes are genetically distant from the genes of interest, and thus have no probability of being expressed on a polycistronic mRNA. We successfully demonstrated that the assay is highly sensitive and produces linear results using a block of DNA containing each element of interest. Note the figures plot copy number of the genes of interest against fluorescence emission data."

Although most individuals get MRSA infections from healthcare facilities, contact with MRSA can happen anywhere, and anyone can become infected. Since Waterloo iGEM’s project aims to make MRSA cells sensitive to antibiotics, public health and safety can be improved, and therefore garner public interest.
Livestock Operations
80% of all antibiotics in the United States are used for livestock operations (Casey et al 2013). The use of antibiotics in livestock operations has resulted in the development of pathogens that have resistance to methicillin and other antibiotics. Livestock animals can act as reservoirs for the independent development of MRSA (Spoor et al 2013). Furthermore, livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) cells have the potential to spread to humans, as shown in livestock operation workers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, and in contaminated food (Rinsky et al 2013), (Van Cleef et al 2010), (Garcia-Graells et al 2011), (Boost et al 2013), (Pu, Wang, and Ge 2011). The use of Staphylocide can reduce the spread of MRSA among livestock populations, and prevent the spread to livestock workers.

""Beware varroa: Apicoli is guarding the beehive!!""
Easter egg
Apis mellifera, the most efficient and widespread honey producing species, is heavily affected by the mite Varroa destructor. This pathogen is actually one of the most important cause of death for domestic bees. Indeed, according to beekeepers, up to 50% of the swarms can be lost every year because of this parasite, causing tremendous economic damages.
35%
Percentage of hives disapearing every year in the US*
*INRA
70%
Honey production loss in France since 1995*
*UNAF

Number of hives lost every year in France since 1995*
*UNAF
Our team is committed to preserving honeybees by limiting infection of beehives by these mites. The aim of our project is to create a bacterium able to bait and eliminate the parasite using the Synthetic Biology tools and philosophy. The engineered bacterium, named ApiColi, will be safely placed in a trap and will express alternatively an attractant molecule and a poison for the Varroa destructor, in agreement with the honeybee life cycle. Our trap will be sealed to avoid any contact of the microorganism with the bees and the environment. We hope that our concept will help to reduce the decrease in bee populations and its disastrous consequences.

Final details
Bug fixing
We noticed, that not all of the award filters gave the right number of teams. This was due to false unlisting in the JSON to RData conversion script. After fixing this bug and after removing the false runner up awards in 2011 all the awards were finally correct.
By converting the methods to lower case before matching them methods missing beforehand, as for example Gibson and FRET, could also be detected.
Design adjustments
In order to have a nice layout when integrating the apps into a page resembling our wiki, a text box gicing a short introduction to the corresponding app was put next to the major input elements. This top section is now optically separated from the results area and all apps fit nicely into the minimum width of the iframe, which is 900px.
Chart details
As most of our charts are only displaying discrete values we wanted to get rid of the extra decimal positions in the axis labeling. This was achieved by adding a short piece of javascript in the corresponding nvd3 plot parameters. Since the number of tick marks was not reduced by the rounding of the numbers this produced repetitive tick marks if only small values were displayed. To avoid this the height and the position of the plot were changed depending on the number of ticks to be displayed. As the final detail browser compatibility tags were added to the css and axis labels were added to the plots.

Team:Lyon-INSA/collaboration
From 2012.igem.org
How did we collaborate?
Collaboration is a very important issue. We think that sharing our ideas could be very beneficial for both teams engaged in the collaboration. There are more than 240 teams involved in the iGEM 2012 so it was impossible not to find another team sharing some aspects of our project.
iGEM FRANCE
iGEM FRANCE is a network gathering the French iGEM community together, linked by a collaborative website. Everything started in February 2012 in Lyon, by the meeting ""The iGEM French Touch"", organized by the Lyon-INSA iGEM team to help new French iGEMers to improve their scientific, human and financial organization. The ambition of iGEM France is to promote and develop in France SynBio research and development, SynBio teaching, biosafety and  bioethics, dialogue between science and society, and develop SynBio programmation by Governmental agencies.
Collaboration with the University of British Columbia (UBC)
We have established a collaboration with UBC for our Human Practice. Indeed, UBC was working on Intellectual property (IP) this year, an aspect we also chose to explore.
One of our advisors is a Professor in Economics. Thus, we have suggested to UBC when they sent their survey on IP, that we could share with them our knowledge and thoughts to improve their survey or to interpret the results of their survey. In exchange they shared the results of their survey with us.
We have used their results to show what kind of IP issues iGEM teams could meet. To see the results of our collaboration you might want to read our Human Practice page .
An interesting way to undertake a collaboration with Göttingen team
Furthermore, we have tried to begin a collaboration with the Göttingen team . They are working on a super swimming E. coli strain. We have proposed them different ways for collaboration. For example, we were interested in comparing the impact of swimming on biofilm destabilization between their E. coli strain and our Bacillus subtilis natural swimming strain. We offered to send them our Bacillus subtilis strain to also make them able to perform comparative swimming behavior studies between both strains. Several different reasons made this collaboration unsuccessful.
Collaboration with TU Munich

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important non-proton polar solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds. It is widely used in MTT stain and cell preservation.
DMSO is a combustible reagent that must be kept in sealed containers away from heat or flame. Also, it is thought to be toxic for blood vessels, liver and kidney. Also, due to its high affinity with skin, toxins and medicines dissolved in DMSO can be quickly absorbed into human body, which may cause potential side effects, including headaches, burning and itching on contact with the skin.
DMSO can be absorbed mainly through breathing and skin-contacting. For prevention, gloves and eye protectors are required in experiment with DMSO. Common nitrile gloves may provide protection from brief contact but may degrade rapidly in contact with DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15 mil) latex gloves are recommended.
Chloroform, or trichloromethane, is a colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid that is produced on a large scale as a precursor of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and refrigerants.
Chloroform may cause irritation to eyes, skin and mucous membrane. Prolonged dermal exposure can result in the development of sores as a result of defatting. It's also a carcinogen and can impair liver and kidney to some extent. Moreover, chloroform dose harm to nervous system that it causes depression of the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately leading to deep coma and respiratory center depression. Serious illnesses would ensue upon ingestion of 7.5 g (0.26 oz) of chloroform. The mean lethal oral dose for an adult is estimated to be about 45 g (1.6 oz). Due to its threat to respiratory and cardiac symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, prostration, jaundice, coma, liver necrosis and degeneration, the anesthetic use of chloroform has been ceased.
Chloroform is not stable and easily decomposed in exposure to light, so it should be kept in brown bottle away from light, heat and acetone (acetone will have acute reactions with chloroform). For protection from chloroform, lab workers should wear proper nitrite gloves and eyes protectors, as well as working in the fume hood. Spent chloroform should be extracted and collected for further disposal.

1. Raw data
OD600 of the BL21 liquid culture overnight was 1.063. Surprisingly, this is different than our results from 5.13 Determining E coli Concentration With Spectrophotometer .

This experiment indicates that BL21 overnight liquid culture might not have the same concentration of bacteria. We'll need to measure bacterial concentration using spectrophotometer every time during mutagenesis to get an accurate estimate of the number of bacteria we are adding. However, to get approximately OD 0.5, for our dilution step in our mutagenesis protocol, we will use 1:50.

We have learned something from the collected questionnaires……
a) The bioreactors employed by the invested object teams varied from each other. Most of them employed E.coli, and few used yeast while others used Cyanobacteria, Gluconacetobacter xylinus, Lactococcus lactis and so on.
However, over 90% and about 35% of the teams had encountered the problems of bacterial contamination and phage infection in labs, respectively.
b) More than 70% of the labs relied on regular laboratory sterilization (UV, ozone, etc.) and strict control of laboratory environment and operation to prevent the problems. Meanwhile, the use of antibiotics also accounted for 34% as a solution.

We had a talk on synthetic biology and our project, and organized related workshops at a science event in downtown Helsinki.
Universities
As the only iGEM team in Finland we considered inspiring new iGEM teams a priority in our outreach work. Other Nordic countries of similar size also have more than one team, so this should be achievable in Finland as well. Norway has 1 team per 2.6 million inhabitants, Sweden 1 team per 2.5 million inhabitants and Denmark 1 team per 1.9 million inhabitants, whereas our team alone currently represents all the 5.2 million inhabitants of Finland. To get more teams next year and strengthen the iGEM community in Finland we contacted biotechnology researchers in two major Finnish universities outside Helsinki. Thankfully, researchers from Tampere University of Technology and the University of Turku welcomed us to give a presentation for their students and faculty members. We visited the universities and talked about synthetic biology, iGEM, our project and offered our help if anyone was interested in starting an iGEM team of their own. We also discussed with the local researchers about their synthetic biology projects and were given a tour in their facilities. We're confident we'll be seeing more teams in Finland next year!
Besides inspiring new iGEM teams, we will continue to actively promote iGEM and synthetic biology in our own universities, giving presentations to students in both the University of Helsinki and Aalto University to ensure an ever growing number of applicants for the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team.

In addition to university students, we reached out to high schools to increase awareness of synthetic biology and iGEM. Our team members went to talk to students and teachers of Mäkelänrinne High School and Viikki High School. We also mentioned the high school track in hopes of inspiring students and high schools to form teams of their own. In addition we met with a dozen high school students in training for the International Biology Olympiad . These students were chosen for the training through a nationwide biology competition, thus representing some of the most motivated high school students in the whole country. We gave a presentation to them about synthetic biology, iGEM, our project and our study fields. We also heard about their training and interests. After presentations, we were very glad to notice how enthusiastic they were"

According to the rule-based languages, such as BNGL[1,2] and Kappa Language[3], molecules are represented with structured objects comprised of agents that can take any number of sites. Bonds could be formed by connecting sites on different agents to group them together and form complex. Typically, sites represent functional physical entities of various kinds of molecules, such as DNA-binding domains and promoter regions. Besides serving as terminal ends of bonds, sites can also take on any number of labels representing its internal states. Labels can be phosphorylation/unphorsphorylation status of proteins and open/close status of a complex of RNA polymerase and a promoter. Biological processes between agents can be easily and conveniently represented by the changes of their sites on the binding status and labels. An example of Lac dimer is given to briefly illustrate the syntax of this representation. Each Lac repressor, LacR, has one dimerization domain dim and can thus be written as LacR(dim). By connecting the two dim domains of two LacRs, the Lac dimer is then represented as LacR(dim!1).LacR(dim!1), where `.' separates different agents and the same number following `!' shared by two dim domains indicates a bond formation between them. The essences of those languages are preserved in MoDeL but with some major changes to make it better suited to describe synthetic biological systems.
Synthetic biological systems are mostly Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRNs), in which regulations in both transcriptional and translational level are key to control the system to exhibit some complex bahaviors, such as oscillation. DNA sequences composed of basic BioBrick parts (agents) are not consicely represented, resulting in unreadability of the reaction rules containing such DNA sequences. In their representations, each part has both upstream and downstream domain and adjacent parts are connected by forming a bond between the upstream domain of one part and the downstream domain of the other. In addition, all the agents in Kappa Language are allowed to appear in any order so that it may blur the recognition of spatial relationship of agents; it is hard to pick up the agents in a DNA chain with the correct order. For example, a complex"

Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

LuxO, when phosphorylated, binds to the Qrr4 promoter, activating transcription of Qrr4 mRNA. Qrr4 mRNA interferes with HapR, so there is no protein HapR. HapR is a repressor whose binding site is at the promoter for GFP. When Qrr4 eliminates HapR, there is no repression of the expression of GFP. Thus, GFP should be ON when Cholera is NOT present. The reverse is also true. In the presence of Cholera autoinducer, CQSS acts as a phophatase on LuxU, which does the same to LuxO, which does NOT activate Qrr4 mRNA which does NOT degrade HapR which represses transcription of GFP. Thus GFP should NOT glow in the presence of cholera. Our results in these test tubes aren’t exactly in agreement with what we want.
- KP Today we worked on our presentation for Friday and we also went over the quorum sensing with Dr. Grose.
4/12/13
- KP We had our presentation today. It was good practice and I learned some things to improve on in the future. There was some confusion on the quorum sensing, because we thought that HapR was a repressor and that it shouldn’t glow green in the presence of cholera. It turn out that it is the other way around and that it should glow green in the presence of cholera and red in the absence of cholera. That still doesnt explain why our tests are glowing green in the absence of cholera. We will have to work backwards and find out exactly what it is that we have. I feel that we have a clearer view of what we need to do. Also, I need to do more research other than wikipedia on lambda phage and its lytic and lysogenic cycles, because in our presentation, I said that that lambda enters the lytic cycle when it is in a cell that is healthy and lysogenic cycle when the cell is in trouble. That is what it says on wikipedia. Anyway, when I said that, I was told that I was wrong and that it is the other way around. I will look into that. We also hopefully got our quorum sensing system worked out now. All we need to do (once we figure out what we actually have in our plasmids) is add the cro transcription site after the GFP, and in the presence of cholera more cro will be produced and lambda will enter the lytic cycle!

Samples collected from cell growth on Saturday were lysed today using enzymatic cell lysis.
Cell samples were pooled together in one 50 mL Falcon tube, with a final cell weight of 7.5 grams in 22.5 mL of lysis buffer.
Lysozyme was added to thawed cell solution on ice (4.5 mg, or approximately 0.0045g) and incubated on ice, swirling periodically for 30 minutes.
PMSF was added to the cell solution following lysozyme at a final concentration of 1mM from a 100mM stock (225uL of 100 mM PMSF stock).
While stirring vigorously, 11.25g of Deoxycholic acid was stirred into solution.  Lysate was then incubated at 37 degrees for 20 minutes.
20 uL of DNase I was added to the lysed samples, and incubated for 30 minutes at RT on a shaker.

Introducing the concept early on
With our nifty CARD system in production we thought it would be a great idea to embed these safety principles from the very beginning of working in a laboratory at university level and have decided to try and implement the system into the induction package for any laboratory-relevant course at our combined universities.
Applicability to other courses
In the future we hope we could expand the principle to medical students in addition, since these constitute a big cohort of the Karolinska Institute, by designing an adapted CARD with more clinically relevant information. We anticipate this would not be related to prescribing issues which are dictated by local antibiotic policy, but instead to raise awareness on hygiene practices, alternatives and additional practices for enhancing antibiotic effectiveness (i.e meticulous care of indwelling catheters and lines), disposal and human waste products and their consequences.
Furthermore, highlighting the importance of this issue to colleagues in the Toxicology courses run at our universities would be a great way to plant the seed of interest in managing antibiotic resistance in the future...and since it is a population level problem, why not approach the epidemiology and public health sciences students too?
University wide event and beyond
Ultimately, we would love to be able to organise an antibiotic resistance awareness day at our respective universities to really drive home the facts and threats of this problem, ideally partnering up with established organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO). Organisationally, this is a huge endeavour however and something we plan to focus on as an extension of our Human Practices work in iGEM, rather than as an integral component of our entry to the competition.

Characterize brain cancer stem cells. Oxygen sequestration to inhibit photorespiration and application for neuroimaging in vivo. Photorespiration—oxygen has an inhibitory effect, lowers rates of photosynthesis. Kind of a backwards photosynthesis. Rubisco—reacts with CO2 to make glucose eventually. If get too much oxygen, binds instead of CO2. Inefficient.
objectives—use oxidase or oxygen binding protein to lower oxygen level. Construct biological parts to carry out its function in vivo, use reporters to extrapolate to brain imaging for tumors.
don’t know the specific details yet. In hypoxic condition, repressor inhibits production of oxygen binding protein. Without repressor,  transcription of oxygen binding gene occurs. Sequester oxygen so it doesn’t slow rates of photosynthesis. Haven’t figured out which promoter to use yet. Still planning. Starting in e.coli, moving to C3 plants.

Industry analysis
Our general industry idea concentrates on agriculture, health care and cosmetic industry, of course, the latter is our main objective.
In recent years, China has become the area with the fastest rate of growth in retailing health care products around the world. At present, the annual value of health care products is nearly 560 billion yuan and that of cosmetics keeps more than 7% annual growth. Especially, among all kinds of cosmetics, skin care products accounts for half of the overall cosmetic market. So, the cosmetic industry has been regarded as the most profitable industry in the year of 2016 in China and, especially, there will be a broad prospect in high-end cosmetics industry. Although astaxanthin is not so famous as hyaluronic acid in cosmetic industry, actually, its medicinal value and market value is higher than those of hyaluronic acid and collagen. There will be lots of powerful effects on antioxidant and anti-aging with the addition of astaxanthin. Nowadays, people all desire health and thus, the demand of astaxanthin will tend to rise. However, current production way  is to extract astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis or some kinds of yeast. There are only 7 normative manufacturers of astaxanthin, which cause the phenomenon that the demand for astaxanthin exceeds the supply and the costs of astaxanthin is quite high. So, if our project can be put into mass production of astaxanthin by extracting from plants (for example, rice), we will take a great advantage in the market.
Because our products come from rice, the project itself is greatly related to agriculture. Thus, we take part in The Sixth Asian Conference on Precision Agriculture held in SCAU this year so that we can make a understanding towards the situation of modern agriculture development in Asia.
Social contract
Aiming at learning about the social contract concerning the genetically modified product, we took part in the lecture made by the key lab of China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment (CFSA) about food safety, lecturing by researcher Wu Yongning.
End of 2015, our team members join in the large scale genetically modified science and technology lecture as well, lecturing by Kou Jianping, who is the commissioner of China agriculture science ministry and technology education department genetically modified organisms safety management and intellectual property rights, and Lin Min, who is the director of China academy of agricultural sciences biotechnology research institute.

The type of the DNA determines the second parameter: possible behaviours with respect to RNA Polymerase:
Permit to bind, and pass through (like a promoter)
Permit to pass through, but not bind (like regular DNA)
Do not permit binding or passing through (like a terminator)
The DNA's behaviour is set to one of these when its type is determined, but this behaviour can then change depending on the state of a third parameter: whether it is bound by a repressor or activator or not. The information of which type of protein is binding or unbinding, combined with the DNAs type, is enough to determine what behaviour the DNA is now responsible for.

Marketing
I began looking at WestJet and Air Canada flights flying to Boston. I had callled a few travel agencies to try to get a quote. I also looked at Hotels at MIT. I need to determine how far it is from MIT, whether it would be economical to stay there and take a cab or get a hotel closer (but a little bit more expensive) and walk to MIT. I also made a list of hotels including their rates, discounts, services, distance from MIT, etc.
I began following up with companies via phone and email. I found 16 more companies that I could contact. I began researching those companies and writing up emails to them.
The team also sat down to discuss logo designs, colors, shapes, etc.

Glycerol stock preparation of successfully-biobricked parts
Today was a day of plasmid isolation and glycerol stock preparation. I made overnight cultures and restreaks last night of the parts that I had biobricked. We need some isolated DNA for the registry, as well as glycerol stocks for long-term storage. We have samples of everything that I prepared, with concentrations on the order of 100 ng/uL. One of the sets - the LuxO D47A BBk - was not isolated well, so I made new overnights and will prepare glycerol stocks of those tomorrow.

In order to improve the experimental techniques and ideas, we went to Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology to exchange and study on August 21th, 2018. First of all, we communicated with our teachers about the background of our experimental project, the innovation of intelligent metabolic pathway, the effect of tetracycline and so on, and listened carefully to the suggestions given by them.
Here are the inspirations and suggestions we got from the exchange:
Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology
—Focus on experimental design and operation
How to reflect an effective feedback mechanism?
How to reflect the innovation point and function line of the project?
What is the relationship between glutamate concentration and cell survival?
Changes in product yield after project completion.
Then we followed the staff to understand the development of the Institute, related research projects, fermentation production and scientific research status, the operation of synthetic biological instruments. Through this communication, we better improved our project ideas and experimental techniques.
Tianjin International Joint Academy Biomedicine
In order to better understand the prospects and significance of the project, we went to Tianjin International Joint Academy Biomedicine for exchange and study. We communicated with the teachers in the field of medicine and production, we discussed the influencing factors in scientific research and production, fermentation, the current production of surfactin and poly-γ-glutamate and so on. The teachers put forward many valuable questions to us and provided a lot of helps in the transformation of the project results.
Here are the inspirations and suggestions we got from the exchange:

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#FRET Reporter_-_-_TEXT.html," TEV protease with a T7 promoter.
Cutting the Fusion Protein with the TEV Protease
To cleave the GFP-REACh fusion protein, we chose Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, a highly sequence-specific cysteine protease, that is frequently used for the controlled cleavage of fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo. The native protease also contains an internal self-cleavage site. This site is slowly cleaved to inactivate the enzyme. The physiological reason for the self-cleavage is unknown, however, undesired for our use. Therefore, our team uses a variant of the native TEV protease containing the mutation S219V which results in an alteration of the cleavage site so that self-inactivation is diminished.
TEV protease with a bound peptide
This picture shows the TEV protease with a peptide chain bound in the binding pocket ready to be cleaved. The recognition site of the bound peptide chain is located inside the binding pocket of the TEV protease. It was rendered with POV-Ray.
Though quite popular in molecular biology, the TEV protease is not avaiable as a BioBrick yet. Hence, the team Aachen introduces the protease with anti-self cleavage mutation S219V and codon optimized for E. coli to the Parts Registry this year.
Achievements
Characterization of GFP-REACh1 and GFP-REACh2 fusion proteins in combination with an IPTG-inducible TEV Protease
The characterization of the TEV protease and the REACh1 and REACh2 dark quenchers was performed by introducing both simultaneously into E. coli Bl21 (DE3). The resulting double plasmid cells therefore contained K1319013 (GFP-REACh1 fusion protein) or K1319014 (GFP-REACh2 fusion protein) and K1319008 (IPTG-inducible TEV protease). K1319013 and K1319014 were located on a pSB3K3 plasmid backbone and K1319008 on a pSB1C3 backbone, two standard iGEM plasmids with different oris allowing simultaneous use in one cell.
I20260 was used as a positive control because I20260 contains the same promoter ( J23101 ), the same RBS ( B0032 ) and the same version of GFP ( E0040 ) and is located on the same plasmid backbone pSB3K3. Therefore, it is expected that when all fusion proteins are successfully cut"

project description
This year’s project is two-fold, and it involves engineering Arabidopsis thaliana with two constructs
that would be important proof of concepts for further studies of feasibility in crops. Furthermore, the
project will address the pressing need of iGEM-compatible BioBricks specific to plants , which would
allow for an increased focus on important agricultural research for iGEM teams worldwide.
          part I
The availability of soil phosphorous is considered globally to be a limiting factor of productivity for
a significant majority of agricultural land. Phosphorus-based fertilizers are used to avoid this
deficiency. Most of the fertilizer, however, often becomes fixed into inorganic and organic fractions,
and consequently is unavailable to plant roots. Moreover, according to Environment Canada, phosphorus
enrichment and runoff into surface waters “continues to be a national issue ” .The first construct of
this project would allow for extracellular secretion of phytase from Arabidopsis roots allowing the
plants to utilize the accumulated forms of soil organic phosphorus (primarily, phytate), which
otherwise would  not be available to the plant.
          part II
With the sole exception of low elevation equatorial ecosystems, plants anywhere else are often subject to
temperatures that are often lower than their threshold for growth and survival. The second construct for
this project aims to increase the range of tolerance to low temperature stress in Arabidoposis by
incorporating an antifreeze protein in the plant. This builds on Yale’s project last year.

(2)
(3)
After infection, the cells will die because of it with an specific death rate d. After it's death, virions will be released, but only a certain fraction of them will continue to cause infection, because of this we consider an effective rate of virions production N. This is represented in the following reaction:
(4)
From the reactions in (1)  and the rates described in the previous paragraph, we get the following equations:
(5)
(6)
Quasi-steady state assumption
Since the complex is a temporary interaction, in the order of seconds, due to regular movement, the changes in CP are in a much faster time-scale than the rest of the system, which develops during a couple of days, therefore it may be treated with a quasi-steady state approximation:
(7)
If we substitute (7) back into (2), (5) and (6), we get:
(8)
(9)
(10)
where we have defined K≡(k1k2)/(k-1+k2).It should be noticed that this is equivalent to the following system:
(11)
Where k serves as a parameter that describes the affinity between the baculovirus and the Sf9, mainly because of the interactions in the membrane of the cell. On the other side, N tells how effective is the production of new virions due to the lytic infection. It contains the information of the internal process in the cell, as well as the externalization.
A second approach: Delay differential equations
We also consider a second approach in the term of the virions production. The virions are not produced instantaneously after the infection of a cell. We consider a period ΤIV after infection before starting the production. Also, the cell only produces virions while they are alive, from this we have to consider an average period ΤD from the moment the cell is infected until the moment that it finally dies.
Consider an instant tI, at this moment we consider that a certain amount of dCI new healthy cells are infected. By definition this differential is given by dCI=C'I(tI)dtI. We will work under the assumption that every cell has the same behavior after infection. They should produce only while they are alive, from this the production rate should have a positive value only in [tI+ΤIV,tI+ΤD] and be zero"

He began researching synthetic biology, and realized that THAT was what he wanted to be doing in his life. Because of QGEM, he decided on pursuing a computing minor, thus giving him either bioinformatics or synthetic biology as career options after he graduates.
Julia Grein (Volunteer Liaison)
Julia is in Biochemistry with a Certificate in Business, away on a co-op placement in Business Development. Although away from the lab, Julia identifies herself with bacterial contamination, not just because she’s small but mighty, but also because she just won’t get away from iGEM! This being her third year with QGEM, she’s taken on a new role to help manage the team. When she’s not doing research, having too much fun with Microsoft Excel, or writing QGEM newsletters, she’s at the gym or lost in Toronto without data.
Christina Li (Dry Lab Volunteer)
Christina is in her second year studying computer engineering. She was introduced to QGEM through one of her engineering projects to create a blue-light transilluminator, and seized this opportunity to integrate the two things she loved: programming and synthetic biology. With high school-level biology, she found some concepts intriguing but difficult to grasp, nevertheless Christina is more than willing to sit down and crack some code or model some data. She appreciates QGEM in providing a team where she can collaborate with others and continue learning about genetics.
Deyang Li (Dry Lab Volunteer)
Deyang is in his second year of Life Sciences. He was drawn to QGEM because of its uniqueness as a student led undergraduate research team, as well as the potential applications of synthetic biology, from pharmaceutical applications to oil remediation. He currently helps with the dry-lab, and outside of QGEM, Deyang enjoys badminton, long runs, and the occasional all you can eat sushi buffet.
Sara Stickley (Wet Lab Volunteer)
Sara is in her third year of Life Sciences. She decided to join the QGEM team to gain experience in student-led research and explore the innovative and exciting field of synthetic biology and its real-world applications! When not spending time volunteering in the lab, Sara enjoys rock climbing, spending time outdoors, and desperately trying not to overwater her cacti. In the future, Sara is planning on pursuing graduate studies relating to genetics and environmental science, and hopes to travel the world.

We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system"

Figure 3-4 Image stacking decreases noise. Here, 26 images of the same field of view were taken and stacked using Adobe Photoshop. SEM Imaging & Figure: Justin Y.
To test if biofilms can trap NPs, we used a solution containing 30 nm AuNPs (from Sigma Aldrich). Because the AuNP solution is purple in color, we can take absorbance measurements. Four experimental groups were set up (figure 3-5): a negative control containing only AuNPs, and three tubes containing AuNPs with either planktonic bacteria, biofilm, or “dead” biofilm (treated with antibiotics). If AuNPs are trapped, we would expect to see a decrease in absorbance (figure 3-5B). The four groups were shaken for 24 hours and centrifuged to isolate the supernatant (figure 3-5, C). The supernatant contains free AuNPs, which were measured using a spectrophotometer at 527 nm.
Figure 3-5 Biofilms trap nanoparticles. A,B) Experimental setup. C,D) Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were incubated with either bacteria or biofilm for 24 hours, and then centrifuged; free AuNPs were expected to remain in the supernatant. Shown are representative images and graph. Experiment: Yvonne W. Figure: Justin Y.
The negative control and the AuNP with planktonic bacteria groups did not change the purple color of the AuNP solution, indicating that bacteria alone cannot trap NPs (figure 3-5, C and D). The addition of biofilm, however, greatly reduced the amount of AuNP in the supernatant. Even with antibiotics, AuNP levels in the supernatant were still reduced, suggesting that the removal of AuNPs depends on the sticky and slimy extracellular components of biofilm and not on the bacteria itself. When we fixed and imaged the biofilm + AuNP"

On the other hand, 27.8% of the survey participants from Ghana  answered Yes to the question: Could GMO help reduce malnutrition in your country?, compared with 14.4%  in Denmark, and 22.7% in the UK. Furthermore, 41.7% answered Maybe, which suggests that people in Ghana  are very open-minded towards GMO as a way to reduce malnnourishment.
Argentina
We received 49 answers from people living in Argentina.
44.9% of the survey participants from Argentina had heard about GMO before which is the lowest percentage of Yes answers among the countries. In contrast 83.7% would eat a nourishing bacteria which would be a GMO. We  wonder if the survey participants were aware of this.
The survey participants from Argentina also had the highest percentage of Yes answers to the question regarding if GMO could help reduce malnutrition in Argentina. 26.5% answered Yes, and 44.9% answered Maybe. Only 4.1% answered No, compared with 10.5%, 9.1% and 11.1% in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ghana respectively. The data  suggests that people in Argentina are very open-minded towards GMO as a help to reduce malnutrition.
Conclusion
The questionnaire gave us a good idea of the general opinion about GMO and the ethical issue of eating bacteria. It shows that most people, are very open-minded towards GMO as a food source and as a way to fight malnourishment, which contradicted with our expectations. Furthermore the data showed us, that most people with a connection to a university had heard about GMO before, but most of these people came from Europe. We think that this might be because people in Europe are more used to being critical towards new initiatives.
Regarding the question: Would you eat a bacteria, that could provide the optimal quantity of nutrition you need?, we wondered if all survey participants were aware of the fact that a nourishing bacteria doesn't exist, and that it requires genetical modification to create one.
We saw no clear tendency with the question: Could GMO help reduce malnutrition in your country? The answers of the individual survey participants were very diverse, but we can conclude that more people from Ghana and Argentina see a potential of GMO as a help to fight malnourishment in their country. This could be due to the fact that people in Ghana and Argentina are presented with undernourishment in their own country as an everyday crude reality.

In a paper published last year, Paungfoo-Lonhienne et al. showed that Arabidopsis and tomato plants are able to actively break down their cell wall to take up GFP-tagged E. coli and S. cerevisiae and use them as a source of nutrients.

Design
While malate-responsive sensors do not occur in E. coli, they have been identified in several other bacteria species, including the soil microbe Pseudomonas putida. We therefore chose to engineer the chemoreceptor mcpS from the P. putida KT2440 strain. McpS is a receptor that responds to a number of TCA cycle intermediates such as malate, fumarate, oxaloacetate, succinate, citrate, isocitrate and butyrate. (Lacal et al, 2010). P. putida and E. coli have different functioning of chemotaxis system, however with structurally similar chemotaxis proteins. Since these proteins are structurally similar, it is reasonable to assume that the mcpS domain will interact with the Che proteins in E. coli and the bacteria will be able to perform chemotactic response upon malate binding to an introduced receptor mcpS. In addition to usage of mcpS chemoreceptor, we are also introducing another malate responsive chemoreceptor PA2652 from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 strain (Alvarez-Ortega & Harwood, 2007). With PA2652 we are applying the same logic as with mcpS, in that structural similarity is enough for these proteins to be compatible with native chemotaxis system of E. coli. The introduction of two different malate chemoreceptors to different cells, allows us to compare different responsiveness of rewired chemotaxis based on structural similarity of introduced receptors to the common E. coli receptors.
Genetic constructs for expression of malate chemoreceptor are not complicated, however they are modular. Expression of the constructs is under constitutive expression of promoter J23100. It is provided from the registry in the biobrick K398500, in the backbone vector pSB1C3. The coding sequence has been removed from this construct using PCR, providing us with backbone vector with the constitutive promoter, to be assembled using Gibson or CPEC assembly. Ribosome binding sites (RBS) have been generated using Salis RBS calculator with relative translation initiation rates (TIR): 44050 & 42010 for mcpS and PA2652 respectively"
Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming#Health test_-_-_TEXT.html," fatal in less than an hour.
Despite the advance in emergency therapy, antivenom is often only the effective treatment. In treatment antivenom is injected into patient intravenously which could neutralize the toxin. Collecting of antivenom is done by milking the venom and injected into the cattle. The subject will undergo immune response where its antibody produced can be collected. This common method of obtaining antivenom can tackle many toxins in the venom but however is considered unproductive since only small amount of antivenom is produced from the animal blood which is due to complicated serum purification process from the animal's serum. Waiting of animal recovery from venom also make its production quite slow and in several cases the animals die after injection.
Therefore bacteria should be introduced as a substituted platform utilizing synthetic biology to deal with the problems mentioned above. Apart from existing characterised antivenom, other antivenoms could be more easily discovered using the various mutagenesis of variable region of antivenom antibody. To develop this platform, well known venom could be produced to test this platform. Indian cobra snake is therefore chosen as the first target due to its generality, high toxicity and it is also one of the highest profile antivenom discovered which could potentially save many victims from this fatal snakebite.
The way to engineer the bacteria is to mutagenise the shark antibody gene to allow different variable regions of the antibody to be expressed on the surface of the bacteria in different libraries. The venom is screened onto each plate of different bacteria libraries. The venom will bind to the right antibody and trigger the signal cascade which results in the expression of the fluorescence proteins which can be detected by FACs. machine. The bacteria that produces the antibody for the venom will be subjected to DNA sequencing which could be the platform for producing bacteria expressing antibody specific to the venom in the future. (Text by Ming)
So the method for the anti-venom generation begins as follows: 1: Take the venom proteins and bind biotin to either the C or N terminus so that it is able to be fixed to a large ferro-magnetic beads that are coated in streptavidin. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin and the beads can be picked up with a neodynium magnet - so the bacteria with the 'antibody' on their surface that is able to bind to the venom proteins will be attached to the bead. 2: The bacteria will have a plasmid that encodes a gene for a single-chain variable fragment, a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of"

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Current Challenges
Proposed Solutions
Proposed Solutions
After identifying some difficulties iGEM teams could face when trying to work with mammalian chassis, our team came up with some potential solutions for these issues. Our team is proposing these broad solutions in an effort to inspire discussion in the iGEM community, and ultimately lead to more creative ways to increase research in mammalian chassis.
The three major challenges that we identified were: cost, parts, and awareness.
Cost
We believe that cost is the largest barrier for most teams, and also the most difficult limitation to overcome. While the combination of increasing interest in mammalian synthetic biology along with technological advances should lower cost over time, our team was interested in thinking of more short-term proactive solutions.
We recognize that one of the most costly factors in doing research in mammalian chassis is the initial cost of equipment like tissue culture hoods and CO2-regulated incubators. Therefore, our team thought about creating an avenue to connect iGEM teams that are based in institutions or labs in which research in mammalian cells is actively done with teams that do not have access to this equipment at the home institutions. Teams with proper facilities could volunteer to be on a “MammoBoard”, and teams without facilities could perform primary cloning and ship their constructs to MammoBoard teams in order to get testing done in mammalian chassis.
Another option is to request facility space at local companies - this might be difficult and only a promising solution for teams located very close to certain biotech companies, but we think it is a good starting point for discussion.
In terms of cost of reagents, we think that teams with proper facilities in place can identify companies that provide reagents and request donations (suggestion courtesy of Natalie Farny, an instructor from WPI). We purchased our reagents this summer from Fisher Scientific, and there are other companies that supply mammalian products such as Sigma Aldrich and Promega . We suggest that future mammalian teams speak with some of these companies for reagent donations in subsequent years.
In future years, companies that are interested in supporting mammalian synthetic biology research in iGEM can help develop a “MammoKit"

Tongji_Shanghai,2016,Team:Tongji Shanghai#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," we made an exhibition of some animal and plant specimen, told the story behind the specimen. They seemed so interested in biology. Then we popularize scientific knowledge about synthetic biology and introduced the iGEM competition to them. It was a little changeable for them, so we tried to make it easy to understand. It’s great to share with senior high school students. They are so young that they have some extraordinary ideas which surprised us a lot.
Tongji Hospital Visit
Since our project is about tumor and its treatment, we want to know how will patients and citizens think of it. Thanks to Tongji Hospital, we could get the access to introduce iGEM and our project to the patients, and then we could communicate with them about their life as well. Some ideas were quite constructive and helpful to our improvement of the project, though most patients couldn't understand it well. On the other hand, it's meaningful for us to learn more about empathy and care. We are willing and determined to do more volunteer work about health and care in the future. IGEM is a great platform to start, and there is a long way to go.
Team Communications
Taipei Workshop in NYMU
We are proudly invited by National Yang-Ming University, an active iGEM team to have a visit in Taipei in August. NYMU kindly held an communication meeting together with other iGEM teams in north Taiwan: TAS, NTHU, NCTU.
We shared our project ideas and give suggestion with each other. To improve commutation experience, we had a “World Café” Workshop focus on environmental protect and youth social responsibility. Team members from different schools presented their personal thoughtful ideas. Moreover, we made a colorful painting together to conclude our discussion results after the workshop.
Unforgettable experience with all the new friends form Taiwan! We not only considered project suggestions and perfected our projects but made friends with each other as well.
Seminar with SJTU
Our team is found on Nov 19, 2015, 2 months before Team SJTU2016 is found. A visit to Shanghai Jiaotong University in Minhang District is paid on Dec 27, 2015. We shared some remarkable project that we had collected from all of the teams in the season of 2015 and some even before. Then they showed us around the campus and had a great lunch together.
