Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#11 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html," HindIII DNA ladder, it has to be remembered that they are uncut so they don't reflect their true length (which is roughly bp) - the gel just shows that there is DNA present there. However the two samples are consistent in size which suggests no contamination.
Process products from a PCR reaction involving arsR BioBrick and cadA Promoter DNA
In the previous lab session, PCR reactions were carried out in an attempt to amplify a promoter-less arsR BioBrick (the BBa_J33206 BioBrick minus the promoter region) and cadA promoter region - these will form the cadmium-sensing AND gate. The plan is to run these products on a gel and if we get results, carry out the following:
Clean up product
Run in agarose gel in electrophoresis
Cut with NheI and BamHI
Clean digested product
Ligate cadA promoter region and a promoter-less BBa_J33206 arsR BioBrick (in pSB1A2 plasmid)
The gel photograph produced after the PCR products were run through 0.8% agarose gel showed that the PCR reactions did in fact work. The Metal Sensing team proceded to clean up the two products however not all of the ethanol was removed! This error became apparent when trying to load the gel with the cleaned up product as the sample immediately dissipated into the buffer surrounding the gel.
This means we will have to carry out another PCR reaction to obtain the arsR BioBrick (without promoter) in pSB1A2 backbone and the cadA promoter region; we shall then continue with the steps listed above. The PCR reaction was prepared and initiated in the afternoon so the products should be ready for tomorrow's lab session.
Results
We took the decision to run 4 sets of DNA samples on 0.8% agarose gel - this includes the midi-prep samples (i.e. cotC, kinA, pGFP-rrnB, pMUTIN4 and pSB1AT3), products from a PCR reaction involving cotC, futher midi-preps of pMUTIN4 and digests from midi-prepped DNA the Stochastic Switch team have prepared (i.e. sac, ara and sleB) The resulting GelDoc photograph can be seen below:

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#Biodetoxification_-_-_TEXT.html," resistant to several antibiotics, which made it unfeasible to insert multiple plasmids containing the dCas9 and HMF pathway. It is resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol and carbenicillin was tested and had no effect on growth. Most recently, we are trying to insert the dCas9 system into the genome using homologous recombination, but that has also proved difficult. We decided to suspend this project until after the Jamboree and focus on the Codon Optimization project, which was also experiencing cloning difficulties.
What We Have Accomplished
Ashlee and Emily have managed to construct the first plasmid, termed plasmid 1.2, as shown below. This plasmid contains the dCas9 system (5.5 kb), the Lambda Red Recombinase system (3 kb) and the Kanamycin resistance marker (1 kb). It also contains two 1 kb genome overlaps with the P. putida upp gene. This gene encodes for the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRTase), which is sensitive to 5-fluorouracil. This would allow us to use a counterselection method to insert our second plasmid containing the HMF pathway. However, to construct the second plasmid, we needed the Kanamycin resistance marker to be inserted into the genome. Since this has not happened, we could not continue making plasmids.
The figure below displays the plan to insert the dCas9 and HMF gene cluster into the genome of Pseudomonas putida.
Insert the dCas9 system and HMF pathway into the P. putida genome
Note: Genes not to scale
We prepared a plasmid containing the dCas9 system, kanamycin resistance marker, and Lambda Red Recombinase system. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli due to its greater cloning efficiency, and was excised using restriction enzymes AflII and PacI in order to attempt homologous recombination.
First, we created what we termed ""Plasmid 1"" via Gibson Chew-Back Assembly. The individual parts contained in this plasmid are approximately 1 kb genome overlaps ""Overlap 1"" and ""Overlap 2"", ColE1 replication origin so the plasmid can be replicated in E. coli, and the kanamycin resistance marker ""KanR"" to select for cells that have the correct plasmid.
Next, we added dCas9 system via an overnight ligation. Using the restriction sites"

Open Science, Responsible Innovation, Big Data and Open access: What are those trends and why should you care?
Either you are a scientist or not, you may not have heard about those terms before but you definitely will in the future.        Open science is a movement whose aims are to increase transparency of research, increase its public availability and accessibility through open access and open data, and to promote scientific collaborations in order for anyone to have the tools to contribute to scientific progress.
Sounds familiar? The iGEM competition is a great example of open science. By using the BioBrick standards, everyone is working in the same way which increases the potential of scientific cooperation.       In addition, as the registry is an open-source BioBrick library, anyone can share their work and improve previous constructions in order to make synthetic biology go forward.      Open Science is spreading in other fields as well and is heading to the development of a new paradigm in research but also in the industry with the rise of “open innovation”.      The research and innovation of tomorrow will be cooperative and based on win-win partnership which is why you better be aware of this movement!
The research and innovations of tomorrow are also expected to meet criteria of “Responsible Research and Innovation” (RRI).       As global awareness is rising, new products and services will be more and more judged on their social and environmental impact.       Innovation strategy will have to adapt, from up-to-bottom to bottom-up strategies, by increasing the contributions of end-users, employees and all individuals on the innovation process.       Synthetic biology is not an exception and is even more subjected to RRI as the development of the field is highlighting ethical dilemma by questioning the definition of living organisms, their use as a micro-plant to produce product for our own interest, and the potential misused of the technology.
Moreover, with the rise of big data, ownership and collection of biological data are likely to be hot topics in a close future as laws and regulations are not up to date with the potential issues to come.
Thus, it is fundamental that people get informed to make an informed decision on what they want, and the only way to prepare them, to treat the source of the problem, is to provide them education through popularization and open science!
Our purpose: Raising awareness by providing tools for a better understanding of synthetic biology
As we demonstrated it, in our digital area, education, through MOOC and open access are more easily available than ever.       Nevertheless, people still have to"

Practicing Stamping on plasma activated slides
2015.04.14: Plasmaactived slides 215 & 314 were stamped with grid-stamp. Each slide was stamped twice. One stamp with 500 ug/ml BSA, the other with 50 ng/ml (1:10000) to see if iRIF detection is still possible after strong dilusion. 1:10000 was barely visible in iRIF, but still better than under fluorescent array scanner.

Slides were left in the fridge for approx. 1h. We encountered several problems putting the glass slides on the flow chambers as they constantly started to collapse. Flowchambers and slides were changed, but the problem persisted. After approx 1h we were lucky and able to measure the slides.
Results:  BW-A-01-002-315 ⇒ The silhouettes of the spotted bBSA were visible in the iRIF measurement, however no binding of Strep-Cy5 could be detected. Fluorescence measurement after the iRIF measurement showed however that Strep-Cy5 had indeed bound to the spotted areas. Spotting was therefore successfull, the iRIF measurement failed however for unknown reasons.
BW-A-01-001-314 ⇒ iRIF measurement was successful as the spots were visible both in iRIF and fluorescent imaging. In both slides the spots were smeared.

BBa_K182001 - Intermediate Part consisting of LacI ( RBS+, Term +) and a Tet operator.
This is an intermediate part using the biobrick BBa_I732820 (RBS, LacI, Term) upstream and the Biobrick BBa_R0040 (TetR repressible promoter) downstream.
It comes with a ribosome binding site upstream of LacI and a Terminator downstream (BBa_B0015) There is no Promoter upstream of LacI, meaning that LacI will not be expressed in this piece.
The TetR repressible promoter BBa_R0040 is downstream of the Terminator.

The Fitting Results
As to know each term how to influence GFP, we divide GFP(t) into 4 parts:
A(t)=(2.9x10-8)e-2.5x10-6t
B(t)=(3.08x10-8)e-4.485x10-4t
C(t)=(6.06x10-10)e-2x10-2t
D(t)=(1.48x10-9)e-1.74x10-2t
Obviously, we easily know the influence within 2 hours of terms A and B are more essential than that of terms C and D. Consequently, we modify equation to be simpler, which neglact C and D terms, to fit our data getting from experiments with our device           and with powder.

Concordia,2013,Team:Concordia#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.

Figure 1. Model: Serpina3n Inhibition of GzmB. Using data from the Ang et al. paper, we developed an equation that models relative GzmB Activity as a function of Serpina3n concentration
Human GzmB Inhibitor ACT3m
Given our model of Serpina3n, we also wanted to create a model for the protein used in our device, ACT3m. The dataset obtained from the ACT3m paper (Marcet-Palacios et al., 2014) is the result of a colorimetric assay. Data was presented as absorbance values (A405), which correspond to the concentration of free GzmB, at different inhibitor concentrations. The paper used this to prove that their novel ACT3m inhibitor was the strongest out of their entire pool of possible candidates: treatment with ACT3m resulted in the lowest A405 values, which suggests the strongest inhibition of GzmB.
To model this set of data, similar adjustments had to be made. First, the dataset was scaled so the numbers ranged between 0 and 1 (in this case, increased by a factor of 2). The same modified Hill equation was used from the Serpina3n analysis. Our model returned a Kd of ≈ 13.336 and n ≈ 0.605, so the equation looks like

Light Filters
Finding the right and optimal filters is a tough challenge. The main goal throughout our project has been to choose easily available parts which are also inexpensive. Thus choosing Schott glasses as filters could not be considered. Alternatively, filters used for illumination of theaters were found to be an ideal solution.
We tested serveral filters and the optimal configuration of filters used is listed below.

The fluorescence protein GFPmut3b has a peak excitation at 501 nm and a peak emission at 511 nm - too close together for our low-cost filters to block the excitation light but transmit the emitted light. Thus, we chose to excite at around 485 nm reduce false positive results below 500 nm. However, no adequate filter for these settings could be found. Eventually, using the dark greenish Twickenham Green filter only little amounts of light shorter than 500 nm gets through, reducing any bias from excitation illumination significantly. Unfortunately, the transmission rate of this filter is quite bad, 20% only, for the target emission wavelength of 511 nm.
Linearity of the Hardware Light Sensor
It is crucial that the selected hardware is mapping reality into the digital world of our $\mu$-Controller. In order to sense reality our setup uses a light to frequency sensor, TSL235R-LF . The light to frequency sensor resembles the most to a photo transistor and thus is less sensible to temperature than a light dependant resistor. Additionally counting a frequency using interrupts seems to be easier and more accurate than using the analog to digital converter.
Using a dilution series of purified iLOV we could determine the characteristic curve for the light sensor. Finally we can conclude that the sensor is linear as expected and shown in the datasheet .
Linearity of TSL235R-LF sensor
Dilution series of GFP expressing E. coli showing linearity  between fluorescence count and dilution. The linearity of the chosen sensor can be determined.
We are measuring optical density using our in-house developed cuvette holder. Particularly for optical density measurement, the amount of light shining through the sample is crucial. If there is too few light, there will be not enough light registered at the sensor, and the resolution of the measurement shrinks. This should be prevented. The chosen light to"

Collaboration with Turkish teams in iGEM 2011
Since iGEM 2007, there is a team to research and prepare a project for iGEM competition from Middle East Technical University(METU). On behalf, there are advisors and instructors who are familiar with competition and content of it. In this year there are 4 registered teams from Turkey and 3 of them are new participants. Therefore in order to come together and criticize our projects and any deficiencies or ambugity related with project. So we organized and arranged a meeting on Synthetic Biology and iGEM competition which is the first in our country.The participants of this meeting were teams;Fatih Turkey, Bilkent_UNAM, METU-BIN and researchers who related with Synthetic Biology and company owners in Biotechnology field also there was special guests via online talk, Drew Endy, he is an assistant Professor of Bioengineering, Stanford University and Scott Mohr Professor of Biological Chemistry, Boston University This meeting was held in September 10, that was close to Regional Jamboree in order to also check the presentation preparations of teams. The news agencies were also invited and the interviews were done with all teams publicity of teams were enhanced.
Except from this, we established a collaboration with METU-BIN Software iGEM 2011 team  on their software program."

Introduction
In our modeling efforts, we basically focused on three thing:
Gene Network
C.Crescentus's Characteristics
Physical Performance of Color Mangling
All we are trying is to give a insight into the system we are studying, to solve problems like:
How will different colors effect with each other?
Is our gene circuit design plausible?
Can we successfully integrate the E.coli and C.Crescentus?
So, we mainly model on four levels:
1. Colony level
2. Cellular level
3. Gene level
4. Physical level

SF_Bay_Area_DIYbio,2014,Team:SF Bay Area DIYbio#ELSEI_-_-_TEXT.html," public domain. This way, no one will be able to privatize our work and it will remain truly open to anyone who wants to use it. In addition, we are furthering openness in synthetic biology by contributing to iGEM's public Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Transparency
Emphasize transparency, the sharing of ideas, knowledge and data. We believe that transparency breeds trust. So many organizations work behind closed doors or patent walls. Like the many processes before us, our open process enhances innovation, brings the conversation to a wide audience, and asks for participation - not exclusion. We implement transparency by publishing meeting minutes and lab notes on our wiki, and publicizing our meeting times and location on Meetup.com and on our website. Those who want to participate but are not local can join us virtually.
Education
Engage the public about biology, biotechnology and their possibilities. Our education philosophy moves beyond a “deficit” model that sees the public as lacking in scientific knowledge, to one that seeks to harness the diverse skill sets of community members and engage them in substantial discussion about how to steer the development of biotechnologies. We recognize that everyone – those with scientific training included – comes to the table with expertise in some areas and not others, and we seek to learn from each other. By working on meaningful, member-guided projects, the question we are asking the public changes from “should scientists or corporations be allowed to…?” to “how should we use these tools?” This education philosophy is supported by recent scholarship in Science and Technology Studies (STS). STS scholarship has moved beyond often misleading and over-simplifying “for or against” opinion polling to show that both European and US publics are not anti-GMO, but rather ambivalent about technologies that seek to modify organisms. In general, people who express apprehension about these technologies are not dead set against a particular technique (such as genetic modification). Instead, they frequently have concerns about the context in which such techniques are “developed, evaluated, and promoted” - concerns which can stem from a lack of faith that institutional actors and processes are acting in the best interests of the public (Marris 2001). Finally, members of the public also express concern regarding the complexity of biology and the unknown consequences of intervening in systems which are not fully characterized (Pauwels 2013). These concerns will not necessarily evaporate by feeding the public more technical information, although many of our members join because they want to learn more about biology. Instead, we believe that the best and most respectful response to public ambivalence is to develop and use bi"

We therefore measured intensities of fluorescence of GFP protein produced in E. coli carrying the pSB6A1 and compared with that carrying the pSB1A2. The data clearly showed that expression level of GFP is much higher in E. coli carrying pSB6A1 than that carrying pSB1A2. Thus we decided to use pSB6 vector to measure activities of various promoters responsible to H2O2.

UQ-Australia,2009,Team:UQ-Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," ice nucleation protein on its outer membrane (InaZ). InaZ acts as a scaffold for the formation of the ice crystals, this directly assists in the formation of clouds and speeds up the rain cycle. However, the bacteria are unable to survive in environmental temperatures above 28°C.  The ideal growing temperatures for syringae are 22°C - 26°C. By introducing heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, and GroES) through plasmid insertion, UQ Australia aims to increase the optimal growth temperature available to P.syringae, thereby allowing bio-precipitation to occur in warmer (and drought stricken) climates. Although syringae already has this proteins encoded within the genome, they are not expressed at levels similar to bacteria which grow at higher temperatures (Susin, et al, 2006).
The heat shock proteins form two systems. GroEL and GroES form one dimer which acts as a chaperon. Together these proteins assists in lowering the mis-folding of proteins. At higher temperatures proteins become unstable and mis-fold at a higher rate.
Ideally, UQ Australia will be contributing a number of parts to the registry.  Firstly, a plasmid with DnaK, DnaJ, as well as an upstream promoter will drive the expression of these two genes.  Secondly, an additional plasmid will carry the genes for GroEL and GroES, also complemented by an upstream promoter to drive gene expression.
Method
After receiving the parts from Kristos we went through the process of transforming them into the bacteria. In order to insert two of the genes into the iGEM standards we have to perform mutagenesis. This process is detailed in the notebook. The basic concept is changing one base pair that doesn't affect the translated protein but removes a restriction site that would normally cut with the same enzyme that the standard restriction sites would. Once this was removed we performed PCR on each of the genes. After PCR each part was digested and ligated into the standard plasmid for iGEM standards 21 and 23. Unfortunately standard 21 was unavailable. There were issues
By taking measurements during the life cycle of P. syringae it should show a shift in the maximal growth peak. Over a 14 hour growth period absorbance readings were taken of the transformed bacteria. Singh et al performed this same experiment with syringae which grew optimally at lower temperatures. Image A shows the optical density of the bacteria population over their growth period.

This page is used by the judges to evaluate your team for the medal criterion or award listed below .
Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
The model should impact your project design in a meaningful way. Modeling may include, but is not limited to, deterministic, exploratory, molecular dynamic, and stochastic models. Teams may also explore the physical modeling of a single component within a system or utilize mathematical modeling for predicting function of a more complex device.
Please see the 2018  Medals Page for more information.

Questions by Cambridge iGEM 2011 Team, Interview by Joe Harvey, Write-up by Matt Jones.
An interview with Kim de Mora
Interview by Matt Jones, Video by Matt Jones.
An interview with Shuna Gould
Shuna gould heard about iGEM in her second year of studying Natural sciences at Cambridge and was attracted partly because of the exciting work that previous Cambridge teams had done. Having done a couple of summer research projects before she was particularly interested in iGEM because of the independent nature of the research.
Shuna is therefore in an excellent position to compare iGEM to other summer research projects. She points out that it is much more challenging, intense and a powerful learning curve. Several of our team, and postgraduates we’ve spoken to agree and we’re sure that throughout iGEM there will be countless other people who recognise that this is no ordinary summer research project.
We heard how iGEM has influenced Shuna’s career not only in terms of providing opportunities within science, but also how she feels ready to make a leap into completely different lines of work after her PHD, thanks to skills at least partly developed during iGEM.
Soon after iGEM Shuna was fortunate to be able to continue her teams work with two of the principal investigators involved in supervising her team, Jim Haseloff and Jim Ajioka from Cambridge University. iGEM has also impacted on her path since then, and she is now embarking on a PHD in which she plans to use techniques she was first taught during iGEM.
One key influence for Shuna was that iGEM opened her mind to PHD topics that she had not previously considered and that her chosen PHD supervisor was excited when he heard that she had had training in synthetic biology techniques. Furthermore, together they have discussed in depth how Gibson assembly can be used to aid her in reliably cutting and pasting genomes during her project which will be dealing with much larger lengths of DNA than she used during her bacterial plasmid work in iGEM. This is at least one example of a situation where techniques taught in iGEM are infiltrating into more in-depth research like a PHD thesis as iGEM students progress in academia.
It is fascinating to hear how iGEM has affected peoples professional lives, but we wanted to know how synthetic biology has affected the mindsets of iGEM alumni. Shuna said she was initially sceptical about the use of abstraction in biology, as her biochemistry training taught her that all biological systems are wonderfully complex. However, through i"

CHU Tsz Long Nelson
I am entering my second year of biochemistry at HKU and i have a special interest in bio-gerontology. I join the igem2009 because i want to understand more about synthetic biology and to get some practical research experience. In my spare time i enjoy table tennis, archery and chess games. I hope to pursue my PhD program in the US after i graduate.
In this competition, I am responsible for biobrick construction and speed control. I learnt a lot of useful skills and hand-on experience of practical research. Though there were many failures, i managed to provide some possible explanations for the failures and discuss it with other teamates. I found myself addicted to scientific research after this competition. I hope I can be a successful scientist and contribute a lot to mankind in the future.

Team Video
As Team Fatih Medical, consisting of 16 undergraduate students, 2 advisors and 5 instructors, we became a big family during this summer. We prepared a video to introduce our crowded family. We planned to have fun and entertain others by sharing our tragicomic situations. Video capturing and preparation stages were a chance for us to clear our heads from intensive and hard lab works. We had a lot of fun while during the whole turnings and we hope you will also enjoy watching it. . .
Challenge accepted! Here’s the video!
Survey
To form an idea about the awareness, the general view on synthetic biology and the confidence in its products and as a chance for the introduction of iGEM, we prepared a survey that includes 10 questions. To share this survey with as much as possible number of people we translated it into English, Turkish and German. For those who don’t possess enough information about SynBio we wrote a short and concrete report about development of SynBio, its study fields and iGEM. We applied this survey through the Internet and directly distributed it in different periods of time. We also applied it to 1st, 2nd and 3rd year medical students. As a result of our collaboration with Team Frankfurt and Team Freiburg 2012 iGEM we got the chance to disseminate our survey in their universities with their help. Using different social networks, we tried to reach people out of genetics and health interests. We estimated survey results with SPSS and Microsoft Exel programs. Survey results can be found here.

WHU-China,2012,Team:WHU-China#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," Safety issues are considered seriously before they approved our design.                We have consulted a few experts for safety questions about both artificial intestinal bacteria and experiments. Their advices help us improve the safety of the whole planning system. For that, we thank Dr. Yulan Wang and Dr. Tiangang Liu so much.               Our lab is supervised by Teaching Centre of Experimental Biology, Wuhan University (TCEB, whose leader is our instructor Dr. Zhixiong Xie ). An expert group of this centre formulates safety guidelines and guarantees their performance in all teaching labs. All experiments we do past its review. Our safety management system includes the followings: Management of Chemicals, Equipments and Experimenters: Chemicals and equipments are registered in TCEB before they are available for us. Equipments are checked and maintained regular. And an entrance guard system is used to ensure only the admitted could enter the lab.
Responsibility distribution: All members worked in the lab are divided to three groups. The group leaders arrange schedules of experiments after assessing safety issues in the group (for example, the safety train of the experimental executer). Every member records his/her  experiments in detail in the notebook of the group. Each group takes responses for cleaning and checking risks in the lab in turns. The group leader takes responses to the team leader. The team leader reports regular on safety to engineer Miss Long Yan, who is authorized by TCEB and manages the lab.
Management of Chemicals, Equipments and Experimenters: Chemicals and equipments are registered in TCEB before they are available for us. Equipments are checked and maintained regular. And an entrance guard system is used to ensure only the admitted could enter the lab.
Training: Our team members have been trained after Guidance of Student Experiments formulated by TCEB.

Biosafety and Publicity
We believe that biosafety is not an issue which should be only considered inside biological lab, but also around people and communities. Spreading knowledge of biosafety to the public will help eliminate misunderstanding and prejudice, from which the science and all the people will benefit. We hope that sharing this idea with all iGEM teams can be useful to take advantage on biosafety.
To investigate public attitude towards our project and to publicize our biosafety ideas are what we do for our human practice. As “eating bacteria” is somehow an unacceptable concept now, we would like to find whether people know the truth about biosafety issues raised by bioengineered bacteria, or they are just panicked by their imaginary “bacteria”. And then, after initiating"

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," 1 organisms. During our summer, we were diligent in:
Wearing Personal Protective Equipment: All work in the lab was conducted while wearing long pants, closed toed shoes, a lab coat, safety goggles, and gloves. These were appropriate to the protocols conducted.
Chemical and Biosafety: Proper storage and disposal techniques for chemical reagents, biological agents, and non-hazardous waste were followed. Disinfecting surfaces, as well as our hands, was important for our team.
General Lab Safety: Eyewash stations were checked weekly (in accordance with federal regulations), while showers were by inspected by Environment, Health, and Safety personnel. We also ensured that lab aisles and exits were cleared, and decontaminated in the case of the bench,  after the day’s work was completed.
Outreach and Engagement Safety
Through laboratory safety is very prevalent in iGEM,  one major safety issue that Team UAlberta encountered was actually our two agar art outreach workshops , Paint. Grow. Glow! and Dark Matters at the Telus World of Science Edmonton. When we first saw examples of agar art and read about similar events done by [insert Calgary, Edmonton], we were ecstatic to host bacterial painting workshops to the general public as microbes are a unique painting medium, particularly since the results cannot be seen until the bacteria have grown overnight. However, as the logistics of the event were discussed further, one question kept coming up: Will this be safe?
A tempting mindset we could have fallen back on was that since past iGEM teams have held similar events, we should be fine to also host these events. Technically, the E. coli strain that we would use actually has evolved to be non-hazardous, as in it isn’t any more harmful than the microbes that can be found outside the lab. However, our team’s developed safety-oriented mindset told us that we could not simply default to this rationale.
To ensure that our event falls within the safety guidelines prescribed by both our institution and by legislation, we contacted the University of Alberta’s Environment, Health and Safety Unit for their advice. They clarified that the lab strain of bacteria we were to use is not biohazardous, but advised us to still follow all safety precautions that come with a Risk Level 1 Organism. This includes all required personal protective equipment, biohazardous waste bins, disinfection, and fully informing the participants of what the risks are.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html,"alto University, VTT and University of Helsinki to get feedback and comments on the feasibility. After all, none of us had never done anything even close to this before. As a result of this feedback, further idea development and admission to Summer of Startups, we decided to work on the idea with a project name ""nest box"". It's a container resembling a traditional Finnish bird nest box (a man-made home for birds) but it contains bacteria producing different fragrances. These bacteria could be controlled using light concealed inside the box. The user can decide which fragrance to produce by a press of a button and this action would be translated into a light signal to control the gene expression in the bacteria. Such a system is concrete and understandable for the public audience and it would help to build a positive image of synthetic biology in Finland. In theory, such system could be used in conference rooms, hotels, living rooms, saunas, movie theaters... The scent marketing is an expanding business and our idea had the potential to add something new to it. Furthermore, it was a concrete product which made our participation in Summer of Startups a lot easier.
We started our BioBrick practice project mid May and the Summer of Startups programme began in early June. As we got forward with the idea, we realized that the nest box concept would be very difficult to execute in practice. Implementation of such a separate unmaintained container would be very challenging and in addition, we cannot bring genetically modified bacteria outside laboratory conditions (it's defined in the gene technology legislation). We decided to solely focus on one element of our nest box idea. Constructing the interface between the bacteria and the user or a computer is not trivial. So, we redefined our direction which was maintained to the end. We wanted to develop a three channel switch that would allow us to activate one of the three genes at a time using only the intensity of single wavelength of light. We could then connect this switch with fragrance producing genes, for example.
Later we realized that it would fit better in a bioreactor in order to get precise control of gene transcription.

Earlier Research
Why to Use Light
Previously gene regulation was controlled by chemical effectors, such as tetracycline and IPTG. In many bacterial cultures, a constant and uniform level of concentration is hard to maintain as the chemicals get absorbed, degraded and modified by the cells and environment. Moreover, the export of these chemicals is hard and time consuming or even impossible and the response time is limited by the"

Benelux Meetup
Benelux Meetup
On June 24th 2017, we organized the ‘Benelux Meetup’ (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg). On this day, iGEM teams from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, together with their supervisors were invited to Wageningen! The goal of this meetup was to get to know the other teams better, polish everyone's presentation skills, generate inspiration by talking to experts on the various aspects of synthetic biology and exchange thoughts on how to develop the projects further. During the last part of the day, a human practices workshop was included in the program called ‘Change of Perspective’. Here, iGEM teams got to step out of their ‘developer’ point of view and moved towards an ‘end-user’ point of view. They gained valuable new insights by participating in the workshop. We developed this workshop together with our Human Practices advisor dr. Bob Mulder.
The Meetup started off with a walk-in lunch, where the teams could relax and get to know each other, while enjoying a nice sandwich and some fresh coffee. After everybody arrived and took some more coffee, the official program could begin, starting with presentations.
The program commenced with short presentations by each team about their project, followed by a round of discussion. Thanks to the different backgrounds of all teams, many questions were asked, providing everyone with useful feedback. Even though the projects were still at the early stage of development, it was very interesting and inspiring to hear all their ideas and goals. After this, it was"

This is the second year for me to participate in the iGEM. In retrospect of last year, I have learned rudimentary molecular experiment skills from our precedents. During this year, I get myself familiar with other advanced skills such as Gibson Assembly, OE OCR and qPCR. I believe that the headquarter of iGEM gives us a scope to image our own biology machine freedomly although for a short while.  At last, I would like to appreciate Miss. LUO as a crucial precedent to guide me into this interesting molecular biology realm.

Operational sequence:
First of all, the dried extract was solved in 200 µl of 70% methanol, mixed and than transferred into small glass tubes (LCMS tubes) and applied to the LCMS machine.
Results:
There were indeed two signals for theobromine and caffeine, howerver, these signals appeared in all samples, suggesting that it is not specific and belongs to the ""background"". A reason could be that the applied substrate xanthosine was not totally clean and contained small amounts of caffeine. If the enzymes had worked probably, we would have expected more significant signals. A reason could be that we had stored the enzymes for mor than two weeks at -80°C after the cell lyses and before using them for the enzyme assay. Maybe the experiment should be repeated with fresh isolated enzymes.
Analysis of yeasts' genome integration
Investigators: Martin
Aim: Study of genome integration Procedure: The clones of the experiment before were incubated in an over night culture, diluted to OD600 = 0.4 and put on a plate with G418 again to study the perseverance of antibiotics tolerance
Results: Of an overall number of 36 clones the experiment started with, 5 were already lost after the over night incubation (probably because of pipetting mistakes during the inoculation procedure on the 96-well plate). Of the 31 remaining plates, 21 were empty. The cfu of the positive plates were:

The plan is to PCR at least two of the clones to gain knowledge why there's been such drastic differences in the integration efficiency and endurance.

Colonies of nptII, nptII digested with DpnI, hph, and crtY were miniprepped. nptII+ DpnI sample 4 was accidentally pipetted into the sample 3 column, so contamination is possible. Concentrations were good. A digest screen was performed on nptII using PstI, and crtY was digested with EcoRI and PstI. The nptII digested with DpnI appeared successful, while the undigested samples failed. Gels of hph, and crtY were also run, showing that the crtY ligations failed, as well as the hph Gibson.
The crtY ligation was run on a gel and shown to be unsuccessful. The hph PCR also came up blank, so the Gibson was also unsuccessful. On the bright side, a digestion screen on nptII shows that site-directed mutagenesis on that site most likely worked!

The Fmoc-FF solution has a pH of 10.5 but after exposure to CO2the pH value is decreasing. The carboxy group of the Fmoc-FF is protonated, neutralizing the negative charge and triggering the self-assembly of the dipeptide molecules. Since the CO2 only comes into contact with the surface of the droplet the fibrillar network only forms at this contact interface, while the inside of the droplet retains its liquid state (Figure 3).
Figure 2: Chemical reaction in Peptidosome upon CO2 exposure The reaction of carbon dioxide and water leads to the formation of carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. All reactions are reversible

In EncaBcillus, we characterized functional Peptidosomes encapsulating Bacillus subtilis. This fundamentally new approach of applying Fmoc-FF in combination with bacteria will create endless new possibilities for bacterial immobilization.
To encapsulate the bacteria we first needed to establish a lab protocol. We created Fmoc-FF solutions in water, adjusted the pH to 10.5 and resuspended B. subtilis cells either directly taken from overnight cultures or day cultures.
To monitor bacterial growth in Peptidosomes, day cultures were grown until an OD600 of 0.02. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 16000g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in Fmoc-FF solution. Droplets of 15 μl of this solution were placed on an ultrahydrophobic membrane and exposed to CO2.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics methods_-_-_TEXT.html," issue: whether the reductionist approach in biology has any effect on our current perception of life and if so, how. The questions meddle with general traditional and established viewpoints. The general content of these multiple-choice questions comes back in the last open question, where the survey-participants could choose to write their opinion on what is life and whether the reductionist approach would lead to fully understanding life.

1. Reductionism (also known as the top-down approach) aims to understand the nature of complex things by reducing them to the interaction of their parts. The reductionist approach has been applied to biology in order to understand the complexity of living things by studying its components (such as DNA, proteins, etc). Do you think that the reductionist approach will lead to understand life?
No, living systems are too complex to fully understand, they have properties that cannot be explained by studying their individual parts
No, biological phenomena are fundamentally special in a way that prevents them from being completely understood
Yes, fundamental research in biology will eventually result in the ability to fully understand life
Yes, we already understand living systems completely, due to the reductionist approach
Other:...
2. Various people think that reductionism challenges the tradition which holds that life is valuable because it is more than ""merely physical"". The special status of living things and the value we ascribe to life may be changed by reductionism. If we assume that a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of life necessarily decreases the value life, should we then pull back from the pursuit of understanding life?
Yes, because we can not foresee the implications that this knowledge might have
No, understanding life is more important than the possibility that reductionism devaluates life
No, because I do not believe that biology can change the meaning/value of life, the dimensions of the human experience cannot be explained exclusively by physics
Other:
3. In biology, evolution is the change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. Should mankind modify organisms (direct its evolution) by the use of genetic engineering?
Yes, because it has known benefits
Yes, because we have the moral obligation to apply genetic engineering if it is possibly beneficial
No, because we cannot foresee the consequences and implications of our actions when we interfere with evolution
No, because evolution is a natural process that research should not interfere with

In the condition that there are nutrients in the nutritional neighborhood, D and R that are at the same site on the layers of different thicknesses begin conjugative transformation, while the division process always exists. The repression has always been difficult in the modeling of conjugation. Most of the F plasmid is with repression. In our SDTC model, we deal the repression as the balance between the conjugation and division, or between the horizontal and vertical plasmid transfer . By introducing a penalty factor p and using our cycle time trace system, we are able to describe this balance. Once a bacterium experience one type of plasmid transfer(horizontal or vertical), another type’s cycle state of the site (which recorded by cycle time trace system) clear, as another type of plasmid transfer need to restart the preparation of energy and the bacterium itself. Besides, the cycle length of the second one change to p times of standard length ,which means the other kind of transfer need more preparation time. We introduce a random factor τ to describe the plasmid loss. When D or T begins to split and multiply, their filial generation has the probability of τ lose the plasmid and become an R. The filial generation that bacteria reproduce disperses randomly in the center of the 3 × 3 square area including them. But the offspring may ‘die in the womb’ when the number of bacteria around its site reaches the upper threshold due to the limited space in the medium. Because of the use of agar medium, if the nutrient at a certain point is consumed, it is completely consumed and will not regenerate, nor be replenished by the surroundings. Each reproduction consumes the nutrients in the nutrients neighborhood. If the nutrients in the neighborhood exhaust, the bacteria cannot reproduce. More precisely, they will firstly choose which distance-level of neighborhood nutrients to take in according to the proportion of the bacterial number and distance in the certain level(closer level has better chance), then, in the chosen level, which nutrient to choose will be determined by the random selection in direction. This algorithm has some advantages as follows: 1. The closer nutrients are more likely to be consumed. 2. Isotropic of nutrient consumption can be maintained. 3. The algorithm is simple. 2.3 Cycle time trace system Set 40min as the standard time which receptor cell breed a generation take, which is to say Ψ2 (R) =1.0.

The little score for the question 6 highlights a weakness concerning the main reason                         of the destruction of the biggest forest in the world; the Amazonian forest. It is surprising as                         we know since years now that the Amazon Rainforest is being hurt and reduced in superficies every                         year.
The age repartition of the participants is also significative with 80% of 18-25 years old range.                                 This is not surprising as we, in the team, are all from this age and diffused the survey                                 to our friends and colleagues.
What is interesting for us is the result obtained for the final question. Only 30.4% of the answers are                         correct. Most of the participants do not know how are recycled sub-products from the wood industry.                         The correct answer is that sub-products from the wood industry are burnt to produce thermal energy.                         However, the answers indicate that most of them think these sub-products are not recycled at all.
Regarding our project it is interesting to see that people are not aware of how forests are managed.                         Hence, a large work of awareness, information and documentation needs to be done so people know the potential of forest to maximize the benefits they already give us.
Thanks to the personal information field, it is interesting to see from where all the participants come                         from. Most of them are from France. However, we collected answers from other European countries such                         as Germany, England Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. We also reached farer countries such                         as Canada, USA, Algeria, but even India and Japan.
Interviews
In the context of our project, we wondered about the impact of the competition and the opinion people                         working at the university may have. We therefore asked three people about their opinion: a researcher,                         a teacher doing educational research and our IP. They gave us their point of view on iGEM, on what                         it brings to a scientist, a teacher and also to students.

S.O.R.D.
We designed S.O.R.D. as an RNA secretion device. It is comprised of osmY (protein naturally secreted by E. coli) and Hfq (RNA binding protein) fused together. This device is what will transport our spiRNA out of our E. coli and to the target bacteria.
In the labs we wanted to test if S.O.R.D. could be secreted, so we used a western blot to do so.
Western blotting indicated that our S.O.R.D. was being secreted entirely . This meant for future plans that S.O.R.D. should theoretically secrete and be capable of carrying RNA on its journey out of the cell.
spiRNA
Our RNA silencing agent spiRNA is what will attach to a specific gene on an mRNA strand in the target cell. We decided to test spiRNA by targeting the fliC gene which forms the FliC protein. This is the repeating subunit of the flagellum. By targeting this gene the bacterium’s motility should be greatly decreased and therefore easy to see if our device works. We did this by expressing a spiRNA containing a fliC targeting sequence inside a target bacterium.
Result:
Our results showed that the bacteria became less motile as there wasn’t as much expansion on the plate as the control experiment. This is strong indication that spiRNA effectively targeted fliC mRNA and reduced its translation, proving the principle of it being able to target specific genes with downstream functional effects. This means that by changing the targeting sequence, in theory we could target any gene at will."

In the case of activation, the dCas9-gRNA complex targets a sequence on DNA such that the RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruiting unit (\(\omega\) in E. Coli and VP64 in yeast) is close to the RNAP binding site: the recruiting unit enhance RNAP binding and therefore gene transcription. In the case of inhibition, the dCas9-gRNA target sequence on DNA is so close to the RNAP binding site that the RNAP is not able to bind anymore; this steric inhibition prevents gene transcription.
If we interpret the Hill function as a binding probability [1], in the case of inhibition we have that a basal expression is possible when nothing is bound to the promotor. Thus the equation of \(\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}\) production is now the following:             \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = \alpha_{GFP,b}\left( 1 - \frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}\right) - (\gamma_{mRNA}+\gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}].             \]             This means that at low concentrations of \(\text{dCas9-gRNA}\) we have a basal expression, while at high concentrations the production of \(\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}\) is extremely low.
Equations for inhibition
\[                           \frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] = \alpha_\text{dCas9} - (\gamma_\text{mRNA}+\gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}]                         \]
\[                             \frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9}] = \beta_\text{dCas9}[\text{mRNA}_\text{dCas9}] - \gamma [\text{dCas9}] + D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - R_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}]                             \]

Filter membrane
To test the effect of the filter membrane, 2mL bacterial suspension flew pass the pump, and the absorbance at OD600 was tested by a spectrophotometer. LB medium was test as control group. And for each type of membrane we repeated for 3 times.(MEASURE-2/3)

In the experiment we found that parafilm is not strong enough to seal the joint. In the third test for 0.22μm membrane, some liquid leak from the gap and flow into the collection tube, making the outcome rather strange.
Considering that we will applied immobilized bacteria for application, which means there will be quite rare bacteria in the water after detection process, we believe it is reasonable to applied a 0.45μm filter membrane once we solve the leakage problem.
Pumps
For pumping water into and out the detecting cell, we chose two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04. We measured that, when powered by Arduino Nano (5V output), the voltage across the pump is 5.40V, while the current intensity is 0.22A. (pic1.pump v/pic2.pump a)
Also we measured the pumping speed under the same condition. Pumping 50mL water cost 3’54’’ on average, and it means the pump should work approximately 7 seconds each time to pump 1.5-2mL water, filling the detecting cell.
Another flow velocity experiment was conducted using 0.45μm and 0.22μm filter membrane. Different membranes were installed at the end of pump pipe and the joint was sealed with parafilm. It took 3’41’’ for 50mL water to flow past the 0.45μm membrane and 3’35’’ for 0.22μm membrane. (MEASURE-1)

2. Imperial has its own Biosafety board, details of which can be found here .
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
3. Our project fulfils all the safety criteria imposed by the Biosafety group. At this time we were not able to get comment on the safety implications of our project in particular by the group.
4.Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
4.Out of the genes we have submitted to the BioBrick registry, there are very few that could potentially raise safety issues.
Module 1 simply involves engineering the cell to produce a new enzyme, which poses no great risk.
Module 2 genes are those envolved in encapsulation. Although biofilms can be involved in virulence, the genes we are targetting are naturally expressed in many GRAS strains of E.coli. By upregulating these genes we pose no new safety risk. In fact, the upregulation of our encapsulation genes, results in the overexpression of colanic acid which has been shown to inhibit biofilm formation and decrease virulence.
Module 3 involves the killing strategy of the cell by restriction enzymes. Production of  these restriction enzymes is an evolutionary tactic used by bacteria as a self defense mechanism against invading phages. These bacteria are naturally found in the gut micro-flora, so there seems no reason why these would cause any safety risk.
During our safety and ethics group discussion, we concluded that the BioBricks used within our project posed no greater risk than those associated with any genetic engineering or synthetic biology project. For this reason we did not detail any special safety considerations on our registry parts.

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," devices and systems and the     functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented     for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of     iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks. Each graph comprises     a set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges. In the set of nodes each     node represents a device, while in the set of edges each edge represents     the input-output combination of the nodes. These graphs are directed     graphs as the edges are created according to input-output combination.     All compatibilities between a regulator and a promoter of an edge is     created, where the source of this edge is the device with the corresponding     regulator and target of the edge is the device with the promoter in     concern.
Fig. 1: A node representing a device
Fig. 2: Arrow representing an edge between two nodes
The atomic structures used in our graphical model have been represented     in Figures 1 and 2. A node is represented with a solid circle where     the label, the part/device ID according to iGEM standards, of the device     is marked on the foreground. The blue arrows between nodes connect the     related devices, representing the input-output connectivity. End style     of the arrow helps us to determine the direction of the node, like in     Figure 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.
Directivity
All the four constructed graphs build for BioGuide are directed graphs.     So that, for every edge there must be a single source and a target.     There is no single edge which is bidirectional. In mathematical form     this can be represented as:
If an edge e has node v as source and node w as target then the edge     can be expressed as
For a directed graph the combination (v, w) is totally different     from (w, v). Therefore,
The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,     as explained in Figure 2.
Connectivity
The nodes forming their own sub-graphs disconnected from the rest     of the nodes have been recognized, which showed us the presence of incompatibility     between few regulators and promoters of the devices. We have observed     this disconnection in all four of our graphs. The basis of the disconnection     has been shown in Figure 3, where the two sub-graphs without any edge     that connects them to the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].

Collaborations
We collaborated with Judd, Carroll High School, University of Westminster and EPFL. We helped them with a mixture of modeling, and wiki development and they have helped us massively in return - giving us advice, testing our hardware and software, reviewing our guide for high school teams and letting us use their facilities.
Judd School
Judd-UK is the only other UK high school team. Luckily, they’re only a short train journey away.
Their collaborations page mentions us too!
What we did for them
We met near the start of the iGEM cycle and discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips - these are available for all high schools in our high school guide . We helped them derive their differential equations and explained some reaction kinetics.
We later advised them on modeling. We suggested ways of modeling their inducible promoter and advised them on solving differential equations, both analytically and numerically. We also helped them find constants for transcription and translation as they are also using a cell free extract. We checked the matlab code for their final model. Their results validated their model. Take a look at their modeling page for details
At the UK iGEM meetup we gave them ideas about what to do for human practices.
What they did for us
They tested our synthetic biology bot giving us useful feedback including suggesting the team lookup feature, the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), which we implemented. They also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step which we tried to implement but found it"

Project Synergy
We have all been working together in every aspect of our project. Nevertheless, some people have had to focus on some areas more than others. The main groups are listed as follows;
The group focusing on fixation of CO2, production of cellulose and light-dependent dormancy system consisted of Sarah Hyllekvist Jørgensen, Ellen Gammelmark, Sofie Mozart Mortensen and Emil Bøgh Hansen.
The group focusing on the breakdown of cellulose to create an electrical current and the optimisation of nanowires consisted of Felix Boel Pedersen, Frederik Bartholdy Flensmark Neergaard, Jonas Borregaard Eriksen and Malte Skovsager Andersen.
The group focusing on the implementation of the device in an urban environment as well as our outreach consisted of Emil Søndergaard, Frederik Damsgaard Højsager and Lene Vest Munk Thomsen.
The mathematical modelling of our project was single-handedly performed by Emil Vyff Jørgensen.
Coding and design of the wiki was performed by Felix Boel Pedersen and Frederik Damsgaard Højsager.
To ensure a good team spirit and dynamic we formulated a cooperation agreement .
Nothing can be done alone, so please scroll further down, to read about all the people who contributed to making our project successful. We are so grateful for all the help and support we have been offered throughout our iGEM experience.

2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Aside from general safety issues, none of the new BioBrick parts raises any particular safety issues; they are all well-known biological parts implemented in the best known (and safe) lab bacterium and budding yeast. That is because the different components of the constructions (promoters, protein products…) are highly used in molecular biology. Moreover, the protein obtained under the variety of conditions are not toxic, and they are widely known and commonly used in different types of studies (since the Green Fluorescent Protein was discovered the scientists have been improving it in order to get fluorescent proteins based in the original GFP but with better characteristics).
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is not a specific biosafety group either committee at our Institute Cavanilles of València University to evaluate how safe our project is, but we have specific contacts in our iGEM team that are on bioethics and biosafety boards. For example, Manel Porcar, our main supervisor is in the national committee of biosafety. Moreover, among the audience of the projection of the short film in Norway there are members and ex-members of Norwegian and European ethics committees.   In addition member of the ethical committee of the Clinical Hospital of València, took part in the debate. To read her letter, click here .
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Fortunately, whenever safety and security protocols are properly followed, environmental, researcher and public safety are well protected (unless, of course, the damage caused was impossible to predict by the current human knowledge). However, accidents may occur. This could carry undesired or even tragic consequences. Therefore, it is our responsibility as researchers to identify, describe and characterize all the biological and laboratory material we are working with, as well as the facilities and all the interactions between these elements in order to minimize the risk of any unwanted situation.
In order to reach this goal, we believe that communication is essential. This is one of the reasons behind our short movie “Talking Life”, one of the goals of which was to promote critical dialogue on the safety of synthetic organisms and mutants arising from them. Learning about the experiences experienced by other groups in security issues could also help preventing dangerous situations. If we know the existence of a new kind of hazard, the use of new ways"

I have compiled a dictionary of over 200 chemicals determined by the EPA to be toxic linked to their respective Kegg IDs. I followed the tutorials for creating a webpage with django and have decided that this will be a good fit for our project. The dictionary of chemicals was made into an HTML drop down menu. In the upcoming weeks, I will make the html form linked to our SQL database so that it can be automatically updated as the EPA list is updated. I am working on making a simple layout for the page where the user can select a toxin from a list as well as select a desired product- the page will respond to these selections and indicate that it recognizes the choices made. Although this is an unimpressive feat, it will lay some foundation for our pages IO. I am also currently investigating how to improve the pathfinding algorithm that Palak found on the net. It is nowhere near efficient enough for our purposes. Ideally, this algorithm will be able to quickly scan the huge network of reactions and show every possible series of reactions that can go from input compound to output compound. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning because we will have to then determine our method of choosing which path will be the most realistic and also optimal in the sense of production.
In other news, I'm still not on the Illinois iGEM mailing list so I don't find out about things like team beer pong tournaments and birthday celebrations. (I assume I'm not missing much- but if I don't get invited to summer thanksgiving I'll be pretty upset).

So after receiving Donny's intimidating email, I finally feel like I should write in the lab notebook. I am still without my laptop, which makes it harder to work on code. But for the last week I have been working on getting COBRA sources codes uploaded to our program. I found a program called OMPC. Apparently, OMPC allows running MATLAB®'s m-files using Python interpreter. OMPC reads m-files and translates them into Python compatible code.
Note having a laptop, I have been unable to check if this program works. Hopefully my laptop comes in tomorrow, so I can check this out because it will save us a lot of time by note having to convert about 30-40 COBRA source codes written in MATLAB to Phyton.

Transformation of the RFP-biobrick (test)
Goal:
Transform the RFP-biobrick (BBa_J04450) into competent DH5α-cells.
Procedure :
Before doing the transformation the biobrick was resuspended with 10 µL dH2O in the plate (position 23O, plate 7). The cells with and without the biobrick (negative control) were both incubated and plated after the transformation. The negative control was plated on LA-petri dishes while the transformed cells was plated on LA-petri dishes with CM.
Results:
There was only one colony on each plate

Colony picking biobrick (test) and transformation
Goal :
1. Get colonies of the transformed DH5α (biobrick)  2. Get colonies on the negative control plate
Procedure:
1. Due to the lack of colonies on the negative control plates, new plates was streaked.
2. New LA-plates without antibiotics were made.
3. Colonypicking the two colonies from the plates with the transformed bacteria in to liquid medium.
4. The transformation of bacteria with the biobrick plasmid was redone"

Today, we digested the inducible promoters, followed by purification and clean-up. Then we equipped the inducible and previously digested constitutive promoters with a RBS (B0032) by ligating respective parts. Subsequently, these ligated constructs were used to transform competent bacteria. We also inoculated overnight suspension cultures with B0015- and B0032-transformed E. coli XL1 Blue MRF' cells from glycerol stocks for DNA preparation.

We performed a colony PCR to test if cloning from the previous day was successful. Positively tested clones were used to inoculate 2xYT liquid cultures for DNA preparation. Overnight suspension cultures of B0015- and B0032-transformed cells were used for DNA preparation.
In order to separate the ampicillin resistance gene from its native promoter we performed a Phusion-PCR with appropriate primers on the P1002 brick.
Wednesday, June 19, 2013
Investigators: Roman, Laura, Kerstin
In order to harvest the successfully ligated bricks, DNA  of liquid cultures from positively tested clones was prepared for sequencing. We also repeated the colony PCR of the last four ligations as they showed questionable restriction patterns. After the second colony PCR was also found to be negative, these parts were once again digested, including gel extraction and purification. Furthermore, the previously amplified ampR gene was purified by gel electrophoresis. However, gel extraction did not yield enough DNA to work with.
Thursday, June 20, 2013
Investigators: Laura, Oliver
First, we performed another Phusion-PCR on ampR (P1002 brick) since the first PCR did not yield enough DNA. We also tried to amplify the luxR gene (C0062) through Phusion-PCR from pSB1A2 plasmid. However, not enough DNA was obtained and digestion of the purified PCR product did not show the expected bands.
More digestions were set up to harvest the separated ampicillin resistance gene and prepare DNA for the next cloning round. Additionally, lactonase (C0060) was ligated with a RBS (B0032), the ampR gene was cloned behind our inducible promoters and we ligated each autoinducer synthetase with a RBS (B0032"

We imagine that BioBricks in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, can be directly mixed with a backbone vector. This will make assembly of expression vectors possible in only a few hours. All our parts in form of PCR-products, should be distributed in microtiter plates, like the original iGEM BioBrick kit. The parts in Plug 'n' Play kit are directly ready for cloning. Furthermore, the ""Plug ’n’ Play"" kit will contain back-up plasmids of all parts to ensure amplification from a mutation free template if needed.
Applications
The Plug ‘n’ Play assembly standard can be applied in a lot of different contexts. Use of the Plug 'n' Play assembly standard is especially advantageous for high throughput projects. In a previous study by Hussam H. Nour-Eldin et. al. (5), they were able to clone 240 genes from a library into an expression vector in only three weeks with efficiency close to 95% (5).
Below we have listed some different applications in which our standard assembly would be particularly useful.
Construction of DNA libraries.
High-troughput cloning.
Development of vector systems for gene expression analysis.
Development of genetic tools for eukaryotes.
Development of reporter systems.
To proof our concept, we developed a reporter system for mammalian cells and for Aspergillus nidulans .

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#HP#Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the high risk group is greater than the general population. Therefore as more true positives would be picked up, the cost of unnecessary CT scans would be offset by the additional correct diagnoses. Everyone with a positive test result would have a CT scan anyway to confirm the presence of their cancer.
The major drawback to a low specificity is the psychological impact of a patient being told they have cancer when in fact they do not. Again, through using multiple miRNA signatures in tandem - i.e. the levels of different miRNAs related to a single disease, and calculating a weighted score involving all of them, so that an abnormal level of just one miRNA does not necessarily lead to a false positive.
We can also alleviate the problem of false positives by ensuring doctors tell patients that the results our sensor provides just indicate the need for further testing, and are not a diagnosis.
Dr Desai also advised that the result from our test could be combined with a score from patient history to quantify their risk (e.g. Tammegami et al.’s probability score). This total score would then be used to increase accuracy of the test.
NICE Criteria for screening tools
To incorporate the feedback from doctors into the applications of our project, we have explained how our sensor meets (or would be applied so that it meets) the NICE criteria for a screening tool.
NICE Criteria
Our Sensor
The condition being screened should be a serious health problem in terms of frequency and/or severity
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2012. In the UK in 2014, there were 46,403 new cases and 35,895 deaths. [4] 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC. [5]
The epidemiology, natural history and development of the condition from latent to declared states should be understood and/or there should be robust evidence about the association between the marker and the disease
Much is known about NSCLC, and although there are still a lot of research going into understanding cancer characteristics. The same is true for most other cancers. Although miRNAs are still being characterized, Hennessey et al. demonstrated a potential link between miR-15b and miR-27b to NSCLC. However, validation is still required with a large patient cohort for clinical use. Expert Dan Pregibon anticipates that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is not far off.
All the cost-effective primary prevention should have been implemented as far as practicable
Smoking cessation is the most effective"

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," and RhlR, are activated to further produce GFP. By analyzing the ratio at which OmpC triggers the QSMs, we can achieve a GFP production that is easy to detect. With this data we would, in theory, be able to link back to the EnvZ concentration. This means that a detectable level of the biomarker can be received.
The process by which we achieved these results was mostly researching the subjects and using Simbiology, an application in Matlab to both design and simulate models. For the third (release of QSMs) and fourth part (GFP expression) of our project we started with the same methods as previously but realized early on that we needed to develop our own equation. For this we expanded our knowledge in Matlab and also contacted iGEM Technion from 2014 for support.
The hypothesis for the first part (EnvZ -> OmpC/OmpF) was that EnvZ is proportional to the OmpR-P production but, at the same time, a part of the OmpR-P is consumed.

We also made a physical contribution to another teams’ project.
Team München iGEM was in need for a working kill switch, so they contacted our team to ask us for BBa_K782063, a part used by team Slovenia 2012       and not yet available in the distribution. The Slovenian team this year is of course composed of different members, but we had to search for the part in      the collection of the National Institute of Chemistry and prepare it.

Mechanical Device
    In addition to the microfluidics device, we have designed a mechanical device for the project. The whole system consists of four parts: the main body, lighting board, shading baffle and microfluidics chip. The details for each part are described in the Hardware page.     When assembling, four LED lights are inserted into the corresponding holes. Four single-pole double-throw switches on the external circuit board can switch the light color (red or green). The power switch is on the battery box. Microfluidics chip is inserted into the upper slot. The shading baffle, which has the same size as the microfluidics chip, is inserted into the lower slot, to avoid the interference from stray light.

    While using, the overall device will be placed in incubator of 37 ° . Pressing the four switches can adjust the LED light into the appropriate color, waiting for bacteria to respond to light signals. Later, take out the baffle and observe the color of each chamber, and that is the ""cipher text"" we get.     There are five kinds of bacteria in our cipher machine: the core bacteria with the oscillation circuit and four affiliated bacteria. As for these four bacteria, they are controlled by the oscillation system and contain the signal transformation circuit (which is composed of the light control circuit and the logic gate circuit). Before using the cipher machine, we should first mix these five bacteria together according to a certain proportion and insert them into the microfluidics chip. Then, insert the chip in our device and put the whole device in the thermos-stated container.     While encrypt"

Cph8
Figure 1: This figure shows the fusion of the Cph1 (green) with the PCB chromophore linked with the EnvZ Kinase  and OmpR (organe). Phosphorylated OmpR binds to the ompC promoter and activates transcription [Levskaya2005].
Cph8 is a chimeric light receptor engineered by Levskaya et al. in 2005. It is a fusion of the photoreceptor Cph1 and the EnvZ histidine kinase.  The light sensing unit is connected to transcription via the EnvZ-OmpR signaling pathway, phosphorylated OmpR acting as a transcription factor. Both OmpR and EnvZ are endogenously expressed in E.coli, so an envZ-deficient strain (e.g. JT2 or RU1012) has to be used [Levskaya2005], [Tabor2011].
Cph1 is only active when it binds the chromophore phycocyanobiline (PCB). Since PCB is not naturally produced in E.coli we also need to express the PCB generators: ho1 and pcyA.
In this construct far red light activates the EnvZ kinase which results in the phosphorylation of OmpR and its activation as a transcription factor. Red light on the other hand deactivates the kinase and therefore the gene can not be expressed.

NPU-China,2017,Team:NPU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", but at the same time, there are some kinetic                                 parameters of the enzyme we are looking for. Its organic matter, or the temperature and ph                                 of the enzyme are different. Therefore, we need to re-estimate this part of the parameters.
In the process data link, we cited the method using the data point weighting of University                                 of Manchester in year 2016 . The weighting of the samples is as follows:
1. When the sample PH is the same, the sample is weighted by 4 .2 when they are close. 1 when they differ much.
2. When the sample temperature is the same, the pH is the same.
3. When the samples are from the same species , the weight of the sample is 4.When they                                 are the non-identical species and are the prokaryotes，or the corresponding species mutated                                 to the corresponding species, the weight is 2. When they are the non-identical species and                                 are the eukaryotes, the weight is 1.
4. Try to delete the missing data. If there are some essential samples of the temperature                                 and PH missing, then the corresponding weight is 2.
1.kernel density estimate 2. Gaussian mixed model.
The fourth point reflects our point of view of Bayesian. In the absence of prior knowledge                                 of the case, we take as much as possible the weight of neutrality.
Based on the points above, we get a new parametric vector after weighting.In our model,                                 we do the fitting of the probability density according to the two methods of the parameter                                 vector: 1.kernel density estimatebsp;2. Gaussian mixed model.
The basic workflow of parameter estimation：
The Gaussian mixture model can be approximated to any real probability distribution in theory.                                 The EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters required for the model. And we use the                                 Gaussian mixture model to estimate the probability density of the possible distribution of                                 parameters.
After making the probability distribution, we select Bin randomly, which meet the conditions                                 of width = len / 10.And we select the most possible bin based on the CDF, and estimate the                                 corresponding parameters when the bin reach average value.
Finally, we get the estimated parameter values, as well as the corresponding parameters                                 of the original PDF. The specific form and parameter values are as follows:
The reaction path of the original pathway is Gly to Gly-3-p and then to DAHP
The original pathway belongs to the reaction of a single channel, and there is a random                                 bibi reaction and an irreversible Mickey equation reaction. The reaction involves two enzymes"

Bacteriophage Plaques
Basic Design
Experiments with bacteriophage growth is often performed either in liquid broth or in solid agar medium. In contrast to the relative uniform distribution of phages in liquid broth, phages form individual clearings in bacterial lawn within solid agar medium. These clearings are termed plaques. They are the product of bacterial cell lysis as phage replicate and spread outward.
For our modeling experiments, we hypothesized that multiple experimental factors may influence the size of plaque formation in solid agar medium (Fig. 1). We decided to start with identifying the relationships between plaque sizes and each of these factors. With these data, we can generate a mathematical model that take into account all experimental variability. Such model can be used by researcher to design the optimal experimental conditions that will produce plaques of the ideal size for their experiments.
Experimental Results
We decided to start with determining the relationship between phage plaque size and phage particle size. Specifically, 0.5 mL of E coli B liquid culture (OD 600 = 0.5) was transfected with 20uL of the respective phage (T1, T3, T4, and T7) at approximately the same concentration for 10 minutes. After this, the bacteria/phage mixture was plated on standard LB plates using x1 top agar. Plates were allowed to solidify at room temperature for 30 minutes, before they were placed in an incubator at 37 Celsius for 24 hours. Following incubation, pictures of plates were taken with Alphaimager and plaque sizes were measured using ImageJ .

2.Codon Usage
When the sequence contains too many rare codons, which means the number of the homologous tRNA is extremely low in E.coli, the whole sequence can hardly express. In order to avoid the appearance of rare codons, each occurrence of rare codons will lead to penalty.
Selection
In each generation we sort the 200 sequences according to the scores of each single sequence. And we terminate the half of lower scores, the rest of them will have better fitness. Repeat the process of mutation and crossover, the average score of each generation will increase. (See Results.)
We repeat the process for 600 generations.
Simulated Annealing(SA)
-Introduction of Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing is a simple and general algorithm for finding global minima. It operates by simulating the cooling of a (usually fictitious) physical system whose possible energies correspond to the values of the objective function being minimized. The analogy works because physical systems occupy only the states with lowest energy as the temperature is lowered to absolute zero.
-Our Strategy
Mutation
We randomly choose 5 points on the sequence to mutate. To each single point, the process is the same with our computational mutation in genetic algorithm.
Scoring
The same as fitness scoring in genetic algorithm.
Parameters
The initial temperature T is 10000.0, after each generation, the temperature reduces to 99% of the former temperature. If the new generation has higher score, it will be accepted. Otherwise it will be accepted at a probability P(A)

Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed the expected band of 1.9 kb (purified GG product, cultivated for more than 14 h). Four plaques of this plate were used to infect four 4 ml (2xYT + carbenicillin) E. coli culture (stock ID: 47) with an OD600 of 0.4. Cultures were cultivated for around 14 h and centrifuged at 8000 xg for 5 min to receive the phage containing supernatants.
AP Opto
The trafos of the APs revealed 2-5 colonies on each plate. A growth of two colonies of each AP was prepared in 4 ml 2xYT medium with carbenicillin. On the next day, a 2 ml glycerol stock (25 %) of each clone was prepared and the remaining cell suspension (3 ml) was purified using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit.
The AP plasmid purification was analyzed by sanger sequencing (GATC). The sequence was not as expected. It turns out, that for amplification of the AP_BB_light and AP_BB_dark the primers CG_005_rev and CG_008_rev were mixed-up. The purification of AP_BB_light is actually AP_BB_dark and the other way around. As the overhangs in the GG did not fit, it is hardly surprising that the transformation efficiency was that low.
