SEU_A,2012,Team:SEU A#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the ‘death gene’ better in our ‘toxic apple’ project, we want to do some research on how to improve the conjugation efficiency under certain conditions. IGEM_Berkeley Team of IGEM 2005 have done some experiment on conjugation in solution and gave the best ratio between initial D(donor cells, similarly hereafter) and R(recipient cells) as 1:2. However, aimed to improve the conjugation efficiency, we consider the experiment and analysis of conjugation in solution are with these disadvantages: 1. The process of the experiment is difficult to be seen by an electron microscope. 2. The result is random in a certain degree due to the large space that cells could freely move in and the complex dynamics system of cells in the solution. 3. Mixing the solution is a necessary step to help D and R contact while it may also interrupt the conjugation itself. Taking the reasons above into consideration, we decided to model for the scheme on solid culture. Due to the limited time in our experiment, we use some parameters from others’ experiment and modeling and we also use the SDTC model to get the best ratio between initial D and R with the total number of initial plasmid donor cells and recipient cells constant by simulation. In our SDTC model, we employ a lattice of 500×500 to describe each cell and each sites in simulation lattice area separately so we can trace their state separately at any time. We use a ‘Cycle Time Trace’ system to record each cell’s doubling and conjugation state and ensure they update asynchronously so that the time in our system could be considered as continuous compared with the scale of cell doubling time or conjugation cycle time though any kind of simulation of time has to use a small period of time as simulation step length and we make no exception.    2.2 Model 2.1 Space system In the SDTC Model, we set up a 500×500 lattice which contain 250000 sites. Bacteria and nutriment can be at any site on the lattice. The bacteria cell is considered 1 um2 that the total area of our view window is 0.25mm2. Furthermore, the lattice can be extended to more than 2 dimension. The thickness of lattice has three possible value: 0, 1, 2, that is to say, each site can hold mostly two kind of bacteria at the same time. In addition, there is no such ‘up and down’difference inside one site in this 2.5D model. The thickness of nutriment is 0"

Charles - FACS 100 samples in just under 90 minutes. Tyler's stuff had low concentrations so it ran slow, but data looks promising. Ken did Heks and Chos and both look promising. My stuff failed due to higher than intended initial cell concentration. Basically cells overgrew ran out of nutrients got sick and failed. Also made 20,000 ng of Dest 4-5.
Other things I did today:
-FACS for TRE:LacI and TRE:LacI-Krab (I'm generating graphs now)
-Transfected CHO cells for Notch-Delta Co-culture
-I was going to repeat Mariola's Mnt and CI434 activation experiments but I couldn't find the DNA, so I asked Divya to do some LR reactions
August 17
Jon - Prepped Notch for full sequencing, minipreps, cell stocking, nanodropping, prepping trash for pickup. Divya - Inoculated and LR'd NCADs, Nanodropped CPLRs. Will transform tomorrow. See personal notebook for details.

Tyler: Prepared for transfections and updated the wiki. Will prepare CHO cells for NCAD phenotype experiment tomorrow. NCAD with HEK-293 cells failed. Hef1A:GV16 experiments looked very good. TRE:LacI-EYFP-FF4 shows a lot of EYFP, about 25% increase if I remember correctly, but the LacI repression looks very weak. We have a Hef1A:mKate that is bad, showing about 0-2.5% fluorescence. I will repeat these experiments tomorrow. The DRD2 shows very small levels of activation, but I think it is actually there (see&nbsp;[iGEM2011:GPCR Experiments]).

Our PCR from last time gave us very dim bands as products so we did PCR clean up and added all three of the samples together into one column. We also set up restriction digests for the cleaned PCR insert of Cro and for the plasmid pIG13 with pstI and ecoRI. This should place the Cro insert right after pBAD in pIG13. I also worked a bunch on the QS construct updating the primers document from last year and working on a document that has the sequence for the entire construct as it should appear in pJG78. Need to redo sequencing for the primers BI222, BI227, and BI247. CH

Our low melt gel had holes in the bottom of the first few wells, so the already low-concentration plasmid was diluted between 4 wells. Our vector’s well was viable, and the vector stayed in the well. KK, KP
5/10/13
We were able to cut out our vector from the low melt gel, but our insert was not visible. So, today, we made preparations to run our CRO insert on a low melt gel again. I made the low melt gel and set it to cool, and to remain in the fridge over the weekend. Kelton and Clarice performed the PCR cleanup of a second CRO insert PCR reaction that we ran. The PCR was more successful this time - the bands were much more clearly visible, in all three of our Lambda samples (see the photo that Kelton will upload).
Today we did a PCR cleanup on our Cro PCR products. We also set up a slow melt gel so we can try again on Monday to get a cutout of the insert in order to combine our plasmid and insert. We already have the plasmid, we just have to wait on the insert because it wasn’t visible in our first slow melt gel. Here is a picture of our second PCR product run on a 1 kb ladder gel: KK, KP,CH
CH 5/13/13 Set up ligations for pIG12/13 + Cro both treated with pstI and ecoRI. Figured out the primers we need for sequencing the region where cro will be inserted (IG57 and IG58).

In spite of test in vitro and in vivo, we also took our first step to make ECHO a real product.
ECHO Capsules
After we visited Roche with Tongji_China, we have been thinking about the proper load of ECHO. In our interview with Lingjie Zhou, who is responsible for quality assurance in Roche, she talked about the advantage of capsules compared with other pharmaceutical preparations, which are listed below.
High bioavailability
Reliable stability
Flexible form
Good compliance of patients
Easy manufacture
More about our interview with Roche .
After the visit, we decided to collaborate with Tongji_China, to purchase the enteric capsule, DRcaps, from Capsugel , a global pharmaceutical dosage solutions company. This kind of capsule can protect product ingredients form stomach acid so that it can release ECHO in colon where our device is supposed to function.

Hydrogel beads
Alginates are linear natural polysaccharide which could respond to the calcium and produce a three-dimensional (3D) network of chain cross linking, serving as promising materials for drug delivery. This time we introduced sodium alginates to make hydrogel covered bacteria beads, which was suspended in drinking water, facilitating oral administration of our engineered bacteria.
The strenghs of hydrogel beads are
Easy to produce food grade beads
Stable for E.coli delivery
Adjustable to produce different sizes
Safe to degradation in vivo
The overall process of hydrogel beads production was shown in Fig.2.

The cost of a false positive was taken as the cost of a contrast enhanced chest CT scan (£359 [19] ), plus the cost of the test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110) as it would be done for 6 years - as that would be the follow up of a positive result of our test. We assumed that all patients with a false positive would subsequently have their cancer ruled out by a CT. Previous screening trials have showed that other procedures are needed, sometimes bronchoscopy, or a false positive proceeding all the way to surgery and treatment. However, we believe a CT in combination with our test would rule out nearly all false positives (especially if several miRNAs were used in tandem to look at the properties of the ‘tumor’ in a subsequent test) - and the probability of a patient having further measures taken would likely be negligible. There is also no data available to quantify this additional cost.
The cost of treatment in stage 1 is £8000 and in stage 4 is £10,050. [19] We used the cost at stage 4 as the upper bound of the cost for stages 2-4. Similar to before, this is likely to decrease were a large scale screening trial to take place and figures for individual stages used - as cost of treatment in stage 2 is far lower than stage 4. [19] We assumed the cost of unsuccessful treatment in stage 1 was the same as the cost of successful treatment in stage one plus average cost of treatment in the other stages - as if treatment is unsuccessful in stage one, a patient is likely to have their tumor progress to later stages. The cost of treatment in stage 4 is not dependent on success as the treatment is just palliative care.
We ignored the cost of recurrence of a cancer - recurrences in cancer are complex and cannot be easily modelled. Furthermore, the earlier the cancer is detected, the lower the chace of recurrence. This means our sensor that can detect NSCLC at stage 1 would drastically reduce this cost.
As Tammemägi gave the probability of cancer in the next 6 years we calculated the cost effectiveness of screening each year for the next 6 years. Hence the cost of 6 true negatives is the cost of our test times 6 (£18.66 x 6 = £110).
Expected QALYs gained was calculated using 70 as lower a bound for life expectancy. The national life expectancy at birth in"

Improvement
TlpA is a thermal sensitive transcriptional regulator, original TlpA was provided by ETH Zurich 2017, and a different version with lower activation temperature, TlpA36, was provided by NUS Singapore 2017, is the one we are improving, BBa_K2447012.
We provided TlpA39, which is with activation temperature higher than TlpA36 but lower than the original TlpA. All these three proteins can bind to pTlpA promoter, TlpA protein, according to the proposed mechanism, it will dimerize at the operator region of pTlpA, repress it and prevent the RNAP from attach to the promoter. It will de-dimerize when temperature reaches its activation temperature. Leakage was observed, transcription of pTlpA was initiated below the expected temperature. ETH Zurich improved this by simply increase the expression of TlpA protein.
Why did we improve this?
While we are designing our drug delivery bacteria project, we found out that TlpA has too high activation energy and TlpA36 is too low comparing to human body temperature. So, we found this TlpA39 on Shapiro’s lab, and utilized it into our project.
We also constructed a TlpA39-LVA to see if the LVA tag will accelerate the derepression process, but we found that there is no repression to TlpA39 since it has been rapidly degraded.
We characterized them by culturing them under different temperature, and read them on a petri dish or plate reader.
We can see that at 35 degree Celsius, TlpA36-K2447012 starts to derepress. At 37 degree Celsius, TlpA39-K2572000 starts to derepress. At 39.5 degree Celsius, Tcl42-K2572001 starts to express.
So they do initiate at different temperature.
Also, we can see there are differences of expression for same regulators are different under different temperature.

Only when a protein-protein interaction initiates transcription of an alternate histidine production pathway would  E. coli be able to grow on his-knockout 3-AT media [1]. Because the reporter in the Dove et al system only gave a binary response of (growth if interaction) or (no growth if no interaction) we felt it was not sensitive enough for our purposes. We contacted Ann Hochschild, who was kind enough to send us the sequence for the promoter for their system, pOL2-62 ( BBa_K2876000 ), a pLacZ promoter with a modified upstream region for lambda cl binding. We then took that promoter and linked it to a turbo-RFP, to allow for a concentration dependent fluorescence response (Figure 12). To test the reporter we transformed DH5-alpha with the pOL2-62 + RFP reporter plasmid, as well as the positive control bacteriomatch lambda and alpha plasmids from Addgene and induced with IPTG. Unfortunately, when we ran the experiment on the plate reader we saw no fluorescence response (Figure 13).

Floor
Heya! I'm Floor and I am the chairwoman of the IGEM Groningen 2017 team. I'm also working on acquisition and human practices. Besides all the regular hobbies I enjoy cooking, making my own clothes, yoga and molecular biology.
Matthijs
The times that any scientific experiment fails on me again, sometimes I think; ""Why am I even doing this? Why did I choose to do this with my life?"" But then I realise that all the other occupations out there suck even more and biological research is just who I am and what I enjoy the most.
Meintje
Molecular biology is what I like to talk about. If you want to know more about the smallest creatures of life, I’m always available for a nice chat. Maybe that’s why I’m responsible for the outreach of our project. To me the project would be successful if I’m able to give an insight into synthetic biology, to all levels of society. Next to iGEM and studying I give guest lectures at high schools and I give tutoring.          But it’s not all about the brain! I also like to play korfball. It’s a typical Dutch sport, looks a bit like basketball, but the more fun part is… we play with men and women together.
Felix
I am the lab manager for our team. Besides working for IGEM and my masters project, I like to kitesurf, go out and cook passionately.         I also am a frequent visitor of Narnia and a member of the board of governance in hogwarts. I like sarcasms, lists, unnecessary comments, politics and synthetic biology.         If I do not get the invitation to Hogwarts, I would like to either do my Phd in synthetic biology or be a kitesurf instructor for a while in South Africa.
Mart
Hi! I am Mart and I study molecular biology and some chemistry. I am really interested in how life functions at molecular level and how we can manipulate these molecules to perform useful tasks. Other interests of mine are experimenting with (molecular) cooking and"

Fluorescence Assay
Procedure
Put 5 mL of LB into new labeled overnight tubes. Remember to make 2 overnight tubes of each (1 for testing OD's in the spectrophotometer and 1 for actually using in the assay).
Take the overnights out of the incubator from the previous night.
Take 100 uL of the overnights from the incubator and place in the new correctly labeled overnight tubes (100 uL of the overnights goes in each copy of each tube).
Grow up the new overnight tubes in the shaker for about 1.5 hours.
While waiting on the cells to grow up, make LB that is at the correct pH for the assay.
Take 4 tubes, label them LB pH7, LB pH4, LB pH3, LB pH2. Put 5 mL of LB into each tube.
Go to the pH probe. Follow the instructions on how to use the pH probe. Check the pH of the solution and slowly add HCl or NaOH to adjust pH. I suggest using .1M NaOH to make the pH7 LB and 1M HCL to make the other pH LBs.
When you are done put the LB in the cold room until you are ready to setup the assay.
Check the OD's of the overnight tubes from the test overnights. If the cells are not at an OD of 0.3-0.4  put them back into the incubator and check again in 15-30 minutes.  The goal is to get the cells in log phase which is around 0.4 OD. However, make sure to not overgrow the cells. Remember that it will take approximately an hour to place all the samples into the 96 well plate so I would suggest taking all of the overnights out near 0.3 rather than 0.4.
Once you have all of the cells at about 0.3 OD and the correct pH LB, grab a 96 well plate and start heating up the plate reader (this takes about a half hour to heat up).
To the blank wells just add the correct pH of LB, nothing else. So add"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users to replace the detecting cell more conveniently. We drilled two holes on the lid of the cell, to insert the pump pipe.
A 585nm-595nm 1W LED light bead, with the rated voltage around 2.0V, is applied in our hardware. Two 1kΩ resistors were put in series with the LED to reduce the voltage across it, as our circuit board can only provide 5V output.
To sense the fluorescence, we installed a LDR (light dependent resistor) sensor of LXD55 series, whose resistance ranges from 8 to 20 kΩ in brightness (10 Lux), and 1MΩ in darkness (0 Lux) with response time of around 20ms. A 10kΩ resistor is in series with the LDR sensor to divide the voltage, and then the resistance value of sensor is collected by the circuit board.
We printed some small components in this part to fix or support the items mentioned above, with the 3D printer.
Control System
An Arduino Nano V3.0 board is employed to control the whole equipment. It is powered by a battery and provides 5V output to different parts. Meanwhile it collects the signal from LDR sensor and transports it to the Bluetooth module, and later sends to user’s phone.
Five relays under the control of Arduino Nano separately regulate the power supplies of the pumps, the LED, the LDR sensor, and the Bluetooth module. We chose Risym 5V electromagnetic relay which could bear up to DC30V/10A.
For transmitting signal we applied HC-60 wireless Bluetooth module.
Firstly we plan to apply a much more complex design, which required us to 3D-print the total equipment. In fact it is difficult for our machine to print such a large box. Thus we simplified it and decided to only print some small components and use a relatively flat PC box to hold all the parts. The heaviest item, the battery, is put on the bottom and the whole detection system is placed at the corner, to stabilize the equipment.
Measurement
Different parameters of the hardware were acquired through a series of experiments. We attached importance to the performance of filter membrane, investigating the efficiency of filtration of bacteria and flow velocity. The working state of the pumps and the LED light bead were checked. And we conducted experiments to simulate the expected working condition of our hardware, to inquiry whether it functions well when floating in the ponds"
Beijing_Normal,2008,Team:Beijing Normal#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," BphC transcription and expression under a 2, 3-DHBP and 4-CB inducible promoter Ppcb. As 2, 3-DHBP is the second metabolite in the pathway, 2, 3-DHBP at a concentration more than 0.1mM will induce the activate Ppcb and thus increase gene expression downstream.
As dihydrodiols and dihydroxybiphenyls are very toxic to bacterial even after short incubation time, we design a feedback repression pathway use sRNA components— sodB and rhyB. Part of sodB was fusion with bphA and biosurfactant pathway and will be repressed by rhyB which is under the control the promoter Ppcb. As only when rhyB molecules is much more than sodB fusion mRNA, it will play a role of repression, only the high concentration of DHBP will arise this reaction. In this case, the amount of these two metabolites will be reduced in two ways.
As to the sensor part, dihydroxylated PCBs are substrate of the clcA-encoded chlorocatechol dioxygenase and thus induce the clcR and related promoter, so we use this as the sensing system. And T7 amplification system is add downstream to amplify the signal.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,"brane domain of Pex13 tagged with the fluorescent protein mRuby.
Pex13−mRuby
We used the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13 as a fluorescent marker − by just using the transmembrane domain of Pex13 with a short linker, we make sure that it has no influence on the peroxisomal features. To obtain a higher differentiation from mTurquoise, which we use for another construct, we chose to work with mRuby. Literature research revealed that such constructs have been tested before − Erdmann et al. (2004) described a construct containing only Pex13200-310 with a C-terminal GFP.
Figure 1.3: Pex13 construct with C-terminal mRuby.
Pex5 variant
In order to achieve an orthogonal peroxisomal protein import machinery we used a Pex5 knockout yeast strain in which we transformed our artificial  Pex5 variant containing a modified PTS1 binding pocket. Our variation facilitates the detection of a non native PTS1 variant instead of the wild type PTS1. The construct contains a medium strength promoter, the Pex5 gene and a terminator. The remaining plasmid parts can be seen in the plasmid map below.
Figure 1.4: Pex5 gene variant.
mTurquoise−PTS
Our approach for import verification is based on the fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with our modeled PTS variants. After several promoter tests with different strengths, we decided to express this construct only in low amounts, since this was the most suitable possibility to detect potential mTurquoise localization.
Our construct is depicted in the figure below.
Figure 1.5: Fluorescent protein mTurquoise tagged with the PTS variant.
Combination of our constructs
To combine our constructs, we cloned our Pex5 and mTurquoise constructs into a level 2 plasmid portrayed below.
Figure 1.6: Level 2 plasmid containing the Pex5 gene and the fluorescent protein.
Subsequently,  co-transformation of the Pex13−mRuby plasmid and the level 2 plasmid was performed in order to verify peroxisomal colocalization.
PTS screening
Trusting on our targeted approach alone seemed risky − that is why we planned a PTS screening to find the most favorable PTS for our three receptors. Dueber et al. (2016) used the Violacein assay for a similar purpose. They screened for the best PTS for the wild type receptor and were successful. Hence another subproject of our team is the integration of the Violacein pathway into"

Chalmers-Gothenburg,2015,Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," pleased that we got this opportunity to get in contact with another team! It has been really nice and we are all looking forward to meet the Czech Republic team in Boston!
The Nordic iGEM Conference
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is getting to know new people with whom you can discuss ideas and collaborate as well as make new friends. As a step towards this, the Chalmers-Gothenburg team has participated in the Nordic iGEM Conference, NiC. This was an initiative by the Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams who collaborated in the hosting of this event. The conference took place between the 24th and the 26th of July at the Uppsala University, and all ten iGEM teams of the Nordic countries were invited. It was a great weekend with very constructive discussions as well as a lot of fun.
On the day of arrival, a welcoming BBQ was arranged in the evening, allowing all the teams to socialise and get to know each other. The evening offered amazing food and a range of fun games, making for a great start of the conference. The next day was when the main event of the NiC took place, namely the presentations of the projects. All the teams had selected one member who would be part of a NiC jury, which in the end would determine which project and presentation would be crowned the winner of the NiC, and be awarded with the highly sought-after Golden Pipette. However, the main intention behind the presentations was to give the teams some practice for the upcoming presentations in Boston.
All the teams, including the jury, were then allowed to ask questions on each project which also was meant to be as preparation for the Q&A which follows the presentations at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. This part of the NiC was very useful and provided a lot of interesting feedback on our project, and also letting us understand the struggles and successes the other teams faced in a very constructive way.
Later that same day, the next part of the NiC was held, which encompassed different workshops that allowed the teams to compare and reflect on various iGEM experiences. The workshop topics included:
1. Awesome solutions for the lab. This workshop aimed to address solutions to technical problems in the lab, and let the teams share their experiences in this area.
2. The future of iGEM technology. This workshop allowed the participants to speculate on current and future technologies which could be used in the iGEM competition.

Amsterdam,2012,Team:Amsterdam#practices#results_-_-_TEXT.html," screening methods. This is done by measuring the acute toxic effects of the compound on the cell instead of directly measuring the presence of the compound. Measured substances are: (I) aromatic carbon-hydroxides (dioxins) and (II) hormones. Dioxins are very stable and not metabolized by the cells that measure their toxic effects, hence easily measurable using this technique. Hormones are sometimes metabolized by the chassis cells used, which affects the outcome of the measurement. European and international legislation concerning analytical chemistry is mostly directed at chemical measurements of dioxins, not the biological measurement.
Cons to bioassays
Mass spectrometry methods are much more widely used in the field and more familiar to companies looking for detection systems. This technique allows to measure various chemicals simultaneously, this technique is very expensive. Mass spectrometry methods are also not completely unambiguous either. For our product to be a viable and interesting measurement method, it has to be much easier and cheaper than already known chemical analytical methods.
View on applications
We summarized the molecular mechanism of the Cellular Logbook for Bart van der Burg and asked him if he could see advantages of a memory module in a multi-sensor system. Applications he could think of on the spot:
Forensics: Intrigued by the facet of time indication that is inherent to the Cellular Logbook, he thought of bacteria that would solve a crime, by inferring the time on which the criminal was at the crime scene. One major bottleneck would be that the crime scene would have to be supplied with bacteria containing the Cellular Logbook beforehand.
Control of compound emission at industrial sites (e.g. factory): he envisioned to place the bacteria at multiple locations around a factory site to get an idea where and when chemicals were released.
Problems envisioned
Release of GMOs into the environment
Survivability of the cell in the environment
Robustness of the test
Specificity for a particular compound - lots of validation steps are required.
Points of action
Bart van der Burg then encouraged us to have a talk with the Dutch Water company Waternet, and specifically to their toxicologist Ron van der Oost.
Waternet (Amsterdam, the Netherlands)
Ron van der Oost is a toxicologist at a Dutch water company, named Waternet . He is specialized in research on risks, effects and behavior of emerging substances in the water cycle.

Furthermore, viewing the future of our hydrogel patch, we think a hydrogel, lysostaphin producing layer, with a removable nutrient layer would be convenient to nourish the cells. The removable layer makes it easily replacable, decreasing the amount of times the total gel has to be removed which is usually painful for the patient.
Diffusion in Porous media
What is the effect of a hydrogel on the diffusion of particles in a medium?
Summary
The processes of diffusion in a porous media can be related to properties of the porous media. There relations were modelled to allow us to find what the effect was of changing properties of the hydrogel on the effective diffusion of lysostaphin within our gel. By measuring the effective diffusion of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP, 26.9 KDa) within our Dextran hydrogel using an experiment, we gained insights in the transport behaviour of lysostaphin (27 KDa). We estimated the tortuosity of our hydrogel to be between 1 and √1.5, and could conclude that timescales for the transport processes in our patch in the range of 24 hours.
Future research in the design of the patch could lead to a preference for another effective diffusion constant in the hydrogel. Using both the model and the experiment we have the tools to estimate what the properties of the hydrogel should be and to validate this effective diffusion constant is indeed what we would have expected.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

Introduction
The effective diffusivity (De) of particles being transported through a porous structure is a certain liquid is smaller than particles being transported in the same liquid but without porous structure (D0). The ratio De / D0 ,often referred to as the diffusibility, can be very different from one porous medium to the other. Therefore it makes sense to relate the diffusibility to variables that characterize the porous medium in multiples ways. A simple way to model this is by relating De / D0 to the porosity (ɛt), constricitivy (δ) and tortuosity (τ) following equation 1 as is described in (1).
The porosity of a porous material is defined as the volume fraction of the vacancies and the total volume, Vv / VT. The tortuosity is a parameter of a porous medium that relates to the shortest paths or main paths where diffusion takes place. The con"

First, give a solution that combines with microorganism and daily products to tackle with air pollutant. Second, come up with the idea to integrate both microorganism and buildings to generate power or reduce the wasted heat. Third, design a bio-system that can be embedded into the asphalt road to deal with the car exhaust emissions or the urban heat island effect (UHI).  This section was highly praised because each team came up with numerous interesting ideas after intensive discussion and we all found it meaningful for the training itself!  In conclusion, our designed warm-up activities have shown the four core values of iGEM: teamwork, think out of the box, crossover integration and deal with the real issue around the world. All the thoughts came out from that day may one day be a project or something we are eager to fulfill. We believe deeply that these difficulties truly exist and are waiting for us to dedicate ourselves in!

In this summer, we attended 5th Asia Pacific Conference held by NCTU. During the conference, we acquainted lots of other iGEMers, building up the several bridges of our following collaboration chances. Also in this conference, we practiced our presentation and conveyed our project idea to others, which is quite useful for us to review our current work in a more objective way. On the other hand, besides reviewing ourselves, to realize other team’s work is quite important as well. At this point, we did find some excellent work and be inspired. We can see how others think and how they practice so that we can also add it to our idea or improve some drawbacks. Here we conclude something that influenced our job :
1. A more concise presentation should be considered. This is our first presentation after our whole frame was formed but we spend too much time trying to give every detail so that we speak too fast and too toneless. After the presentation, most people didn’t get the basic concept and function of our work judging from their question. We then modified the whole slides into a more concise and more comprehensible version which do helps more audiences to get into it.

The resulting plasmid DNA was screened using restriction enzyme digest, and the fragments produced were compared against in silico digestions performed using Genome Compiler and also our own predictions based on the DNA sequence.
testing e. coli plasmids using a plate reader
We took advantage of the skills that we learned performing the Interlab study and applied a similar protocol to our plasmids. We modified the Interlab protocol for our purposes by evaluating conditions such as the starting O.D., the duration of the time course, and the necessity of washing out LB before reading the cell cultures on the plate reader.
​
DH5a cells that were transformed with our plasmids were grown overnight in LB with 25ug/uL chloramphenicol. The next day, the cultures were diluted down to a specified O.D. The first time point was taken here as time 0, and we continued to culture the cells over 4 hours, taking time points as specified. The GFP and Abs600 readings were taken using a Molecular Devices FilterMax F5 multimode plate reader. When the desired reaction conditions were identified, we repeated those parameters but used cultures containing the biscistronic Arsenic Circuit spiked with a range of arsenic concentrations.
Testing plasmids in cell-free lysates using paper ticket
The optimal conditions for GFP expression in the plate reader is expected to represent the upper limits of what we can expect using the paper assay. This is because we expect it to be slower and less efficient for the reaction to occur in live cells, as compared to a cell-free system where all the necessary proteins are readily available. We start with the conditions understood from the plate reader experiments and titrate the duration and amount of arsenic down. The cell-free assay is performed using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for the Promega E. coli S30 Extract System for Circular DNA.

Two phycocyanobilin(PCB)-biosynthesis genes (ho11 and pcya2) from Synechocystis encoding a heme oxygenase and bilin reductase, respectively, is essential to convert heme into PCB.  Figure 2 depicts the phycocyanobilin-biosynthesis pathway.3 With the biosynthesis of PCB, cph1 serve as a red-light absorbing chromophore that is inactivated under red light and activated without red light . 4,5
envZ-ompR, a dimeric osmosensor, is a multidomain transmembrane protein and one of the best characterized two-component histidine kinases from E.coli. Besides the periplasmic receptor domain that is flanked by two transmembrane helices, it possesses a C-terminal 228-residue histidine kinase domain that is located in the cytoplasm6. Upon changes of extracellular osmolarity, envZ specifically phosphorylates its cognate response regulator ompR, which, in turn, regulates the Pompc 7.
With the two components just mentioned, cph8 can serve as a photoreceptor that regulates gene expression through Pompc. Without red light, cph1 is activated and it enables envZ-ompR to autophosphorylate which in turn activates Pompc. Under the exposure of red light, however, cph1 is deactivated, inhibiting the autophosphorylation, thus turning off gene expression. This mechanism is depicted in Figure 38 and the experimental data that support this mechanism is shown in Figure 4.
Design of Red promoter
We designed a new biobrick, Pred, to positively regulate gene expression using red light. Compared to the negative regulation provided by cph8, positive regulation is more direct and convenient to operate. In addition, cph8 relies on Pompc to express downstream gene, but our design relies on a stronger promoter, Plac, that can amplify gene expression, further making sure that the level of expression can meet our needs.
In the presence of red light, Pompc is shut down and lacI cannot be expressed to repress Plac. As a result, Plac is activated and all the downstream genes can be transcribed. In the absence of red light, whatsoever, Pompc is activated as autophosphorylation is allowed. LacI can be expressed to repress Plac and the genes downstream cannot be expressed, consequently. By using Pred, we can achieve positive control using red light.

Presenting Eugenie!
Today is our last day of summer research! We presented our work to the Wellesley community, and overall, we got a very positive reaction for our program. In particular, people appreciated the fact that they didn't have to program at all and the visual representation of synthetic biology parts. Additionally, the fact that the corresponding Eugene text highlights when a part is selected was highly appreciated. Overall, we've made a lot of progress over the past few weeks, and I'm very proud of where Eugenie is right now! I'm also going to miss working with our team so much. To the left I have a GIF created by Google+ of us walking to starbucks, which was one of several traditions this summer.

⇒ Access to room 3152 is crucial, and no means of entry currently exists. This will be imperative if we require ddH2O, an autoclave, LB stock, a normal scale, large glassware, or any number of other items.
⇒ Due to lack of access to 3152, protocols requiring sterile water cannot be tested. Sterile water exists in 3151A, but is 3 years past its expiration date.
⇒ No source of agarose or ethidium bromide has been found, so electrophoresis protocols cannot be tested. Interestingly, there exists plenty of loading dye.
⇒ Large amounts of stock compounds IE ethanol belong to the room and are not owned by us. Currently they are being used. This may cause problems, especially if we start using more expensive materials we still don't own.
On a side note, the contrast between the physical sign-in sheet in 3151 and the online form on ctools is rather confusing-it may be better to just use the online one, and have people log their hours individually.

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter4_-_-_TEXT.html," Though the wild TALE protein coding sequence is more than 2000bp in length which is relative hard to assembly, we conquered this task. At the same time, we constructed an expression carrier for the TALE protein with iGEM standard parts. We designed two carriers for the TALE protein, one with constitutive promoter and one with regulative promoter. In addition to that, our report system, a system aiming at testing the binding ability of the TALE proteins we produced was also finished in the last two weeks.
On the other hand, our human practice group spared no effort to design our logo and wiki. We are also making essential preparation for our trip to the States.
PLAN FOR FUTURE STEPS
1. Test the reliability of our report system.
2. Finish the construction of our express carrier (the regulatory part).
3. Assembly the TALE protein sequence after our optimization.
4. Work in the Human practice section.

Question: 1. the specific protocol about how to use Congo red to stain curli fibre?
2. we used to consider making the curli fibre ca rry the current at a magnitu de of 10-12 , but we lac k a proper ammeter to detect the current at such a magnitu de. What if we increase the current to a magnitu de of 10-6, woul d the curli fibre (as conducti ve wire) be burnt off? Could somebody have some suggestion on increasing the current?
3. Does somebody have some tips on Gibson assembl y? With many thanks!
It is rather a rough time for our team. On account of some neglects and faults in designing the reverse primer, we had to restart the assembly of the building blocks tragically. So, our project now is faced with much difficulty arranging the time and accomplishing them in time. Since there is no time left to tolerant more unnecessary faults, we are scheduling specific experimental plans in two parallel groups and going to make a contrast so that we can choose a more complete one. In addition, we are trying to find specific protocols in further inducible expression.
PLAN FOR FUTURE STEPS
1.arranging two groups to building the standard blocks in the meantime
2. trying a new assembly method gibson assembly to improve the efficiency.

On the right hand side: plot of the selected thermoswitch to use with His-Iga-Mstx. RNA thermometer termed sw_4 displayed no artifacts, with relatively high translation efficiency at high temperature and largely lower efficiency at < 25 C.
Thermoswitches were initially designed to appropriately melt and function at 37 C. Comparing the first curve in each plot which resembles the original sequence of our constructs without incorporated thermoswitch (control), it can be seen that novel designs show much stronger temperature dependence. However, they did not manage to achieve quite exact 37 C and displayed marginally lower translation efficiency than controls. Some sequences displayed artifacts that showed up as jumps in the efficiency plots. The believed reason was the usage of different SD sequences at low and high temperatures. For in vivo testing we selected designs that did not exhibit such jumps. Another interesting finding was that all thermoswitches designed for Iga protease bearing constructs showed a considerably lower efficiency of translation even at higher temperatures compared to OmpA bearing constructs, meaning that this characteristic was probably attributed to membrane protein structure and would be needed to be addressed in the future.
The model was also applied to check the activity of thermoswitches that we have acquired from literature (see Design and Results / RNA Thermoswitches ). Our model predicted fair, but viable switching effects for thermoswitch-GFP designs, which were later supported by in vivo measurements.
Fig. 5 Plots of translation efficiency vs. temperature of the “GJ” thermoswithes-GFP constructs. Thermoswitches GJ2, GJ3, GJ9, GJ10 display similarly fair translation efficiency at 37 C, except for GJ6, which displays notably higher translation efficiency. GJ thermoswitches significantly differ in their activity at lower temperatures, with GJ9 locking the transcription most tightly and GJ3 being the leakiest of all tested designs.
Model
A simple in-silico translation-initiation potential model5 to quantify the likelihood of in vitro translation of a given mRNA sequence from a series of interaction energy parameters at constant temperatures was developed. The model defines the translation-initiation potential σ as:

After eliminating contamination we noticed non-uniform coverage of the sequence               in the phage genome assemblies after re-aligning the reads to the assembly, which can be seen in Figure 3.
Figure 3: non-unform coverage of FFP sequence
In theory, we should observe uniform coverage over the full genome since there is no bias for read              template generation during sample preparation (due to random primers).
However, the first half of the sequence has a lower coverage than the remaining part and there is              a high-coverage region in the middle and end of the assembled genome.
Terminal repeats are common in phage genomes. Therefore, it can happen that double coverage within              the sequence occurs due to missassembly of the genome. As a result, initial and terminal residues              of the sequences are forcematched in the interim of the assembled sequence rather than at its edges.
We thus tried to use the other assembler, miniasm, which is known for very fast assemblies but little              error correction. However, this error correction can be achieved by combining miniasm with minimap for read mapping and racon for polishing the sequences.

These transitions are important for the activation of dioxygen and thus methane hydroxylation [4,5]. The genes for the subunits are arranged in a 5,5-kb operon which additionally contains another open reading frame formerly designated orfY and later mmoD. MMOD binds to the hydroxylase in a similar fashion as MMOB and MMOR, yet the function has long stayed unclear [6]. It has been suggested, however, to be part of the above-mentioned 'copper switch' regulating the expressions of sMMO and pMMO, respectively [7].

Machine Learning in Synthetic Biology
While we built our Machine Learning based software tool, it dawned on us the kind of impact machine learning could have on synthetic biology and the data in the registry of biological part. Ever since the inception of iGEM ,the registry been accumulating charechterisation data about different parts and now we are at a point in history where we can use powerful machine learning based tools and leverage the data available in the registry and other biological databases to  build tools that can make powerflul inferences or aid synthetic biologists in their lab.
Some of the safety measures that we follow are listed below :
The registry of standard biological parts has been growing with large amounts of data every year, which has led to an abundance of certain types of parts (promoters, RBSs, chromoproteins, quorum sensing modules etc.): (Y/N)
If a new part is being added to the Registry, say a new promoter and if the registry has enough data about promoters to build a machine learning routine that is capable of characterizing the promoter without the need for tedious experiments in the lab, with what level of alacrity would you accept such a tool?
In the future, about 10 years from now, when the data available in the Registry has increased exponentially leading to teams developing highly reliable tools that can characterize newly added parts based on training a machine learning tool on existing parts, do you think iGEM/the registry should make such routines available through the registry as a reliable source of characterizing newly added parts? Also if you think they should, let us know about what kind of an impact this would have on the iGEM community.

Postcards Delivered to HHU Düsseldorf iGEM
On June 22nd, we had a Skype call with Dusseldorf iGEM because their project was very similar to ours. They were trying to establish a co-culture of S. elongatus , E. coli , and S. cerevisiae . Due to our shared goal, we exchanged a variety of information from culturing conditions to genetic assembly methods. We also sent a few articles that discussed co-culture that we found helpful for our project, and extensively discussed it with Dusseldorf iGEM.
In addition to the similarity between our projects, we were also both honored to receive an Opentrons OT-2 robot from Opentrons. Unfortunately, at the time of discussion, they have not yet received their Opentrons robot, so we wholeheartedly offered to run any protocols on the Opentrons that they wanted to test out. In return, they offered to let us try out a cyanobacteria gene circuit in their co-culture apparatus. However, due to time constraints and the extensive shipping process, we could not prepare and ship the gene circuit to Dusseldorf.
Furthermore, we were incredibly excited to collaborate with HHU Dusseldorf in their mission to send postcards to bolster public awareness of synthetic biology and allow teams to introduce themselves and their projects before the Giant Jamboree. We designed our postcard to have gumballs (as we are The Sucrose Factory) and described our project briefly on the back. After we shipped one hundred postcards, we received a stack of post"

IISc-Bangalore,2017,Team:IISc-Bangalore#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," which is achieved after an infinitely long span of time. This was the first insight that made it clear that to make any efficient use of a gas vesicle's buoyant properties, a strategy was required that would increase the \(R_H\) considerably and would allow them to float better.
Numerical Solutions
A numerical solution requires intelligent initial and boundary condition choices to yield reasonable results. Computational tools[6] were used to solve the above equation with different conditions to see how the distribution changes over time. Some plausible boundary conditions and their qualitative solutions are given in the illustrations section of our model.
Note that these examples are only qualitative and only give a flavor of how the concentration profiles evolve over time. All the parameters in the primary differential equation have been set to unity to obtain the plots. We wish to show how these plots can be used to find the functional forms of the OD vs time curves that are obtained in the spectrophotometry assay for gas vesicles.
Illustrations: Qualitative solutions to the model
Illustration 2: Uniform initial profile with exponential boundary conditions.
Assuming the initial mixing is uniform, this is the most natural way in which we expect the concentration function to evolve on the boundaries. The exact initial and boundary conditions are taken such that they satisfy each other nicely. The contour plot below shows how the profile evolves over time. The legend on the right shows the relative magnitude of concentrations present in the plot.
Figure: Uniform intial profile with exponential saturation at boundaries
Figure: Time evolution of the concentration function (Illustration 2)
Illustration 3: Exponential initial profile with exponential boundary conditions.
Such a situation can arise in the event the particles have settled down due to gravity initially but start floating instantaneously at t=0. While quite unrealistic, this solution might be useful in cases where the gas vesicles have been reversibly denatured but are allowed to float up after removing the denaturing agent. The plot below shows how the profile evolves over time.
Figure: Exponential intial profile with exponential saturation at boundaries
Figure: Time evolution of the concentration function (Illustration 3)
Illustration 4: Linear initial profile with exponential boundary conditions.
This is the most unlikely of the three cases we've dealth with till now. An linear initial profile is almost impossible under normal conditions unless some kind of external agency maintains it. Even then, we've tried to solve the equations to show how the concentrations will evolve for such a case.

The infectious dose depends on gastric acidity (the lower the acidity, the fewer vibrios required to cause infection)[6]
1.4 Physiopathology & Virulence
Cholera is a very virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhea. The bacillus can be found in patient’s stools for 1 to 10 days after infection (106 to 108 bacillus/mL [3], [5])  and is disposed of in the environment where it can potentially infect other people. An untreated choleric person would produce 10 - 20 liters of diarrhea a day [7]. The cholera toxin (CTX) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits responsible to the symptoms. Once inside the cell, the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein :  Arf6 [8]. This bound exposes its active site, allowing it to ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of G protein. This results in constant cAMP production, which leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration.
A healthy human feces contains 1012 bacterias per grams, more than 400 different species can be found [3]. V.Cholera is more in patient’s feces than other bacterias [3] [9].
The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V.Cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V.Cholerae carry a variant of a bacteriophage called CTXφ[10].

2. DNA Extraction
In order to obtain the target, the vibrio DNA must be extracted.
2.1 Laboratory extraction
Nowadays, DNA preparations are widely used because of their easy using. A lot of suppliers proposes kits (NEB, QIAGEN…). Kits allow to extract 50 ug to 10 mg of DNA thanks to different protocols/materials (Miniprep, Midiprep, Maxiprep, Megaprep and Gigaprep [11]) and different kind of polyn"

When this is done, the TiO2 layer is dipped in freshly prepared hibiscus tea and the now colored FTO is blow-dried again.
The conducting site of the second FTO is shaded with graphite using a pencil.
A few drops of the I2/KI electrolyte are added onto the TiO2 layer of the first FTO. Now both FTOs are combined so that both conductive sides, i.e. the TiO2 layer and the graphite, touch each other. Furthermore, both FTOs need to have a small shift to the shorter side so that they can be connected to a multimeter. This whole setup is secured using two clips.
Finally, the DSSC is connected to a multimeter by attaching the cables and alligator clips on the offset of the FTOs. During irradiation with sunlight or a lamp, current and voltage can be measured.
“Do-it-yourself Solar Cells LAUF –
At the summer festival on July 23th of the CJT high school, students of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg invite everyone to a do-it-yourself solar cells workshop. The iGEM Team of the University (“international Genetically Engineered Machine”) wants to build solar cells from toothpaste and tea together with all visitors. This event is a part of the team's project for the iGEM competition. iGEM offers an international platform for college and high school projects in the area of synthetic biology. Next to lab work, maintaining public relations is mandatory to inform  people of all ages about the various aspects of genetic engineering. The workshop experiments will take place once at 10 am and once at 1 pm.”
As the pictures show, our littlest visitors had a lot of fun and were very interested in creating something new with their own hands. Of course, the competition “Who has the best solar cell?” spurred the children on.  The parents were also excited to make solar cells out of everyday articles such as tea and toothpaste and even wanted to know the chemical reactions behind these special photovoltaic cells.

All in all, it was a fantastic experience and we found it very inspiring to look on the concentrated yet fascinated happy faces! During our next visit to the CJT high school in October, we invited students and their families to a public discussion"

Synthetic biology with S. thermophilus
Escherichia coli is a commonly used chassis microorganism in synthetic biology because there is a wide range of information available regarding its characteristics and well-defined experimental protocols.  Our ultimate aim was to improve the understanding of one of the lactic acid bacteria required in yogurt production: Streptococcus thermophilus. S. thermophilus could be incredibly useful in synthetic biology, specifically in creating yogurt with increased production of different macromolecules – this is an application where E. coli would not be suitable.
Although there are other bacteria present in yogurt (most importantly, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), we chose to use S. thermophilus because it is a naturally competent organism: certain strains of S. thermophilus are highly transformable – for example, the strain we used (LMD-9) has been shown to yield up to 106 transformants per ml of culture [1] . Competence can also be induced through adding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (ComS) in strains that are not as easily transformed [2] This takes advantage of the ComRS system, whereby ComS associates with the Rgg-like regulator ComR in order to induce the transcription of comX. ComX encodes the sigma factor σX, which upregulates genes which are required for DNA transformation [2] . A protocol for transformation using ComS can be found on our protocols page .

We tried 2 different methods.
- Dilute 1g of starch into 100mL of agar and try to dilute it and boil it to sterilize. The problem is that it is very difficult to dilute...
- The second method seem to be better. We diluted 1g of starch into 100mL of Soft Agar (it dilutes very well). Then plate blank agar plate (LA) and then add a thin layer of SA ith 1% of starch. Poke the plates.
- We plated IAI+ECE112, IA751+ECE112 and also IA751 and 1A1 for control.

Week eight was a rather successful one. The pH-project finally showed first results - we more or less finished cloning our constructs -  and we were able to start planning the experiments for the pH-dependent expression of fluorescence protein. Additionally, we pretty much finished our work on the temperature-inducible expression of GFP with the heat shock promoter ibpA. On another front, a valuable team member left us for his semester abroad in South Korea. Starting this week, he will be performing mainly assignments that can be done over the internet.

Expression of the pH-construct posed some major challenges. First of all, buffering capacity of the M9 media made it difficult to change the pH-values in the bacterial cultures accordingly. Somehow a solution for our problems with pH-dependent expression must be found. For that reason we had a never ending meeting until late at night,  which was very challenging, but in the end we managed to find a solution.  To make lab-work more fun again, we started drawing with E. coli on agar-plates harboring differently colored fluorescent proteins. Additionally, we filmed a video describing our project to be able to start a crowdfunding campaign.

UnaG
UnaG is a fluorescent protein that was recently discovered in eel muscle (Anguilla japonica). Its small size and ability to work under hypoxic conditions make it stand out from other fluorescent proteins like GFP. These special abilities and the fact that it is a new discovered protein inspired us to work with UnaG.

Go Green - Go UnaG!
As part of this iGEM project, research has been done on the newly discovered green fluorescent protein called UnaG. This protein is interesting firstly because it is about half the size of other fluorescent proteins that are being used today, making it suitable as a fusion protein. Secondly, it fluoresces only when a bilirubin molecule is bound non-covalently to the protein. This feature could make UnaG suitable as an inducible marker by the addition and removal of bilirubin to cells. Moreover, unlike all other fluorescent proteins of today, UnaG does not need molecular oxygen in order to fluoresce, meaning that it can be used as a marker protein in research under hypoxic conditions. These cool features, alongside the fact that it is always exciting to work with new discoveries, made us want to add this protein to the iGEM toolbox! During the summer we created three different UnaG biobricks; one with a hexahistidine tag  suitable for affinity chromatography, one with the hexahistidine tag and a flexible linker of six amino acids suitable for fusing to other proteins, and lastly one biobrick with only the flexible linker attached to UnaG.
UnaG - A Fluorescent Member of the FABP Family
UnaG was discovered as late as 2013. It originates from the muscle fibers of the Japanese Unagi eel Anguilla japonica. This is the first fluorescent protein to be found in a vertebrate species, giving it a range of biochemical properties that differs from proteins found in the original FP family - one of the most astounding ones"
Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," open (homogenisation) or exogenous feeding. Both options had pros and cons associated with them. Homogenisation would allow the fatty acids and the enzymes to come in to direct contact with each other very easily in vitro. Whilst this would appear to be a very simple way of producing the required fatty acids, there is of course the problem that the cells would be killed and therefore unable to produce any more product in the long run. This would be a major inconvenience for industry, which would want sustained production over time. Therefore feeding the bacteria exogenously would be a more viable option of long-term production. This has its own set of problems, however. The primary concern is that passive diffusion of long-chain fatty acids is very slow and therefore could be rate limiting. This said, it would cause less metabolic stress on the cells and in the long run return a higher yield per cell.

Improvement of existing BioBrick
Our biobrick BBa_K1027002 (delta 12 desaturase) is an improvement of the BBa_K925000 biobrick created by the St Andrews team in 2012. We improved this biobrick from the ground up, starting by taking the protein sequence from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This protein sequence was reverse translated and then codon optimised for expression in E. coli. We believe our redesigned biobrick has two features that the original biobrick does not. Firstly, the original biobrick could not be transformed by iGEM HQ, whereas we have managed successful transformation (as shown by the plate pictures). Next, the St. Andrews biobrick was cloned from cyanobacteria, and so is not optimised for expression in E. coli. As St. Andrews then went on to express their delta 12 desaturase biobrick in E. coli it follows that a sequence optimised for expression in this chassis, as ours was, would perform better than the sequence naturally found in cyanobacteria.
Orbitrap LC-MS analysis
Delta 9 desaturase and delta 12 desaturase enzymes were chosen because their products, when expressed in their host organism (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803), convert stearic acid into oleic acid, and oleic acid into linoleic acid respectively. Therefore, we fed batches of transformed DH5-alpha with 2 different concentrations of exogenous fatty acid (0.1% and 0.5% stearic acid fed to the delta 9 desaturase batch,"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and one to C3, the possible matchings are (T1,T2)->(C1, C2"

Customization of the Plug 'n' Play with DNA assembly standard opens the door to a wide range of applications.
When do you need to customize the system?
When a desired biological part is not yet a part of the Plug'n'Play with DNA kit.
When seamless assembly is required (e.g. protein fusion).
When the introduction of mutations are required.
When the introduction of deletions are required.
When short sequences such as linkers, RBSs, signal peptides etc. are required.
A guide for the most common design requests is given below. The guide is based on work conducted by Morten H. H. Nørholm and Hansen et. al. Figures obtained from Genee et al. (in preparation).
Creating new parts
Creating new biological parts can be necessary, when they are not already included in the Plug 'n' Play kit and submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
1. To create a new part, forward and reverse primers have to be designed for the DNA of interest. The free-ware netprimer is an excellent tool for finding suitable primers.
2. In accordance with the Plug’n’Play assembly system the category of the part i.e. promoter, GOI, TS, module, or marker cassette has to be determined.
3. Subsequently the linkers belonging to the category have to be identified. The appropriate linkers and Plug'n'Play tail for the part can be found in the linker table . The forward and reverse primer linkers are 8-9 bp long, and are placed at the 5’-end of the primers.
5. Order the primers from your favourite oligo company. Notice"

Did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? Each student on our team has gone through basic laboratory safety courses put on by the Risk Management Services. The basic laboratory safety served to cover topics such as the Workplace Hazardous Material Information System (WHMIS), biohazards, hazardous chemicals, and radioactive materials. Graduate student advisors and other researchers have all received in-depth safety training in biological and chemical safety and trained and directly supervised iGEM members during project experiments. The team also established general safe protocols . D. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? The Canadian government has 2 bodies which overlook each biosafety committee at Canadian universities. The first is the Public Health Agency of Canada . They published the “Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines” – a booklet that outlines all the rules which biological labs must follow. The second group is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency which mostly deals with plants and animals. Additionally, should we ever choose to commercialize and release a product, it would be into controlled reactor vessels of oil refineries.  Even though the microorganisms are not directly released into the environment, we would have to go through numerous other agencies in Canada – most notably Environment Canada . It is only after strict screening and investigation that such a product would be allowed to be used commercially outside of laboratories.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? Biosafety is a major aspect of our project this year.  We are focusing on two ways to limit safety risks posed by released organisms: 1) Distributed pathways -- By taking a single pathway and distributing the necessary pieces among various members of a microbial consortia, the possibility of the entire pathway being transferred to wild organisms drastically decreases. 2) Effective kill switches -- The use of tested and effective kill switch mechanisms will control engineered organisms that are introduced to the environment.  Through the standardized evaluation of kill-switch efficacy, will aid iGEM teams in choosing the best system for their project.  Such an evaluation will be made possible by the protocol that is designed and tested as a result of the collaboration between the 2012 University of Calgary and University of British Columbia teams.

Wet-lab Validation
Overview
After we finished the software, we decided to carry out an alpha test which involves the main functions of our software. Therefore we designed a circuit and build it up in a vector with the help of our software. Expression data are measured and can be used to validate and calibrate the software. Here we show the whole detailed process of the experiment.

Experimental data
After the sequencing confirmation, we collected the data every hour for ten hours and the fluorescence and OD600 of the liquid cultures were measured using a plate reader. At the beginning, we used tetracycline which inhibits TetR repression. Chart.1, Chart.2 and Figure.1 Show the fluorescence and OD600 data
Discussion
Why we did not use the sunlight sensor as our input source anymore?
Before further experiment, we needed to ensure all the parts that we would use were in order so that we conducted a PCR for all the parts that we used after the propagation of the plasmid by transforming them which are in 2015 distribution"

THE AGEING GUT
Lycopene Probiotic
Lycopene is an antioxidant naturally occuring in tomatoes, giving them their rich red colour. This antioxidant is also known to be lacking in the elderly population, meaning there are higher levels of unregulated oxidative stress. This BioBrick is induced by oxidative stress and produces lycopene as means to 'mop up' the oxidative stress in the environment, in the form of a probiotic.

Principle Investigators
Prof Dr. Matias Zurbriggen (Institute for Synthetic Biology, HHU), our primary PI, who supported our team in getting started this year and helped us find a suitable and realizable topic. Furthermore, he provided us with theoretical knowledge and valuable input regarding our project during weekly meetings with our three team representatives. He also provided us with chemicals and consumables, whenever something was missing in our lab.
Prof. Dr. Gunther Döhlemann (Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, UzK), one of our secondary PIs, who provided our team in Cologne with a lab to work in as well as equipment and consumables. Furthermore, we would like to thank all members of the institute for their assistance with experiments.
Prof. Dr. Andreas Weber (Institute for Plant Biochemistry, HHU), our secondary PI from Duesseldorf. For the second time he was a great mentor and contact person for many aspects of our project. He played a big role in helping us find our topic, supported us with valuable theoretical knowledge as well as organizational issues, especially regarding the planning and implementation of our SynBio conference.
Organization
Dr. Martin Mauve (Dean, HHU) for providing our team with a common room to work in. Furthermore he approved a generous financial grant from the Heinrich Heine University.
Brigitte Haumann (CEPLAS, HHU) for being our team’s guardian angel. She helped us with the entire organization of the project outside of lab, including fundraising and financial administration, registration, booking flights (and amending the booking multiple times) and a lot more. Most of all we would like to thank her for her moral support and her undying iGEM spirit.
Dr. Stefanie Zeretzke ("
Lethbridge,2015,Team:Lethbridge#Practices Current_-_-_TEXT.html," representation of what to expect post-release. Upon government approval, the predator is released into the ecosystem. Potential downfalls of biological pest control include predatory species becoming an alpha predator in the food chain, or becoming an invasive species itself [7].
Mechanical Pest Control
Mechanical pest control involves the use of physical means to control pests. Some examples of mechanical pest control methods include insect traps, physical barriers, or weed pulling. These control mechanisms are advantageous in terms of minimizing off-target effects, and are generally environmentally friendly. However, these methods can be laborious and are often not feasible for implementation on commercial crops. Recent research has aimed to decrease the amount of labor required to pull weeds from commercial crops by using computer vision-guided machines [8]. Initial results with computer guided machines has shown promising results, producing weed reductions in the range of 62-87%. However, this research requires more development in order to be mainstream in commercial agriculture.
Crop Rotation
Crop rotation is an agricultural method in which different species of crops are grown in the same area of land to promote nutrient renewal within the soil. In addition, crop rotation aids in crop yield, soil quality, and controls the build-up of weeds, pests, and other diseases that might be specific to the crop.                      However, crop rotation can limit the variety of crops a farmer is able to grow in their field due to specific rotation patterns. Each season, these crops need to be monitored in order to control the likelihood of diseases being carried over to the next crop. This may be limiting for farmers because of the constraints associated with which crops they are able to plant and at what time they can be planted. In addition, certain crops require specific machinery which may be expensive for farmers [9].
An example of an important crop produced throughout the world is canola. It is used to make canola oil which is a key ingredient in many foods, cosmetics, and biodiesels. When canola crops are rotated with barley, oats, or wheat, the lowest number of diseases carry over from the previous crop which in turn increases yields of the canola crop. Most other crops such as corn, flax, potato, and sunflower require wait times of up to three years before they can be planted to prevent a buildup of diseases common to both the respective plant and canola [10].
Crop Burning
Another method of pest control involves crop burning, which is the process of setting fire to crop residues after harvest seasons to clear large areas of land. Remaining pests on particular crops are killed in order to prepare the soil for the following season. Crop burning is considered a quick and easy method for"

Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Policy#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," mesmo que sutis? Se sim, diria que isso pode ocorrer de forma inconsciente? Existe e acho que pode acontecer de forma inconsciente. No meu caso, quando vou procurar alguma escola para ministrar aulas, sinto que há preconceito. Dentro da sala de aula também há, porque já sofri preconceito quando um aluno disse que eu não tinha base para ensinar física, por ser mulher. Tenho amigas que sofreram preconceito na parte administrativa de escolas; elas formaram-se em Licenciatura em Ciências Exatas com Habilitação em Física, mas não foram contratadas porque eram mulheres. Would you say there is any kind of gender segregation or discrimination, even if it is subtle? If yes, would you say happens unconsciously?
There is and I believe it occurs unconsciously. In my case, when I search for a school to teach, I feel there is prejudice. Inside the classroom it also exists, because I have suffered prejudice when a student said I was not fit to teach physics because I am a woman. I have friends that have also suffered from it in school’s administrative area. They graduated in Exact Sciences with habilitation in Physics, but were not hired because they were women. Uma carreira acadêmica, contando com graduação, mestrado e doutorado, muitas vezes passa a se estabilizar apenas aos 30 anos. Como você vê o impacto disso pra você? É diferente dependendo do gênero? Às vezes conseguimos fazer os níveis do ensino superior sem interrompê-los. Não sei se há muita diferença entre os dois gêneros. An academic career, with graduation, master and doctorate, most of the time stabilizes at 30 years old. How does it impact you? Does it depend on the gender?
Sometimes we can do graduation and post-graduation without stopping them. I do not know if there is much difference between genders.
Letícia, você engravidou durante o segundo ano de graduação. Como você conciliou a gravidez e os estudos? A minha filha nasceu no começo do terceiro ano da graduação.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html,"
In spring of this year a producer of robots for pipetting automatization, Opentrons, announced an event, where iGEM teams from around the globe would get a chance to win one of 10 free OT-2 robots. The condition was sending an abstract of our project and arguing how exactly our team would benefit from this addition. We sent our freshly written scientific abstract and we were among the 10 winners out of the 77 teams who had applied. We were more than happy to get our hands on an OT-2 and very thankful to Opentrons for giving us such an amazing opportunity!
We also had the great honor to personally skype with one of the Opentrons and iGEM Measurement Committee members and this year’s judge, Kristin Ellis. She was very kind and offered us help with anything we might need in the next few months. In addition to that we were invited to subscribe to the Opentrons forum and stay in touch not only with other iGEM teams who won the same robot, but also with the Opentrons community.
Working with Teams
TecCEM
iGEM TecCEM wants to bring joy to the world and simultaneously educate the public by making a cover song of “Girls like you” and “Moves like Jagger” from Maroon Five with funny lyrics about science and the iGEM competition. We are glad to be a part of this very cool project!
OUC China
A great way to educate kids is through pictures and stories. Since we knew about OUC China’s idea to create a comic book about synthetic biology we were on fire to help translating everything into German and Italian. The final comic book is really cute and explains the basics of synthetic biology in an easily understandable and educational way.
Stony Brook
Since we use the same organism S. elongatus it was easy for us to exchange our knowledge in a Skype interview. The iGEM team of Stony Brook sent us helpful papers and we gave them some insight into our work with cyanobacteria.
Bielefeld-CeBiTec
In order to further educate ourselves on topics regarding dual use, some of our members went to Bielefeld on July 11 to listen to a panel discussion on the topic ""Dual Use Research of Concern"" organized by the iGEM Team Bielefeld and the Biotechnologische Studenteninitiative (btS) e. V. Bielefeld.
Dual use is defined as technology or equipment designed or suitable for both civilian and military purposes. It refers to research or knowledge that is done for the benefit of the society"

B. Reduce the Possibility of Complement System Activation via Ail protein and Polysialic Acid (PSA).
The Ail protein from Yersinia enterocolitica has been proven to confer E.coli HB101 with resistance to complement killing in human serum. We aim to incorporate this protein into our minicells to prevent complement deposition, which will consequently: 1) increase minicells’ longevity in circulation and 2) reduce inflammation.
We have also explored the possibility of encapsulating our chassis with polysialic acid (PSA), surface structures that are typically associated with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in mammalian cells. Scavenged or synthesized de novo by certain types of bacteria, PSA reduces complement deposition as well as antibody opsonization. [4] This, too, will lengthen our minicell’s circulation time and reduce the risks of inflammation.
All three of these precautions (lpxM, Ail, PSA) will further enhance the innate safety and effectiveness of our minicells by prolonging their circulation time and preventing an adverse immune response.

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Finance_-_-_TEXT.html," over 500 sampling sites mandated to be monitored for their water quality in the province of Alberta.  Each one of these monitoring sites are required to take a variable number of samples at different locations around the sites as well as a variable number of periods throughout the year.  By estimating the potential number of sites that could use our technology, our group estimates that the total market potential of our general toxin sensor is $7.5 Million annually.  If our technology could displace 30% of this market, their is the potential of producing a $2.25 Million annual revenue for our general toxin sensor alone.
Cost To Develop Our Product
From our manufacturing analysis which was done in collaboration with provincial government programs, we were able to determine the potential cost of developing our prototype into an actual product. From this analysis we have been able to predict that our prototype development will take approximately 1 year at a cost of ~$250,000.  A single cartridge for the detection of toxins in a water sample could cost approximately $4.10 and the detector could cost approximately $251.00. The sales price of our cartridges and detector systems were set at $100 and $5,000 respectively to be competitive and more cost effective than other products presently used in this market. Being almost 20x below our sale price, these numbers appear reasonable to obtain profitability and were used in determining our profitability in the market (see below).
Financial Barriers To Market
Numerous hurdles exist in being able to bring this technology to market, the largest of which being the necessary regulatory assessment hurdles needed to for our technology to be used as a standard (a single EPA application could cost as much as $350,000 posing a critical issue in developing our company).  In addition, marketing will be a critical aspect to ensure that the market adopts our technology.  Government endorsement, and industry backing from end-users will aid in this development.  A summary of the findings of major barriers to entry into the market is below:
Technology Development (Biological, Engineering, Hardware, Software)
Prototype Development - Bench Scale and Up-Scale
Regulatory Approval (EPA, Health Canada, Environment Canada, etc.)
Marketing
IP Protection
Team Selection, Attracting and Retaining Talent
Overhead and Expenses
Below is a breakdown of the expected expenses of the business for the years of 2014-2016, dictating the amount of capital that will be required in order to achieve our goals.  This was also inspired by our milestones timeline whereby we expect to have a product ready for the market by 2016.

Sequencing displays that the detector is definitely able to bind to the target (perfect alignment with the target sequence for samples D, E and F).
Two reasons explain the presence of false positive colonies (in plate A: no target). The first is the one that was expected, i.e. the probe was badly digested, explaining that it could not receive the target but was transformed and read anyway, because the detector was still circular (sample A). The second reason comes from the previous step: the probe insertion.
During the screening (Figure 13), two colonies have probably been mistakenly selected. One having the vector with the insert and the other corresponding to a vector without insert. (B and C samples)
2.3.3 Evaluation of sensitivity and specificity
An important aspect in diagnosis is the estimation of sensitivity and specificity. These two parameters estimate the capacity of a system to deliver a result with low false positive cases (positive result while the patient is not ill) and low false negative cases (negative result while the individual is actually sick).
Sensitivity
Sensitivity measures the limit of detection of our test. Here, this is defined by the lowest detectable amount of Vibrio cholerae that the system can detect to confirm presence of the pathogen. To estimate sensitivity, the target amount was gradually reduced,  while the detector amount was kept constant. The first attempt displayed satisfying results with 100 ng of target and 100 ng of probe. From that data, the target amount was divided per two four times.

Once detected by the parasite these stimuli lead to signal-dependent breakdown of inositol phospholipids which is directly linked to activation of protein kinase C (via elevated diacylglycerol level) and mobilization of calcium (via elevated levels of inositol triphosphate) which in turn evokes subsequent cellular response (Matsumura et al. 1991) such as the release of enzymes from a specialized gland - called acetabular gland complex – at the posterior region of the head of the parasite (Fishelson et al. 1992) .
These enzymes include  number of proteases that target proteins in the host's skin such as keratin and elastin the latter of which is cleaved by the most essential and abundant protease called schistosomal elastase, which we use in our iGEM project to detect Schistosoma. This process allows cercaria to burrow through the skin of their new host, where they leave their tail behind, into blood vessels.
There are six species of Schistosoma known to successfully infect humans: Schistosoma mansoni , which uses Biomphalaria snails as intermediate host and can cause intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis in Africa, the Arabian peninsula as well as South America; S. japonicum, a zoonotic parasite, which uses Oncomelania snails as intermediate host and can cause intestinal and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, especially in South-East Asia; S. mekongi, S. intercalatum and related S. guineansis ,which are restricted to small areas an only of local importance;  as well as S. haematobium, transmitted by Bulinus snails, which can give rise to urinary schistosomiasis in Africa and the Arabian peninsula
Map of the distribution and spread of Schistosoma species. (Gryseels et al. 2006)
Additionally there is number of avian Schistosoma species, especially in Northern Europe, the USA and Canada that cannot infect humans but will still try to enter our skin giving rise to the harmless but unpleasant condition called swimmer's itch. However these conditions, like cercarial dermatitis often go unnoticed in endemic areas.

Gibson assembly
Gibson assembly is a useful DNA ligation method that offers an alternative to the classical approach of using restriction enzymes. The procedure was was developed in 2009 by Gibson et al [1] and was introduced to the iGEM competition by the Cambridge 2010 team .
We successfully used Gibson assembly for our plasmid assemblies, allowing us to put different genes in our plasmid backbones. You can find our protocol in our Notebook, under ""Protocols"" section.

Principle
Gibson assembly relies on the activity of 3 different enzymes:
T5 exonuclease
Phusion polymerase
Taq ligase
In order to perform Gibson assembly on two DNA sequences, these sequences need to overlap by at least 20bp at the edge. You can easily add these overlaps by extension PCR.
Combined together, these 3 enzymes allow overlapping DNA sequences (sequences A and B) to be ligated together in a single and isothermal reaction. First, the T5 exonuclease chews up bases at the 5' end on each strand, creating single-strands on the edges. Due to the sequence overlap, the single strand from A will anneal with the single strand from B. Then, the Phusion polymerase extends the DNA sequence from the 3' of the AB overlap. Finally, when there all the gaps have been filled by the polymerase, the Taq ligase ties up the A and B fragments.
Step-by-step
Preparing the parts: For every pair of parts that you want to asemble, you need to add 20bp overhang with the other part (see illustration below). This implies running a PCR with primers that contain the overhang on their 5' end. After the PCR, you can purify your reaction products with a PCR purification kit"

Adh (alcohol dehydrogenase), the fifth required protein, was not available as a BioBrick but because of Escherichia coli 's own AdhE the pathway works. ( Atsumi et al., 2008 )
Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the isobutanol pathway ( Atsumi et al., 2008 )
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of module III - the production of isobutanol. 3-phosphoglycerate from the CO2 fixation is converted to pyruvate in the glycolysis. In the implemented pathway pyruvate is then converted to isobutanol ( Atsumi et al., 2008 )
The product synthesis can be changed through the modularity of BioBricks, so that variable high value products derived from pyruvate can be implemented in the future.
Isobutanol
Isobutanol is an amino-acid-based alcohol and consequently an organic substance.
Figure 3: Chemical structure of isobutanol.
It can be produced by the 2-keto-acid, or Ehrlich, pathway. In this pathway 2-ketoisovalerate is first decarboxylated into isobutyraldehyde by the keto-acid decarboxylase and then reduced to an alcohol by an alcohol dehydrogenase. Keto-acids are immediate amino-acid precursors. By using this enzymatic conversion amino-acid-based alcohols can be produced in E. coli. These alcohols include n-butanol, n-propanol and isobutanol. Although the energy contents of isobutanol and n-butanol are similar, isobutanol is the closest to industrial use. Isobutanol has a better octane number because it is a branched-chain alcohol in comparison to straight-chain alcohols like ethanol. This indicates that isobutanol could be a possible alternative to ethanol as a fuel additive. In contrast to ethanol, the traditional biofuel respectively biofuel supplement, isobutanol as a higher alcohol has a lower hygroscopicity. Implementation of these characteristics in one of our application scenarios . ( Atsumi et al., 2008 ; Peralta-Yahya et al., 2012 )
