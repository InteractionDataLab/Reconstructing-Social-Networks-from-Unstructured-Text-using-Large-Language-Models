The C Project
Although we do software, we also keep eyes on promotion of synthetic biology and sharing our own program. Therefore, we started a long term human practice, “the C project”, since this summer.“the C project”, as we call, consists of three parts: Curriculum, Communication and Community.
Curriculum
As a IGEM team, we try to let people as many as possible to know what synthetic biology is. Therefore, advisors of our team, Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, have established a set of synthesis biology curriculum this summer. We have done many works related to human practice on the curriculum.
Jiong Hong(in the right picture), advisor of our team, gave lectures introducing safety and ethnics issues of synthetic biology.
Luojun Wang(in the head picture), members of our team, gave lectures promoting iGAME.
A survey* on how students know about synthetic biology and their interests for tutor game was made.(*the survey statistics comes from a sample of 240 students. Numbers of undergraduates, masters and PhDs are 160, 60 and 20)
Analysis of the results of the survey The first chart shows students' favorite game types for iGAME, and the second chart shows their knowledge of IGEM project.
The Circos Map
We tried many methods to plot our survey more straightforwardly and clearly before we finally chose Circos mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos . Circos is biological software used to plot genome elements and relationship. Here, we innovatively used Circos to demonstrate our survey.(as in the right picture) Circos is somehow like pie chart yet it can present multi information as all the statistics are proportional and clear on the graph.
In the graph, there are three circles. The inner circle stands for their knowledge of synthetic biology, and middle circle stands for their interests of iGame. Deeper the color"

2D Detection of IPTG and HSL
The method of the chip production was developed by this year's iGEM Team Aachen with Anna as driving force and person in charge. A lot of parameters were tested and the final protocol for the production of the sensor chips the way there were used for detection in the project is published below.
Chip Production
Cell Preparation
over night culture of sensor cells (50 ml in a 250 ml flask with) max. 16 h
centrifuge all 50 ml by 3000 g for 10 min at RT (21°C).
discard the supernatant
re-suspend the pellet in 1 mL tempered (~21°C) LB-medium.
Agar Preparation
autoclave 50 ml medium with 1.5%(w/v) agarose (has to be multiplied with the number of chips prepared).
cool it down to 45°C in a water bath.
Chip Preparation
mix the cooled medium with the cells by inverting gently.
pour it in the chip mold, avoiding bubble formation (!).
wait for approximately 20 min until the agar has solidified.
cut out the chips with a scalpel.
put two chips into a labeled petri dish and store additional 4 chips in labeled petri dishs in the refrigerator.
incubate two chips for 1 h at 37°C prior to induction.
Sensor-chip manufacturing
Scheme illustrating the work flow during chip production. For the production steps see above.

I had the opportunity to work with Laura, who was very helpful in explaining the scripts we were running. Tom was also able to send me information on python and unix commands, so navigating through these programs was easier than expected. I’ve worked on and off with MATLAB, but I actually found python and gams to be a lot more user friendly.

Biomass and ATP calculations
J_exp2
Once I generated my input files using a python code provided to me (I only had to personalize my directory information), I was able to run FBA scripts for both the WM1788 wild type and nitrogen fixation models. I was able to determine maximum biomass values for both, as well as maximum ATP values from these biomass outputs. For the WM1788 wild type model, I got a maximum biomass value of 2.97 and a maximum ATP production value of 547.03. For the WM1788 nitrogen fixation model I got a maximum biomass value of 2.52 and a maximum ATP production value of 391.274. These values checked with Laura’s. From there, I ran FVA on both  the wild type and nitrogen fixation models, and generated spreadsheets for flux data on each reaction in the model.

The Galactose Pathway
J_exp3
On Wednesday, I started to look at the pathway taken by galactose as it enters the cell, thereafter initiating glycolysis. Given our model predicted higher cell growth rates for galactose as a sole energy source than for glucose, which contradicts most available literature, we were trying to determine if there were any reactions that would help explain this phenomena (for example if there is a reaction supplying additional energy in the galactose model). However, even though I was able to identify the series of reactions the take place immediately following the uptake of galactose, which include converting alpha D­galactose to beta D­galactose, and elementary reactions depending on enzymes such as 4­epimerase and galactokinase, a greater amount of energy was required to initiate"

Assessing Endotoxin Levels
Msb-B Knockouts Reduce Endotoxin Levels By 49-Fold
Endotoxins are pyrogens deriving from gram-negative bacteria. Their removal from any pharmaceutical product is mandatory. Therefore, we engineered an E. coli strain lacking lipid A, a major endotoxin component and used this bacterium to produce our cell extract. To evaluate endotoxin content of different cell extracts, a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL)-test was performed according to the supplier manual . As a reference, we compared the cell extract from our msbB-deficient strain (K2) to a cell extract from a wild-type strain (K4) as well as a commercial cell-free system (myTXTL, Arbor Biosciences). A solution with lysed E. coli served as a positive control.
Compared to the K4 strain our msbB-deficient K2 cell extract had 49-fold reduced endotoxin levels (0.06 EU/ml compared to 2.94 EU/ml). Other cell extracts such as the P15 cell extract (3.83 EU/ml) and the commercial myTXTL (4.65 EU/ml) had even higher endotoxin contents.
Endotoxin content in different cell-extracts determined by LAL-Test. Error bars indicate standard deviation of the measured plateau values. Error bars indicate SD
A calibration curve using known endotoxin concentrations is required for the LAL-Test. A dilution series ranging from 0.625 EU/ml to 5 EU/ml. The fitting curve is used to interpolate the concentrations in the unknown sample. The linear fit of the calibration curve had a R2 of 0.98, an intersection with the y-axis at 0.38 and a slope of 0.39 ml/EU. These values are in accordance with the requirements of the LAL-Test manufacturer.
Removal of endotoxins is impeded by their tendency to form stable interactions with other biomolecules. Our method of preventing the lipid A biosynthesis is therefore superior to extensive isolation steps required for removing endotoxins in conventional phage production.
Nanopore Sequencing Enhances DNA Purification
Besides the cell extract, the DNA quality is the key to phage assembly."

We transformed BBa_K1755024 into E.coli BL-21. Then we detected the concentration of riboflavin through measuring the absorbance under 444nm. However, we didn't find regular change relationship between riboflavin production and Hg2+ concentration. The result showed that BBa_K1755024 can not work as we anticipated.

Our MFC
1.Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) are a promising technology for electricity production from a variety of materials, such as natural organic matter, complex organic waste or renewable biomass, and can be advantageously combined with applications in waste water treatment[1]. However, MFC have not achieved commercialization yet on account of low power output, which is mainly due to the low efficiency of extracellular electron transfer without the help of redox mediators added manually into the reactor, such as neutral red, thionin[2].
The E. coli K12 was cultivated and then inoculated, and the E.coli thus obtained is referred to as ‘original bacteria’ which was subjected to a fuel cell discharge process until the cell voltage was below 0.05 V. The bacteria suspension that underwent fuel cell discharge was inoculated into a fresh medium and cultivated. The resulting E. coli is referred to as ‘electrochemical bacteria of generation I’, which was again subjected to fuel cell discharge until the cell"

HUST-Cheering
NCTU iGEM conference
HUST-Cheering! Conference the 2nd!
Three universities in Wuhan, HUST-China, WHU-China and HZAU-China, always keep in touch and have collaborations. They suggested us that we can find a more suitable microbial chassis instead of E.coli because it might be intolerable to so many heterologous recombinant proteins. This summer, we kept the tradition to hold a conference in July and shared ideas of synthetic biology when NCTU Formosa came to discuss with us. Moreover, we discussed about our projects and got valuable suggestions from each other. For instance, how can we recycle Tb3+ from the recycled REEBOTs? Maybe we can extract them (Tb3+) by some chemical solutions, and then purify them by replacement reaction or others.
NCTU iGEM conference
This year we also participated in iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. We shared ideas with different teams and discussed about the difficulties that we had ever met. Most importantly, we showed our project and realized its shortages during the statement. We can optimize the pmrC promoter and triple LBT by modeling and doing some orthogonal experiments. Besides, we should consider how to improve the efficiency of the sitag by designing the shape of our silica board. The suggestions given by Prof. Chen brought us a way to enhance our REEBOT system, which directly advanced our project progress.
In poster show time, some students made a possible suggestion to us that PH should be changed to denature LBTs to separate rare earth ions after the capture work. One teacher from SCUT questioned whether our oprf-3 * LBT can express the membrane surface successfully. She thought that the over-length of oprf-3 * LBT may not meet our own requirements.
In the presentation section. We got many questions from other teams. Most of the questions are about our capture part, including how many times the silicon net can be used, how to get the bacteria from the silicon net after the bacteria is captured, and so on. Afterwards we mentioned the use of silicon net in the group meeting, and eventually we"

TecMonterrey_GDL,2018,Team:TecMonterrey GDL#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to the environment they have to be, at the time their relatives suffer a specific type of illness. Because of this, we gave a lecture. Our objective was to generate awareness that both, depression and anxiety are diseases that need to be treated as such, otherwise they can have severe consequences of different type including suicide. On the lecture we gave basic information of the disease, as well as information of public and private institutions able to provide help and support.
At the beginning of the lecture we asked the persons to fill some questions, the questions were written on a cardboard and we gave them stickers, so the registry was their answer  (since the questions were true or false). Throughout the talk the great majority of the assistants showed interest on the topic and on the information given, since they are in a vulnerable state we believe that it might be easier for them to understand the relevance of mental illnesses. At the end, we asked         the people to answer the same questions as the beginning, to measure the impact of our presentation.
We considered this activity a potential success since the information was of great importance for those who are in need of help.  W.H.O. has also recognized that the stigmatization of depression and lack of availability for treatment is still prevalent. In Mexico, mental illnesses continues to be a taboo, with the increasing depression events in the population, this sort of talks are necessary. Our plan is to keep pushing towards an open dialogue for depression.
More about Galilea:
This institution gives integral and humanitarian help to patients of a hospital named Hospital Civil de Guadalajara and their relatives. Help provided includes emotional, medical or nutritional, throughout programs intended to motivate people to improve their way of living. This non-profit organization received donations from the private sector, or people interested in maintaining the program active.
The organization has a partnership with Fray Antonio Alcalde shelter, which main characteristic is to help people from outside the state, who attend medical appointments at the hospital, or who have a relative in the hospital.

Most presentations may be considered successful when its audience reaches this stage.
3. Analysis
In contrast to comprehension, which emphasize on ‘comprehend all the knowledge and relationship as a whole’, analysis focuses more on breaking the whole project into basic elements again. Through evaluation of different basic element and their relationship, audience are supposed to understand why these elements are organized in this specific way instead of the many other random combinations.
Analysis prepares the audience for making creative changes on the existing project.
4. Inspiration
We have thought a long time about what should be the ultimate goal of an iGEM presentation, and finally we name the highest level of our taxonomy as ‘inspiration’.
After the entire preparing step mentioned above, the audience have converted a new and unfamiliar project into a dynamic part of their own knowledge system. From then on, the original project can be easily abstracted, broken down and forming into new ideas, and that is the most charming point of the communication.

A set of 3-D printed brick toy inspired by the iGEM taxonomy
When we look through the iGEM presentation taxonomy ourselves, we found that it is more difficult to help the audience go through the last two levels of the taxonomy with only a presentation alone. So, we came up with an idea that designing a 3-D printed brick toy may help with these process.
The brick toy is naturally composed of basic elements. They are designed to be easily pulled apart and recombined again and again, thus giving plenty of opportunities for the players to do the comprehension and analysis work. Especially for our recombinase-base system, which actually involves a turning and moving gene circuit itself, a brick toy helps to visualize the process how the circuit changing from one state into another. In that way, the players can easily check whether or not his/her new design can work properly, making the whole ‘inspiration’ stage more enjoyable.
We have brought the brick toy to the iGEM conference CCiC and also to our club fair. It received warm welcome there.
The brick toy is composed of the following parts.

Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#project description_-_-_TEXT.html," the amount of large strongyles in pastures. By detecting large strongyles in pasture the large strongyle “buster” can help horse owners prevent their horses from getting infected since they can see which fields that are infected or not.
Worm culturing
The first step in obtaining live nematodes is the recovery of the eggs from the feces. This is done through filtration of the feces and different centrifugation steps with saturated salt water followed by a bleach containing solution to obtain sterile eggs. The eggs are successively stored in LB media for a period between 7 and 10 days to allow them to hatch and reach the third larval stage. After this process the large strongyles are divided from the small strongyles under a microscope and stored for successive use.
Transcriptomics and Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we need to choose approaches that allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we chose two distinct approaches. For the first one, we’re doing transcriptomic analysis, which relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli for 2 or 3 hours and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA, which will reveal which genes are upregulated when the worm is next to the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
The second approach utilizes libraries of phages expressing a set of peptides on their surface. By various rounds of incubation and washing, only phages specific to the strongyle will be found and sequencing of their genetic information will allow us to construct a peptide that is specific to surface markers of the nematode leading to creation of a biosensor
Reporter system
Once we have the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, we’ll have to be able to see what we’ve done! We plan on using fluorescent chromoproteins to be able to detect our worms in both grass and in feces. This would allow a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect our worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
Proteomics
Contributing to the lack of Cyathostominae research
A second part will attempt to explore the known concerted action of the parasites. Seasonal encystation and emergence of larvae occurs in a coordinated fashion, so the hypothesis is that the encysted strongyles react to a signaling compound. To find possible candidates for this compound a strategy is employed in which samples of infested host tissue are run"
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," no longer be able to reproduce and our system no longer functional. To correct this problem, we may need to introduce another strain of bacteria that is vulnerable to phage infection and that competes with the strain that has developed resistance. It is also possible that the phage population will coevolve with bacteria, or that the resistant bacteria may mutate again and lose the resistant gene.
In the future, we will continue to improve our model to incorporate more aspects of our system. For example, we may model the influence of decreasing phage numbers as a result of ELP precipitation. Modelling the interaction between bacteria and phages populations has helped us enormously in understanding the viability, efficiency and sustainability of our design.
COPPER BINDING EXPERIMENT
Another important component of our system is the metal-binding peptide, whose purpose is to sequester the floating metal ions before they are precipitated. To gain an understanding of how efficient our metal binding protein, CUT A, can bind to copper, we conducted an experiment where we added the same amount CUP I to solutions with different concentrations of copper. The figure below shows the result of the experiment.
Figure 10. Copper-binding Experiment Results
For details on the interpretation of this result, refer to our result page.(click here )  Unexpectedly, the result did not show a consistent decrease in absorbance (indicative of a decrease in copper concentration) over time as the enzymes bind to copper. In fact, the concentration of copper appeared to have increased closer to the end of data collection. To understand this peculiar result, we proceeded to construct a model.
COPPER BINDING MODEL
Purpose:To determine how efficiently CUT A, our copper-binding protein, can bind to copper ions.
Definitions of Parameters and Variables:
1. Concentration of Free Copper in Solution
2. Concentration of Free Enzyme in Solution
3. Concentration of Enzyme-Ion Complex
4. Rate of Forward Reaction (Kforward): The rate at which free copper ions bind to CUT A. This is dependent on the concentration of free copper and CUT A.
5. Rate of Reverse Reaction (Kreverse): The rate at which bound copper ions are released. This is dependent on the concentration of free copper and bound copper.

Opiorphin
Short chain polypeptides have many applications in the field of biopharmaceuticals. Probems arise int he fact that it is difficult to isolate these short chain peptides without the amino acid methionine as the first amino acid in the chain (due to the nature in which DNA is translated into protein, see here for details). As a result these short chain peptides can be difficult and expensive to synthesise and purify.
Opiorphin is a good example of a short chain peptide that encounters these difficulties, and we have chosen it to showcase the possibilies of peptide delivery by The E.ncapsulator. Opiorphin is a pentapeptide (five amino acid sequence) that is naturally produced within the body, and plays a role in pain relief, and as an anti-depressant. The pain killing properties of the chemical are as strong as morphine, although due it's mechanism of action, without the addictive and psychological side effects that come with the more traditional drug.  Opiorphin works by inhibiting the production of an enzyme involved in the breakdown of endorphins within the body. By inhibiting the action of this enzyme, endorphins stay present for longer, bringing about the pain relief associated with these molecules.
Unfortunately the chemical is not widely available on the market due to high production costs. We therefore propose the unique peptide synthesis mechanisms of The E.ncapsulator as a synthesis and delivery platform for the drug. We have included a His tag as part of the removable linker mechanism. This allows for easy purification of the compound.

We transformed the following plasmids into Top10 cells, the transformations were grown overnight at 37°C:
The pSB4K5_CsgBCEFG colonies grown in 50µL LB (17/08) were transferred to 1mL fresh LB and grown overnight at 37°C.
20/08/2015
The transformation worked for the #1, 2, and 8. The transformations #3-7 had no visible colonies.
The pSB4K5_CsgBCEFG colonies grown overnight (19/08) were put in a colony PCR. The results showed again that the insert was too large.

The ligation of pSB1C3 with BFP_Spycatcher_His was not successful. The BFP_Spycatcher_His (18/08) was restricted with EcoRI-HF & PstI-HF. The restricted construct was then ligated with pSB1C3 from 03/08 and 15/07, and pSB4K5 to improve the chance of a successful ligation.
The CsgC_L/M/H constructs were repeated by ligating to with EFG. The BC_High was also repeated by ligating to EFG.
There were in total 6 ligations, as shown above. These were then all transformed into Top10 cells, and grown overnight.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," all increased, but the sucrose group and fructose group increased faster than control group, which meant adding sweeteners indeed accelerated the fluorescence protein production in yeast cells in our system.
In other words, our system can be sensitive to sweeteners. Besides, the red fluorescence intensity increasing rate of fructose group was higher than sucrose group’s, which means that the sweetness of fructose is higher than sucrose’s. This result also conforms to the result measured through people tastes.
In order to confirm this result, we repeated this experiment three times.  The all results showed the similar tendency. These results demonstrate that the system can work as our expectation.
Though the fluorescence intensity is still at a low level, the distinction between each group can be observed obviously. The reason may be that natural signal pathway in yeast can’t adapt well with the human sweet taste receptor. The improvements of this work are continuing. (Fig. 16)
Fig. 16 The schematic diagram of Gα mutation
Summary
1. We had the optimized codon and synthesized human receptor gene T1R2,T1R3 successfully by using OE-PCR.
2.The heterologous receptor was expressed and located on the cell membrane successfully in yeast, which has been confirmed by immunofluorescence.
3.Our system can sense sucrose, fructose as our expectation.
>
Fig. 17 The red fluorescence intensity of different sweeteners
To confirm whether our yeast can respond to different sweeteners, we selected fructose, sucrose and glycyrrhizic acid as sweetener candidates. The result showed that the red fluorescence intensity sucrose induced was the lowest among these three sweeteners and it was the highest induced by glycyrrhizic acid. It suggested that our engineered yeast system could respond to different sweeteners indeed. More importantly, we found that the fluorescence intensity is positively correlated with sweetness.
Fig. 18 The red fluorescence intensity of different concentrations of glycyrrhizic acid
We also found that fluorescence intensity induced by 1 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid and 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid was greatly increased than the control group. This result showed that when the concentration of the glycyrrhizic acid reached 1 g/L the fluorescence intensity was higher than 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid, which meant that 3 g/L of glycyrrhizic acid might exceed the detection limit of the system. The result also indicates if sweetness is beyond the detection limit, the result may not be accurate. Just like that,"

RHIT 2018 iGEM Team
When looking through the list of project abstracts for the iGEM 2018 Team competition, we saw that the RHIT team was also working towards a very similar goal. They were engineering bacteria to produce PETase and MHETase to breakdown PET and then engineering the bacteria to metabolize ethylene glycol (EG) by overexpressing fucO and aldA. They had also done a lot of interesting mathematical modeling for EG metabolism. Since we had taken very different approaches in trying to work towards a similar end result, we thought that it would be incredibly enriching and beneficial for both teams to connect and discuss our projects. We immediately reached out via email and scheduled a virtual meet-up.
During the meet-up, we ended up covering quite a lot of ground and talked for much longer than we had anticipated. We began by talking about our respective projects as well as the logic and rationale behind our differing project designs. While our project was focused on completely eliminating PET by completely metabolizing all the PET degradation products, the RHIT team intended to collect the leftover TPA to be used for re-polymerizing into new PET plastic, an interesting idea we had not thought about before.
Next, although we were both working on engineering strains of E. coli to metabolize EG, we were using completely different methodologies, which we discussed at great lengths. Our approach was more centered on genomic engineering. Since two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) are known to improve EG metabolism, we had used Lambda Red recombineering to replace the native genomic operons for these two genes with inducible promoters, allowing us to control overexpression of each enzyme using IPTG and aTC induction. In addition, we had used MAGE to target the ribosome-binding sites of key genes identified from our Flux Balance Analysis modelling with the hopes of optimizing EG metabolism at the translational level. In parallel, we were also using a mutagenesis and adaptive evolution approach to gradually evolve an EG-metabolizing strain of E. coli.
The RHIT team, however, used none of these approaches. Instead, they were planning on expressing the two key enzymes (fucO and aldA) from a high-copy plasmid. By increasing"

STEP System Test
""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
Partial Tests
Before fully test the STEP system, we first divided the whole transducer into two sections: the extracellular domain of ligand receptor & transmembrane domain, and the intracellular domain of transcription factor & protease. After testing both parts we were able to examine and optimise the whole system in both HEK293T and HeLa cell lines.
BiFC Test
A critical factor for the system to work is the ability of the transducers to correctly locate onto the cell membrane. To verify that we designed a test of bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC), split the N- and C-terminal of ECFP (BBa_E0020) at the A155 site and directly attached them to transmembrane linkers of the two VEGF-STEP chains.
After confirming the validity of our split ECFP in E. coli BL21 (see our parts page), we transfected HeLa cells using the two chains and added VEGF 24 hours later. After 12 hours of induction and 4 hours under low temperature for maturation, we successfully observed cyan fluorescence under microscope (Figure 1).
Figure 1. BiFC test. (a) The N- and C-terminal of split ECFP are attached to transmembrane domain of our VEGF-STEP. In theory the two chains can band together and emit ECFP fluorescence after adding VEGF.

When it come to the simulating waste water used in the experiment, we received the recommendation from Nanjing-China. The standard formula of simulating waste water is as following:
Glucose 0.3 g, tryptone 0.1 g, yeast extract 0.01 g, CH3COONa 0.15 g, NaCl 0.05 g, MgSO4·7H2O 0.236 g, K2HPO4·3H2O 0.147 g, NH4Cl 0.18 g, DI water 1 L, 115℃ 30 min sterilization.
The total phosphorus(TP) of the simulating waste water is 20 mg/L since all of the phosphorus in the water comes from the K2HPO4·3H2O added. By changing the  amount of K2HPO4·3H2O, we can adjust the TP in the simulating waste water according to experimental demand.

Lethbridge Workshop- Day 2
This morning I attended a Wiki workshop.  We got some tips on color choices and organization and looked at some websites that do a good job of this (Facebook for example).  Afer this we had some time to work on our Wikis and get help from the instructor (Jesse Johnstone) as well as from other teams.  For example, we were able to give U of L some help linking their pictures.  We got some contact information from Jesse, which will be very helpful down the road should we run into difficulties.  All in all this was a great weekend put on by AIF.  We got some really good information on presentation skills, marketing and Wiki design and we got another chance to meet some of the members from the other Alberta teams.

(EVENT PLANNING)
Why
We have created a series of Poly Cards as a new public   education tool of communicating    synthetic biology and iGEM projects.    For better practice of Poly Cards, we    get inspired from TED and hold Syn-Bio    Share Salon in Zhejiang Science and Technology    Museum cooperating with Zhejiang China Association    for Science and Technology. In the process of teaching    and sharing, we try to promoting synthetic biology to the    public, share iGEM projects in recent years, guide them to    brainstorm new ideas, and discuss about safety issue about future.

Ways of self-killing:
1) toxic protein
2) sgRNA targeting genome of strains with no NHEJ repair system
3) sgRNA targeting essential genes
PART DESIGN
At the first stage, we need to verify the function of two toxin proteins and make sure the bacteria can be killed after the expression of toxin proteins. To control the expression of killer gene, instead of J23119, arabinose inducible regulatory promoter/repressor unit is employed in our circuit.
Fig.8 Circuits for toxin gene function testing through induction by arabinose.
After measuring the growth curve, we observed the obvious difference between the testing group and control group. [see results page for killer]
To facilitate the measurement of plasmid threshold, we combined the inhibitor circuit with the killer circuit and replace the RFP for killer gene. [see design for threshold]
Fig.9 Circuits for testing for killing capacity under different concentration of arabinose, which can be regard as under different plasmid concentrations.
For the toxic protein, MazF and HokD were chosen as candidates. [see more about the killing mechanisms]
Upgraded P-SLACKiller
Why do we need to optimize our project?
It's possible to produce generation of plasmid-free cells, even if all plasmids were losen. Thus, we decided to integrate the killer device into genome to solve this problem. [see reombination]
To control the plasmid number above different thresholds, we need to adjust the initial threshold through replacement of RBS as well as in-promoter mutation. [see mutation]
Recombination
Recombineering ( recombination-mediated genetic engineering) is an efficient molecular                             engineering technique used for gene replacement, deletion and insertion.
Ways: a linear plus circular reaction
A：Employment of traditional λ-Red recombination
PART DESIGN
The basic circuit of upgraded P-SLACKiller is shown in Fig.10.
Fig.10 The basic circuit of upgraded P-SLACKiller.
Compared with the original one, two homologous arms (50bp) are added. With the help of lambda Red recombination system, the killer part can be integrated into genome, preventing the whole system from being invalid. The final gene circuit is shown in Fig.11.

Collaborations
The exchange of ideas and resources is an increasing practice among scientists, with networks of research collaborations growing around the globe. The iGEM competition has allowed us to get in touch with many teams globally.
During the course of the iGEM competition we collaborated with two teams. Our main collaboration was with the University of East Anglia located in the UK.
In the image above left to right: Hanya Benotmane, Nancy Teng, Sam Prudence and Braulio Carrillo.
The UEA team were looking for a fast and accurate method of comparing how different surfaces affect the adherence of E.coli versus Shewanella cells. Their project aims to prepare biological systems within Shewanella cells that will store energy harvested from the sun as hydrogen, so finding out which materials suit the growth of Shewanella was crucial.  Imaging the cells on different surfaces through atomic force microscopy seemed to be the best method. After a few Skype sessions with UEA we decided to send 10 AFM metal specimen discs and host them for a day to image their pre-prepared samples. Due to time constraints, not all the discs prepared were imaged that day, 4 discs remained and were imaged at a later date by the Kent team.
Here are some examples of images taken on the AFM for UEA. These figures show E.coli and Shewanella on graphite
In return the UEA team kindly agreed to generate model  structures for our protein sequences. This was a crucial part of our project as some of the proteins we are working with have been characterised. The protein sequences of each protein were sent to UEA and the proteins were modeled using the Phyre2 software. The UEA team sent the"

Conclusion
If we really wanted to design an aptazyme that can correctly respond to the exposition to different levels of saxitoxin, varying the colorimetric response in function of the toxin concentration, it was absolutely necessary that the linker was designed by this specific software. Even though the response wasn't exactly what we wanted, it is clearly shown that we are on the right path. In other words, the modeling provided by this software was a key part in the development of our project and future improvement of it.
Future
We are highly interested in working with Heidelberg's team on improving both their software and our aptazyme with this new experimental results we had based on their previous work. See you next year, Heidelberg!"

The products were transformed and the gel of the colony PCR had faint bands at ~3500bp. These 4 colonies with the expected size bands were made into overnight cultures and miniprepped, however the gel of the verification digests showed 3 bands at approximately 2000 bp, 2900 bp, and 5000 bp.
A Kapa PCR of construct 11 was repeated, along with digestion, ligation, and transformation.
Figure 26.Verification digest of transformed construct 10 in Top10 E. coli cells. Three of the four lanes show bands at 2100bp, 2700bp and 5000bp, the backbone, construct and uncut plasmid are expected at 2070bp, 2642bp and 4712bp. No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Week 19: September 2 - September 6
This week, we got the sequencing results for construct 9 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE B +Link+K coil), construct 10 ( pSBIC3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+K coil) and the TALE target sequences. The TALE target sequences (with old and new [B] + [A]) worked. One of the primers for construct 9 sequencing had poor results, so it was resent for sequencing. Construct 10 didn’t work, so we set up digestion, ligation and transformation again. Colony PCR revealed right-sized  bands for 4 colonies (Figure 27). We set up overnight cultures and mini prepped those over the weekend.
Figure 27. Colony PCR of transformed construct 10 in Top10 E. coli cells. Four of the twelve lanes show bands at 3000bp, the bands are expected at 2862bp. No contamination is observed in the negative control without DNA. Some unexpected amplification is seen in the lanes.The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
We did colony PCR of construct 11 ( pSB1C3 + BBa_J04500 +His+ TALE A +Link+βlac), but the bands were not at the expected size, so we repeated transformations with more competent Top10 cells.

In this way, we can make them work for a certain period and then make  them commit suicide. This system has advantages compared to a system, in which kill switch is turned on when a cell stimulated by external factors. To turn on kill switches triggered by a chemical, like arabinose, It is necessary to scatter chemical and let it reach GM microorganism. This is not realistic in natural environment. Scattering a lot of chemical can have bad effect to the environment. In the sea, where added chemicals diffuse quickly, or in the soil, where we cannot add chemicals directly to GM microorganisms, we cannot use chemicals as a trigger of kill switch. On the other hand, using internal trigger system used in our project, we need not to concern about requirements for scattering chemicals or diffusion of GM microorganisms.
Let’s think about possible risks on this method. First, we should consider the case when whole system is work perfectly. Does a difference of division cycle among each cell cause problem or not? If 104 times multiplications take only a little time, it seems not to cause problems. However, how about the case where cell division takes significantly long interval?  We think there is not so much problem in this regard. First of all, even if a division interval is long, they must ultimately divide up to all counts, and all cells would be die. Next, we can indicate for two reasons that the existence of cells which are unable to divide couldn’t cause much problem. One reason is that each cell has its lifespan.  The other notable reason follows from the fact that GMO exerts critical influences on environment when they proliferate abundantly. Inversely, it can be said that if E. coli cells with our kill system doesn’t much worked, or equivalently the cells has very low level of multiplication, they have few impact on environment. Thus, our strategy utilizing a division as a gene expression trigger has fundamental advantage when we have no option other than the distribution of GMO.
Let’s further examine potential defects and environmental risks accompanied with the system.
You might find defects on mechanism of loop system. Each system is probable to stop or skip process undesiary. If the genetical process of our kill system is stopped, E. coli might proliferate without operation of division counting. More worth case is when several units of division counting halt simultaneously; it leads breakdown of whole system. Also loop system might not start if there is leaky expression from Pbad even under an arabinose free condition.
Moreover, the gene mutation"

E. Chrono
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in Escherichia coli to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.
The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals:
Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design.
Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices.
Fabricate and test microfluidic designs.
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.

Background
Despite the science involved in iGEM, our team also recognized the human practices portion as well. Members of our team participated in a variety of activities to both gain awareness from our community by sharing about our project, and also to gain insight from various individuals. This information guided the next steps that were taken in our project.
Members of our team worked in a variety of activities including public engagement, a survey, and conducting interviews. We also recognized that since our idea of increasing the efficiency of blood coagulation has never before been attempted by any other iGEM team before, to create a ""Best Blood Practices"" with the hopes of assisting future iGEM teams. The knowledge gained from working with the blood will be invaluable to future generations of iGEMers."

Figure 4 is the model we created for figure 5. Figure 4 is our modelled system with the MazF gene with a ssra tag at the end. The ssra tag allows for any initial unwanted gene expression to be degraded by existing proteases in the cell. The condition assumed is that as the amount of MazF proteins tagged by ssra are initially produced, the tagged proteins will be recognized by existing proteases in the cell and be degraded. But as the expression increases rapidly it occupies all the existing proteases at a rapid rate in the cell preventing further degradation of the MazF protein. This is illustrated in figure 5 with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis the amount of protease. Figure 5 shows that the concentration of occupied protease increases rapidly which offers a useful tool for controlling for any unwanted MazF gene expression in the initial stages.

Unfortunately, the device dried out a day after being placed in the incubator. This visit proved our fabrication flow's ability to create microfluidic devices capable of trapping HEK293 mammalian cells, and gave both teams great insight on the other end of the biologist-microfluidics bridge, and sparked ideas for further customization of microfluidics for the lab bench. Highlighting the rapid design and prototyping enabled with Neptune, not a week later we returned with an entirely new design and batch of two chips ready for further testing (while our design and fabrication flow allows for iterations to occur within hours, the schedule of both teams needed about a week). This further collaboration is detailed below.

PART 2
For our second on-site visit to MIT, we redesigned our chip to better observe the HEK293 cells under the microscope. Namely, this iteration replaced the cell traps and valves with a diamond chamber and an equivalently shaped window through the polycarbonate for facilitated microscopy on the otherwise empty control (red) layer. The valves were removed with the hopes of running fluid through the device while it was under the microscope, and not detaching it from its pumping infrastructure like in the previous iteration. The fluids pumped through the device were similar to the first iteration, starting with ethanol solution, then PBS, suspended cells mixed with culture media, and finally culture media alone. Evaporation, which occurred in the previous chip in the incubator, was assumed to not be in effect in the closed system of the microscope. To allow the cells time to adhere to the PDMS, the flow of culture media was disrupted; unfortunately the flow was disrupted for too long, and the fluid again evaporated out of the chip, likely through the viewing window due to the microscope not being an ideal closed system. This second visit gave timelapse evidence that the HEK293 cells were surviving and beginning to multiply in"

Today I set up a massive colony PCR with the BBK-CP primers in order to veirfy that we were able to get all of our parts into the psB1C3 vector.  Today I also made more LB broth.  I also did transformations of a few other parts into the psB1C3 vector as well as the construction of I0500-B0034 with the Lethbridge part.
Himika
Today I set subcultured the DegP cells containing MalE and MalE31 into 20 ml broth and allowed it to grow for 6 hours. I induced these cells with 15 different arabinose concentrations. This was left shaking overnight and I will read these cells tomorrow.

Week 16 : choosing an AHL pair, improving diffusion
Monday 8th September
We have enough crosstalk results to decide which pair of quorum sensing systems we will use : Las and Lux. See this article for more details.
Diffusion experiment (trying to have a correlation between channel length and time of fluorescence, having cells at the end of a channel and adding pure HSL at the other end of the channel, see this article for more details on the setup) : We tried lower concentrations of pure HSL and the wells start shining at different moments, but we still don't have any correlation between channel length and starting time of fluorescence, because our chip seems to be leaky and some wells dried completely. However, this experiment enables us to check that fluorescence appears after a reasonable time and that channel length probably doesn't influence this time too much.
On the modeling side, we are not able to retrieve diffusion coefficient of HSL from this diffusion experiment but we can use a parameter from literature.

Crosstalk experiments continued
Monday, 6th September
Until now we thought Lux was crosstalking too much with las and tried to improve the pair Las-Rhl. However we realized today that Rhl is difficult to improve and that our induction curves of Las and Lux are good enough, since Las is never responding to lux-HSL and we only have to be in a range of las-HSL concentrations that is below 10 nM to avoid Lux responding to las-HSL.

Wiki
We've put a lot of work into our wiki this year. The most important part of course is the content. We used Google Docs to write and work as a team - resolving a total over 600 comments. Adam, our student leader who did the bulk of wiki editing made over 1300 edits - and as a result has gone slightly insane.
Several wikis we looked at were inaccessibly written - often lacking good explanations and having little page structure. This is likely down to the last minute rush before the deadline. We started early and spent a long time perfecting our text, so hopefully you find it all makes sense.
Another problem is that previous wikis are slow to load. They often have large swathes of redudant code and uncompressed images are commonly uploaded at much higher resolutions than needed. We saw some homepages well over 10MB! Our homepage is just 0.7MB, and all our other pages are similarly optimized. We've done this by analysing our site with Google's Pagespeed and Lighthouse auditing tools to find where we could improve. We correctly sized and compressed images, reused files so they can be cached and used SVGs where possible for diagrams.
As SVGs can be embedded more easily into the page, page load times are improved as the browser doesn't have to fetch the images seperately. SVGs also allow for infinite scalability allowing our wiki to take advantage of high resolution screens like Apple's 'Retina Displays'. They're also powerful as they allow text to actually be text rather than pixels - allowing screenreaders to read diagrams, improving the accessibility of our wiki. The worst cases we’ve seen are are wikis that are just huge PNGs - they take forever to load, don’t allow you to select text, are inaccessible to the visually-impaired and lack links and citations embedded in the text.

PCR of the yddg gene failed yet again. It is possible that the primers are not correct.

July 9
One of our potential knockouts and a positive control were grown on the M9 plates. There was growth on both plates, although the growth on the positive control was much faster and greater than the potential knockout. Since the potential knockout was able to grow on the amino acid-less M9 media, it appears to be not auxotrophic. Characterization with PCR continues to be difficult, and it was suggested that we simply sequence the strains.
The plates with the potential knockouts were placed in the 37° incubator overnight to cure the plasmid.
The potential biobricks were successfully miniprepped, and a PCR was performed to isolate what was actually between the VF2 and the VR primers in the plasmid. The product will then be run on a gel, and if it appears the correct length, will be sent for sequencing.
Joe made M9 plates with an amino acid, to further test his knockout.

The PCR to isolate and amplify the insert from the potential biobrick showed many bands, characteristic of non-specific primer binding. As another test to see if the insert was correct, we cut with EcoRI and PstI to look for the appropriate insert size, and indeed found that there was an insert at about the right size.

An attempt at doing an experiment to calibrate the fluorescent proteins for the plate reader (looking for quenching, linear relationship between OD and fluorescence, etc) was done on Sunday, but as it turns out, we had the wrong promoter for a fluorescent protein, and the wrong antibiotic resistance for one of the other proteins.
Competent cells were made from each of the knockouts, and they worked well. The yddg strain was ordered through collaboration with Calgary as well as the keio collection proper in Japan.
The sequencing results from our amino acid biobricks came back, and it looks like only MetA was successful. It should be"

Sharing with IONIS Paris
IONIS Paris gave us an insight into their project, fundraising technique, and human practice. We conducted a Skype call on 10th July 2017 in our beloved genetic labs. Discussion started with an introduction from both teams. They shared their project idea which mainly concerns on temperature changes cell detector. Further, they applied the project on Meteorology Centre and farming by forming a collaboration. We shared our project idea as well and also expressed our concern on fundraising. Our team received a valuable advice to search a sponsor. In the end, the discussion closed with a photo session and a social media account exchange to keep us stay in touch. Moreover, they asked us to participate on their survey.

GMM Legislation Document
Click Here!
iGEM event has provided us a competition as well as collaboration. As a synthetic biology enthusiast, we have a responsibility to make our work safe and comply the law and regulation. Therefore, we collaborated with 137 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks, and 5 continents to compile a worldwide GMM legislation document. Our role was to provide an Indonesian GMM regulation based on Peraturan Pemerintah No. 21 Tahun 2015. This is most probably one of the biggest collaborations in iGEM!
The compilation of GMM legislation is very useful in a lot of different ways for practitioners of synthetic biology and other related fields. Many information can be inferred from our collaboration result that will be able to help many parties.
Aside from significantly contributing to the whole collaboration which helps every team in its own ways, we also the gain some insights from the collaboration. Our take on the compilation of GMM regulations is that the use of GMOs especially as a bioremediation tool directly applied to environment is still very strictly prohibited in most areas of the world. While our project grand design in the long run is to directly applying our bacteria in the ocean, this collaboration led our project to develop new alternatives and safety measures modules to cope with the regulations so that our project can be of use in the near future.

Medical Explorers
Our partnership with Warwick High school brings in 20 Medical Explorer Students for a two day intense experience with University level lab work. To create an accessible and relevant outreach program we followed the Outreach Planning Guide . An overview version of the guide can be found on the Database Page .
Find Communities
Students interested in medicine are often very interested in the biological sciences. We wanted to present students with examples of synthetic biology research and help them understand the impact this science will have on the medical field in the future. These learning objectives will be valuable for students who maybe using gene therapies as treatments with future patients, or for students who have an undiscovered passion for lab work.
Evaluating Interest & Understanding
We connected with Amanda Snyder, the Magnet Coordinator for Warwick High School, to collaborate on the Medical Explorers summer program for rising 9th graders. Amanda provided a background on what the students would be covering during their two week experience in the Medical Explorers program. Knowing that the students were just entering high school helped us to create a program that would offer new challenging material but not be overwhelming for the students.
Consider How to Connect
Knowing the students had an interest in medical sciences helped us to put synthetic biology into a relevant context for them. The goal of this outreach was to excite students about the potential applications of synthetic biology, while making them aware of the limitations and risks associated with the science. To promote this discussion and engagement we provided ample medical examples to keep students engaged. We had two days with these students so at the end of the first day we distributed short articles discussing relevant uses of synthetic biology, every student got a unique article, and we encouraged students to look into other examples of bioengineering at work. Students were then prepared to talk about their articles and how they felt about the use of synthetic biology. This combination of teaching methods allowed us to connect more effectively with students, encouraging learning through hands on activities, in a reading, and then in a discussion.

Modeling Tol/Pal diffusion
Tol and Pal are membrane proteins which are located respectively in the outer and the inner membrane.  Tol and Pal proteins interact with each other, forming Tol/Pal complexes. By acting like press studs binding the inner and outer membranes, thus stabilizing the outer membrane using the peptidoglycan rigidity, the Tol/Pal complexes play a central role to preserve membrane integrity [ 5 ][ 6 ].
The diffusion of proteins in these lipid bilayers can be modeled by Brownian motion. This diffusion model gives the probability law for the location of Tol and Pal in the membranes.  The following three equations model the Brownian motion of Tol, Pal and Tol/Pal complexes, represented as particles.
In the above equations, CX denotes the concentration of protein X, and DX denotes the constant kinetic coefficient associated to X. The kTolPal and k*TolPal denote the reaction constants for Tol-Pal complexation. In the last equation, Φ is an unknown function representing the Tol-Pal complex motility. However, because the Tol-Pal complex is significantly larger than the other proteins, and is doubly anchored in membranes, we made the assumption that the mobility of Tol-Pal complexes is negligable in comparison to the mobility of isolated Tol and Pal molecules. Stated differently, we set Φ to zero.  Lastly, additional constraints on Tol/Pal diffusion have been added to enforce a constant distance between Tol and Pal proteins.
In the above equations, the laplacians capture the non-homogeneous molecular diffusion on non-flat membranes. Indeed, they link the evolution of protein concentrations with the local shape of the membranes, since we know that on a two dimensional space:
where x and y are the coordinate of the surface and where the different partial derivatives are depending on the cartesian coordinates of the surface we are evolving on.
Unequal osmotic pressures create small blebbing
Using the equations for membrane deformation, we can compute numerically the shape of the outer membrane at steady state under various assumptions. If we assume that Tol/Pal complexes acts like press studs locally imposing a fixed distance between the two membranes, and that their initial distribution  in the membrane is not totally homogeneous, then we obtain results of the following type.
Shape at equilibrium of the outer membrane presenting blebs (red) resulting from osmotic pressure differences and with Tol/Pal complexes locally imposing a fixed distance between the inner (green) and outer membranes.

If bacteria are dangerous and spread easily, new types diseases could be potentially created/spread if research isn't careful . There is so much good that could come out of synthetic biology though that as long as they have good regulations, it's fine.""
What is your dream application of synthetic biology?

What do you think the field of computer science could contribute to biology?
""The magic of the computer lies in its ability to remove the limitations of human capability. Whereas in the past our creativity was restricted by what was manually possible, today the computer is enabling discoveries that the mind is simply incapable of making on its own. I believe we will see the computer as an integral part of many of the seminal discoveries within synthetic biology in the next decade. Through the computer’s power in analyzing enormous sets of data and sheer calculating speed we will be able to make connections that were previously unfathomable. The use of DNA as storage and biological computing are fundamentally changing the definition of computers. We are only at the beginning - there are applications of computer science to synthetic biology and vice-versa that no one has yet imagined. There are algorithms to be discovered and research to be done and I will remain optimistic in watching the field grow out of its infancy and mature.""
Ithaca, NY
What are some ethical concerns you have regarding genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms?
""I think there is something that has to be said with regards to how we are producing at a rate just to meet our population's needs as opposed to the natural rate of growth. For me, personally, I think that fighting nature in the sense that we are with genetic modification can pose a potential concern. That's not to say that I think that science has not done its due diligence with the process. I understand that there is a pressing need to produce at a higher rate, but I think that there are some moral concerns associated with opposing the natural rate.""

UNC-Asheville,2017,Team:UNC-Asheville#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," pressure cooker we had purchased from eBay could be dropped in favor of the school’s autoclave.
For our first attempt at assembly, we decided to attempt ligation into the psB1A3 backbone provided with ampicillin resistance. It was concerning that this vector was not only linearized, but provided at the low concentration of 25 ng/uL. Approximately half of our IDT DNA was wasted attempting both a single insert digest/ligation and the double insert ligation protocol provided on the iGEM website. Out of concern for running out of DNA, PCR primers were designed which could amplify these parts. The standard oligos for the biobrick prefix and suffix were unable to amplify either sMMO1 or GroEl/Es successfully.
After many, many, many rounds of attempted PCR and ligation attempts, and additional attempts to PCR up the backbone, our team decided to assemble in a puc19 backbone (We foolishly did not consider the possibility of amplifying existing Biobricks and restricting out the necessary chloramphenicol backbone). When this failed, primers were designed which would conceivably amplify the IDT parts while giving them sufficient overlaps for Gibson assembly to work. No one in our school had ever done Gibson assembly before, so most of our advice came from the internet, at least until we went to the iGEM meetup in Virginia, which was extraordinarily useful. After two rounds of attempted PCR, a decision was made to simply re-order the parts with Gibson overlaps. Several attempts at Gibson assembly were made, but for a reason we never figured out, all that came back on diagnostic gels were the chloramphenicol backbones, or bands that were clearly not our parts. One last ditch effort was made to create biobricks by ordering dhlB under inducible lac promoters from Genscript, already in puc19 via a grant. With a few weeks to spare, we finally got our first Biobrick in the correct backbone, and collective nervous sighs of relief could be heard echoing off the halls of Zeis. In the eleventh hour a hail mary ligation produced bands that appeared to smmo1 and sMMO2 as well as a definitive, proving we had GroEl/Es in a backbone. While we had no time to sequence these, we did send them off to iGEM HQ (Godspeed you beautiful bricks…).

The Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel
Assumptions
[Ca2+]out is in excess compared to [Ca2+]in.[12]
The experiment takes place at room temperature (25oC).
the L-type Ca2+ (Cch1) channel is homologous to those found in other eukaryotes.[3]
Any Ca2+ that enters into the channel will exit into the cell.
The channel is specific and selective for Ca2+.
The cell is at steady state previous to stimulation.
There are two activation gates ('a') and two inactivation gates ('i').
Gates of the same type are identical and independent in action.
There are approximately 100 calcium channels per yeast cell.[1]
Constant Instantiation
the overall model of the calcium channel can be subdivided into its constituent gates: the activation gate and the inactivation gate. Collapsed into chemical formulas, the channel's interactions with the calcium can be thought of as such:
Based off the assumption that any bound calcium must travel inside, the result:
These may be further subdivided into the activation and the inactivation gates:
and
The rate constants are provided below:
The Calculation of Voltage Experienced at the Cellular Level
Although the electrodes registered voltages in volts, the individual changes felt by the individual cells in the SC media are estimated to be in millivolts. In particular, a recursive algorithm was used to calculate the optimal voltage wherein charge (from calcium) transport across the membrane occurred at the greatest rate. The MATLAB function fsolve was utilized to find this point. It reflects the observed data as seen in the notebook: the optimal point was found to exist at roughly 0.007-0.008 V, or 7-8 mV.
Figure 1.c. MATLAB algorithm for the deduction of voltage of greatest charge transport
Calculation of Charge Intake
The charge intake is usually dependent on two variables: stimulation time and stimulation voltage (received).[6] The dependence can be reduced to one variable by varying the stimulation voltage at fixed stimulation times. Simultaneously, it is useful to construct, as per the RS model, a relationship between the calcium current and membrane voltage, at various stimulation times. From Ohm’s Law, it is known that V = IR. Therefore, the equation may also be written as:
In this case, the current would consist solely of calcium ions moving into the cell.[12] Also,"

Natural Promoters
Introduction
Eukaryotic promoters are very complex and difficult to characterize. They usually lie upstream of their target gene, but they can have regulatory elements that are several kilobases away from the promoter. Fig. 1 shows some of the factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of polymerase II [1]. For our assay we want to utilize several natural promoters to sense certain conditions in the cell, such as hypoxia, DNA damage and heat. The selection criteria for these promoters are that they have to be very specific to a transcription factor and they have to be easily induced and inhibited. These natural promoters will give us a chance to start testing and fine-tuning our output system early on which can then be applied to our synthetic promoters.
Figure 1: Diagram of various components involved in regulation of Pol-II transcription. The regulatory elements include a core promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs including the TATA box , which is bound by the ""TATA-binding protein"" (TBP). The Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes and the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind. The proximal promoter is upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 1000 bp contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins. Most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal"

Biobrick Safety
All organisms are biosafety level 1 with the minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. This year, our team is planning to construct a total of 7 novel basic biological parts, and to build complex devices by making use of these parts together with parts available from the Part Registry. Our BioBricks have been considered to be safe for uses and circulation. The parts and their safety evaluations are as follow.
aceA and aceB
Our team is cloning isocitrate lyase (aceA) and malate synthase (aceB) from E. coli strain BW25113. They are enzymes involved in the glyoxylate cycle in plants and bacteria. Dean et al. at UCLA introduced aceA and aceB genes into human hepatocytes to investigate fatty acid metabolism, and no hazardous effect was reported1. Based on current findings, we believe the two genes will not raise any significant safety issues.
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) is a short signaling peptide that directs proteins to the mitochondria in mammalian cells. Its functionality has been tested in human hepatocytes by Bai et al. and no harmful effect of MLS has been reported2. Our team cloned the coding DNA sequence of MLS from a commercial plasmid – pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen) – and fused it with aceA and aceB genes so the MLS can guide the two resulting enzymes into mitochondria. Again, based on the paper written by Dean et al., and with the consideration of the signaling function of this part, we consider this BioBrick to be safe in uses.

We also went through a set of design cards with requirements for interactive exhibits by age group, and we wrote up how our exhibit design satisfies each of the requirements.
7/3/2015: Day 25
We had the day off today because of the holiday tomorrow!
7/6/2015: Day 26
We started working on the computer prototype. We now have a very solid idea of what the software will look like, so it is much easier to program to that end. A lot of the programming also depends on the visuals and animations, so we only have the basic motions and functionality so far.
7/7/2015: Day 27
Today we continued working on the prototype and the phrasing write-up of all the prompts and information in the application. In the afternoon, Casey visited the lab again and brought some of the sketches and mock-ups of their initial design ideas. We discussed the artwork we’ll need, and agreed that some of the animation will be crucial for getting the functionality down, so Casey will begin working on that in the next few days.
7/8/2015: Day 28
As part of the Summer Research program at Wellesley, we have to give a presentation on the research we are doing. Our presentation is scheduled for tomorrow, so we spent most of today working on that. We started building off of the NEGEM presentation we gave, but changed it accordingly so that we spent more time explaining the basic science behind our project, since oru disciplinary group is the Computer Science, Math, Astronomy, and Physics, and no one has much biology in their background. It was good practice to make sure that we can convey the basic concepts, and it was a lot of fun making our presentation more engaging and animated (literally, we added a whole bunch of nice transitions and animations on the slides).
7/9/2015: Day 29
Our presentation was at lunch today, so we spent most of the morning finishing it up. The presentation went fine; people asked a few questions afterwards. In the afternoon, Casey sent us some more of the design work they’ve done, so we incorporated the flask animation and the new background into our design. It is starting to actually look good now. I’m excited to continue working on it next week, since tomorrow we are going to the Science Museum!

Design and Synthesis of the miniTn7BB-Gm
As a first step to undertake the construction of the miniTn7 biobrick toolkit, we designed a synthetic miniTn7 minitransposon from which all derivatives could be easily generated. The design was inspired on the miniTn7 transposon set constructed by Choi et al. (2005) . The main features of this initial construct, designated miniTn7BB-Gm are: (i) wild-type Tn7R and Tn7L ends, enabling transposition in vivo when the Tn7 transposase is expressed in trans, (ii) prefix and suffix with unique EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI restriction sites, fully compatible with Assembly Standard 10, (iii) annealing sequences for standard primers to facilitate amplification and sequencing of cloned BioBricks, (iv) transcriptional terminators flanking the multi-cloning site to efficiently insulate cloned BioBricks from vector transcription, (v) a selectable gentamycin (Gm) resistance cassette flanked by duplicated SphI and NcoI sites to facilitate marker replacement, (vi) flipase recognition elements (FRTs) flanking the gentamycin resistance cassette, to allow clean excision of the marker in strains bearing transposon insertions, and (vii) SfiI sites flanking the complete transposon to facilitate cloning into the appropriate plasmid vectors. A schematic of miniTn7BB-Gm showcasing the aforementioned features is shown in Figure 1. The miniTn7BB-Gm transposon was designed by David Caballero and commercially synthesized (Mr. Gene)

From top to bottom: day 1, day 3, day 5 and day 7. We can visually see the colour change from cloudy and opaque to more red due to the conversion of ALA to PPIX.
Our tubes of the original 45 samples did not have consistent colouring as we would have expected. Day 5 samples appeared to be more red in colour than day 7 samples.
Fig 2. From top to bottom - day 1, day 3 and day 5 cells of the Mg-chelatase plasmid + mutant cells + IPTG. The day 5 cells are noticeably darker than both day 1 and day 3, and the day 5 0mM ALA sample.

Introduction
If you ask iGEM veterans about the organization of their freezers, you often get the same anwer: ""chaotic"". What if iGEMers would always know where to put and find their samples? Two organization paradigms are most popular:
organization by type — e.g. putting all primers in one box
organization by purpose/person — e.g. everything related to the kill switch in one box
But both of these paradigms lead to the same problem: For good scientific practice many parameters must be recorded. In most cases, this includes date, name, insert, backbone, strain, clone number, medium and sometimes even the growth medium.
“
All this has to be scribbled in very small, and hopefully permanent penmanship on the top of the tube, which is a circle about 1cm in diameter. [...] It's an organizational nightmare held together by a very thin thread of paperwork.
”
Jeff Shrager, Ph.D, 14th July 2000 [1]
When teams and projects grow, the number of samples steadily increases and at some point people tend to loose control and oversight. Freezers are collapsing under highly frequent usage and samples get lost. For iGEM teams this typically results in nightly phone calls to find stuff and match the project deadline. In 2014 we had many of these troubles and knew something had to change so we could scale up.
Therefore we developed and deployed a mobile-first sample management system for humans. It solves the problem of sample identification and tracking without the need for expensive equipment.

Safety
Realizing the importance of bio-safety issues, our HP team also talked with several professors about the possible biosafety concerns of our project. Though we were told that manipulating ssDNAs and use them as miRNA inhibitors ex vivo raises little safety concern, the other two aspects mentioned by the professionals raised our attention. On the one hand, Dr. Zhuo Song, the technical director of Genetalks noticed us that when used ex vivo, the potential toxicity of the miRNA Lockers may affect the normal function of the cells, on the other hand, Dr. Shuo Tu (Professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology, Nanchang University, mainly focus on tumor cell apoptosis) told us that if our miRNA Locker is capable of being used in vivo, its toxicity to the host animals as well as its pharmacokinetics should also be considered.
With their suggestions in mind, we made further adjustment on the experimental design of our project. Though with no specific data to show yet, we are preforming experiments determining the effect of our miRNA Lockers on the growth and apoptosis of the ex vivo cell cultures. Further in vivo experiments are still under planning and approving procedure of the ethical board of our university (see Future work part on the Results page ).
Application prospect
Nowadays, miRNA inhibitors plays an important role in medical treatment. To know more information of miRNA antagonist therapy, we interviewed Professor Li LingProfessor and master’s supervisor of biochemistry and molecular biology department, school of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, his main research direction is molecular mechanism of bone metastasis in tumor.
Professor Li Ling mentioned that the FDA program approved gene therapy technology and the first gene therapy was expected to be approved in January 2018. In addition, an RNAi (RNA interference) drug has entered the main clinical endpoint of phase three clinical trials. MicroRNA antagonist therapy is a promising new technique for treating diseases at gene level. With the wide application of this technology in clinic, many clinical drugs and therapies harmful to human body will disappear. However, new therapies will have their own advantages and shortcomings, old things cannot fade away immediately, and new things will also face many challenges to retain. Hospitals and clinicians should keep up with the breakthrough of medical technology, enrich the knowledge reserve of gene therapy technology and its treatment, and meet the new challenges at any time to serve the human health.

As of October 2013, there are 42 groups declared worldwide and 3353 members on DIYbio Google group mailing list.
Competitors
Market reaction
Open-source/DIY
Example: IO rodeo Most likely group to be affected initially by the Darwin Toolbox entry into the market. Like our start-up, small companies typically struggle to compete with regards resources and reach. However they may be possible sources of collaboration instead of competition.
Global Biotechnology Companies
Example: Bio-rad This group is unlikely to be affected in the first couple years. As their products are currently sold in mass quantities and with restricted accessibility to individuals, they don't currently reach Darwin Toolbox's target market. They may react to youGEM's entry by making their products better towards individuals.
Specialised Companies (e.g. forensics)
Example: Sirchie Similar to global companies, this group is unlikely to be immediately affected initially as it is well established. However as this group target a niche market, they may later be challenged by Darwin Toolbox's broader scope.
Competitor Analysis
There are no direct competitors who provide an alternative to our product. Our competition is more indirect and falls into three broad categories: companies offering laboratory equipment hardware kits, laboratory equipment supply and educational biotechnology kits. We assessed our product in comparison to other companies by the following criteria, and the results can been seen in the table below.
Competitor Analysis Criteria
Affordability
How cheap is the technology? How much does shipping cost?
User-friendly
How easy is the technology to use?
Completeness
Is it an all-in-one solution?
Convenience
Does the company ship internationally? Is it pre-manufactured or does it require assembly?
Brand strength
How easy is the product to find? How much does it push the market forwards? How reliable is the reputation?
Marketing Plan
Stakeholder outreach and product promotion routes
•Existing market groups –DIYbio: existing DIYbio spaces, mailing lists, Makerfaires, social media –iGEM HS: directly via iGEM HQ, including discount or promotion for registered iGEM teams –Schools: science education networks (STEM and PsiComm), educational funding bodies (BBSRC) –University Students: university representatives, advertise via iGEM teams, word of mouth –Field Researchers: targeted via specific case studies, academic journal advertising
•New markets, “mainstream” citizen scientists
Initially, we aim to target technophilic people, e.g. parents who want to do science with their children.

INSA-Lyon,2010,Team:INSA-Lyon#Team#Students_-_-_TEXT.html," the fifth year at the INSA Lyon, I am interested in Research and Development in industry. This competition allowed me to do a whole research project from the research of informations to the results presentation. Moreover, I am specialised in Microbiology and Molecular biology. Chassis building, now called Synthetic Biology, is an important tool for the future which has to be controlled. Therefore for me, this project is both a personal and scientific improvement that gathers team work and scientific approach.

Introduction
The readout of the signal corresponding to the biological approach A is based upon imaging E.coli on a single cell level. This is absolutely necessary since only then our algorithms will be capable of computing and detecting a change in the       motility or tumbling frequency.       Early experiments using scientific microscopes at our department showed that it is possible to image E.coli in a brightfield setup at a magnification of roughly 10x. However, as also described in the Hardware section, we first       wanted to implement a simple setup that doesn’t involve lenses. Therefore at the very beginning of our project, we built our own lensless setup. After several improvements of our setup did not lead to the expected result, we decided to model       our setup with the help of HoloPy - a python based tool for working with digital holograms and light scattering."
