Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2018,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," way around. As we have set a great focus on science communication, we used many possibilities to introduce science to a broad public.
FameLab – a great Way to introduce Science to the Public
The FameLab presentation format was developed by Cheltenham Festivals in 2005 and similar events worldwide have been organized in collaboration with the British Council. The competition aims to communicate science in innovative ways. During the FameLab competition every competitor has three minutes to present a scientific topic as a lecture. Presentation slides are not allowed, but all equipment that the participants are able to independently bring to the stage can be used. The lectures are evaluated regarding to their content, structure and charisma by a jury which consists typically of representatives of science and the media. FameLab International takes place in the US and around 30 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. So far, more than 7000 participants worldwide took part in FameLab International. In most countries, the winners of regional preliminary competitions compete against each other in a national final. The winners of all national finals will then meet at FameLab International in the UK at the Cheltenham Science Festival. Since 2011 there are also annual FameLab competitions in Germany. Bielefeld Marketing GmbH organizes the format together with the British Council in Germany and coordinates the regional preliminary decisions and the annual Germany final.
Our team member Antonin participated in the regional preliminary decisions in Bielefeld and presented our project to a broad public audience. Our project was presented as the biological Philosopher’s Stone that transforms polluted water into gold and other valuable metals. By skipping technical jargon and using visual language, Antonin was able to explain our topic within two minutes to people of different ages and scientific and educational backgrounds.
Antonin's full performance can be viewed in the video below:
Radio – another Way to reach the Public
Media today is an effective and great tool to address many different people. Therefore, we contacted our campus radio station Hertz 87.9 and got the opportunity to present the iGEM competition and our project at their live science broadcast.
The interview can be accessed here! (German).
We were in touch with the radio team throughout the whole iGEM competition. We broadcasted a podcast in cooperation with Hertz 87.9 and are invited to their science show after the Giant Jamboree. This is a great example of how media and science can work together – we are very thankful about the amazing cooperation!

May 29: First day of the summer session!
Today, we attended the Summer Research Program Orientation - we got to meet our fellow researchers and faculty. Orit presented an introduction about human-computer interaction and the design process we will be following. We received our mentors and were also split into subgroups to start our research. My group - Casey, me and Nicole - is researching semantic search and the importance of it in a synthetic biology setting.
May 31: Intro to the surface
I conducted some research, reading up on documents about semantic search and synthetic biology. Later, I learned how to program in C# today through some tutorials on the Microsoft Surface. The tutorials led me through some basic tasks, such as creating an image and allowing it to be resized with a maximum and minimum length and width, grouping multiple objects in categories, and setting an object's initial placement on the surface. For using C# and the Microsoft Surface for the first time, it did not seem too difficult - I am excited to start coding projects on the surface.
June 1: More surface tutorials
Microsoft Design Tutorial
I learned about the design principles and guidelines of Microsoft Surface applications. I read about the Windows 8 OS and was introduced to the metro-style apps of the new user interface. Many of the general guidelines were similar to the ones I learned for designing iOS applications, such as focusing on the user and making important objects larger. Other principles were specific to the Windows 8 environment, such as considering how the user navigates the app based on location of controls and gestures. I started the tutorial on the Microsoft surface, but continued it on my computer. Afterwards, I read some more documents and articles about semantic search.
June 4: Field trip to Microsoft NERD Center!
Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge, MA
The new Windows 8 Interface
In the morning, I continued my research about semantic search. At lunch, I attended a workshop on Statistics, where we reviewed the concepts of descriptive and inferential statistics. During the afternoon, we all took a field trip to Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge. The Microsoft building was very interesting - while everything was simple and clean, the colors of"

Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Human Practice#Gender Study_-_-_TEXT.html," to understand their motivations and activities in iGEM. The study was designed to  be unbiased and to avoid stereotype threat (for example by putting the question about gender in the end among many other pieces of information). It is still available here . Participants in the survey had to rank from 1 to 5 (1 being not important, and 5 very important) answers to questions regarding personnal and professional motivations for participating in iGEM as well values and on what did they spend their time. 63 people answered among whom 32% were women.
It is interesting to notice that men and women answered almost exactly the same way regarding most of the questions. Women gave a little more importance for the value of fundamental research in iGEM while men graded a bit better ""Changing the world"". Motivations were approximately the same as well as time spent on each activity. Just a little fact was that men considered human practices a bit more important than women did but spent a little less time on it.    There is only one main difference (more than one point out of five which is represented below) : the will to lead a project and lead a team. It is striking to see how much men are more motivated to lead teams than women. This is definitely to put in relation with the number of women advisers found and the impact it can then have on teams mixity. This could reflect women lack of self esteem in some parts of their work.
Figure 10: Results of survey : what did you hope to learn in iGEM? A survey was distributed to iGEM teams asking participants to rank their motivation to participate in iGEM in various subjects between 1-5.  The only significant difference between the motivation of men and women in iGEM were in the subjects leading a team and leading a project.
Recommendations
   Considering all the results that were presented above, here is a list of recommendations for the iGEM foundation to pursue an active policy to improve mixity in iGEM.
Raise the number of women judges
Promote large teams
Write up a small paragraph to team heads to insist on the importance of motivating young women to be advisers.
Giving Bonus point when the team have women advisers
And finally, add in iGEM requirements a Gender reflection. By having teams filling out the database that was built and answering the survey and write a small paragraph about how they see mixity in their team and what it could bring, it would drastically raise the awareness of young men and women about the gender problem in science. Having an up-to-date database is also a great way to see"

The PCRs of pnikA and prcnA were digested with the enzymes EcoRI and SpeI. Together with a reporter they were brought into the backbone pSB1C3 via the Gibson Assembly. The reporters were GFP ( BBa_K549001 ), lacZ' ( BBa_K549002 ] and luxAB ( BBa_K549003 ). The reporters were taken from various BioBricks: GFP from BBa_E0040 ( BBa_E0040 ), lacZ' from Ba_J33202 ( BBa_J33202 ) and luxAB from the BioBrick BBa_K216008 BBa_K216008]).
Of course we also had to proliferate our needed BioBricks that we transformend into super-competent cells. From the overnight cultures we did plasmid preps.
Week 2
fur: Finally we were then abled to do a fusion PCR on the gained fragment with the primers fur_fwd and fur_rev.
Again we used an annealing temperature of 50°C and the Phusion polymerase. The expected length of this PCR was 520 bp.
The other part of the system is the promoter norB. The PCR was done with the Phusion polymerase and the primers PnorB_fwd and PnorB_rev. template was the gDNA of Neisseria meningitidis. The annealing temperature was 50°C for the 400 bp fragment. Unfortunately the PCR gave not the wanted fragment.
PCR for the arsR system: BBa_J33201 with the Phusion polymerase. The wanted fragment contains a promoter, the ABS part, a RBS and arsR. The expected length is 500 bp. Used primers are parsRENX_fwd and arsRABSS_rev. The annealing temeperature is 50°C. The PCR did not work out. In the next step we tried a gradient PCR to find the ideal annealing conditions for our fragment. The gradient reached from 42-65°C. This time we also changed the polymerase and used Taq. Also this attempt gave not the wanted result. Also the PCR with the"

For easier understanding the BioBricks for our project may be sorted into four groups: (1) the creation of a vector in which you may clone every protein of interest, which gets then linearized and becomes used for transformation of Physcomitrella patens, (2) BioBricks which can be used to determine the localization of a protein in Physcomitrella patens being either cytoplasmatic, secreted or receptor bound, (3) a set of six different phytoremediation effector proteins which either bind ( BioAccumulation ) or degrade ( BioDegradation ) a xenobiotic substance and finally (4) we assembled the BioBricks for a red light triggered kill switch that kills transgenic moss cells if they are exposed to full spectrum sun light.

DNA Synthesis
DNA synthesis is the natural or artificial creation of     deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. In the cell, each of the two     strands of the DNA molecule acts as a template for the synthesis of     a complementary strand. Based on a similar principle, polymerase     chain reaction (PCR) too is being used for DNA synthesis in vitro.     Further, with advances made in science, it is now possible to     create artificially synthesized novel nucleotide DNA sequences [20]
DNA replication – the natural DNA biosynthesis (in vivo DNA     amplification)
DNA and DNA replication mechanisms appeared late in early life     history. DNA traces its origin from RNA/Protein [21] , however, to     remain in the scope of our current project, the natural process of     DNA replication proceeds in an enzymatically catalyzed and     coordinated steps: initiation, elongation and termination.
The first step in DNA replication involves the unzipping of the     double helix structure of the DNA. This is carried out by an enzyme     called helicase, which breaks the hydrogen bonds between the     complementary bases pairs of DNA (A with T, C with G). This leads     to the separation of two single strands of DNA, creating a ‘Y’     shaped replication fork. The two separated strands serve as     templates for making new strands of DNA subsequently.
One of the strands is oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction     (towards the replication fork), whereas the other strand is     oriented in the 5’ to 3’ direction (away from the replication     fork).  Due to this difference in their orientation, the two     strands replicate differently.
A short piece of RNA sequence called primer (produced by an     "
Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," chemical extraction of the contents of flasks took place. The protocol followed was from the experiments performed by the secretion team when they were testing out past iGEM parts that were capable of producing PHB. After extraction, a white powder was collected at the bottom of the tubes.  The results are shown in the picture below.
Figure 20: Extracted PHB from PhaJPhaC-expressing cells cultured for 24 hours and inoculated with FSPS for 16 hours. PHB was extracted using TritonX-100, sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol in a series of washes and incubations.
Week 19 (Sep 4 - Sep 8)
We made overnight cultures of A+B beta-oxidation colonies 1-6 and pET29b(+)-phaCBA colonies 1-10 from the master plate that was streaked last week. We performed plasmid miniprep on these cells the next day. phaCBA was then digested using NotI and KpnI. We only digested pET29b(+)-phaCJ FadE (A+B) beta-oxidation colonies 3 and 5 with NotI and SalI; the other colonies did not show pure samples from the nanodrop. The plasmids were digested at 37 degrees in a water bath for 1.5 hours and then heat inactivated for 20 minutes immediately after. We ran the samples on the gel. We transformed pSB1C3 into E. coli DH5a and made overnight cultures of the E. coli.
Figure 21: Gel electrophoresis of pET29b(+)-phaC digested with NotI and HindIII and pET29b(+)-fadD digested with SalI and KpnI run on 1% agarose gel.
We sent pET29b(+)-phaCBA for sequencing because the gel bands confirmed the successful transformation of the part. The sequencing results showed that colony 9 was successfully ligated and cloned into E. coli DH5a.  Only one band was seen for A+B beta-oxidation so we decided to repeat the procedure again. We made overnights of the A+B beta-oxidation colonies 1-14 and performed the same procedures for plasmid isolation and digestion confirmation.
We also began putting our parts into the pSB1C3 backbone for the iGEM registry. We made overnight cultures of the E. coli transformed with pSB1C3, pET29b(+)-"

All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node"

Parts
TUST-iGEM 2018 team members are committed to the establishment of a wide range of diverse parts library. We have constructed a detection and degradation system for tetracycline and data and phenomena demonstrate that they are valid.
We use the Gibson assembly method to build our parts. This way we were able to generate our required parts in a fast and efficient way. Therefore, all of the parts we used are composite. The different basic parts comprising the composite parts are documented seperately, although they do not exist induvidually.
In the case of a constitutive expression, the promoter is included in the biobrick itself. For the inducible expression, we made use of a plasmid backbone containing a Tet-promoter ，a Lac-promoter and the LacI gene, which encodes for the Lac repressor. And we improve both the function and characterization of the some part to better express in our constructive chasis.

In a recent paper, Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz (2010) argue that the open source system, which has been widely used in the IT sector, can be an alternate solution to the patent framework to promote innovation. The aim of our approach is not to precisely characterize the way the ""open source approach"" could be adapted to the synthetic biology. It is to urge the iGEM community to get involved in a collective reflexion on its contribution to the development of a ""synthetic biology commons”.
The Commons: an alternative model
Open source softwares' users have been in even greater numbers for the last few years. According to a study made by Markess International in France in 2009, on 160 French companies, 92% had used open source softwares during that year. The viability of its mere founding principle explains its success : the involved software can be used freely with a license (“open source license”) authorizing it and even allowing its source code to be modified and enhanced by the licensed one. At first glance, such a model would seem to be inefficient as the software should not generate any profit : their license makes them indeed free to use. However, companies have opted for a business model involving services and proprietary software (“proprietary bricks”) that complement the open source product.
Besides, the mere nature of this emerging sector makes it very innovative : a whole community back it up by enhancing the software's source codes. This system also allows companies to make profit on a patent-free position. That is why such a successful example could serve as an inspiration for our reflexion.
From the open source software to the commons approach
The open source system functions thanks to a wide community literally owning the diverse software under license. This community defines the rights and duties attached to the use and development of this software. As a consequence, the open source can be considered as a case of commons, i.e. a resource jointly owned by a group. This vague and ancient term has covered various kinds of resources, namely natural resources (e.g. fisheries, pastures and forests) as well as the immaterial ones such as knowledge.
The commons' management has been belittled for a long time. Indeed, since the biologist Garett Hardin published his famous article entitled “The tragedy of the commons” in Science in 1968, the negative arguments he gave against the commons have tarnished it. Hardin postulates that one pursues its own interest and as a consequence if a resource (e.g. a pasture) were to be exploited freely"
Johns_Hopkins-BAG,2009,Team:Johns Hopkins-BAG#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," (constructed by Build-A-Genome students) 750 bp  Chunks (constructed from building blocks)            30 kb  Genome                      12 Mb
The Nomenclature
In all cases, the chromosome number and arm (left or right) is listed first, followed by   the design version, the chunk, the BB, then the oligo (which is prefaced with an ""o"" --   that's the letter ""o"" not a zero).For example, to refer to a...  ...chunk:  3L.3_23.B3  This is chunk B3 from the left arm of chromosome 3, design version 3_23.  ...BB:    3L.3_23.B3.1  This is BB 1 of chunk B3 from the left arm of chromosome 3, design version 3_23.  ...oligo:  3L.3_23.B3.1.o01  This is the first (most 5') oligo of BB1 of chunk B3, from the left arm of chromosome 3,   design version 3_23.
Oligo Plates 96-well plates of oligos are labeled as above, but designated ""p"" for plate. Multiple plates exist for each chunk, and are labeled p1, p2, p3, etc. For example:  3L.3_23.B3.p2    This is plate 2 of chunk B3, from the left arm of chromosome 3, design version 3_23.
Clones Applicable when sending clones (white colonies) off for sequencing. You will pick approximately 24 clones per BB for CSPCR, and send at least 12 off for sequencing. These 12 are labeled according to the convention laid out above, but have the designation ""c"" for clone. For example: 3L.3_23.B3.11.c05 This is clone 5 of BB 11 from chunk B3, from the left arm of chromosome 3, design version 3_23.
The Workflow
1. Oligo mixes – Oligos are distributed by the instructors in 96 well plates.  You will first make templateless PCR oligo mixes (TPMs) and outer primer mixes (OPMs) for use in the templateless PCR (TPCR) and finish PCR (FPCR), respectively.
2. Templateless PCR (TPCR) – The TPCR is performed to form a larger construct (the BB) from the oligo mixes.

1. Restriction digest for the riboswitch plasmid (3745 bp) with Fast Digest from NEB in total reaction of 20 ul. Set up the following reaction:
• Fast Digest buffer 2 µl
• EcoRI restriction enzyme 1 µl
• XbaI restriction enzyme 1 µl
• Plasmid 1 µg
• Nuclease free H2O until 20 µl
2. Run Gel Electrophoresis with 0.8% agarose at 150 V for 30 minutes. Gel extraction and concentration is measured with nano drop. Plasmid Concentration: 8.1 ng/µl
Gibson Assembly
1. Calculate the number of pmols needed for each fragment if we use 30 ng of the vectors.
(30ng X 1000)/(3745bp X 650)= 0.012 pmols
2. We used 3 fold of excess insert, so the number of pmols for plasmid will be 3 times the amount of insert we need (0.036 pmols).
Amount of SFR2 needed:
(x X 1000)/(1869bp X 650)= 0.036 pmols

British_Columbia,2012,Team:British Columbia#ConsortiaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". We received new ligase, and if that doesn't work, we are going to try the gibson assembly method. Using a previous restriction digest, we attempted another ligation of our new potential biobricks.
The first set of chemically competent cells did not grow anything. The procedure was repeated and completed today. The cells were transformed with a known plasmid and appropriately plated.
Rafael gave us 4 new electroshock cuvettes to temporarily replace the ones that we had destroyed. Joe used 3 of them to test his knockout, and as of today, there is one candidate colony growing on a 1/4 antibiotic concentration plate. A battery of tests have yet to be run to confirm that it is a knockout.
Yesterday, we went to Dr. Ramey, who had taught students who made a successful knockout using the lambda red system. They used a different recombineering plasmid than we did, and we received this plasmid. It was, however, growing in a strain that we were unfamiliar with, and we decided to isolate the plasmid and transform our Epi300 cells with it.  It is currently growing in a culture at 30°.
We received only the TrpB gene from the registry, and successfully grew it on a plate. We are now growing a culture to isolate the plasmid and if Joe's knockout is indeed a knockout, we can characterize the existing biobrick part by complementation.
We ordered the Gibson assembly kit, and it ran upwards of 700 dollars for 50 reactions.
Joe successfully PCR'd out the DszD gene from Rhodococcus genomic DNA that he isolated.
We made Tet, Kan, and Amp plates with 1/2 and 1/4 antibiotic concentration to try growing our knockouts. There was no growth from a resistance-less K12 cell on any of the plates tested.
Our PCR for the yddg and tyrA genes was unsuccessful.

July 1
There are many (hundreds) of colonies on Joe's recombineering plates, and the concentration of colonies goes up as the concentration of antibiotic goes down. It appears that the addition of arabinose to the culture did nothing to increase recombineering efficiency. There are several large, well defined colonies on the full antibiotic plate. It appears that 2 days are required for sufficient growth at 30°.
With this success in mind, I PCR purified a couple of other knockouts (ArgE Tet and TrpB Kan) and transformed them, reusing the electroshock cuvet"

Improving on MARS
The 2017 Boston University iGEM Hardware team, MARS, created a repository of chip designs called the MARS Repository. The MARS Repository contains design information and files of the nine different synthetic biology protocol chips MARS had designed. The data contained in the MARS Repository is open to the public and allows synthetic biologists to utilize microfluidics without designing a custom microfluidic chip.
A main goal of our project is to increase the accessibility of microfluidics, so we have decided to uploaded the documentation and design files of the microfluidic chips we have designed to the MARS repository. We have created the following chips and introduced them to the MARS Repository:

TERRA Adapter
The TERRA Adapter is a scalable, predesigned chip that is capable of selectively dispensing the output of the microfluidic chip running the experiment into the intended lab vessel. The TERRA Adapter serves to increase the number of and types of microfluidic chips that are compatible with our system. This makes the system more user-friendly, as they don’t have to design a chip that both completes a biological experiment and is capable of selecting the proper output to be dispensed.

This chip was designed to encapsulate sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and cells suspended in media in droplets for later use in the Harvard iGEM team’s keratin skin patches. These chips consist of three aqueous inputs that combine without mixing into one input that is then pinched by the oil channels at the droplet generator to create droplets.

Inspired by the InterLab Study, this series of chips attempt to follow the protocol of running three consecutive 1:20 dilutions followed by a pair of consecutive 1:10 dilutions. These sequences of mixers are then paired with an valve actuated output selection mechanism such that either the third, fourth, or fifth dilutions can be selectively dispensed onto an agar plate.

Yale,2011,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," expressing RiAFP exhibit increased survival post-freezing. Relative freezing tolerance was calculated by determining number of viable cells before and after freezing from three biological replicates. Survival rates for cells expressing RiAFP increased by up to 60% relative to the vector control (p < 0.05). Uninduced transgenic cells also exhibited increased survivability, likely due to leaky expression in the BL21*(DE3) strain.
RiAFP inhibits ice recrystallization in a concentration-dependent manner. Serial dilutions of purified RiAFP inhibited ice crystal formation in a dose-dependent manner compared to BSA control solutions. Two ice recrystallization inhibition assays, the splat assay and the capillary assay, were used to demonstrate this effect.
RiAFP has cryoprotective effects on rat liver: Tissue frozen in the presence of RiAFP showed decreased perforation on the whole as well as increased cell survival and tissue integrity.
To read more about our functional assays, please visit our assays page.
MAGE: Optimization of antifreeze protein:
RiAFP was successfully integrated into the genome of the EcNR2 strain. In vivo genomic engineering was performed using the lambda-red recombination system. The RiAFP gene was linked to kanamycin by crossover PCR. dsDNA recombination efficiency data from Conjugative Assembly Genome Engineering experiments (Isaacs, et al 2011) was used to identify 3 highly recombinogenic sites in the EcNR2 genome.
Four hundred and thirty four million predicted combinatorial genomic variants of the RiAFP gene have been generated thus far. This is a diverse population of insertion, deletion, and mismatch mutants for the hypothesized ice-binding region of RiAFP. Using multiplex automated genome engineering, we were able to generate more potential “biobricks” than currently exist in the iGEM registry! We are in the process of screening mutants for enhanced survivability and performing iterations of the MAGE cycle.
(Right) Figure modified from Wang et al., 2009.
To read more about our MAGE experiments, please visit our MAGE page.
X-ray crystallography:
As a recently discovered hyperactive antifreeze protein, RiAFP has thus far only had its primary protein structure, with no predicted homologies/models for its secondary structure.  Thus, we have begun protein crystallography to determine the structure of RiAFP (and eventually of MAGE-generated variants) to understand the source of its potent antifreeze activity.  Preliminary and promising “fuzzy-ball” crystal hits for RiAFP have been obtained thus far"

The upper blue and red boxes are in the position about 26kDa are GFP protein (25.8kDa). The lower red box in the position of about 20kDa is GvpC-20 (20kDa).
Because the GvpA protein can’t be seen on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we wanted to use GFP to detect the expression of GvpA. We use a polycistron of gvpA (gvpC) and gfp to detect the RFU. We can see that, the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 2000, and the RFU of Gvp and GFP Generator is about 4000, while top 10 is about 0 as control. (Figure26)First, the RFU of these parts are rather high. Second, the E.Coli with these two plasmids can float. Third, we can see GvpC on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. So, we can see the two parts can express Gvp Protein and work well.

Design:
When we first started our project, we took a trip to our local Safeway to catalog products containing triclosan. We discovered that many products had already phased out triclosan; some labels even read “Triclosan Free.”  Although triclosan had been removed from products, many of them had simply replaced it with a different antimicrobial.
This trend reminded us of what Arlene Blum told us about how when chemicals are removed from use manufacturers look for a replacement; but because these chemicals need to serve similar functions they often have similar structures, and thus similar consequences. What results is a cycle whereby one toxic chemical is replaced by another toxic chemical.
We didn’t want to raise fear over triclosan use and contribute to this cycle. Instead we wanted to raise awareness around appropriate chemical use and reduce the use of chemicals in cases where there is no proven benefit.
This lead us to supplementing our triclosan biosensor with an, “antimicrobial footprint app,” to get consumers thinking about whether antimicrobial agents are even warranted in consumer products.
Deliverable:
We designed our app as a heuristic to raise awareness about the unnecessary ubiquity of antimicrobials in consumer products.  In the app, the user can click on an “About” tab to learn more about antimicrobials and how to be a responsible consumer.  They can then go on to calculate their “Antimicrobial Footprint.” The user is able to click on antimicrobial containing products that they use, and see how it affects their total footprint. After using the app’s antimicrobial calculator to calculate their footprint, the user can submit their footprint along with their location. On the final page of the app the user is able to see how their footprint compares to the average footprint of other users. The submitted data is used to calculate this average, as well as to create a heat map of antimicrobial usage in the United States. This is another deliverable that users can look at to become more educated consumers.

ECUST
This year, we developed a close relationship with an iGEM new comer—ECUST iGEM team.
Since SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is a more experienced team, we offer our help to new team to our best. In July 30, we visited ECUST, having a face-to-face meeting and a lab tour. In the meeting, we helped them get a brief idea of what                             modeling, human practice are, and gave them some advice on project designing, collaboration and visa application.
Besides continuous communication, two teams collaborated on experiments. When their experiment encountered problems we helped then transform the part they needed.
In return, when we failed so many times in transforming CrtI ,they did the transformation for us which helped us proceed our project smoothly. Also, they provided us with pSB1C3 when we were short of plasmid skeleton.
And here is a table shows briefly what we have done for each other. For more information, please visit ECUST collaboration page.

Shanghai Tech University
In July 2017, we visited Shanghai Tech University and participated in their meetup. During the meetup, we listened to their project introduction and discussed some details with them about modeling and Human Practice. In the meeting,                             we suggested them to think about finding an application for their project.
ZJUT-China
In April 2017, iGEM ZJUT-China team visited SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team in the Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is the first year of ZJUT-China to attend iGEM competition. So the team members came to communicate                             with our team. They shared their project and our instructor commented on their project and gave some advice. Students also had a communication on iGEM competition that it is not simply a scientific research program but connecting                             with society by Human Practice.

University of Virginia
Initial Contact: We got in contact with a lot of American teams over our project, but the team at the University of Virginia played a key role in the development of our perchlorate assay, and giving us an idea of what American based water companies test for in supplies.
Cooperation: We sent Virginia our perchlorate assay and COSHH form, and they undertook test on tap water. They even did two! We then received back the results from their local water report, which showed us that perchlorate is currently not a compound that's tested for in water supplies. Alongside this, we received their assay results, helping determine the sensitivity of a perchlorate assay we developed. Here is a pdf of their results!
Follow-Up: The team at the University of Virginia have helped amazingly with the perchlorate assay aspect of our project, confirming its sensitivity, and we'd like to thank them hugely. Best of luck to them, and we look forward to supporting them at the Giant Jamboree. #TeamVirginia
University of Warwick
Initial Contact: The University of Warwick e-mailed us to get in touch over water sample collection. Some of our team met them at the UK meet-up in Oxford in July, to hand over the samples collected from all over Exeter.
Cooperation: As the Warwick team are looking into water pollutants and the removal of them, specifically lead, legionella and oestrogen, they asked us for four water samples from different points around Exeter. Due to the size of Exeter's estuary, and the river Exe running through it, we were happy to help. This impacted on their project as they tested for oestrogen, and then used the sample to isolate bacteria that may have the ability to degrade oestrogen. This led to further understanding of how rare degradation circuits are, and showed an improvement on Tawiwan's 2017 circuit.
Follow-Up: Warwick followed up with how our water samples impacted on their project. We wish Warwick the best of luck in this countdown week, and look forward to supporting them at the Jamboree! #TeamWarwick

Flagellin are the constituent subunits of the helical filament substructure of bacterial flagella. In the flagellar-building process, flagellin are exported out of the cell sequentially by the flagellum-specific export apparatus. F. Vonderviszt et al. demonstrated through their work that the signal sequence responsible for allowing the flagellar export system to identify and export Salmonella flagellin is its 26-47 amino acid residue segment [ 18 ].

Expression of Art-175 in literature done in E. coli as host, implying that upon production Art-175 is not able to bypass inner membrane to reach peptidoglycan and exert lytic activity. We have cloned our Art-175 constructs into E. coli as a proof-of-concept.
Induction of expression of Art-175 should not kill expression host, whereas the secretion-tagged Art-175 should be able to lyse peptidoglycan layer and kill expression host cell upon initial export through inner membrane (DsbA- and YebF-) or straight to the extracellular medium (Fla-).

Each group contains students from at least two different -and often completely opposite- studies. An example is Physics and Psychology. These groups tour around Leiden, doing all kinds of fun activities, like canoeing, partying and board games. There is also a batch of Cultural activities taking place in the ‘Van Der Werf’ park. We were invited to perform during this carousel of activities. We will mainly make bio-art with people, like we did during Night at the Museums.
August 16th - 18th, 2016 - IWBDA Newcastle upon Tyne, UK
The eighth international Workshop on Bio-design Automation brings together researchers from the synthetic biology, systems biology, and design automation communities. This year Newcastle upon Tine was the host city or this event. During several sessions and presentations different aspects of the field of synthetic biology and the efforts to create computer-aided design tools addressing synthetic biology's specific design needs were being discussed. Four members of our team got the chance to take place in this community and learn from the design automation community. We were allowed to present our project to the audience and show our scientific poster. Besides a lot of interesting questions and advices, we even received a prize for best poster.
September 17th - Night of Art and Knowledge
The Night of Art and Knowledge was quite similar to the Night at the Museums, but even much bigger. However, this night fitted our science related topic better. This night was another opportunity to spread the news of our project and about synthetic Biology. So right between the amazing knife collections in the National Museum of History, we stalled out our plate stacks of bacteria in beautiful colors and more than 400 agar-plates where people could make their own bacterial art while being talked to about the most fascinating synthetic biology topics, including our mission to Mars. This was also again a great opportunity to ask people their opinion on this field and genetic modification - so that’s why we also conducted surveys, just as the ones we did for the pilot study at the Night of the Museum. Thereby, visitors got the chance to fire our team with interesting questions regarding our project, which we were more than happy to answer and the Random Positioning Machine was rotating again with garden cress - because who doesn’t want to know what microgravity does to small organisms?
Overall, the night was very successful and reactions from all around us were filled with joy and excitement. Just to see everyone create artwork with living organisms instead of paper and pencil and to get people excited about"

We recognize the importance of collaboration in the validation of the ElectroPen's functionality, and in next year's project, will conduct a larger international collaboration study with the ElectroPen to further demonstrate reproducibility and the versatility.
The tutorials and instructions to build the ElectroPen system have not yet been released as an open-access publication comprising of these documents will soon be released. However, all interested teams may visit our booth during the exhibition session at Jamboree to register to participate in a mini-InterLab Study for the ElectroPen with supplies provided by us!
Figure 7: a We worked with TAS_Taipei to validate the ElectroPen’s efficacy, and through two trials conducted, they successfully demonstrated that electroporation using the device was successful. b Collaboration with the University of Georgia team on 3 different trials also indicated the same results, validating the performance of the ElectroPen."

BNU-CHINA,2015,Team:BNU-CHINA#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," our survey in Hebei Province we collected soil and plant samples containing the whole plant of soybean with dwarfish stem and yellow leaves whose growth were apparently slower than the other conspecies around. The samples were processed immediately on returning to laboratory, to observe the condition of nematodes and to conduct some statistics analysis.
Fig. 14 Soil nematodes screening in our lab
The sample was dealt following the modified Baermann funnel method. First, roots of the sample are cut off and split into matchstick-shaped slices, which, after packaged with gauze, are immersed with aseptic water for 12 hours. Then, 50 gram liquid samples collected from the immersion  are observed and compared with the aseptic water the next day. It was observed that nematodes presented in 4 of the samples while no nematodes was found in the contrast groups. Photograph of the experimental group and control group were displayed as follow.
Fig. 15 The observed result of the isolated nematodes from sampled gathered in Heibei field
Afterwards we consulted professor Li Hongmei in the College of Plant Protection, Nanjing University to find out the classification of the extracted nematodes. Professor Li informed us that according to esophagus features, the nematode from figure-A can be identified as Aphelenchida which possibly has something to do with plant parasite, whereas nematodes B~E are Rhabditida that live saprophytism and are not plant parasite, and nematode F is recognized as Dorylaimida that lives a free life. Therefore we can conclude that there actually were nematodes as plant parasite in the samples we collected. Few as the farmers may seem, the potential threatening of the agriculture nematode still exists.
However, according to our previous investigation, we found that the local farmers had no idea of the nematode pest, and meanwhile the relevant administrative department hadn’t prepare any contingency plan at all, which indicated a possibility of huge financial loss if nematode pest broke out some day. So we are looking forward to a further investigation and popularization of science in our future work, testing the nematodes condition in soil and popularize some knowledge relevant to nematodes and its prevention to the local residents. And in this way we hope that we can help them work in the agricultural grass-roots to nip the nematode possible disaster in the bud.
Proposal
According to our investigation, we summarized our finding into a proposal which may offer guidance to the state government. At the same time, we hope that every team in this"

JUDGING FORM
Safety
Safety first! Synthetic biologists try to solve problems using biology - and can do so in new, innovative, and powerful ways. However, it is all moot if we create new problems in the process!
Safe Project Design
Our project was designed with safety in mind! If our intended project works, the bacteria should not be able to survive outside the confines of the lab
Safe Lab Work
We practiced safe lab work - gloves and lab coats were worn when appropriate (nearly always) and waste was disposed of appropriately
Our autoclave was used to prepare sterile media, sterilize instruments, and discard biological samples
Most of our work was performed in a Class-II Laminar Flow Hood - keeping our samples sterile, and preventing their spread within the room
Safe Shipment
Samples were shipped safely - samples were shipped in petri dishes or 96 well plates, either hand delivered or shipped via FedEx, wrapped in secondary containers/material (parafilm & saran wrap) and standard shipping evenlopes"

Prions
Prions are self-perpetuating proteins that have a soluble, normally functional form and an additional insoluble form known as aggregates or amyloids (Tyedmers et.al, 2010). They are self-propagating conformations that have the ability to transmit phenotypes that are not caused by changes in nucleic acid formations (Tyedmers et.al, 2010). The first prions that were discovered were disease-prions, notably in mammalian diseases including sheep scrapie and human Creutzfeldt- Jacob (Liebman & Chernoff, 2012). These diseases were transmitted by infectious conformational isoforms of proteins, which in turn convert other proteins into the isoform (Liebman & Chernoff, 2012). To date, there are over thirty human diseases associated with the formation of prions (Liebman & Chernoff, 2012).
Currently, there are seven-known prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each with a different function and phenotype (Tyedmers et.al, 2010). Although there are no general sequence similarity among all the seven prions, there is a heightened expressed level of asparagine and glutamine residues in all the prions (Tyedmers et.al, 2010).
Modularity of Prions
New prion domains and functions and reporters found to make synthetic prions- leading to new natural prions (Wickner et.al, 2000). A hybrid prion protein can be formed by fusing different prion domains into the corresponding protein filaments (Wickner et.al, 2000). However, this hybridization is very selective - as it will not combine with all protein filaments (Wickner et.al, 2000).
Reasoning for Usage
By using the self-perpetuating qualities of the prion domain as a tool, alternative forms of various proteins can be induced. This can occur through the enhancement of an existing function, or transferring a new one. Through this mechanism, in future research and applications, isoforms of proteins can be produced and manipulated for the desired effect or product. Applications of this project can be found here.

These conferences discussed iGEM EPFL’s experience with cell free systems optimization, especially with linear DNA expression templates. Moreover, the EPFL team benefited from Athens’ team knowledge             and experience with kit design to start the kit design for our diagnostic tool. The collaboration finally materialized with Yannis from iGEM Athens visiting the EPFL team and spending some time with us in the lab. The discussion revolved mainly             on continuing the projects beyond the iGEM competition, and especially the realization of a diagnostics kit. Both teams are planning on developing models for a diagnostic toolkit, as well as models for the 3D printing of their device enclosures.             The two teams decided on setting a framework for the shared realization of these goals.
iGEM GreatBay China
We had the privilege of collaborating with Great Bay China , a high School team from Shenzhen. We received numerous tips and good advice about poster design, the flow that iGEM presentations should have as well as information about common                   pitfalls and how to avoid them. On our side, we were able to help them with identifying backup plans to perform the last step of their transformation chemically, since the enzyme performing this action is unknown to this day.
The Artistic Side of Synthetic Biology
Bring Science Out of Your Lab!
This year, the EPFL iGEM Team gave the opportunity to iGEMers from all over the world to compete on a new level… Art! We know how hard it is for iGEM teams to think about art before the Giant Jamboree, and  we hoped to inspire teams to look at the artistic side of their experiments.
Indeed we are convinced that art is a domain which people from all backgrounds can appreciate. This is the reason why we organised a contest of artistic images from team’s experiments! A way for us to open the dialog with the public about our project and, more broadly, about biology.
Here are some of the entries that we had, we were very grateful to all the teams that participated in this photo contest, and we hope that more teams will start to explore the interface between biology and art in the future.

PCR of electro comp expression plasmids
We performed a mini-prep of the cultures that we grew overnight of the electrocompetent cells. We then performed a PCR on the product of the mini-prep, checking for the 1.4 kb cross junction to confirm the presence of our omega+ultramers+spec plasmid. We used the same recipe as the PCR we performed on Tuesday .
Description of gel below.
No bands appeared for PCR peformed on a 1 to 10 dilution of the cultures. Miniprep product from colonies 78, 79, and 82 had the expected band at 1.4 kb, while 80 and 81 had a band that was slightly smaller than the the expected product size. We saw a similar band in our PCR of the isothermal assembly reaction product . We are unsure exactly what is causing this band. If either the omega subunit or ultramers were missing from the plasmid, a similar sized product would result since both are ~350 bp. We are curious if a plasmid can still be formed if one of these components were missing.
We checked the concentrations of our miniprep product to see if that would explain our problem.
ID     Conc. (ng/ul)     260/280     1.4 kb band? 78      16.12             2.10            Y 79      41.64             1.64            Y 80       5.84             2.01            N 81      61.24             1.62            N 82      20.25             1.72            Y
We can't tell whether the concentration of the miniprep product contributed to the strange band we saw. 81 had the highest concentration but still didn't work. We decided to try plating 4 more colonies from 80 and 81, to see if any of them have the appropriate band.
We also decided to make final plates of cultures 78, 79, and 82, using 2 ul of culture and 50 ul of LB+spec. They were plated on new spec plates. We will incubate them at 37* overnight.
Checking the expression plasmid plates
All the plates had colonies on them, although there were still areas of unspecific growth, presumably because of uneven dil"

Short Summary
At first, we took a closer view on recent and previous projects of the iGEM community and biotechnology in general during the literature workshop to gain first ideas about publicly and scientifically interesting projects.  Furthermore, we informed ourselves on different technologies that can be used for projects as ours including single molecule real time sequencing. Soon, we recognized that biosafety is a great aspect of biotechnology in general that has to be regarded carefully for our project. Thus, we deepened our knowledge in this area, creating our own Biosafety Report to enable everyone to reproduce our efforts. However, we did not only encounter biosafety but also more general aspects and concerns about our project when talking to experts. As we wanted to have a oublic opinion on these, we created the ChImp Report that features chances and implications of our project.
Biosafety Report
Many teams need to deal with biosafety issues during the competition. ""Is our organism hazardous?"" or ""What will happen if it escapes from the lab?"" For this reason, the iGEM HQ offers various opportunities to obtain information like the safety policies, safe lab work guidelines or"

1. CCIC in Peking University
In this summer, our team members attended in CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) meeting, which is organized by Peking University School of Life Science.
All iGEM teams in China came here, shared ideas and presented their projects. We learned a lot from others and they also provided us some precious advices. For example, they taught us how to immobilize our constructed bacterias so it won’t cuase any biosafety problems.
I still remembered that we exchanged a piece of our pizza so we could eat different taste of it. We really enjoy this meeting and we hope every year there would be a sharing meeting like this in China!
2.iGEM club---Light For Your Mind.
To share ideas with people who have the same interest in synthetic biology, we set up a iGEM club named Light For Your Mind. Every week we will choose a theme, every club member  read literatures or something else about this theme. On every thursday, we will hold a party and share ideas about this topic. For example, as the picture below shows, one of the members was raising a question and the rest of us was talking about it.

4. Survey about formaldehyde
In order to find how deep the pollution of formaldehyde affects people, our team made a survey and did a research in Changchun. The survey and details are as follows.
Results: All the participants know formaldehyde and its harmfulness, but only 30 percent have examined the condition of harmful gases indoor. In spite of this, they all show interest in products that can detect and decrease the concentration of formaldehyde. The attitude towards price is showed in Figure 1."

Queen's Canada iGEM team was very excited to collaborate with various other iGEM teams this past summer. Together, we were able to build a stronger iGEM community, and progress in our respective projects - the insight of others providing great advancement.
This year, QGEM collaborated with the Ontario Genetically Engineered Machine (oGEM) Collective, which is composed of iGEM teams from the universities of Toronto, Guelph (new this year), Waterloo, McMaster, and Ottawa. With oGEM, we meet several times during the year to discuss ways to promote iGEM in Ontario, funding strategies, project troubleshooting, and new ways to collaborate for wet lab, dry lab, and policy and practice departments.
One of the oGEM collaborations featured this year was promoting iGEM to new potential teams, and creating a detailed database of helpful tips and tricks for wiki development - a task most teams noticeably struggle with. Through web conferencing, email, and simply communicating ideas in person at the oGEM meetings, these valuable tidbits and thoughts were shared. The ability to discuss QGEM's wiki struggles with others, and gain insight into possible methods of remediation, was extremely valuable to QGEM.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter
This summer, the University of Calgary initiated a Canadian iGEM Newsletter - a fantastic opportunity QGEM was eager to participate in. As each participating iGEM team shared monthly recaps (pertaining to all aspects of their respective projects), QGEM was able to easily learn what other iGEM teams were up to. Thus, allowing faster communication between teams given a deeper understanding of each other's work, and therefore, stronger collaborations. QGEM has participated in all Canadian iGEM Newsletters to date (two volumes).
Participation in the Canadian iGEM Newsletter allowed QGEM to realize the parallels existing between QGEM's project, and Waterloo's. Ultimately resulting in communicating the idea of a collaboration between the two teams.

    Heathrow Scientific
Dr Badge, Christopher, Luke and Anthony met up with the company's Global Sales Director, Mark Shelton, in a University car park to receive the delivery: a trolley load of ex-display laboratory equipment. We had time to chat with Mark about the project and for him to take us through the collection of equipment and consumable items.  The boxes of equipment included (amongst many other things) a mini-centrifuge, an orbital shaker, a Rota-Filler 3000 (a type of pipette filler for larger volumes), a large box of disposable spreaders and a wide assortment of containers, dispensers and tube racks. The racks included an adjustable universal test tube rack that you could turn upside down for easy emptying of liquids.
All of this equipment has been of great use in the project, especially the orbital shaker and Rota-Filler 3000 when running the Polystyrene Growth experiments in the minimal media as these had to be kept shaking for long periods of time. The Mini centrifuge and mini interchangeable tube rack was also essential for running the PCR as we didn't have a centrifuge in the lab that would accept small tubes. The spreaders were vital for the colony counting experiments.
It is fantastic that, despite the dire economic situation, companies like Heathrow Scientific are still able to come up with creative ways to support great ideas like iGEM, and their contribution is hugely significant

Calgary,2017,Team:Calgary#Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," research, we realized that pSB1A3 is incompatible with pSB1C3 and that transforming cells with both of these plasmids at the same time would not be possible. This led us to attempt to create a ""super"" pSB1C3 plasmid containing both our Phasin-HlyA Tag part and PhaCAB from Imperial College. Sam used XbaI and SpeI to cut Phasin-HlyA Tag out of the pSB1A3 backbone and ligate it into pSB1C3-PhaCAB that had been linearized with XbaI. This ligation was unsuccessful and will be re-attempted next week.
Kaitlin and Lalit prepared the Phasin-HlyA Tag protein fractions collected by Lalit in Week 17 for running on an SDS-Page Gel. First, Sigma-Aldrich anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel resin was prepared, as per manufacturer's instructions. Then each sample fraction was incubated with the anti-FLAG resin in order to help isolate our Phasin-HlyA Tag (which has a FLAG tag) from the large volume of other proteins present in the samples.
Week 24 (October 10 - October 13, 2017)
Unfortunately, the SDS-Page gel run in Week 23 did not work, even after our samples had been incubated with anti-FLAG resin. All lanes, even the controls appeared empty, therefore it is believed that the resin was not properly prepared and all proteins were eluted out of the samples.
Kaitlin re-attempted the creating of a pSB1C3 ""super"" plasmid with both PHB-secreting (Phasin-HlyA Tag) and PHB-producing genes (PhaCAB from Imperial College). She followed the same digestion as Sam in Week 23, where pSB1C3-PhaCAB was linearized with XbaI and Phasin-HlyA Tag was removed from pSB1A3 with XbaI and SpeI. However, she then ran the digested products on a 1% Low-Melting-Point agarose gel, excised the linearized backbone and Phasin-HlyA Tag insert, and ligated the two together (see protocols here ).
A lot of work was done on the wiki, such as updating the secretion journal and writing content for various pages.

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

We helped the SCU-China team to test the antimicrobial activity of their designed antimicrobial peptide Cecropin XJ. We also helped the UESTC-software-China team to design some primers for their project.
3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.

In synthetic biology and iGEM, the biosafety issue is seriously considered. Another big threat to public health is the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. We aimed to build a markerless visual selection system for L. lactis, which would have the potential to be used as a live vector in human. However, we lacked the knowledge about the exact situation of multiple drug resistant bacteria and biological containment. Thus, we consulted Doctor Gong and Doctor Li to obtain their instruction and seek advice from them on our project design. We really appreciated the valuable advice they gave. We finally improved our project design to be antibiotic resistance gene free and biologically contained. At the CCiC conference, Doctor Zhang Haoqian gave us suggestions that we should add some quantitative results to our project, and we made adjustments accordingly. To popularize synthetic biology and iGEM, we created a special coloring book for education and public engagement.

After the counseling with Doctor Gong and Doctor Li, we decided to establish the markerless visual selection system and we also chose the His segment as the targeting locus to achieve biological containment. After the CCiC, we further carried out some experiments to obtain the positive rate and the accuracy rate of the blue-white selection system. We finished these quantitative experiments and found that the accuracy rate is  100%, even only"

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html,"84151 vector. pMTL84151 contains the ColE1 origin of replication for use in Gram-negative organisms as well as a Gram-positive origin of replication so that it can be used as a shuttle plasmid between E. coli and C. difficile.
The method used for our GFP assay can be found in our Labfolder. Briefly, reporter plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α after which an overnight culture was grown. The overnight culture was used to inoculate test cultures which were normalised to the same starting optical density (OD). After six hours of growth at 37°C shaking at 220 RPM the optical density was measured and cell samples were taken. Fluorescence was calculated using excitation at 485 nm and measuring emission at 525 nm. This fluorescence value was then normalised to the optical density to give fluorescence per OD unit. The positive [BBa_I20270] and negative [BBa_R0040] controls used were the same as those used in the 2018 InterLab study.
The strongest promoter of our set was PCac_thl (0.3235µM) which was around three times stronger than the positive control [BBa_I20270]. The second strongest clostridial promoter we tested (PCsp_fdx) was slightly less strong than the positive control. The remaining two clostridial promoter PCdi_tcdA and PCdi_tcdB only weakly expressed in E. coli, though both showed activity significantly higher than the negative control [BBa_R0040]. The three existing parts we characterised with a novel RBS showed a range of expression levels as expected [BBa_J23106, BBa_J23114, and BBa_J23119]. We conclude that these promoters are capatible with the novel RBS part [Bba_K2715009] we added to them.
Figure 1. Relative expression of GFP from each of the seven promoter constructs in E. coli from a six hour culture. The positive and negative controls are those used in the Interlab study, BBa_I20270 and BBa_R0040 respectively. The results represent the mean of four technical replicates with error bars representing the standard error of the mean. All values were calculated using calibration curves generated in the Interlab study, corrected for optical density and reported relative to the equivalent μM of fluorescein.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Results Jack_-_-_TEXT.html," at concentrations according to the main effects screening design. The experiment was repeated using two separate batches of cell extract; one which was initially moderately active (extract one) and one which initially had low activity (extract two). The results for each are shown below. It can be seen that for extract 1, the CFPS reaction with the highest CFPS activity was that with the original premix composition (R21), suggesting that the supplement solution was already near optimal. This is not surprising as the extract was already showing moderately high activity. Conversely, for extract 2, the reaction using the original premix was not the one with the highest CFPS activity. Similar to the first main effects screening design analysis performed, endpoint data was used with JMP to build a model predicting the important factors for each extract (bar charts below). This analysis shows that the most important factors vary greatly between each extract.

Contrast values are used as an estimate of a factor’s effect on the response. a) From CFPS system data utilising the moderately active extract (extract 1). b) From the CFPS system data utilising the low activity extract (extract 2).
Conclusions and Future Work
This study has begun multifactorial analysis on the components of the supplemental solution for cell free protein synthesis systems. It has provided evidence that some supplements have a greater effect on a systems protein synthesis activity than others, and that the important factors may differ between cell extract batches. The ability to use a Design of Experiments approach towards the optimisation of CFPS systems has also been demonstrated. While this study has provided evidence towards these claims, further work should be performed to validate the findings. A DoE screening design for the supplements of CFPS systems should be used on the same cell extract batch repeatedly. This will help confirm that the screening models derived from the experimental design data are accurate. The screening design should also be performed on many different batches of at least moderately active cell extracts to"

Fig. 2 Ligation of MaSp2 6-mer. The expected product for a 6-mer ligation is ~712 bp. There are other bands present that may be due to other possible ligation events.
We successfully created a 6-mer ligation product without beads, although the results is far from efficient due to the presence of a number of bands that correspond to other ligation events.
We excised the 712 bp band for gel extraction tomorrow.
We plan to PCR amplify the 6-mer and ligate it into pSB1C3.
This result indicates that successive ligation can only be perfomed twice, as ligation efficiency decreases dramatically. This means that for creating larger MaSp constructs such as 12- or 15-mers, we would need successive ligation and purification steps to achieve efficient construction."

10.0082g + 10.0074g  Lennox Base
1 L water
Making ampicillin stock solution:
Collected information about ampicillin - Typical concentrations of ampicillin are 50 ug/mL for low copy plasmids and 100 ug/mL for high copy plasmids.  Stock solutions are usually in 100 mg/mL.  Ampicillin will last about 4-6 months or 1 year (according to different sources) when stored in dH2O at -20 degrees C.  It will only last about 3 days at 37 degrees C.   We will begin to use 100 mg of ampicillin per liter of LB, as opposed to what we used in the past, which was only 10 mg per L.  Our concentration for plates was already 100 mg/L, so this will remain unchanged.
1.0001g of ampicillin dissolved in 10 mL.  This yields a concentration of approximately 100 mg/mL.  Solution was extremely frothy and difficult to manage, so we attempted to continue dissolving into 100 mL instead.  However, this also resulted in a fair amount of undissolved ampicillin.  Read online that sometimes with ampicillin trihydrate powder it is easier to dissolve if one adds 10 M NaOH to the solution.  We had 5 N NaOH, so we added 20 uL.  This appeared to work, so we added an additional 80 uL.  The mixture was a little cloudy still, so we decided to simply add powdered ampicillin to some of the freshly autoclaved LB.  This should work for a while until we get our stock solution.
Note that the transformation protocol from the Silver Lab indicates a minimum DNA concentration of 250 ng/u"

Overview
We regard safety regulations as a necessity for our own well being and the environment. A high-quality solution of a problem is of no value if the damaged created exceeds the benefits of the solution.
Like any other work, the work in laboratories has its own workplace health and safety regulations. In our About Our Lab , About Our Project , and the Final Safety Form we described how we handle chemicals, microorganism and waste in our laboratory, and how we think our organism and bioreactor will be used by other people.
During the competition period we have collaborated and discussed about safety issues with many iGEM teams, but also with people from community labs and the industry.
Risks of our Biological Project
Our project falls into the category of metabolic engineering and our genetically modified cells are not intended for any use outside of an industrial facility. On the other hand, handling genetically modified organisms and methanol in a production facility does require several safety measures.
Not only did we discuss biosafety throughout our project, but we were also very aware of working responsibly and safely with methanol in our growth experiments. Learn more about it on our safety form .
Risks and Chances for Methanol in the Industry
Methanol is an important part of the chemical industry as it is used for plastics, paints, glues, and pharmaceuticals. It is also increasingly used as biodiesel, as gasoline blends, and in fuel cells. But methanol belongs to “Flammable Liquids” Class 3.2 (Primary Class) and “Toxic Substances” Class 6.1 (Secondary Class) [1] so it is quite dangerous to handle. Problematic situations especially occur when methanol gets out of a continuous, closed system"

TU_Darmstadt,2018,Team:TU Darmstadt#FUN_-_-_TEXT.html," our wine hiking tour.
The group feeling was enhanced by different occasions such as a trip to Austria, team member´s birthday parties and game nights with never ending werewolf sessions. Even broken tabletops, a long car ride with stressed drivers and passengers having a broken foot couldn´t stop our vibe. Just too fast rollercoaster rides decreased the optimistic faces of some passengers.  We even taught the chemists how to biology.
The chemists fit in really well!
Who said a summer toboggan run would be fun?!
As part of the Human Practices, we participated at the “Hessentag” and supported our state Hessen in presenting funded biological research projects. As always, our main goal was, to spread the fun about biology.  Spread the style to the public.
And then there were the times, we went to mingle with other iGEMers at meetups. We sure had lots of fun meeting everyone, seeing their projects and talking synthetic biology. However, some of us might have gotten teams mixed up. This is was when one of our members seemed to believe, he belonged to Munich.
Some of us just can't let iGEM go and see their lab group everywhere they go. Might be a sign of real love!
Usual night out at iGEM TU Darmstadt.
Inside every guy a little boy is hidden.
Team leaders at work (even the calendar helps)!
And of course, helpful as always, planning lab work for the groups.
We had such a hot summer this year and still worked in the lab every day. In fact, it was so hot outside that some of us started going a bit crazy.
We also want to introduce the best employee of the year & our hearts;
Learning what the do's and don'ts of the lab are, can take some time. Some of us had to wait outside, because they didn't have the right footwear.
Even on vacation iGEM never sleeps. Be aware!
Games nights after our team meetings quickly became a given! Here's what a session of Werwolf with iGEM TUDA looks like.
Best friends share their lives, and yogurt!
iGEM TUDA cooks and iGEM TUDA rocks.
Wiki Freeze was really tiring and stressful. On top of that, we believed it to be a good idea to have fotoshoot day during it was well. This is how this turned endeavor turned out.
All in all, we had an amazing year, filled with lots of fun times!"

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Colony PCR products were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in TAE buffer.
- 5 μL of PCR product was pipetted into each lane (no loading buffer required as PCR buffer contains loading buffer).
- 4 µL of 500 bp DNA ladder
- 80 V for 30 minutes
- The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
