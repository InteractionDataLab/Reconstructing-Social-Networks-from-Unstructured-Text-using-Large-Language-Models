Penn,2011,Team:Penn State_-_-_TEXT.html," photosynthesis using the BCHM gene or to engineer a serotonin sensor. We thought about making a bacterial fuel cell by using Geobacter as a sacrificial anode. We also liked the idea of using bacteria to perform intelligent tasks, like mathematical arithmetic. The last idea we developed was to engineer a bacteria that would be able to detect radiation. The team spent a few days researching these topics to determine how plausible they would be and after a few days of background research unanimously agreed upon the bacterial radiation detector. As we dug deeper into our topic we narrowed our focus. We discovered that the Penn State 2007 iGEM team had used the lambda phage system to also develop a bacteria that would test for radiation and thought this would be a great area to expand. They were not able to fully assemble their device or test it so we came to the conclusion that we could  build upon their initial foundation and develop a great project.
.
Research
After deciding to follow up on the bacterial dosimeter idea for our project, we as a team we had to first do some research on the effects of ionizing radiation in order to better determine what exactly we would be detecting. Currently all living organisms are exposed to a relatively low dose of radiation; this amount is so negligible that the negative effects are unnoticeable. The problem with ionizing radiation occurs when one is exposed to a high dose for a short period and/or low doses over an extended period of time. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends nuclear industry employees to limit ones yearly exposer to 50 mSv, or 100 mSv over 5 years.1 One international study, composing 15 countries and encompassing 598,068 nuclear industry workers, found that an increased risk of cancer exists. Specifically, 99% of those tested were exposed to less than 50 mSv of radiation per year, and 1-2% of these cancer related deaths may be attributable to this exposer. It’s also estimated that 100 mSv of cumulative radiation exposer would result to a 5.9% increase chance of mortality. Therefore it is important to be aware of exposure to radiation especially when working in a nuclear facility or when exposed unintentionally.2 1. Cardis, E.

Lipoplexes and polyplexes. Aiming at improving the delivery of the new DNA into the cell, the DNA must be protected from damage and its entry into the cell must be facilitated. For this reason, lipoplexes and polyplexes have been created to protect the DNA from undesirable degradation during the transfection process.
Hybrid methods Due to every method of gene transfer having shortcomings, there have been some hybrid methods developed that combine two or more techniques. Virosomes are one example, which combine liposomes with an inactivated HIV or influenza virus. This has been shown to have more efficient gene transfer in respiratory epithelial cells than either viral or liposomal methods alone. Other methods involve mixing other viral vectors with cationic lipids or hybridising viruses.
Dendrimers Dendrimer, highly branched macromolecule, have a spherical shape. The surface of the particle may varies in a large range and many of the properties of the resulting construct are determined by its surface. Particularly it is possible to construct a cationic dendrimer.On reaching its destination the dendrimer-nucleic acid complex is then taken into the cell via endocytosis.

Types of Gene Therapy
Germ line gene therapy
In the case of germ line gene therapy, germ cells, i.e., sperm or eggs, are modified by the introduction of functional genes, which are ordinarily integrated into their genomes. Therefore, the change due to therapy would be heritable and would be passed on to later generations. This new approach, theoretically, should be highly effective in counteracting genetic disorders. However, many jurisdictions prohibit this for application in human beings, at least for the present, for a variety of technical and ethical reasons.
Somatic gene therapy
In the case of somatic gene therapy, therapeutic genes are transferred into the somatic cells of a patient. Any modifications and effects will be restricted to the individual patient only, and will not be inherited by the patient's offspring.
Difficulty of Current Gene Therapy Approach
In the laboratory, gene transfer is a powerful tool that can be readily adapted to meet the needs of an individual investigator. In the clinical arena, however, gene therapy is more complex and requires consideration of the interplay between the disease and the patient, along with any other conventional treatments being administered.
One of the difficulties in advancing gene therapy technology from the laboratory to the clinic is that the perfect vector system has yet"

Potsdam,2017,Team:Potsdam#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," is similar to the gap repair during homologous recombination. This technique can be used for the selectively recovery of chromosome segments up to a size of 250 kb from complex genomes and is a useful tool for the characterization of genome variations and gene functions. The needed TAR vector consists in opened state of two terminal gene-specific target sequences, so called hooks, a yeast selectable marker and a centromere sequence. A further requirement is that the cloned DNA shows at least one autonomously replication sequence (ARS). The TAR vector and the DNA carrying the DNA sequence of interest are transformed into yeast spheroplasts. By recombination between the hooks and the homologous sequences of the DNA fragment of interest a circular yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) is formed. The yeast selectable marker allows selection while the ARS of the cloned DNA leads to replication of the YAC [3].

What is Auxin?
1881, Charles Darwin and his son Francis examined coleoptiles (the protective sheath covering the emerging shoot in monocotyledons) exposed to unidirectional light. Consequential, they concluded the existence of a signalling molecule directing their bending [1]. This small molecule named auxin has much more functions in the plant than just regulating organ bending in response to light and gravity: it mediates growth reactions of plants to adapt to current environmental conditions, controls genetically pre-programmed physiological processes such as leaf and other organ formation and many more [1]"

Surveys
We completed surveys for multiple teams throughout the project including University College London, Delft University of Technology and University of Westminster, and joined in an international survey consisting of teams from Germany, Mexico, Israel, Taiwan, England, Austria, India, Pakistan, France and Lithuania.
We completed surveys for other teams to help enhance their scope of knowledge of genetic engineering and modification.  We took part in the international survey as it represents public attitudes across the globe – here in Scotland we feel that GMOs are represented in a negative light and wanted to understand whether this attitude was constricted to Scotland, the United Kingdom (by checking Sheffield’s results), Europe (other European teams) or global.
Northern Meet Up at the University of Edinburgh
The undergraduate team at the University of Edinburgh organised for all teams in Scotland and the team from Newcastle University to meet up near the end of August to practice our presentations and receive constructive feedback on how to better deliver our project.
This was the first time we had presented to other teams and received encouraging feedback that our project and delivery were interesting enough to keep listener’s attention, however our presentation should be reordered as it was difficult to follow. There were also some slides that were not important that we should remove, as well as using that time to include greater detail on our lab work. We were told we had the knowledge to answer questions effectively however we needed to be more concise. This feedback was vital in shaping our presentation.
UK Meet Up at the University of Westminster
The University of Westminster hosted a similar meet up to Edinburgh’s, this time inviting all the teams in the UK. We delivered our presentation again; incorporating the feedback received in Edinburgh, and were met with similar enthusiasm.  We were advised to make our presentation more of a story with one slide following on from the former, as it seemed like we were just rattling off what we had completed over the summer. Once again this enabled us to improve.  The questions in London were tougher but our answers held up to scrutiny and we considered the presentation a success.

Our first ligation involved BBa_J23100 (RFPc) and BBa_I14033(Pcat). The BBa_J23100 was cut with SpeI and PstI in order to remove the RBS-RFP-Terminator composite part. Three trials were run on the robot with the same parts and the same amounts. A fourth trial was run manually alongside the robot. When ligations were done the total amount for each robot trial was about 5ul off from the desired amount. It took one day for the colonies to grow on the plates but it took about two days for them to finally turn a pinkish color. The ligation was restriction mapped in order to verify that the robot worked properly. One of the robot trials had good results but we needed more verification in order to state that it was successful. Also there were very few colonies so the process had to be fixed.
We tried ligating again but this time we used BBa_J23101 with Pcat, as we did not have enough digested BBa_J23100. The colonies were very faint and did not seem to produce good outcomes. We decided to test another promoter in order to continue forward. BBa_R0040 (Ptet) worked better so we did two trials on the robot with BBa_J23100 and BBa_R0040 and then one manually. This time around, the colonies looked to be the right color but there were still not enough colonies to call the outcome a success. We decided to take a different approach for fixing the issue by testing new parts. We did a ligation using large parts that have had good ligation outcomes manually. The parts were ligated so that the order in the plasmid is Ptet-RBS-LuxR-YFPc-pLuxR. After being transformed on Ampicillin plates there were a lot of colonies on both the robot trials and the manual trials. This can be seen verified in following figure.
We also did a double volume ligation at the same time as the Ptet-RBS-LuxR-YFPc_pLuxR ligation to see if we could fix the volume issue. The final amounts for each ligation this time was only off by 4ul. BBa_E0240 (GFPc) and promoter BBa_R2000 were used. Unfortunately no colonies grew on the plates. The ligations for Ptet-RBS-LuxR-YFPc-pLuxR was tested by restriction mapping the part. Colony A did not ligate properly but colony B and C did work. The insert is about"

TrinityCollegeDublin,2015,Team:TrinityCollegeDublin#Malaria_-_-_TEXT.html," economic development. Annual economic growth in countries with high malaria transmission has historically been lower than in countries without malaria.
Economists believe that malaria is responsible for a “growth penalty” of up to 1.3% per year in some African countries.  Malaria also impedes children’s schooling and social development through both nonattendance and perpetual neurological and other damage linked with severe episodes of the disease. The mere presence of malaria in a country also hinders individual and national prosperity due to its effect on social and economic decisions. - Economic costs of malaria, World Health Organization (last accessed October 2, 2010)
Treatment of Malaria, Artemisinin and Synthetic Biology
The first operative treatment for malaria came from the cinchona tree bark that has the compound quinine. However, the parasite developed resistance to the drug and later, artemisinin, which was discovered by Chinese scientist, Tu Youyou and company, in the 1970s from the herb Artemisia annua, became the commended treatment for P. falciparum malaria. It was often given in combination with other antimalarial drugs.
In the context of malaria, synthetic biology has been used to create a reliable source of artemisinin. In 2005, Amyris was awarded a five-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to create artemisinic acid (a precursor to artemisinin) in yeast using the synthetic biology platform in partnership with PATH and UC Berkeley. Their objective was to improve artemisinin production and reduce Artemisinin-based combination Therapies' (ACT) prices. In 2008, Amyris licensed the yeast strains to pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis; and in 2013, Sanofi started using large-scale production to produce the semi-synthetic artemisinin for ACT treatments. Kay Monroe, who is currently executive director of Zagaya, reported on the situation:
Sanofi is a good partner and have done a fabulous job of implementing photosynthetic chemistry but exclusivity is not what we signed up for. This is what Zagaya has been pushing hard against. So if we can get fermented product to somebody else, those people can use whatever technology, like cheaper standard chemistry, to make artemisinin from the precursor. The chemistry conversion is therefore, not exclusive. Amyris is making sure the exclusivity is going to go away as it’s been working closely with Sanofi.” “…Sanofi is a European company so it’s easier for them to make SSA even if it’s expensive but we felt this can be done faster"

- Label 7 centrifuge tubes (15mL) 1, 1C, 3, 3C, 16, 16C, and C (""C"" is for control). To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 4000rpm for 10min at 7 Celsius. Supernatant was taken out using pipets and discarded. E coli was then resuspended in 10mL M9+ supplemented with uracil and adenine.
- To 3 centrifuge tubes (1, 3, and 16), add 200 uL of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (add nothing to C). Because 5-bromodeoxyuridine stock is a 10mg/mL aqueous solution, the final mutagen concentration in the five test tubes will be 0, 100, 200, and 500 ug/mL.
- Let the bacterial suspension incubate with mutagen for approximately 1h 30min.
- 90ul of 7.17 phage stock was added to each centrifuge tube (add nothing to C). From 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock, we know that 5.3 phage stock has 7E8 particles/20uL. Thus, to each of the test tubes, we are adding approximately 6.5E9 particles.
- Incubate phage on shaker at 37C for for 1 hour, 3 hours, and 16 hours, respectively.

Introduction
As it is known to all, Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective. Based on synthesis biology, our team creates a smart system called Micro Holmes which can monitor the pollutant inside the water in real time. Once the system was founded, through users' laptops, smartphones or some other media, we would acquire the statistics of pollutant which has been analyzed by the system. Reforming the E.Coli, we endowed them with the ability of sensing the pollutant inside the water and delivering the message of it. Therefore, raising them inside the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), they can rapidly augment the voltage as soon as the polluted occurred. Then, by the automatically collecting and analyzing equipment, we can know the concentration of pollutant converted by the instant electric signal. Escherichia coli, a tiny but full of power creature, perfectly plays an important part as Holmes in our project. So, are you interest in how he was created and how he works?
First of all Mr. Holmes must has a piercing eye to find the trail of pollutant; And after detecting pollutant,"

RHIT,2017,Team:RHIT#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"after the cells were transferred into the M9 minimal media, growth phase: lag1). The fluorescence would then experience a continuous increase in the subsequent interval (growth phase: lag2). Then it would dramatically fall until reaching a new equilibrium (growth phases: exponential and stationary).
It was assumed that the promoters were not active in the lag1 phase (second interval), which meant almost no mRNA or GFP was made according to (Alon et al., 2013). When the promoter came back to function in the lag2 phase (third interval) and the cells barely grew in size (Alon et al., 2013), the fluorescence largely increased. When the cell finally began to grow in the exponential phase (fourth interval), the concentration of fluorescence fell again until reaching an equilibrium.
This was a model with many assumptions that could be improved further. Whether any of the productions was reduced to ~0 in the lag1 phase was not very clear. The conducted experiment indicated that fluorescence might peak between 2-4 hr, much earlier than the end of lag2 phase predicted by the model. The concentration used for the models for the vitamin B12 riboswitches could be too high or the values of kA and kB could be too different from the actual values. Therefore, the graphs stuck too close to each other. The rate of cell division in the original medium and the stationary phase was also unclear, so the diffusion constant for the exponential phase was used for them. It should be higher in the original medium with more nutrients and lower in the stationary phase due to the decrease in nutrients. The significance of these, however, could be reduced by only looking at the fluorescence level at the end of the exponential phase, where the diversion of fluorescence caused by different concentrations of vitamins would become very obvious. The probable lower division rate and mRNA/GFP production rate in the stationary phase should have more complex results that were not able to be modeled due to lack of information.
Methods and Coding:
Calculations of values of the constants:
Degradation rate of RNA:
The half-life of a RNA molecule in exponential phase is 4.1 minutes and 7.8 minutes in the stationary phase as in (Xie et al., 2015). A basic differential equation to find out the degradation constant was constructed:
kdm =degradation constant of mRNA
t = half-life of mRNA, min
(d[RNA])/dt=-kdm*[RNA]
Solving it gives:
[RNA]=e^(-kdm*t) kdm=(ln⁡(2))/t

Engagement
We organized the first synthetic biology workshop ever held at our University, presented by an international leader in the field. We reached out to over 50,000 listeners on radio, informing them about synthetic biology and our project. We engaged extensively with a number of industry partners at various events, among them SANEDI (South African National Energy Development Institute) where we presented our project, conducted surveys and interviewed the Center Manager, Dr. Karen Surridge-Talbot. We also exhibited our work at the Women in Energy Business Summit where we engaged with a number of stakeholders in the energy sector of South Africa. Similarly we exposed 40 elite grade 11 learners to science, renewable energy, synthetic biology and our project through the UP with Science program at the University of Pretoria. Finally, we created two videos on our project which was posted on Youtube in addition to maintaining active Facebook and Twitter accounts.
SynBio Education
ACGT Synthetic Biology Workshop and Symposium
The iGEM team at the University of Pretoria together with the African Centre for Gene Technologies (ACGT) and the Forest Molecular Genetics (FMG) research group hosted a synthetic biology workshop and symposium. The synthetic biology workshop was hosted at the University of Pretoria’s main campus on the 5th of September and facilitated by Professor Fernan Federici from the University of Cambridge. Prof. Fernan gave an introduction to synthetic biology to the workshop attendees and went on to discuss the engineering of multicellular organisms and DNA fabrication, as well as TechnoX  and the social impact and effect on collaborations.
The workshop was followed by the symposium the next day held at Irene Country Lodge. The keynote address was delivered by Dr Geoff Baldwin from Imperial College London. Presentations from the Pretoria_UP iGEM team, Amanda Dodd  and Tumi Chale from the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology group as well as Lazarus Takawira from the University of Pretoria then followed.
The workshop and symposium were both a success and the Pretoria_UP iGEM team met their objective of educating, informing and making people aware of"

InterLab
Interlab with ZJUT-China
    This year is our first time to attend for the iGEM, So We met up with ZJUT-China，DLUT-China and LZU-China in Jiangsu Normal University to learn some experience form them and share our own project to them . Before this meeting, we had some troubles in interlab and we couldn’t find correct method to solve it. So we shared our problems with them at the meeting. The ZJUT-China had finished the interlab successfully and gave us some suggestions on our interlab. We adopted their suggestions and finally made it. After this meeting, we had a further communication with ZJUT-China and What they studied in Lysis gene gave us some inspiration about our own project, which made us consider to add a kill switch to make our L.lactis safer towards the biological environment. In return, we also gave them some ideas and suggestions to help them with their project.
Kill switch with SSTi-SGZD
    This year we also had a deep cooperation with SSTi-SGZD. They helped us with Wiki construction and technical support, so our Wiki could be compatible with the required format. We shared our ideas that we want to add a gene as the kill switch and wanted to get their suggestions. Then they just provided us with a supernova kill switch in a light-controlled gene system, which was an essential part to their last year's iGEM project. In order to help them with their experiment, we suggested on a method called Ubbelohde viscomete, which they could used to test the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid.
Safety with  Unesp_Brazil
    This year we also contacted with the  team Unesp_Brazilr by e-mails. We all concerned about the safety of the synthetic biology so we talked more about how to construct a high efficient chassis microorganism which is safe enough. Although we wanted to make our strain applied into the practical application, we didn’t know anything about the application of engineering bacteria. Fortunately, Unesp_Brazil offered the regulations and instructed us to apply our bacteria in the correct way. They also offered us the gene which could"

Amplification of some plasmid backbones from registry.
Week 5 (06/18 – 06/24)
The construct me and Ross made last week is purified but not yet quantified and screened; anyway we want      to send it for sequencing before the Post Office closes (along with CysE      and M256I CysE) or the samples will be stuck during the weekend (and we don’t      want that!) We estimate a concentration of about and blindfoldingly      prepare the samples. Cristina rushes and between traffic and parking is in      front of the Post Office 5 minutes before closure. In the meantime, sadly,      the construct is NOT confirmed by screening. Doh.
This week i tried to do a lot of things:
- PCR to amplify parts i will use for cloning: FAILED.
- Other PCR: FAILED.
- Have a BBQ with all 3 years of biotechnology, professors and researchers without drinking too much and without staying up late: FAILED.
After all this failures I decided to do a 3-assembly, but again I failed the minipreps of the parts I needed.
I prepared all the samples for sequencing, and I continued purifying various plasmids and helped out other people in the lab. And I also studied for the exam of Developmental Biology.
This week Giaco and Ross went to CiBIO (research center) to try FACS for the first time: they took RL007, RL009, RL0024 in BL21, and got expected results.
I failed another insertion PCR; also with the new primer on RL0030A the gel kept on showing multiple bands.
This week Giaco and Ross had a honey weekend here in lab, all alone…îScience weekend has begunî [battle journal citation]. I don’t know exactly what happened, but anyway Giaco got the first mutation: the PstI site .

Aims for the Week
The Construction Crew are being ambitious this week, and will attempt to transform and purify eight biobricks. These are not from a particular module, but include many of the Promoters we want to use and the Ribosome Binding Site biobrick which failed to work last week. The Modellers wish to model the buoyancy biobricks because they have the most information for this, and using the Groningen 2009 modelling, they have a good idea of how to apply it to our project. They also plan on modelling the laccase gene for the degradation module, which we hope to obtain to transform into our bacteria. The laccase gene is from a strain of bacteria found to degrade polyethylene. Erin is taking a break from modelling to work on the proposal for the Rathenau debate, and hopes to get it in essay format by the end of the week. The Sponsorship team aim to complete their list of potential sponsors to email and create a detailed account of our budget. The key aim for Human Practices is to get a security license for our DIYbio event - without"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Project#2D Biosensor_-_-_TEXT.html," loss of fluorescence ability. Hence, we concluded that long-time storage of the sensor chips at -20°C is not possible under the tested conditions. However, the 'ready-to-use' sensor chips can be kept at at 4°C for two days when using LB medium, and storage at this temperature for 5 days is possible with chips made from TB medium.
Sensor chip manufacturing using the closed mold
When injecting the liquid agar into a closed mold we encounter problems due to frequent bubble formation.
Optimal Agarose Concentration for Sensor Chip Manufacturing
For the sensor chip manufacturing, agarose was preferred over agar because of the uniform linkage between molecules that results in a better chip homogeneity. In addition, agarose reduced diffusion of the inducer molecules through the chip. A reduction in diffusion is essential for the formation of distinct fluorescent spots on the sensor chips.
The finalized chip mold
An open casting mold was found to be optimal for sensor chip manufacturing, because this approach was fast, easy to handle and generated a reproducible chip quality.
Optimal Chip Configuration
Several approaches were tested for the production of agarose-based sensor chips with reproducible quality. The first approach was to cast every sensor chip individually. To achieve a plain chip surface, a requirement for high quality images, we casted the sensor chips between two microscope slides. However, this approach was not adequate because the agar was too liquid and leaked from the microscope slides. In a second approach, we designed a closed mold into which liquid agar is injected using a pipette, but we encountered a high number of bubbles in the resulting chips. Bubbles in the sensor chips interfered with fluorescence evaluation. Finally, we tried an open casting mold. Once solidified, we cut the agar along precast indentations in the casting mold to form the chips. An advantage of the open mold is the ability to simultaneously produce nine sensor chips while the surface tension of the liquid agar ensures a plane chip surface.
Induction of the Sensor Chips
To test our molecular constructs, we simulated the presence of P. aeruginosa by using IPTG or 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Initial experiments showed that diffusion of the inducers hinder the formation of distinct fluorescent spots. Through this set of experiments we determined that the best compromise between diffusion and spot intensity is an induction volume of 2.0 µL for IPTG and 0.2 µL for HSL. Furthermore, detection of growing P. aeruginosa based on secreted HSLs was possible using the K131026 construct. The experiments for optimizing the induction of our"
Exeter,2015,Team:Exeter#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," approach to bTB testing was important for us but it was also important that our test could fit into the Strategy for Bovine TB Eradication document that they released in 2014.
Click here for the TB Strategy Document
In this document there are a number of key points relevant to the development of our test. The bTB research programme states how “Evidence [related to the development of new vaccination tools] needs to be multidisciplinary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease epidemic”. It also states the importance of “developing new diagnostics tests for surveillance”.  We have approached solving the issue of bTB in the UK from a multidisciplinary approach due to the interdisciplinary members of our iGEM team. The fact our test offers a scientific solution that acts as a DIVA test, it paves the way for political change as a valid DIVA test would eventually allow for the reintroduction of the BCG vaccine.
Bovine TB clearly presents a number of important social issues also. Our public engagement was important to help us as a team understand the contentious issue of Badger-Cattle transmission of bTB. DEFRA has recently undertaken a number of Randomised Badger Culling trials to assess the effect tackling the natural reservoir of M.bovis has on the cattle incidence of bTB. This trial was highly controversial. Our focus as a team was the detection of the bacterium in cattle that in a way that doesn’t interfere with the BCG vaccine, allowing the reintroduction of the BCG vaccine and therefore taking a step that is widely accepted to be necessary to eradicate bTB from the UK. In our public interview and surveys we deliberately avoided the topic of Badgers to avoid controversy. However a number of individuals, unprompted, made it clear that they are strongly against Badger culling. Similarly the farmers we visited had completely different views on Badger culling. The situation with bTB in the UK is highly controversial, however our test aims to identify infected animals with an extremely high degree of sensitivity, allowing the definitive identification of infected animals. With any disease it is important that healthy animals are protected and infected animals are identified. New Zealand, a country that saw a reduction of bTB incidence rate of 96% in 10 years had a clear strategy to deal with the natural reservoir, possums. Our test is a tool that offers a potential solution to a problem that currently costs the UK economy £1 billion every year, and finding this solution is what drove our Human Practices. Whether our test leads the way for social change is not for us as a team to decide due to the"

SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT#HP#Magazine#iGEM Story_-_-_TEXT.html," one month later, we started to have a concept of our project.
At that time, some fellows can’t overcome the intensive life, and the team registration was coming, and leaders started the second selection. I was so lucky that I made the team while I was one of two freshmen students in iGEM team. After that, we focused on project design the whole March. In April and May, we optimized our project and began to search the sequence of gene and protein. In May, we learned the basic technique of experiments. Because of the final exams, we stopped and prepared for the exams in June.
5. The Joy and Pain
When I am looking back, it’s a bitter but sweet experience——we can fully use of imagination and ideas and also design innovative projects. But at the same time, we had to enrich our knowledge via reading lots of papers. We had to learn how to use different database including gene bank , NCBI ect, at that time I started to realize the multifunction of library. Owing to lack of knowledge, my designs have been rejected one by one, but I did’t  give up because I believed I would find my best answer.
Today is 5 August 2014, it has been 9 month since my first participation in SCUT-iGEM. Nowadays, I still work in the lab as usual for our dream.

The Project
Genomics has reached the stage at which the amount of DNA sequence information in existing databases is quite large. Synthetic biology now is using these databases to catalog sequences according to their functionality and therefore creating standard biological parts which can be used to create large systems.
As these databases grow, the need for integrated tools that perform complex operations, organize information, and automate regular processes is becoming increasingly obvious. The synthetic biology community could be better-served with the development of flexible tools which not only permit access and modification to that data but also allow one to perform meaningful manipulation and use of that information in an intelligent and efficient way. These tools need to be useful to biologists working in a laboratory environment while leveraging the experience of the larger CAD community.
This project develops a toolset called ""Clotho"" which provides a variety of design views and tools to aid biologists to modify existing synthetic biological systems as well as create new ones. These tools differ from current offerings in this area in that they not only provide the needed tools to manipulate designs in one complete system but also provide unique ways in which to visualize the design as well as a number of connections to both local and global part repositories.
This page provides insight into the background for the Clotho project as rooted in Platform-based design (PBD). PBD provides the overall design methodology for Clotho. This includes the orthogonalization of computation, communication, and coordination. In addition there is a heavy emphasis on reuse and the separation of performance from behavior. Also on this page we provide information regarding the overall timeline of the project, Clotho's software architecture, and a detailed description of all the pieces that go into Clotho.

shorten the reaction time
We would like to make the bioluminescent reaction time faster than BBa_K769011 by constitutively expressing all lux genes except the luxA or luxD gene.
Method
Construction of biobrick
Pconst-lux CDBFEG –DT (deletion of luxA) was constructed by inverse PCR.
Primers with restriction site EcoRI and XbaI at 5’ end and SpeI and PstI at 3’ end was used to clone luxA
Arabinose inducible promoter was added in front of luxA.  These two parts were connected.
The same process was performed to construct this part.
Evaluation method
Transformed E coli. TOP10 was precultured into LB medium and incubated at 37℃. After incubating for 12 hour, precultured solution was inoculated into 100 mL LB medium. When OD660 of the culture became 0.6, arabinose(0.25% f.c.) was added to induce and expressed the proteins at 20 ℃. After induction, the 500 μL of culture was harvested at every 30 minutes and measured light intensity and OD by plate reader.
Result
As we expected, when only luxA or luxD were  induced, the light intensity reached its peak faster than wild type. However, the maximum intensity of these two construct far lower than wild type. It may be caused by loss of mass balance of lux proteins. We could improve the light emission by expressing luxAB or luxCDE together not only luxA or luxD.

Alberta,2012,Team:Alberta#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," copy control was used to amplify plasmid beyond normal limits for plasmid purification or as a method of protein over-expression for purification. Our goal is spatial colour control.
                  
Fig 7. We developed and tested a series of copy controlled origins, with the promoter for RNA II containing operators for LacI and TetR, inducible by IPTG and ATC respectively. In one case we maintained the natural -10/-35 region. In another, we increased the promoter strength of these regions. In another we made a mistake with PCR primer design that actually proved to be useful. The ones we constructed are listed in Figure 8 below. With the exception of the weak (wild-type) TetO origin, all have been shown to be functional, as detailed next.
                 
Fig 8. Origin promoter sequences. Shown is our design for controlling plasmid copy number through either the TetR or LacI repressors. Synthetic promoters that were used to replace the native RNA II origin promoter (upper sequence) of the pSB1C3-based plasmids that constitutively express either [Pr-3]LacI (in the case of  LacI-regulated RNA II) or [Pr-3]TetR (in the case of TetR-regulated RNA II). The table shows, for each promoter, the sequence, relative strength of the -35/-10 regions, and status, where “+/+/+” indicates the promoter has been constructed/tested/ is functional, respectively. Promoters and their accompanying NsiI sites were incorporated into each repressor plasmid by appending each sequence to the 5’ end of a pcr primer whose annealing region immediately followed the -10 region of the native promoter and which synthesized towards the suffix.  The reverse primer incorporated the NsiI site at its 5’ end and synthesized towards the prefix. The resulting product was then cut with NsiI, ligated and transformed into competent cells. Since the inducer concentration required for optimal growth was unknown, each transformation mix was equally divided between culture tubes with different concentration of the appropriate inducer (IPTG: 0 mM, 0.002 mM, 0.004 mM, 0.008 mM, 0.016 mM and 0.032, 0.64 mM; ATC: same numerical series but at mg/L). Notably no growth was observed in the absence of inducer. LacI-Pr* and TetR-Pr* were our first attempt at this strategy. It was discovered after"

The Context
A food allergy is defined as ”an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food”1.
The immune system is supposed to identify and destroy germs, like the bacteria or viruses that invade our bodies. What happens when a person has a food allergy is that the immune system targets a harmless food protein, an allergen, as something dangerous and attacks it. This exaggerated immune response is mediated by immunoglobulin antibodies (IgE antibodies) which are proteins produced by the immune system to fight foreign substances. IgE antibodies trigger the symptoms of an allergic reaction, which can vary in severity from slight itchiness to potentially fatal anaphylaxis (difficulty breathing, reduced blood pressure)1, 2. It is estimated that about 1- 2% of the general population has some sort of food allergy3.
A person living with a food allergy is under constant threat from hidden allergens in anything they consume, wear, or even breathe. It is generally considered that peanut allergies are amongst the most dangerous of allergies due to the severity of the symptoms despite minimal contact and the fact that peanut allergies are often life-long3, 4. As for general food allergy, peanut allergy effects about 1% of the general population. However, in the last decade there seems to have been an increase of peanut allergy among children both in the United States and Europe5, 6.

Pittsburgh Water Crisis
Blood-Lead Levels in Children
Product Design
Pittsburgh Public Schools
Pittsburgh Public Schools tested the water from all schools' water fountains this summer as a proactive measure against exposing the students to lead. Any water fountains found to contain lead were removed. New filtered water dispensers were also added to each school. Aife created a video about the dangers of lead poisnoning for the teachers to show students, so that the students could better understand why their water fountains were tested over the summer. Take a look below, or visit the link here !
Your browser does not support the video tag.
A pamphlet recently issuesed by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority notified customers that elevated lead levels were found in several water samples from the Pittsburgh region. Residents can now request free kits to sample their water. However, it is too late to prevent lead intake from contaminated water and too early to know the extent of the damage. Our sensor would have provided residents a way to test their water as often as they pleased, and the elevated lead levels could have been detected earlier. You can read the pamphlet here .
Blood-Lead Levels in Children
No paper draws a correlation between the level or duration of lead exposure and blood-lead levels in children. This is especially problematic in situations where lead is suddenly found in water, such as in Flint, Michigan, or Pittsburgh. There is no way to predict the damage that has been done to children, the most vulnerable population to lead poisoning. Thus, we developed a model to predict the blood-lead levels of children based on the level and duration of their exposure to lead. The model can help authorities decide what actions to take when high levels of lead are found in water. The"

Hypothesis 4: Cloning of colicin into pSB4A5
The colicin gBlock was amplified via PCR, digested with EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into the linearized pSB4A5 low-copy-number plasmid backbone.
Figure 4.Transformation of colicin+pSB4A5 low-copy-number plasmid into E. coli BL21 cells.
A purified plasmid sample was sent for sequencing. However, the results showed numerous mutations.
Hypothesis 5: Subcloning of colicin into cumate regulatory system
Plasmids from the transformed bacterial colonies containing the cumate system were digested with XmaI and NdeI in order to remove the BFP and insert colicin in its place. After the digestion a gel extraction was performed, followed by ligation with the colicin DNA and a subsequent transformation.
The resulting colonies contained an insert of the appropriate size (~1600 bp), which was the same size as the positive control (the ligated product - cumate and colicin). The results from the sequencing contained multiple mutations at variable sites along the sequence.
Figure 5.Plate with overnight transformation of ligated cumate+colicin+pSB1C3 showing one colony.
Successful cloning was demonstrated with colony PCR with positive control as a reference (ligated product cumate and colicin) and sequencing results, which, however, showed multiple mutations due to continuous exposure to UV and repetitive PCRs.

Hypothesis 6: Bacterial proliferation of cumate regulatory system with colicin in medium containing cumate in a concentration gradient
The next step would be to measure the toxicity of colicin by growing the bacteria in cumate-containing medium. Unfortunately, due to time constraints we were unable to test out our hypothesis.

Team:Sheffield/21 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 21st July - Still in Newcastle!
A bit of a groggy start for the team members silly enough to carry on drinking last night in Eazy Street. Unfortunately this led to our late arrival to the morning talks - sorry to everyone there for our rather rude interruption! We did manage to take some interesting points about tips, safety and human practices from the talks, which will prove useful when we get around to adding more depth to our project.
After enjoying the last of the talks, we decided it was time to head home to Sheffield. Once we arrived in Sheffield Caz went to check our samples... WE HAVE BANANA AND WINTERGREEN E.COLI!!! - awesome.
We'd just like to thank Newcastle for organising the get together. We found the trip a great opportunity to socialise with other UK teams, learn some valuable tips for our work and to see how well everyone else is getting on with their projects. We'll look forward to seeing you and the rest of UK iGEM again at the Jamboree, best of luck with your projects, we hope all goes well!

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the parts individually with the bacteria. This will allow for further experimentation with the full bacteriophage construct including the other parts.
ELASTIN-LIKE POLYMERS
The purpose of elastin-like polymers (ELPs) is to remove the metal ion-laden phage from the solution[4]. At a specific temperature, ELPs will aggregate and precipitate out of solution. This transition temperature (Tt) is influenced by factors such as the heavy metal concentration, concentration of ELP, the length of the ELP chain, and the variable amino acids in each monomer. We will be altering the length and the concentration of ELP to achieve our goal Tt. We plan for the ELP to have a Tt between 45οC to 50oC as this will allow the ELP to remain in solution while maintaining the optimal efficiency of our chosen bacteria[4]. The length and the Tt have an inverse relationship; when we increase the length of the ELP, the transition temperature decreases. Using this information we intend to keep the guest residue the same while altering the length to achieve the goal Tt.
To influence the characteristics of our ELP, we can also experiment with the variable amino acid in each monomer. All ELPs contain the amino acid sequence Val-Pro-Gly-X-Gly, with X representing the variable amino acid. For our project, we want to use a hydrophobic amino acid, specifically valine, glycine, or alanine. By using a hydrophobic amino acid, we can destabilize the ELP and it will more readily drop out of solution. There are several residues that are found to work well with the precipitation of ELP; valine is found to be the most effective for protein aggregation. We will add standardized linker sequences to the N- and C-termini of the ELP to allow for easy fusion to other functional proteins. In our case, we will be fusing the capsid protein of the bacteriophage and the metal-binding peptide to either end of the ELP.
Figure 3. Schematics of different variants of elastin-like polymers[4]. The Tt for both ELPs is 50oC but the ELP that uses valine as the guest residue in the 40 pentapeptides is much shorter and therefore more efficient in precipitation as it uses fewer resources.

We used the program ApE to create plasmid maps and digest predictions, the following figure shows the expected digest results at each stage of our PCR mutagenesis, if the miniprep DNA was cut with EcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes.
Figure 2: Predictive digest of stepwise removal of biobrick incompatible restriction sites. Generated by ApE: A Plasmid Editor.
Miniprep DNA from each step (uirS1, uirS1A, uirS1AA, and uirS1AAA) was transformed into the ER2925 Dam- strain, a colony was cultured, miniprepped, and digested with EcoRI-HF and XbaI-HF enzymes. Undigested DNA from each sample was run in lanes 1-4.
Figure 3:  Restriction digest. Lanes 1-4 ; Uncut uirS1-1AAA. Lanes 6-9 uirS1-1AAA digested with EcoRI and XbaI. DNA miniprepped from Dam- methylation strain ER2925 so methylation protected XbaI site at position 523 can be checked by digest. 1% agarose gel stained with Ethidium bromide and photographed on a Bio-Rad GelDoc. Figure illustrates the removal of restriction sites in a sequential manner, with the final uirS1AAA sample being biobrick compatible.
Once uirS was biobrick compatible it was digested from pCR 2.1 TOPO plasmid and ligated into pSB1C3, then further light-sensor plasmid assembly could take place.
Sensor
In Synechocystis, the uirS two-component system is involved in a negative phototactic response to unidirectional UV-A light (Song et al., 2011). The proposed mechanism places uirS, a transmembrane protein, as the protein that photosenses UV light. It is suggested that a phosphotransfer from uirS to uirR occurs upon UVA-light excitation of Phycocyanobillin chromophore bound within uirS; uirR is released from the transmembrane protein and locates to a binding region upstream of the lsiR promoter. uirR bound upstream of lsiR is shown to act as a transcriptional activator of lsiR (Song et al., "

Based on the traces from the emission spectrum we saw emission maxima at 415 nm and 475 nm, differing quite drastically from previously reported data (J.Mahon, 2011). While fluorescence values increased with rising pH at 415 nM, fluorescence values decreased at more basic pH at 475 nm.

Tox Assay
ToxAssay To provide a safe work environment for everyone involved in the process of protein purification and BoNTC based assays, we had first to prove, that our mutated botulinum toxin would not be able to cause neurotoxic cleavage of Snap25. Since the BoNTC light chain (LC) alone can not enter a cell, we expressed and purified the LC to test its cleavage ability compared to the wildtype LC. Based on the papers on findings of Vadakkanchery et. al and Edwin J.Vazquez-Cintron et al. we developed an assay which would show the activity difference between the purified LC wildtype compared to our LC mutant. The principle of the assay was the catalytic cleavage of the SNAP25 protein. SNAP25 cleavage by an active LC, which the assay was based on, results in a peptide fragment with the following amino acid sequence:
N’ATKMLGSGWSHPQFEK’C (Mpeptide: 1803 [g/mol]).
We chose a buffer for our cleavage assay composed of 150mM K+ glutamate and 10"

In physics, one might calculate the velocity of a falling ball by taking into account the gravitational force, and the friction between medium and the ball as separate components. In biology, to understand living systems we can reduce the complexity by for e.g. focusing on specific organs (for higher eukaryotes) or go even further down to the cellular level. In synthetic biology, we look at the molecular level to see how organisms work. One of the major breakthroughs in the past century is the elucidation of the DNA structure by Watson and Crick. They set the path for discovering what is now believed to be the foundation of life, the omnipresent translational system based on a 4 letter code inscribed in the DNA double-helix, accounting for metabolism and reproduction of living systems. Synthetic biology plays a key role in clarifying the complex principles of the translational system and enlighten the enigmatic foundation of life on a molecular level.
Figure 3. A schematic representation of the concepts of the top-down and bottom-up approaches (design based on the idea of Steven Flipse ).
What happens if the reductionism approach will eventually show us what life is all about? What happens when humans can create living systems? We cannot foresee if research in synthetic biology will be able to reach those goals. But since the scientific community is getting closer en closer to the foundation of living systems, the ethical questions become much more important. To get an overview of what plays a role in evaluating reductionism in synthetic biology, we propose a framework in which we display the connection between evolution, life, and reductionism.
Figure 4. Framework to display the connection between evolution, life and reductionism and the bottom-up approach towards creating biological systems.
Since Darwin's work On the Origin of Species in 1859, a lot of scientific theories suggest that the world as we know it is a product of millions of years of evolution. This phenomena that mankind will probably never be able to fully understand has produced a complex biological world with an entangled network of many different living systems and (non)organic materials. Science indicates that only a relatively short period of time the homo sapiens have walked the earth (surprisingly on two legs) and have evolved to a sophisticated heterogeneous community with thoughts, believes, opinions, consciousness, and the ability to adapt and improve survival chances better then any other organism. The property that made mankind the top of the food chain is its ability to use the brain efficiently. One of the things that humans have used their brain for, is to give definitions to the things that they saw and heard. So what"

After the warm-up period, set the wavelength to 600 nm (top knob).  4. Set the filter lever to the appropriate position for the selected wavelength (bottom). 5. Press the MODE button until the display mode is set to FACTOR. 6. Using the INCREASE/DECREASE buttons ensure that the factor is set to 1.0. 7. Press the MODE button until the display mode is set to TRANSMITTANCE. 8. With no cuvette in the holder and the lid closed, turn the 0%T knob until the measured transmittance is 0.0.     This is zeroing the device. 9. Fill a cuvette with 3.0 mL of the medium used to grow the cells (e.g. YPD) and wipe the sides with a KimWipe to eliminate fingerprints and dust particles. 10. Place the cuvette in the compartment. 11. Align the guide mark of the cuvette with the guide mark on the compartment. 12. Close the lid of the compartment. 13. Adjust the TRANSMITTANCE to 100.0 using the 100%T knob (right).     This is essentially the equivalent of when you TARE a balance. 14. Remove the sample.     You may choose to leave this cuvette of YPD for other users as they will likely be performing the same procedure.          Note: the spectrophotometer must be blanked for each user even if a common cuvette is being used. 15. In a new cuvette add 3.0 mL of your cell culture sample. 16. Wipe the cell with a KimWipe and insert into the compartment as in Step 10.  17. Record the value shown in the data display (make sure MODE is ABSORBANCE).     Absorbance is a synonym for OD (optical density). 18. When all measurements are obtained, turn the O%T (left knob) counterclockwise to switch the spec off. 19. Clean your cuvettes thoroughly and dry them completely.

Purdue,2008,Team:Purdue#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ine (cyclopyrimidine) dimers between adjacent thymines.  The cell will first activate two initial DNA repair systems.  First, the phr pathway will specifically fix thymine dimers with the help of visible light.  This process occurs constantly at very low levels in cells.  If there is too much ssDNA for phr to keep up, the cell activates nucleotide excision repair (NER), which effectively eliminates most of the damage with very high accuracy.  NER is considered the first phase of the SOS pathway, as its genes (uvrABD) are normally inhibited by the lexA repressor (a characteristic of all ~40 SOS genes).   However, if DNA damage is extreme, other SOS genes, including recA, are activated as a last resort.  This next set of genes causes the cell to form random mutations via DNA Polymerase V (a mutagenic polymerase) which will add any base into a gap, as opposed to the correct one.  For this project, we are using the recA promoter, which is a standard promoter of the SOS pathway and is activated only after extreme DNA damage.
Part 2: Modeling
As the Purdue team consists of mostly engineers, it is our goal to be able to mathematically model our system.  A working model will help us understand the mechanisms involved in our genetic modifications, and will allow us to predict the consequences of any modifications.
For more details, see the Modeling page.
Part 3: In the Lab
After combing the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we found 2 parts that we could use to implement our idea.  First, part J22106 (contributed by Bangalore in 2006) is the promoter for recA, a central gene in the bacterial SOS pathway.  Next, we found a complete lacZ (I732017) which could be attached to the promoter.  Both parts are relatively OK according to the quality control tests.  By cloning the sequence of promoter-reporter, we can make the traditional if-then construct often used to test promoter strength.  In this case, however, we will clone it into lac- cells (so we don't get false positives).  By plating on X-gal plates, those cells that have successfully transformed will turn blue.
Standard Assembly methods were used.  Stabs of transformed cells containing each part were obtained from iGEM.  Next, a miniprep was done for each part (using QIAGEN miniprep kits for microcentrifuge), and each part was"

The intein purification tag has a size of 55 kDa and should therefore be present as a band above the fusion protein when the column is fully loaded giving us a direct indicator for successful ferritin formation.  Since such an intein band was not present we concluded that the chitin column was not overloaded and had enough free space for the released intein tags to bind to.
To make sure that the mutant ferritin-mTagBFP BBa_K2638612 assembled correctly protein expression and purification was repeated in media enriched with 100 mM of Iron(III) citrate (Iron(III) citrate was boiled in LB to dissolve crystals). The E. coli strain ER2566 was used for intein tagged protein expression. Using iron enriched medium the formation of detectable iron nanoparticles was expected only if the mutant ferritin has successfully assembled inside the cells and kept its functionality in regards to forming correctly and binding as well as oxidising iron ions. Despite the introduction of the mutations (removing the E-helix and DE turn) correct assembly could be proofed this way.
The iron loaded ferritin was again purified following the intein purification protocol and the presence of the mutant ferritin was confirmed by fluorescence measurements as described above. Afterwards we examined the mTagBFP tagged NP using a small 80 kV desktop transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Figure 5: Size of our ferritin modeled using Chimera.
The TEM images seemed to confirm the formation of iron nanoparticles suggesting that the ferritin cage had formed correctly inside the cell and also keeped its function to take up iron.  It should be noted however that the resolution of the 80 kV TEM used for making these images is not ideal and we cannot say with full certainty that the structures with a size of ~29 nm visible in the TEM images are the mutant ferritin. To the best of our knowledge nothing else could be responsible for creating such uniform structures visible under the TEM.
As a side note we should point out that proteins are in general not visible well in the electron microscope but we noted a clearly visible white circle around a darker spot which might be caused by the protein shell around the iron core. The iron core however should be clearly visible as a dark spot in the TEM images. If the resolution of the TEM is good enough it is even possible to see the uniform metal structure of the iron core like we showed in a previous experiment.

Canada
The specific guidelines facilities adopt depend on the risk group classification of the agents involved. For the handling of biological materials under Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines, however no requirements are specified. Risk group 1 includes any biological materials that are potentially pathogenic to humans or animals, but are very unlikely to be so, or are not pathogenic at all. Some recommendations for CL1 facilities outlined in the Canadian Biosafety Standard are as follows:
The designated areas for handling biological materials should be separated from public areas and administrative work areas.
There should be designated hand and eye wash stations appropriate for facility operations.
Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses, lab coats and, footwear covering the feet, must be worn.
Only authorized personnel and visitors should be allowed in the facility.
Waste materials must be disposed in the proper containers and wastes that came into contact with biological materials must be decontaminated before disposal.
Proper hand washing techniques must be employed after coming into contact with biological materials.
Procedures must incorporate proper aseptic technique and minimizes contamination and the formation of aerosols.
Food and drinks should be prohibited from the lab.
Personnel must be trained for the safe handling and storing of biological materials to protect them.
Safety guidelines must be kept up-to-date.
To work with biological materials in higher risk groups (2, 3, and 4), in addition to adopting the appropriate containment level, a Pathogen and Toxin Licence must be obtained from PHAC. Although CL1 provides the foundational biosafety guidelines for these containment levels, further requirements must be followed to minimize contamination and hazards to personnel working with high risk group pathogens. Additional information for the operations of these controlled facilities are discussed in the Canadian Biosafety Standard Second Edition handbook.

They also offered us the gene which could be added as the kill switch, helping us to notice the importance of using a kill switch to make our bacteria safer. Of course, we  give some methods to help with their experiments and shared some experience about our project. Because this is the first time to attend for the iGEM, we are very appreciated that Unesp_Brazil could share experience with us and adopted our ideas even though we are a new team for iGEM.
Collaboration with XJTLU-CHINA
    At the beginning of the iGEM, we have already contacted with the XJTLU-CHINA since they have rich experience about igem. They held a seminar to introduce the rules of the igem which helped us to start our project in a correct way and they also gave us many instruct in our human practice. They had some problems about website construction,  so we put forward some advice and finally they solved the problems. We also help them make a mind map which you could see in their wiki. We are appreciated XJYLU-CHINA and hope we will have more collaboration in the future.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," because of the complex difficulties we donˋt know how to generate with great certainty an antibody response that is 100 % emerging. There are, of course, vaccines used in the animal area but itˋs not guaranteed that the given vaccine will raise antibodies in each vaccinated animal. The performance of live vaccines is comparatively good. The performance of attenuated or inactivated vaccines is very poor, because you donˋt observe antibody response in the vast majority of cases.
    But on the other hand the use of the life vaccine is associated with problems, as life vaccines can [...] cause the disease, because the attenuation is not well defined. At least the vaccines that are being used now. So there are a lot of difficulties and people have of course been trying to use new technologies to produce subunit vaccines. And they were using promising protein antigens that have been investigated in-vitro and they were shown in vitro to work very well, but when used as a vaccine the performance was not satisfactory.
   This is the current state of affairs and people keep trying. But it probably needs another approach. The current molecular approach is not complete enough to generate the antibody response and the protection level that is required.
Kai:
Could you explain why it is so difficult to design good diagnosic methods?
Prof. Sachse:
Actually there are good laboratory tests that would be specifically enough but all these tests require extensive processing of the sample matrix, so you need DNA extraction or you need to produce a lysate. This might be enough for a diagnostic laboratory because they can handle the sample matrix and they can do the processing and they can even automate this to a certain degree. But in a field setting that you are envisioning this is unacceptable, it would be too much. In an area with poor infrastructure, where even electricity supply is not guaranteed, it would be too much to include another step of processing of your sample. The other issue is that when you process the sample you lose a certain degree of your sample amount due to the process. So you lose potentially some of your sensitivity as well and if you can avoid the pre-processing use the sample as it is, as you are trying to do, this is a potential advantage. This is on sensitivity. Currently the successful tests are based on PCR. Amplifying a few copies of DNA that is there, this is the way how they achieve the sensitivity, you canˋt do this and therefore you need to employ specific reactions or highly efficient binding reactions and, also as you do, include fluorescence, which is always a factor to enhance sensitivity because fluorescence can be measured at very"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.
Generation of products based on reaction templates
Within MoDeL definitions, product templates are composed of both ST parts and NST parts. The ST parts are all transfered from reactants or modifiers. A transfer table is defined in each reaction template to label where does each ST part comes from and goes to. It seems to be very easy to generate Chain-Node structure of products from reactants and mod modifiers based on the transfer table. However, it doesn't.
Consider first a template reaction with one reactant, X-A-B-Y, where A and B are both NST parts and X and Y are both ST parts with type ANY. If it could be digested by a certain enzyme, the products should be X-A and B-Y. In the real biological system, if there is a species with structure C-A-B-C, where the first part C and the last C binds to form a tree node. If we try to digest the A-B bond, the species would not be split into two pieces as expected because the two products are connected by the tree node. To generate the structure of products correctly, we design a three-step mix-trim-split algorithm to solve this problem.
Mixing, trimming and splitting: three-step algorithm to generate products.
The first step is to mix reactants and products. The mixture includes all chains of reactants except for those which are matched to the templates as well as all trees. It also includes all chains and trees of products. And now we have a mixed species with chains and trees from different sources. It is worth noting that chains and trees of modifiers will not be added into the mixture. The next step is to trim the trees. Trees with leaf nodes that are not defined in chains will be removed from the forest. The last step is to split the products out from the mixture. This is because the mixture may not be one standalone complex. For example, it may have two unbound and uncorrelated chains. In other words, some chains that are not connected with others via tree nodes should not be incorporated into other species. The final standalone split species are real products in the system.
We provide an example to illustrate the product-generating procedure. The reactant has"
Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," year. PNP focuses on (but is not strictly limited to) the following criteria:
*Collaborations(silver): Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a SynBio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.*
*Human Practices (silver): Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible, and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. (Exceptional outreach and education work is recognized by the Education & Public Engagement Special Award)*
*Integrated Human Practices (gold): Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. (Exceptional Human Practices is recognized by the Best Integrated Human Practices award)*
The current iGEM rubric contains four aspects for evaluating Integrated Human Practices:
Was their work integrated into their project?
Does it serve as an inspiring example to others?
Is it documented in a way that others can build upon?
Was it thoughtfully implemented (i.e., did they explain the context, rationale, prior work)?
What Projects Need to be Accomplished in PNP?
Project Assessment:
Is your work safe, responsible, and good for the world?
It is critical to evaluate how science can affect the people who will be implementing it and the people outside of the science community. According to the 2016 judging handbook, teams should “pursue questions relating to regulatory, economic, ethical, social, legal, philosophical, ecological, security, or other societal questions relating to synthetic biology”. This is where PNP comes into play. Referring to the Integrated Human Practices medal criteria, projects should be developed with local and/or global considerations. A way to achieve this is consult various stakeholders, experts, and the team throughout the design, execution, and presentation of their project.
In addition, PNP teams up with Lab to come up with potential applications for the main project idea using engineering principles, where the motivation for potential applications of the project must clearly defined. For example, we could take the overall project and explore how it interacts in different environments, how it can be implemented in different situations, how we can alter it slightly to gain new/different functions, how it can be combined with other project, etc... Project Assessment is particularly important as it fulfils both silver and gold criteria"

Figure 2. Expression of an INP-Silicatein fusion protein in E. coli driven by the ""Coliroid"" induction system. Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pcyA), heme oxygenase (ho1), and a cph1/envZ fusion protein (Cph8) are encoded on a single plasmid. PcyA and ho1 are expressed under a arabinose responsive promoter whereas Cph8 is expressed under a tetR promoter. This arrangement allows for precise control over which genes are expressed at what time which allows us to optimize the production and assembly of the photoreceptor. Once produced, pcyA and ho1 function to convert heme into phycocyanobilin (PCB) which then associates with Cph8 to form the complete photoreceptor. Photoreceptors exposed to red light are inactivated whereas those which are not exposed to light remain active thus stimulating the production of genes under control of the pompR promoter. We placed our INP-Silicatein fusion protein under the control of the pompR promoter in order to allow differential expression of outer membrane targeted silicatein based on exposure to red light.
Surface Displayed Silicatein
Our surface display team intends to use either an outer membrane protein A (ompA) from E. coli (BL21 strain) or ice nucleation protein (INP) to create a fusion chimera to display silicatein on the surface of the E. coli cell. Both ompA and INP protein can serve as a suitable carrier for other proteins which need to be localized to the exterior of the cell. The silicatein gene will be fused to the carrier protein using PCR overlap extension and other recombinant genetic methods. This fusion gene will then be expressed in living cells under stringent genetic regulation and the kinds of materials that can be nucleated will be observed.
Our initial efforts were focused on cloning ompA and generating a fusion with it and silicatein using PCR overlap extension. Our efforts to produce such a fusion protein failed, so we turned our attention to the use of INP instead.
Ice nucleation protein (INP) is an outer membrane protein originally discovered in Pseudomonas syringae. The protein has the capability of catalyzing the formation of ice crystals in supercooled water 6 . INP has distinct domains: the N-terminal module is responsible for targeting and surface anchoring, while a central domain is a series of repeating units that dictates the ice nucleation activity"
Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#overview_-_-_TEXT.html," instance), mass die-offs among the fish could devastate local ecosystems [5]. Containing F. psychrophilum is thus crucial to both the economic and ecological well-being of the earth's natural habitat.
Current Solutions: The current treatment protocols for BCWD involve chemotherapeutic agents. Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as oxytetracycline are currently being used  by fish farms to treat BCWD [4], but these antibiotics remain in the food we consume, leach into the ocean or soil surrounding farms, and give bacteria the opportunity to develop resistance. Antibiotic resistance reduces the effectiveness of the administered antibiotic in successive generations, thereby worsening the effects of BCWD over time. This prompts the need for a treatment for BCWD that is less prone to resistance than antibiotics.

We checked the PIG92 overnight that was started yesterday, but it was still clear. We started three more overnights of PIG92 in LB, LB+AMP, and LB+CAM. We will check tomorrow to see which of these is growing correctly.
10/11/13
The overnight of PIG92 that was started on 10/9 is nice and cloudy today, indicating growth of our bacteria. The overnights started yesterday are still clear, including the overnight in LB, so the bacteria just takes a little more time to grow up than we were expecting. We pelleted the overnight from 10/9 and placed it in the freezer for tomorrow"

We also met with Orit, who told me that for the demo on Thursday, I should formulate some kind of lesson plan for our testers. On Thursday, 6 chemistry class students will be meeting with us to test our applications. These testers will be our pilot study so we don’t need to worry about surveying them. Nicole and I also worked on our Powerpoint for our presentation on Friday.
July 17: Today I finished the Powerpoint for our presentation on Friday. I also finished making a rough draft of the lesson plan for our demo on Thursday. Things I still need to add to the demo are: information on how synthetic biology is actually carried out and more information about HCI and computer science.
July 18: Today we demoed our applications to counselors from International high schools. We gave them an introduction to the lab and showed off the MoClo Planner and the SynFluo Sifteo interactions. Later, the lab went on a trip to Horseneck beach as a CS outing with other computer science research teams.
July 19: Today 8 high school students came in to demo the SynFluo project. I started out by showing them the Powerpoint presentation, which introduced them to synthetic biology and to our project. Then the students split into two groups. Nicole demoed our project to one group and Consuelo showed the other group the Beast and the vertical Surface. We ran into difficulties with the project and Surface, so we also ended up showing the students more components of the Beast and the vertical Surface. The students seemed very interested in the project and found putting the E. coli into the Surface especially interesting. Some things that I learned from this demo were: the students had difficulty connecting the concepts of synthetic biology with the Sifteo project; the students had had little previous exposure to biology; the students were interested in the idea of touch interfaces and could explore and learn how things work on their own; the students were very cautious with SynFluo because we told them how to use it. These are some things to keep in mind for later. For my part, I will tailor the presentation to fit students with minimal biology knowledge, which should also help enforce the synthetic biology component of our project. In the evening, the whole lab went on a group trip to watch The Dark Knight.

We have been exchanging information and ideas with Lund while discussing the various topics related to stress and project management. While we are looking at the problem from the perspective of an individual, iGEM Lund are focusing on burnout related to management and group dynamics. Together we aim to create an overview of different sources that can cause exhaustion and also what you can do to avoid it.

This year 9 team members attended the DTU Biobrick Tutorial. A great event arranged to introduce many of the nordic teams to each other. This generated a perfect opporunity to create a great starting point for future collaborations. Nevertheless, the Biobuilder weekend also brought some great opportunities to practice transformation. It turned out to be especially valuable for early year students and students that never had performed a transformation before. In general we found the registry tutorials and the information about the InterLab study very useful since we before the event had a lot of questions about it.

Ideas collision with art-major students:
We have a talk with an art-major student from Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University. Her opinion was absolutely new for us and drove us to think deeper and wider about the relationship of art and science.
Key point:
Both expression approaches but different tools
Inspiration and method expansion
Information visualization
Encouragement also challenge from science-major students:
Rely on the platform of UCAS High School Student Summer Camp, we did a research among high school students who were mostly interested in scientific study from all over China. We were glad to find that the unconventional idea of combination of art and science has been well-accepted among the young generation. And many of them were as enthusiastic as us in presenting scientific principles, data, phenomena through artistic ways, and in expressing our perception of the world with both approaches. But they also express the regret of lacking relevant chances in their life to truly engage in such activities.
Key point:
Present scientific principles, data, phenomena in artistic way
Enrichment of form and expansion of audience group
Limited knowledge and practice
Interested but lack chances of engagement
Initiation of our imaginative thinking
Encouraged by the result of our general research, we were confident about the significance of our work. To seek the most precise point to cut in, we interviewed Pro. Liu from IBP, who is experienced in popularization of both science and art. He told us that just as Joseph L. Goldstein said in 2015 Lasker Award Ceremony, “The most original scientists (and artists) in our day discover new"

Linking Cells
The possibility of printing bacteria in structured layers is supported by the biological property of making biofilms. In this part of the project we studied the proteins that allow cells to produce connections, and how we can modulate their production
Introduction and Motivation
Printing a biofilm requires the bacteria to produce several components that allow them to make a connection between them. Furthermore, they require to attach to the surface where they are printed on. Finally, they need to make the biofilm only when it is desired.
In order to study the connections that exist between bacteria, we focused on the bacterial amyloid curli structure. These bacterial structures contribute to biofilm performances where cells interact with other cells and even surfaces. The curli consists of proteins bound together and to the cell membrane. CsgA, the main subunit, polymerizes in the extracellular space creating an amyloid nanowire; and CsgB anchors this nanowire to the membrane, creating connections between different cells (Joshi et al., 2014).
Consequently, we designed different versions of biobricks (see Parts) coding for the CsgA gene to create a biofilm in a controlled manner from CsgA deficient cells. To prevent premature biofilm formation and clogging of our printer, we designed the expression of CsgA to be  inducible by rhamnose so that the biofilm is only created after the cells are printed. This also functions as a safety feature in case of escape. The experiments (and their results) that we used to analyse the expression of CsgA and its promoter are explained in this section.
Fluorescence assay for kinetic measurements regarding induction of csgA expression
Background
In the kinetic experiment, the fluorescence signal of the proteins CsgA and CsgA-GFPmut3 (I13504) proteins expressed by our constructs was recorded in time. Besides fluorescence, we measured the OD600 of our cultures in order to normalize the fluorescence signal per cell. The main goal of this experiment was to see, if different induction levels with increasing rhamnose concentrations would lead to a higher production of CsgA. If this was true, the quantity of produced CsgA present in the medium could be controlled. This degree of control is key to achieving our main goal; making a biofilm with reproducible strength.
The obtained results can be used"

Nonetheless, when Hill’s coefficient (n) is adjusted to a value smaller than 2 and ‘a’ is set to be smaller than 1, the three stable points disappear and reduce to a single intersection, which indicates that under the above condition, the system no longer exhibits tristability. We therefore conclude that for the Tristable Switch to attain tristability, the following constraints must be satisfied:"

TU-Delft,2012,Team:TU-Delft#part1_-_-_TEXT.html,"2006 made a biobrick called the ‘banana odor generator’. With this part E. coli cells can generate the isoamyl acetate molecule. We aim to let yeast detect this isoamyl acetate signal with a olfactory receptor. The idea is that in future work the yeast should couple this back to the bacteria to have gaseous yeast/bacteria communication on plates.
The human receptor OR1G1 and mouse receptor Olfr154 are known to react on isoamyl acetate [11] and therefor these two receptors were used in this iGEM project.
Parts
A design of the receptor construct was made with the olfactory receptors placed between the N-terminal and the C-terminal part of the rat I7 receptor. As a promoter the strong constitutive GPD promoter is used and as a terminator the CYC1 terminator. The receptor can be replaced by using the restriction sites BamHI and NdeI. A FLAG tag is added upstream of the receptor sequence to look at the localization of the receptor in the membrane. The plasmid construct for the receptor expression was obtained by restriction of the synthesized receptor construct and ligation in the pRSII415 expression vector. The following biobricks are created:
BBa_K775000
BBa_K775001

The transformations with the plasmids were done in the S288C S. cerevisiae strain. All the plasmids were also put in a strain with a far1::kanMX4 knock-out strain. In table 1 all the strains that we made in this subpart are shown.

After transformation of the plasmids in the yeast a PCR reaction was performed in order to verify if the plasmid was correctly transformed. Since the PCR reactions were performed with single colonies we expected to obtain one PCR product with the length of the receptor part. However, for all the receptors we saw multiple PCR products on the gel; products with the length of the receptor, and products indicating that only the plasmid backbone was present (without the receptor). This indicates that during growth of the yeast a part of the plasmid was emitted.

Activities
The event began on Friday the 14th in the afternoon with the main course. In it, after the reception of the attendees we gave way to a series of very interesting expert presentations. We were able to count on the attendance of the following personalities
Victor de Lorenzo
He is one of the Spanish most relevant researchers in the Synthetic Biology field. He work in the National Biotechnology Center (CNB) a part of the Superior Council of Scientific Investigations (CSIC). His laboratory is specialized in solving environmental issues using genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida. He gave us an interesting talk about ""Synthetic Biology in the rescue of the planet Earth"".
Saul Ares
He is a researcher of the CNB too. His work is central in the mathematical modeling of Synthetic Biology systems. He has also collaborated with previous iGEM teams. His presentation talked about ""How do cyanobacteria count to ten"".
Krzysztof Wabnik
He is a Young Investigator Researcher of the Center for Biotechnology and Plant Genomics (CBGP) at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). The group he is leading uses multilevel computer model simulations, synthetic biology experiments and microfluidics. The name of his presentation was: ""Combining computational and synthetic biology approaches to understand the dynamics of plant hormone signaling circuits"".
Despite these inconveniences we had assistance from several participants of some teams (all of them came from within the Spanish territory thanks to the facilities for transport). Although there was an extensive program of activities, these had to be adjusted and reorganized so that the maximum number of attendees could enjoy them.
After the talks a social event was held in which the attending teams could relax having dinner in the center of Madrid with one of the most typical activities here: go out for tapas.
The second day was inaugurated with a visit to the university to show the facilities where our team works and it was explained which procedures are used in each of the sections that were visited.
Subsequently, the presentations of the projects were made. A simulation of the presentation was carried out as it should be done in Boston, to learn how to take the time and try to correct the excesses or lack of time in each section that was exposed.
In the afternoon there was a tour around Madrid, where the most iconic places of the city were shown. And although there were activities scheduled for the next day, this was the activity that closed the meet up"

Background
A universal platform for protein on-site detection
Interest in developing portable detection devices for on-site analysis has risen sharply in recent years. Many areas, including medical diagnostics, environmental toxicology and bioterrorism controls, would beneﬁt from devices that can perform a rapid ﬁrst-level detection without the need for equipped laboratories or skilled personnel. ZJU-China iGEM team this year successfully built a universal protein detection platform based on the idea of aptamer-induced inner-membrane scaffold dimerization. In our project"
NJU-China,2016,Team:NJU-China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," of the current status of clinical cancer treatment and patients' actual thoughts and real needs, enabling us more aware of the importance and urgency of developing new drug therapy, which proved the significance of our topic.
Most of the patients desire to try the new drugs, but the amount of patients who meet genetic testing standards and requirements of targeted therapy are still limited. Therefore it needs the joint effort of various communities to promote the development of therapeutic targeting drugs and enlarge its covering. At the same time, efforts should be made to diminish the cost of molecular targeted therapy as much as possible, becoming affordable for more patients and families and permitting continuation of more lives.
Interview with patients
Ms. Chen (60-year-old)      Gastric adenocarcinoma sufferer
Ms. Chen primarily realized her disease due to sudden hemafecia. After a thorough check, she was told that she has got poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. She had surgery on Dec. 22nd, 2013, removed the 2/3 of the stomach. In May this year, she suffered a plummet of her weight, from more than 140 pounds to less than 90. Her gastric cancer recurred. She ate less, and one examination showed that cancer cells could be found in 13 different pieces of tissues in her.
Ms. Chen’s treatment now mainly depends on chemotherapy, while cooperates with oral drugs simultaneously. Chemotherapy treatment period is 21 days of hospitalization, followed by 3 days infusion (Oxaliplatin) for about 7-8 hours per day. Her medication cycle is to take oral medications (made in Japanese) for 15 continuous days, then withdraw for 1 week, then circulate.
She chose imported drugs for chemotherapy (import drugs are at her own expense, while domestic drugs can be partly covered by medical compensation). Although imported drugs have relatively limited side effects, as it can prevent hair loss, there are still some adverse reactions like nausea and vomiting, and she felt numb hands and feet. Monthly cost is around 8-10k RMB (around 1300$).
She has adapted gene detect to find pathological cause, and she has more in-depth knowledge of molecular targeted drugs. Yet because the examination results showed that her gene type does not match targeting drugs, thus she gave up targeted drug therapy. When told that targeted treatment costs about 30k RMB (around 4500$) per month, she considered it as acceptable and affordable.

2. ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit
Abstract
ClonExpress II One Step Cloning is a simple, fast, and high effcient cloning technology and enables directional insertion of any amplied DNA product into any linearized vector at any site.
  Click on Me
Introduction
The ClonExpress II is a novel cloning Kit, independent of DNA ligase, significantly reducing the vself-ligated colonies and bringing a true positive rate > 95%. The enhanced Exnase II and highly optimized buffer significantly improve the recombination efficiency and the tolerance to impurities. Both the linearized vector and the PCR products of insert can be directly used for recombination without purification, significantly simplifying the procedures.
Steps
1. Preparation for linearized cloning vectors
Select an appropriate cloning site on the vector that will be linearized. It is recommended to select the cloning site from regions with no repetitive sequence and the GC content of the certain region (within 20 bp up and downstream of the site) stays between 40% and 60%.
The linearized vector can be obtained by digesting the circular vector with restriction enzymes or by reverse PCR. Double digestion is recommended because it brings complete linearization and low false positive rate. If single digestion is adopted, a longer digestion time is necessary to reduce intact plasmid residues and decrease the false positive rate. When using reverse PCR amplification to obtain linearized vector, it is highly recommended to use a high-fidelity DNA polymerase.
2. Acquisition of Inserts
The principle for the design of ClonExpress II primers is adding homologous sequences of linearized vector (15 bp∼ 20 bp) to the 5' -ends of both Forward (F) and Reverse (R) primers. This is to make the ends of amplified inserts and linearized vectors identical to each other (15 bp∼20 bp, excludes restriction enzyme cutting sites).
Firstly, design the forward and the reverse primer"

Our iGEM team made contact with Kabugho Beatrace through Hank Pellissier of the Brighter Brains Institute (BBI). The Brighter Brains Institute offered to partner with us, as they’ve supplied condoms to Ugandan women in the past and were interested in our new method. According to Kabugho Beatrace, the population of Kasese increases every day due to high birth rates. At the same time, there is also a high infant mortality rate, as mothers are in too poor of health to carry a child. The only contraception available in Bukonzo county are condoms sold in remote pharmacies. According to Kabugho Beatrace, the condoms are placed near registers and customers are often too afraid to be seen purchasing condoms due to the overwhelming stigma on birth control in Uganda. When we spoke with Beatrace, she was very supportive of our new method of contraception. She works closely with other women’s groups in Uganda and contacted them excitedly to discuss our new method and provide us their input on our project’s safety, maintainability, and cost. Our team is extremely grateful for Kabugho Beatrace and the connections she provided us.

Buhanga Thuligahuma Women's Group:
Through the recommendation of Hank Pellissier of BBI, our team contacted a Buhangan villager named Masereka Sebastian. Buhanga is a rural village of 2,000 people, and all are members of the BaKonzo tribe. The village is extremely isolated. According to Masereka Sebastian, you can't drive a car there--you have to walk 3 kilometers or take a dirt bike there. Being that Masereka Sebastian owns a dirt bike and can access printing shops outside of the village, our iGEM team contacted him to print our questionnaires for distribution to the local Buhanga Women. We had over 42 women interested in taking our survey, but we limited the number to ten. The women chosen to participate in our research were left to the discretion of Sebastian. Some women chose not to have their answers published as well. From their questionnaire responses, we learned how expensive contraception methods are, and how many women’s husbands don’t respond positively to them using birth"
Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"2H system, the promoter needs to have less leakage expression and respond sensitively to the proteins combination. After thorough search, we eventually found a mutant Gal1 promoter( BBa_K2637059 ), which was designed to functionally reduce false positive conditions. Besides, we selected Gal2 promoter( BBa_K2637009 ), which works independently in order to improve the accuracy.
We were successfully cloning four kinds of plasmids carrying the genes of mCherry, EYFP, NanoLuc and Fluc respectively with the Gal1 promoter and the ADH1T terminator by harnessing the principles of yeast homologous recombination. And also other four kinds of plasmids with the Gal2 promoter resembled the above four types, to compare which promoter works better. Moreover, to avoid the appearance of false positive phenomena which are likely to happen in the yeast two-hybrid system, we constructed the plasmids in four genres, and every kind of plasmids contained two cassettes consisting of Gal1 promoter with varying fluorescent proteins and Gal2 promoter with different luciferases. Only when both reporter genes function normally can we ensure that the system succeeds. all circuits are constructed respectively on the plasmid pRS416 and the details can be found in the table4 below. 
Ultimately, fluorescence spectrophotometer and multilabel reader were performed on our detecting process to analyze the expression of the fluorescent proteins and luciferases of the plasmid we constructed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae respectively.

Interview with Dr. Sabine Dittrich
We also had the opportunity to talk with Dr. Sabine Dittrich, who is heading the fever work in FIND's fever, AMR and Outbreak program. Since her general field of work, as well as her personal interest, is improving detection of bacterial pathogens both in human and environmental samples, we were excited to ask for her opinion on our project. She gave us advice on which pathogens should our first prototype target, considering the importance of respiratory pathogens in terms of antibiotics over-prescription. However, a Safety Level 2 lab is required for working with these pathogens and our lab is Safety Level 1. Thus, to meet this criteria, we chose the pathogens based on suggestions of PhD students from Prof. Simmel´s lab. Dr. Dittrich also mentioned, as Dr. Pardee before, that it is very important to keep our device simple and that it would be ideal if it could be stored at room temperature. We achieved that through the lyophilization of our reaction mix in a paperstrip .

Prof. Joyce Tait , from the University of Edinburgh and director of the Innogen Institute (UK), also conceded us an interview. She has specialized in innovation-governance-stakeholder interactions in life science and related areas, including cell therapies and regenerative medicine, synthetic biology, pesticides and GM technologies, drug development, stratified and translational medicine and biofuels. She told us that for fighting against the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance, it is very important to have devices for point-of-care diagnosis so that people could test themselves at home or so that farmers could test their animals for common pathogens. These applications are exactly what CascAID aims to offer with its low price and independence from lab infrastructure.

1 High Schools
----Mentoring new high school teams
This year, we publicize an assistant Handbook in Chinese version striving to help general schools get familiar with the iGEM competition and encourage them to take part in. Particularly, our handbook focuses on the basic information like long-standing history and medal requirements, as well as the outstanding works done by others. Beside, this book is practical for anyone who wants to know more about iGEM with easy-to-approach pictures and summaries which then gives readers a clear image about this competition. Our Handbook has helped five high schools including SKLBC-GDSYZX, SKLBC-China, Shiyan_SY_China, H4Z-Hangzhou and WLSA_Shanghai as well as several universities. Notably, SKLBC-GDSYZX started their first journey in iGEM this year within our collaboration. They benefit a lot especially from team setup guidance since it is their first time to organize an iGEM team. Questions like how to gather the talents and how to figure out their topic seem important for them. Although other teams are not the first time to participate in, they also learn a lot from our experience. They highly valued our work exhibition sector and paid more attention studying deeply. We believe that our Handbook can prompt their success and we are intended to help even more schools not just in China but all over the world.
