3) Attending Summer School (Theme: Social Epidemiology)
On September 9th and 10th, some team members attended 5th Summer School of Japan Society of Research and Information on Public and Co-operative Economy. (The venue was Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.)
The theme was social epidemiology which is a branch of epidemiology. This academic field focuses particularly on the effects of social-structural factors on states of health. Most team members major life science and when it comes to disease analysis and therapeutics, life science mainly focuses on micro materials like gene, metabolite, cell and etc. In contrast to the microscopic and innate viewpoint of life science, social epidemiology focuses on more macroscopic and acquired side of disease. This difference was interesting for us.
We received a lecture from Dr. Ando in Osaka University. Her recent research interest is disease analysis with work-related psychosocial factors. It was really meaningful for us to get in touch with her passion to find social prescriptions to improve the adverse effects of precarious employment.
Currently, the inter-disciplinary research between genetics and epidemiology is not quite advanced enough yet, we think. However, in the near future, when we analyze possible causes of disease, it'll be important to integrate both of the viewpoints.

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," all occasions, however in Figure 15 where the same experiments have been carried out using RFP instead of CFP the differences are not conclusively favouring M-B or B-M as the more active promoter. It is possible, therefore, that in the CFP experiments that there was a difference in the amount of cultured media that was used to inoculate fresh tubes (with more E. coli transformed by M-B + CFP being added than those transformed with B-M + CFP, resulting in more growth and thus increased production of CFP).
In Figure 7 and through statistical analysis it is shown that there is no significant difference between the growth of cells transformed by M-B, B-M or PyeaR compared to untransformed cells; this shows that the hybrid promoter does not affect the growth of its chassis.
Following the experiments over the 11-week project we have successfully produced two hybrid promoters including bacterial and mammalian elements in two orientations that sense nitrates and nitric oxide (and therefore likely nitrites). We have also successfully ligated the promoters to CFP and RFP as reporters, and have successfully transfected mammalian cells with M-B + CFP, proving the flexibility of the system.
Future Experiments
Full quantitative analysis to see where the values lie
In order to gauge how the promoter responds to different levels of substrates experiments must be first designed to test the sensitivity to nitrates, nitrites and nitric oxide. The experiments detailed above have characterised a great deal of the nitrate sensitivity; moving on from this a salt such as sodium nitrite could be used as a donor for nitrites to assess how the promoter responds to nitrites as a substrate. A donor for nitric oxide must be found as well in order to ascertain more easily how the promoter responds to this compound (nitrite reductase has been looked at as a possibilty thus far). Finely-tuned experiments will be carried out to find the area at which fluorescence intensity moves from steadily increasing to dramatically dropping off (e.g. 15 mM - 20 mM for nitrates), and once a range has been found experiments would be carried out with small incriments of change of substrate concentration. Repeats will be made of all experiments in order to more accurately detail the change in intensity compared to substrate concentration.
Combining the system with different reporter/effector enzymes
Now we have completed experiments involving fluorescent protein reporters the next logical step for our future applications would be to attach different reporters or effector enzymes. We could attach an enzyme such as nitrite reductase in order to increase expression of"

The team purchased an EnzyChrom Ethanol Detection Kit (alcohol oxidase) from BioAssay Systems to test ethanol production in their sigma70/PDC/ADH operon transformed into the NEB Iq E.coli cell line. “We grew the cultures with the addition of 2% glucose, since glucose can help improve E. coli growth. With this new assay, we were able to detect 0.02% ethanol”.
     “To further improve ethanol production, we contacted UNIPV-Pavia, who in 2009 was able to attain 2% ethanol production. UNIPV-Pavia used 10% glucose.” Jovanna and her team grew the cultures in 10% glucose, yielding 0.018% ethanol. This demonstrates that the Nevada's Team cultures respond differently than the UNIPV-Pavia Team cultures.
Growing Cyanobacteria and E. coli together, can it be done? Scientists may soon have an answer.
     The co-culturing apparatus has just been delivered by Matt Bowden, the team’s lead mechanical engineer.  The device will allow for growth of E. coli fed by Synechocystis without cross-contamination between the chambers. Stress testing of the device can now begin, in order to determine how to effectively keep it sterile, prevent all leaks, and ensure the water pump can run for the durations needed to culture cyanobacteria.
      The most important of these tests will be to show that we can prevent all E. coli from entering the cyanobacteria chamber, as contamination will quickly smother the cyanobacteria and prevent photosynthesis.  Methods will also need to be developed to sterilize the apparatus, as it is not autoclavable in its entirety and cannot be easily assembled in the sterile hoods available to the team.  This may involve running the device while pumping bleach through the system followed by a pumping with sterile water.  However, it is unknown if all of the tubing will be resistant to this treatment, and other sterilizing chemicals may need to be used.  Finally, we need to be sure that our water pump can run for several days at a time without burning out.  If the pump cannot last for the time required for Synechocystis to grow, we will need to redesign the apparatus with a sufficient water pump.
      Once stress testing has been concluded, we can move on to the final test of our project, in which we will grow engineered E. coli to produce biofuels from sugars provided by our Synechocyst"

Carmen: Could our expetations lie in sinthetic biology to revolutionize the science?
It’s too soon to see how the BS will develop in a few years however we have hope in this scientific field. BS provides several tools to improve the investigation thanks bioinformatic softwares and mathematics modellings analysis. Besides, the fact of using standard parts will provoke that science progresses faster.
Victoria: Could sinthetic biology create life at some point? I would like to mention the recent investigation of Craig Venter which is, in some way, related to this question.
After many years of analysis and investigation of life, it's time to start using that knowledge and create biological machines. Nowadays it possible modify wild organism creating this biological machines and fitting its with ours problems. However, except some privilege minds (for example Craing Venter), we cannot create life from scratch today.
Rodrigo: Sinthetic biology is viewed by some as a potential weapon, which is your point of view about it?
SB could be used as a tool for unacceptable purposes in the same way that a knife it is really useful in the kitchen but dangerous in the hands of a killer. SB has a great potential, if we use it to create or to destroy depends on ourselves. Ethical commities are necessary to harness the potential of Synthetic Biology so it is not used for harmful or unethical purposes.
Domingo: Is sinthetic biology limited by the ban of manipulating human genes?
t’s difficult to specify when a gen is from human or another organism. It’s totally legal manipulate human genes from other species which work in the same way that genes. Nevertheless genetical human experimention is still banned today unless the law would change. In this line, BS provides the necessary technics to investigate"

UI-Indonesia,2014,Team:UI-Indonesia#Human Practice#Expert Talking#yohda#_-_-_TEXT.html,". The coolest thing is: this will be the first one Indonesia ever have! She knows about our project we’re doing in the lab, so her point of view really matters. Find out her thoughts about our project’s safety assessment and the prospect of synthetic biology development in Indonesia!
Synthetic biology has been developing in Indonesia, but actually there are many issues involved. As a developing country, Indonesia hasn’t had a safety guideline regarding research in Synthetic Biology. But luckily, Indonesian are very “easy-going” and people will try to accept it as long as it can solve problems. A prove of it is shown by a biosimilar products such as erythropoietin, diarrhea drug, and other stuffs that has been commercially published. However, many aspects should be reconsidered including ethics, sustainability, and safety. UI is currently developing a guideline for biosafety and risk assessment for the first time ever in Indonesia. For our project, some things that need to be emphasize is we need to go through more specific study of the safety of virulence gene that would be inserted in the bacteria, and for further research we have to try it in in-vitro, preclinical (animal), and even clinical (human) for the last object.

Methylmalonyl-CoA Pathway. Making the whole thing work.
«
June
July
August
September

Week 6
In this week the first experiments for the genomic integration of the methyl-malonyl-CoA synthetase were set up. First of all the plasmids were transformed into TOP10 grown and purified. The first attempts on the amplification of the fragment didn't work at all and we ended up with a specific product of the wrong size.
Week 7
After a validation of the template plasmid via restriction digest the PCR reaction was optimised. Unfortunately none of the cells transformed with the PCR product using electroporation could be positively screened, no matter how the PCR fragment was amplified.
Week 8
As the repetition of the colony PCR under different conditions was still negative, new PCR products were prepared and pooled. To eliminate possible errors fresh competent cells were prepared.
Week 9
After doing colony PCR again and getting inconclusive results, it was decided that the genomic integration failed using this experimental setup. Thus we started from scratch using a new primer pair and finally it turned out that the polymerase was causing the problems. By the end of the week BAP1-pKD46 could be transformed.
Week 10
Even after running several colony PCRs there were no positive clones to be found. Thus the pKD46 was digested for validation. On the gel a miniprep from the PCR-transformed cells was included. The identity of the pKD46 was fine and the miniprep didn't contain any DNA, as expected.
Week 11
In this week the whole procedure was repeated again from fragment amplification to extensive colony PCR"

①With SZU-China
In our communications with SZU-China in July, we gave them several suggestions such as involving suicide system in the circuit design to enhance safety. Since it’s their first time to attend iGEM, we shared the experience about team building and registering and helped them to get familiar with metal requirements.  We consulted them how to use of flow cytometry and freeze-dry machine.
②With SJTU-Software
We helped SJTU-Software to test their software, recorded the testing video and took the photos. And we also gave the suggestions as following: a.Improve server response speed; b.Add log output; c.Grateful Shutdown and Exception Handling; d.Use native code in GUI components, which should be significantly faster and more flexible in comparison to Swing;
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).

Mr Holmes
Device and Software
The soft- and hardware aspects of our project are described in the Error Log, because we all learn from errors we made.
The Software: Measurarty
The third part of our project is our software `Measurarty`. The software will allow us to analyze the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells in a more advanced and better way than just using a simple tresholding technique. We will utilize a modern segmentation algorithm in combination with further, detailed image processing algorithms.
At the core of our segmentation algorithm is a Statistical Region Merging 1 implementation written for Qt enabled C++. Statistical Region Merging (SRM) is a straight-forward technique for creating regions in an image. Such regions then can be used for region-based image segmentation, the core of most image analysis softwares. Additionally, segmenting regions, instead of single pixels, brings an enormous performance improvement. To the knowledge of this team, most SRM implementations only use region-size and color gradients for region creation. We are going to change that.
Over the next few months the computational devision of our team will develop an easy-to-use, easy-to-run software for image analysis of color-based image analytics.
For this purpose we would like to present our novel approach in this wiki, and formulas will help you to understand our algorithm. Until the math-tag in MediaWiki is working again, MathJax will provide us with a $\LaTeX$ environment!

Cast 1% TAE gel, used 2 uL of 100 bp ladder to visualize result.
Fig. 1 Post-elution amplification of 6-mer (no beads). The desired product is ~712 bp. There are unexpected bands at 400 and 100 bp. These are probably due to non-specific amplification
This PCR confirms that the 712 bp band is the desired 6 mer.
The presence of other amplification products may be due to contamination of template by 3-mers (406 bp size) or IT construct (100 bp size). May also be due to non-specific amplification.
We can try temperature testing in the future.
I also want to try PCR without the GC-enhancer.

Fingerprint Ageing
Analysis and Modelling
Overview
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to work with a set of fingerprint data obtained from an Australian PhD thesis. The two aims were to find which lipid compound has the most distinct degradation rate and to find the general degradation behaviour of compounds within fingerprints. PCA is a statistical observation tool that reduces multivariate data to its principal components in order to visualize hidden correlations in data which otherwise contains too many dimensions to view these correlations. The results of PCA can be visualised through plots and graphs produced by MATLAB.
Using a method similar to that of the FluID models , the binding of lanosterol synthase and squalene epoxide to form lanosterol can be investigated. The aim of creating a model describing lanosterol formation is to find the optimum binding rates and optimum initial concentration of lanosterol synthase required in the fingerprint ageing device. Ordinary differential equations were used to investigate the concentration of each of the substances over time, and sensitivity analysis was used to find the optimum conditions. Click below to find out more about each section.
Principal Component Analysis
Consider principal component analysis and how it was implemented.
Squalene Epoxide Model
Consider the binding between squalene epoxide and lanosterol synthase.
Principal Component Analysis
Aim
The aim of this section was to find the principal lipid compounds that account for the most variance across each individual, therefore the lipid with the most distinct degradation rate across all tested individuals. We also wanted to determine how fingerprint compounds differ in quantity in-between individuals and against time. From the principal lipid, age curves can then be produced. This would be used as a means to deduce the age of a fingerprint if the concentration of the principal compounds are known.
Background
A dataset from a recently published PhD was made available to us. The data consisted of 336 fingerprint samples taken from 8 donors in a single day. The samples from every donor were then analysed in triplicates for lipid content across 28 days using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The raw chromatogram values were then normalised to take into account the quantitative changes between compounds (1) . The data has many dimensions to consider such as sample, age or donor, these can obscure correlations making it difficult to pinpoint where a correlation may come from. Principal component analysis is a statistical observational tool that reduces multivariate data to its principal components in order to visualize hidden correlations in data which otherwise contains too many dimensions to view these correlations (2 , 3) . Principal component analysis was the chosen statistical procedure"

ULB-Brussels,2011,Team:ULB-Brussels#Debate_-_-_TEXT.html," health involve large time lags, and are sometimes irreversible. Type I errors, on the other hand, are usually limited to short-term economic costs borne by the developers and marketers of GEOs.
 
Second, the precautionary principle assists in accounting for another type of uncertainty that arises from ecological systems research, something that is inherent in all biological systems. With regard to the release of GEOs into the environment, uncertainty arises from gaps in current knowledge about the behavior of a GEO, the novel traits modified, ariability in the environment, and limits in predicting the evolution of GEOs subsequent to their release in the environment. Third, by broadening participation in the risk characterization process, the precautionary principle may be helpful in reducing type III error, which occurs when scientists provide an accurate answer to the wrong problem, that is, they ask the wrong question. A realistic way to cope with such inherent uncertainty in complex biological systems is to implement an adaptive management approach to biosafety governance. Such an approach for assessing the ecological and human health effects for the release of GEOs into the environment that is consistent with the CBD adherence to the precautionary principle has been developed by the Scientists’ Working Group on Biosafety. It should be acknowledged that the precautionary principle has been criticized by some as being overly vague. Other criticisms of the precautionary principle include (1) current regulatory processes are already precautionary, (2) the precautionary principle is not scientifically sound because it advocates making decisions without adequate scientific justification, and (3) if it were implemented, the precautionary principle would stifle innovation by requiring proof of safety before new technologies could be introduced. However, a recent analysis has concluded that implementing the precautionary principle is not only good science, it is also good economics for at least 4 reasons: (1) precautionary action benefits workers, (2) precautionary action does not impose damaging costs on industry, (3) precautionary policies can stimulate technological innovation, and (4) economic logic supports timely action to avoid substantial health and environmental costs.
As regards society – scientists’ communication, it has rightly been raised by Professor Bruno André. It stated: ""the information is available everywhere thanks to the new technologies but you can communicate only to those who are interested. The question is how to stimulate their interest? "". We think that the iGEM is a good way to stimulate the interest of people. An international competition that involves students from different backgrounds and from all around the world is a perfect opportunity to have the media attention we need to touch many people.
Probabilities, in turn, have been invoked by Jacques Van Helden."
IONIS-PARIS,2017,Team:IONIS-PARIS#hp#society-law-gmos_-_-_TEXT.html," south of  France affected by very hot summer. We discussed about the dangers of cold and hot temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost and heat with the help of particular devices.
Mrs Leplatre think that our project is a good idea because global warming affecting the vineyards are the problem of the year. It was the first time that the south of the France has suffered from frost. There has been 10 % to 15% less production this year because of hail, frost or drought.
As long as your product has no impact on health, she sees no inconvenience in advising the vine growers to use this solution on their vineyards. She also give us some advice on our product. If our solution are working on the vine it will be necessary to irrigate the vineyard in addition because the soil will be dry too and it will be not enough to have only our solution.

8- Plant care discussion with  Agrauxine - 09/05/2017
The 5th of September we were invited by Agrauxine the business unit of the group LESAFRE PLANT CARE. They are specialise in the development of products from microorganisms for crop protection.
We had the opportunity to met with Mrs. PROFIZI CAMILLE (R&D director), Mr. RONAN KEMPF (Marketing and Development director) and Mrs.GARRIGUES CHRISTELLE (R&D representative from Lesaffre in Angers).
We presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get pieces of advice to improve our presentation.
They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project to others companies in the same field, what we should delve deeper such as the safety and applied design part about our project and what we should conceal  or place in the middle of the presentation to avoid troubles especially in France such as the term GMO and direct contact with the environment. Unfortunately they weren’t able to finance the project due to the company image in France but in exchange they put us in contact with several experts in the French Agriculture regulation like the ANSES and the contact of someone in the United States GMO regulation.
It was a very pleasant experience, to talk to professionals in the plant care, have their opinion about SofterShock and share scientific knowledge. We certainly developed our professional communication skills!

Background
Background
Transportation in America is primarily driven by petroleum. In 2017 alone, petroleum accounted for 92% of energy usage by transportation systems whereas biofuels were used for just 5%1. It’s no surprise; petroleum is much easier to obtain by tapping into the mass amounts of oil underground, and due to the amount of processing and testing biodiesel must undergo in order to be sold, petroleum ends up being the cheaper option. However, it comes at a cost to the environment. The drilling and burning of oil produces harmful byproducts, disturbs wildlife, and is ultimately unsustainable.   In a world constantly looking for faster, cheaper methods of production, the answer is typically found in chemical synthesis. Biosynthesis methods simply cannot match the efficiency and cost of chemical synthesis, despite the environmental benefits they offer. These benefits fuel the question: is there a way to make microbial reductive pathways, such as biofuel production, more efficient and less expensive than current methods?
Petrobrick
A publication in Science in 2010 showed that E. coli can be genetically modified to produce short-chain alkanes that can imitate petroleum and other fuels, although yields are very low at about 0.3g alkanes per liter of output2. In 2011, the University of Washington iGEM team used this to create the Petrobrick, a biobrick used to create enzymes (acyl-ACP reductase and aldehyde decarbonylase) that can produce alkanes in E. coli. This work can be used as a baseline for our goal: to create a system that would produce more alkanes per unit of input than is currently possible.
Microbial Fuel Cells and Microbial Electrosynthesis Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are circuits consisting of two electrodes in two media chambers, one of which contains microbes. The chambers are connected by a semipermeable membrane and a wire with a load, creating a system. The microbes act as the electron donors, and the electrons travel from anode to cathode, creating a current that powers the load. Protons cross the semipermeable membrane to bind with electrons and oxygen, making water molecules"
LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," It might be necessary to perform studies that show the successful distinction between failing and approved candidates that all seemed promising during 2D cell culture tests.
Competitor Analysis. As the market for bioprinting technologies of living cells is currently evolving quickly, the market has not yet been diversified (Appendix 8.). We do not regard any manufacturers of hardware components for 3D printers in the biotech field as direct or indirect competitors as we are not a hardware company but selling a holistic solution for drug testing. On the other hand, companies that actively sell drug testing solutions based on 2D cell cultures are our primary indirect competitors. We consider companies which also provide 3D cell cultures for drug testing our direct competitors. Within our direct competition, we distinguish between companies who deliver 3D cell cultures based on 3D printing and spheroid technology. As we are streamlining our competencies on the production of liver cells into a standardized version, we are not targeting the ordinary tissue engineering market but the market for preclinical drug testing in the pharmaceutical industry.
Fig. 4: The main competitors within the market of drug development assays are divided into direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors are further divided by technology. On the one hand the sheroid technology and on the other hand the bioprinting technology.
In the following we analyze our direct competitors based on the spheroid method. The spheroid cultures are mostly generated by the so-called hanging drop method, which is a technology based on gravity. The cell culture medium is poured onto the upper level of a cell plate, and in each well a small drop forms. Greiner Bio One International GmbH is a leading global partner in the fields of biotechnology, diagnostics, medical devices and in-vitro diagnostics based in Austria. At the ANALYTICA 2016 trade fair in Munich, we had the opportunity to talk to one of their sales managers, who gave us detailed information about the product. Greiner offers spheroid cultures to closely reflect the in-vivo tumor microenvironment. The spheroid cultures are produced by magnetic forces which hold the cells in a stationary position. InSphero AG is a Swiss start-up founded in 2009, which has already won several awards and distributes standardized 3D microtissue models based on the hanging drop method. The activities of SpheroTec GmbH, a spin-off of the TUM and 3D Biomatrix, Inc. provide similar solutions. The disadvantages of spheroid cell cultures are the irregular arrangement of the cells, so that the final tissue structure cannot be actively controlled."

2. Educational Outreach
The core contact point between science and the broad public is communication. The welfare of nascent scientific fields highly depends on the communication- and discussion-capacity of scientists as well as on the openness, knowledge and acceptance of society. Therefore, in addition to our practical lab work and theoretical philosophical analysis, we also wanted to introduce people of different ages to the novel field of synthetic biology. Since we believe that informing the public spreads understanding, promotes acceptance and avoids pre-judgement, we used most of our free time to communicate our work as ‘synthetic biologists’ particularly to children, high school students and undergraduates. Because we think disregarding the importance of appropriate ways of communication is definitely a counterproductive attitude, we tried to didactically match the content of our presentations to the age and background of the people we met. We also included our own thoughts about the metaphorical language of synthetic biology (see Philosophical analysis ) to give unbiased and clear information of synthetic biology, its products, possibilities and risks. Our educational presentation of synthetic biology has four sections:
2.1 Children - DNA-Extraction
2.2 High school students
2.2.1 Presentations for high school students
2.2.2 Practical training in our lab
2.2.3 Synthetic biology and society
2.3 Undergraduates – Compact seminar: ‘Theories of the Living’
2.4 Open house presentation
2.1 Children - DNA-Extraction
We have ‘spread the word’ of synthetic biology among kids at every opportunity. However, because it is sometimes difficult to express the main ideas of a specific new field such as synthetic biology to small children, we decided to not only to talk about it, but to make them experience it! We wanted to give the children a first impression in the tiny, but amazing world of cell biology by learning through their own action. Using a microscope connected"

3) Switch circuit
Questions:
Can we construct a simple and at the same time robust pulse generator that allows pulses of variable duration without modification of the construct?
Can we build a pulse generator that would work inside the chemostat?
Method:
We decided to build a simple pulse generator based on LacI IS mutants, which upon expression rapidly silence lac-controlled expression despite presence of IPTG. This allows us to induce expression with IPTG and terminate expression by addition of tetracyline. Since it is independent of removal of inducer by complete exchange of medium, it can be used inside the chemostat.
Results:
Using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis we generated eight different mutants of LacI and characterized them in a simple genetic experiment. As it turned out, all of them repressed lac-controlled expression even at high concentrations of IPTG. We constructed a pulse generator consisting of a tet-controlled LacI IS generator and a constitutive TetR expression cassette and demonstrated that leaky expression of the protein of interest as well as repression of lac-controlled expression due to leaky expression of LacI IS are not problematic.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA level. The effect of IPTG induction on the ER2566 genome are shown on the left and the effect on the pTXB1 are shown on the right. Thus illustrating how the ER2566 genome and pTXB1 act in concert when induced with IPTG.
Figure 2 illustrates the effect of IPTG induction on DNA level. The effect of IPTG induction on the ER2566 genome are shown on the left and the effect on the pTXB1 are shown on the right. Thus illustrating how the ER2566 genome and pTXB1 act in concert when induced with IPTG.
The E. coli strain ER2566 were used for the expression of the target gene cloned into pTXB1. ER2566 carries a copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene inserted into the LacZ gene. The T7 RNA polymerase is thereby under the control of the lac promoter. The pTXB1 contains a T7 promoter in front of our target gene and is therefore dependent on the presence of T7 RNA polymerase. To induce protein expression in ER2566, IPTG is added. IPTG binds the lacl repressor located on the pTXB1 plasmid and alter its conformation allosterically. The event prevents the repression of the β-galactosidase, coding the LacZ gene in ER2566 and thus induces the transcription of T7 RNA polymerase (Figure 2). By addition of IPTG we allow E. coli to transcribe the T7 RNA polymerase through the LacZ gene, thereby indirectly induces controlled expression of our target gene, through binding of the T7 promoter.
In addition IPTG is not hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase encoded by the LacZ gene as it contains a sulfur atom in its structure, thereby diverges from allolactose, which is the natural inducer of the lac operon and substrate to hydrolysis by β-galactosidase. The diverge structure of IPTG  prevents the cell from degrading the IPTG. The concentration of the inducer remains constant in the experiment, which allow the expression of lac-controlled genes not to be inhibited Juers, D. H., Matthews, B. W., & Huber, R. E. (2012).

What is ‘programmable‘?
Logic, which tends to be presented in the form of truth tables, shows a relationship between inputs and outputs. Below are the truth tables of the two basic gates: the And gate and the Or gate. So we quickly find the difference lies in the outputs when only one of the inputs is true. In the And gate if there are only one true input, either A or B, the output is false. But in the Or gate it’s to the contrary. So if we can control the output when only one input is true, we can successfully make the switch between the And gate and the Or gate, which can be called a programmable device.

How we make it happen?
We accomplish the design of the switch between the two gates with the help of the site-specific recombination system. Cre-Lox system is a typical kind of site-specific recombination system. The system consists of two components: Cre recombinase and LoxP site. It is a site-specific recombinase technology widely used to carry out excisions, insertions, translocations and inversions in the DNA of cells. It allows the DNA modification targeted to a specific cell type or be triggered by a specific external stimulus. We make use of the cre-lox site-specific system to accomplish the inversions in the DNA. When the external stimulus comes, the Cre recombinase will be expressed and then flip the sequence between the two LoxP sites.
After the flip, the direction of the signal stream is altered, which results in changes of logic on the physical layer. Through controlling the direction of the signal stream we can achieve our goal to make a logic-flexible device. Now let"

Discussion —— Primates experiments
During the experiments, we once noticed that primates are used in other research team in the lab. Then we found that Professor Xiang has project about primates, which are bought from Guangdong Blooming-Spring Biological Technology Development Company.
Then how about our project in the future? Will we use primates to do experiments before clinical trials? Is it necessary? Is there any other animals can replace primates? We discussed these questions with Xiang. For safety concern, the reaction of primates is the most similar to human, which is the reason why we use primates to do some experiments. However, animal experiments must follow ‘Three R’ principles, reduction, replacement and refinement. So, it is not sure whether our project is going to do primates experiments, which need to do further assessment in the future.
When you see the eyes of the monkeys on the photos above, how do you feel? Lovely? Cute? It seems really difficult to treat primates as experimental animals.
It has been a contradiction between medical development and animal protection. New drugs are always built on a grate amount of death animals, which sounds crucial but we cannot test new drugs on human first. Most scientists have to do animal experiment for human health. Primate experiments do make a great improvement in medical such as in AIDS and some emerging infectious diseases.
Sacrifice of some animals can save more human, but what about the equality of life?
Is it correct or not to use primates for medical development? What is your opinion?

Fig. 5 the Gaussian Plate to study locomotion on-chipC. elegans crawls like a “sin” function, so the width and angle between pillars are so optimal that worms can freely move. The radius of pillar is 0.25mm, and the distance of two pillars’ center is 0.6mm, which allow worms move in natural conditions.
After deciding to use this microfluidics to study the locomotive behavior changes, we are noticed that the shape of microfluidics is similar to the Galton board. [2] . (Fig. 6(A)) Therefore, we assume that C. elegans is just like balls in the Galton board. The force of slow buffer flow acting on worms is the same as the gravity acting on balls. Moreover, the probability for C. elegans chooses to go left or right is equal when it passes a crossing. (Fig. 6(B))
Fig. 6 A) The simulation of Galton board The distribution of balls is Gaussian distribution. B) the Gaussian Plate and the crossing in it the Gaussian Plate is simulate the Galton board and the probability is equal for worms to go left or right.
Both distribution in the Galton board and the Gaussian Plate are Gaussian distribution. Based on these, we can monitor changes in worms’ distribution. We injected diacetyl (2-nonanone) that C. elegans prefers (repulse) into the right (left) channel to make a concentration gradient of the Gaussian Plate. Because of the gradient, worms tend to move to the side filled with diacetyl (or go away the side filled with 2-nonanone), causing Gaussian distribution changed. If changes happen, we can make sure that inserted target genes in C. elegans will not affect it olfactory receptor neuron pairs. (Fig. 7)
Fig. 7 The Gaussian distribution A) The ideal Gaussian distribution before adding chemicals. B) The changed Gaussian distribution after adding chemicals by using the first diffusion methods, which means diacetyl diffuse in the same plate as the Gaussian Plate.
In order to make a concentration gradient, we come up with two methods to get it. (Fig. 8)

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," contamination still poses a big issue: it complicates correct,                             high-quality downstream analysis of sequencing data and usage in medical applications.
… our run times aren’t fixed, unlike the other systems. Some people even have what they                                 are looking for after a few minutes in real time, with success criteria not being based on total yield and an en-run analysis.
Clive G. Brown, CTO of Oxford Nanopore
This raises a simple question: How do you check if you have what we are looking for in a                             quick and easy manner?
The question could also be rephrased to: Is our sequencing run contaminated? In contrast to                             Illumina sequencing, in long read third generation sequencing (e.g PacBio or minION), there                             is always the possibility to abort a sequencing procedure, redo the library preparation and                             continue using the same chip. Especially when sequencing prokaryotic(-like) material, huge                             contaminations of the sample are possible. These could either be human DNA/RNA from the                             library prep, ribosomal RNA due to rRNA depletion not working, or even contamination from                             other organisms (host organism for phages, etc.).
Thus the earlier such contaminations are detected, the better the sequencing chip can be                             conserved for future use. Therefore we implemented sequ-into.
Especially since the library preparation and the sequencing are often in the hands of                             trained life scientists, while the down-stream analysis on the other hand is performed by                             trained computer scientists, there is often a gap in the workflow. Sequ-into aims to close                             that gap as a convenient cross-platform tool, fusing an intuitive graphical-user-interface                             with state-of-the-art long-read alignment software.
What can sequ-into help you with and what not?
Sequ-into is not an application for a thorough interpretive analysis of your sequencing                             data.
It can, however, be a very helpful addition to your sequencing lab routine. As it is easy                             to install and to use without much prior knowledge necessary, it is ideal for the very                             first assessment of your sequencing files.
In particular it allows you to quickly tell whether your sequenced reads represent what you                             aimed for to sequence or if your reads in fact stem from an unwanted source. Thus allowing                             for a fast reaction during long sequencing experiments and early alterations in your                             protocol in the laboratory prior to sequencing.
Later on, you might want to further investigate your sequencing data. Here, the extraction                             function of sequ-into offers the possibility to save reads of a wanted source or unwanted                             sources separately. Even the filtering by many"

Another developed point concerned relations between humans and other living beings. Some participants said that ethical committees unconsciously used an artificial hierarchy of living beings: some of them are placed before others without any biological or scientific basis. An explanation would be of psychological order: we feel closer to animals than bacteria because animals can react to stimuli and show reactions which can be similar to human feelings. We thus set up a better legislation to protect animals.

7.  What should we do to safeguard our rights and interests if our intellectual property is infringed?
First, ascertain the number of suspected infringing goods and the scale of operation at the crime scene. Obtain evidence from the same scene for several times. If your evidence can prove the large amount of the infringing goods and the operation scale and your repeatedly forensics can prove the operator sells the infringing goods continually, you may obtain much indemnity.
Second, ascertain the operator`s business information to avoid influencing the lawsuit efficiency due to the litigant`s own problems or other procedure matters.
Third, save the defendant`s website, propaganda materials or information kept at the relevant departments as the preliminary evidences to claim for compensation, for example, the data about their business scope, sales volume, or profits, which defendants profess and submit to some departments.
Fourth, search for the source of the infringing goods proactively and stop the infringement at the origin. In this way, you may obtain more indemnity at the same time.

Project Summary
We are currently pursuing the concept of brewing a gluten-free beer using a yeast that secretes an enzyme to break down gluten.
As Fort Collins is a major brewing hub, it was natural for our team to gravitate toward a beer-related project. Knowing full well the problems caused by Celiac disease, and the affinity many others have for reducing gluten in their diets, we decided to design and create a yeast strain capable of both fermenting quality beer, and breaking down gluten. To accomplish this we had to address several issues:
What is the immunological basis for gluten intolerance i.e. gluten’s antigenic qualities?
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive system. People with Celiac disease suffer from a severe reaction when exposed to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Glutamine and proline rich regions of gluten family proteins, which include gliadin in wheat and hordein in barley, are incredibly stable and cannot be broken down by the stomach. The antigenicity of gluten seems to be due to these proline and glutamine rich peptides, the most prevalent one being the 33-mer: LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF, found in gliadin. The sequence seems to be fairly conserved across barley and wheat. Three distinct patient-specific T cell epitopes identified previously in T cell proliferation assays are present in this peptide, namely, PFPQPQLPY, PQPQLPYPQ (three copies), and PYPQPQLPY (two copies). Upon reaching the intestines, these peptides are processed by a Celiac’s immune system, producing a response that damages villi in the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. [1] [2]
Where can we find a viable enzyme?
Our search for an enzyme capable of breaking down gluten and neutralizing its toxicity led us first to the enzyme mutated by the 2011 UW iGEM team. The modified Kumamolisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5."

Lots of Colony PCR's
Ran Colony PCR's of both silk in T7 promoter biobrick, as well as silk in pet vector in BL21 cells.
The results from both looked weird, but there was at least a faint band at the right size.
We inoculated the 8 colonies from the t7 biobrick and also 6 colonies from the silk in bl21. (chlor and kan resistance respectively.)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The emergence of multi-drug resistance in food-borne bacteria is an increasing problem globally. Described by WHO, CDC and other International agencies as one of the world’s most pressing public health threats, antibiotic resistant infections from food-borne bacteria cause an estimated 430,000 illnesses each year in the USA alone. This issue thus has attracted significant attention towards Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES- A SOLUTION
AMPs are gaining popularity due to their effectiveness against a wide range of pathogenic organisms that are resistant to conventional drugs. Since their mode of action, for the most part, exploits general but fundamental structural characteristics such as the bacterial cell membrane and in many cases they may have multiple targets within cells, the likelihood of the emergence of resistance is thought to be considerably reduced compared with that for many current antibiotics, which have more specific molecular targets (Håvard Jenssen et al).
For easy biosynthetic production, we decided to work with a small peptide, devoid of cysteine knots. In addition, we preferred that it not be easily degraded by proteases. Keeping these in mind, we looked for peptides that possess antimicrobial activity .Of the many that we came across, we were interested in working Lt2a.
ABOUT OUR PEPTIDE
Latarcin2a (commonly known as M-Zodatoxin) is a 26 amino acid peptide isolated from the venom of the Asian spider Lachesana tarabaevi. Latarcins (Lt-2a) adopt an amphipathic alpha helical structure in membrane-mimicking environments.
NMR structure of Latarcin2a
Amphipathicity corresponds to the segregation of hydrophobic and polar residues between the two opposite faces of the a-helix, a distribution well suited for membrane binding. The polar part is shown in magenta color, and hydrophobic part is shown in wheat color.
They produce lytic effects on both gram positive and gram negative bacteria via a carpet mechanism. As explained by Tamba and Yamazaki, this mechanism involves the external binding of the peptide to the membrane, followed by its critical destabilization.
Carpet model of antimicrobial-induced killing
In this model, the peptides disrupt the membrane"

Part 2: CAPSULE WITH BACTERIA
Capsule with bacteria - the capsule can be put in the fridge; after, it would be inserted into the microneedle and then using a snapping mechanism/force to break the capsule which starts the process and peptides go through the semipermeable membrane
Tuesday, May 17th
Device Prototypes:
Major idea #1: Bacteria, rich media (LB), membrane all in top of drug reservoir        
Variations of Major idea #1
Patch on top of microneedle array (patch is directly on top of patch)
Drug reservoir right on top of needles (i.e. no patch) and size controlling membrane
Problems: How can we actually put in things in this small drug reservoir?
Drug reservoir right on top of needles – media is initially frozen and then melted after application to body due to body heat
Problems: can’t make the media frozen because expensive (buy refrigerator)
Frozen media will also expand like water, so when it melts it may not come into contact with spores
1 packet containing the bacteria in the drug reservoir → snap the packet to release bacteria spore
Problems: How can we actually put spores in small packets and then put them in the small drug reservoir? How can we break those packets?
Introduction of a gel (on a “lid”/backing layer that is lowered onto the top of the microneedle array/drug reservoir) OR rate controlling membrane (hence we have a rate and size controlling membrane)
Problems: How do we put a lid on the top of the microneedle array? How do we stick the gel on the lid? If the gel falls, won’t it block the size controlling membrane? How do we put a rate controlling membrane in the small microneedle array?
Major idea #2: Leave microneedle as it is; have larger patch that contains 2 chambers to separate LB and spores
backing material (what the block is made of)
“valve”
size controlling membrane
adhesive layer
microneedles
Constraints:
70 degrees C to activate spores"

Thermostability Engineering Trials of Monomeric GRFT (3ll2)
B Factor Modeling
The B Factor of a protein residue is a measure of displacement due to temperature dependent vibrations and thermal motion of atoms in sidechain. Often, these values are used to identify amino acids which hinder protein thermostability. Using Yasara, we were able to calculate the B values of each residue and modeled the B values of monomeric Griffithsin using PyMOL pictured below. In the image below, red corresponds to residues with B factors above 17  Å^2,  yellow corresponds to residues with B factors above 15 Å^2, and residues shaded green and blue represent stable amino acids left unaltered in subsequent steps.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Through these calculations, we discovered, as expected, that only certain amino acids (SER, ARG, and GLY) in loops had B factors above 15 Å^2. Now that we discovered where the protein lacked in stability, we decided to run Yasara's position scan function to predict how we could alter these amino acids and quantify the improvement of thermostability.
Position Scan Profiling
The Yasara position scan function calculates the change in stability (ΔΔG) for each selected residue and the 19 other amino acids in the position of that residue. This function also shows how different noncovalent interactions are altered once each amino acid is altered and calculates the overall change in stability of the entire molecule based on the changed topology of the protein. Initially, we only used this function on the S, R, G amino acids which had a high B factor, but realized there were additional amino acids which could also have very negative ΔΔG values. We expanded the use of this function to all amino acids not in the binding loops of monomeric GRFT"

Using these results, actual experimentation is necessary to validate the pathway - perhaps, given future feedback the algorithm could account for user's successes and failures and preferentially bias results toward those experimentally validated.

Slide 29: StrepCy5 step signal in iRIf was seeable, but weak. Anti-GFP binding could not be observed. Plate reader confirmed StrepCy5 binding. Slide 12: results were analogous to slide 29.  Strep signal was weak, Anti-GFP binding not detectable. Even though blocking step showed properly the stamps. Platereader afterwards showed very strong StrepCy5 signal. We wondered why on the other hand it was quite weak in iRIf.

Slide 12: Platereader: Cy5 signal after iRIf
Additionally tests were conducted to investigate if proteins get pulled off, when blocking with the backside of a PDMS flowchamber. Half of each stamp was blocked with backside of a pdms flowchamber. Idea: When PDMS flowchamber pulls off the bBSA stamp, we should see a difference in signal intensity between the half which was blocked with PDMS and the one which wasnt. Stamps then were manually incubated for ~1h with 300 ul of 5 ug/ml StrepCy5. Intensity was observed in platereader: No difference between the halfes (blocked & unblocked) could be observed. Concluding from these experiments: Blocking with the backside of a PDMS flowchamber does not noteworthy pull of proteins (e.g. bBSA). →We should retry this approach to get rid off air bubbles when stamping.

Furthermore, our setup was tested. Measured Slide 208 (VisionPharma). General setup works fine (Jürgen fixed some stuff). Syringe first drove to wrong position, so many air bubbles came into system. Anyway measurement was continued. Blocking and binding of Strep could properly be seen.

Edinburgh_UG,2017,Team:Edinburgh UG#HP#Interdisciplinarity_-_-_TEXT.html," the trainer’s expectations were reasonable.
Particularly, a well-defined protocol has been identified to greatly help the trainee. The protocol provides                 clear and consistent terminology for both parties, and it gave a reference that the trainee can depend on,                 especially when they forget a task or technical terms. The trainers also reported the protocol aided them                 to perform demonstrations, which allowed the trainee to follow in a logical and precise manner.
Another aspect that the participants reported as beneficial was previous cooperation experience. While it may                 seem obvious, the results clearly pointed out when both parties were already friends or past collaborators,                 they find communication easier. In other words, practice makes perfect. Even if communication is initially                 difficult, it is worthwhile to continuously ironing out the kinks.
Nonetheless, as the survey identified, difficulties in collaboration remain. A common theme was that communication                 became difficult when too many technical terms were used by the trainer. Naturally, every discipline develops                 jargon. And despite the reported attempts of trainer to minimise their use of technical language, trainees                 still frequently complained that it hindered their understanding. Therefore, it is likely interdisciplinary                 collaborators were already aware of the drawback of technical language, but it should still be consciously                 and deliberately controlled.
Interestingly, there was a disconnect between trainer and trainee not before, but after the skill exchange. The                 last question of our survey asked both parties if the trainee can repeat the work independently. In every                 questionnaire, the answer from the trainer, with varying amounts of added qualifications, was positive. However,                 every trainee reported they would feel uncomfortable without guidance. Therefore, our questionnaire highlighted                 a disconnect in confidence. To illustrate, an experienced biologist deemed miniprep trivial, but every non-biologist                 that was taught in miniprep reported they liked further assistance to master the process.
Therefore, it is crucial to be reminded communication and collaboration are not one-time events. Instead, experts                 should consider them a long-term endeavour that requires multiple sessions before learners can fully impart                 the skill and knowledge.

Systematic Review of Previous iGEM Teams
Given interdisciplinarity is thought to benefit academic research, investigated the status of interdiciplinarity                 in synthetic biology, more specifically, in iGEM. iGEM is open to students from all disciplines and is                 interdisciplinary by nature. For example, human practices and modelling represent social sciences and mathematical                 sciences, respectively. Moreover, i"

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,". Previous studies on B. subtilis have shown that surfactin, a lipopeptide produced by the bacteria, inhibits the pathogens of honey bees, including P. larvae, A. apis and Nosema ceranae.1 This solution would be applied to bee bread, which we knew, the larvae ingested in their diet.
Through their feedback, we evaluated the risks of using yeasts in our product and the risks of introducing GMOs in what is known as ""harmless honey"". They emphasized that an overdose of yeasts would cause a fermentation of the honey and an alteration in the microbiota of the bees which could be counterproductive since this would cause diseases such as American foulbrood to arrive, they recommended us to be very careful with the dose and consider the addition of a fermentation inhibitor in our formula. From this meeting, we set out to investigate the export requirements of honey, which is the main product exported by beekeepers, and how our genetically modified yeasts would affect or play a role in these requirements.
One issue we were asked to review was whether the hexane extract of A.satureioides is oxidized because if so, it loses its qualities. Currently, a treatment that they use to fight diseases in bees is the oregano essential oil which they have already found to be oxidized. After further investigation, we verified that certainly, the extract that we wanted to add is oxidized by exposure to air. Another treatment that beekeepers use to fight diseases, is the sodium bicarbonate which, when it is spread in the hive, causes the bees to begin a cleaning protocol with which they take that bicarbonate out of their hive taking away the dirt present.
They mentioned they do not usually have much time to try different combinations of treatments and find out the optimal combination. They said there is not much research in the beekeeping sector, so it seems excellent that we intend to carry out scientific research in this field and try different combinations of peptides thus ensuring the best combination.
They also told us about other bee pathogens, Nosema apis and Varroa destructor. They commented that, if effective, our product is excellent, however, they also mentioned that in general there are many good products at a reasonable price, however, they are challenging to work with. Occasional applications are less complicated than regular ones. They look for a practical alternative, cheap and that doesn't consume time. Concerning the final product being a dilution, they commented that this was difficult to apply since, if our product was to be applied frequently, it would be laborious to have to spray every"
BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Proof#test4_-_-_TEXT.html," different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.
We assembled these corresponding circuits together for the final testing.
We assumed that, more arabinose added, more inhibitor will be expressed and the downstream in-promoter will be repressed. That’s what we are going to prove.
But when arabinose was added, RFP intensity increased contradicting with the expected results.                                 Maybe the terminator can’t completely isolate the two devices. Thought of it this way, we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits. The circuits are shown in the Fig.9.                                 So we change the promoter direction and add another B0015 to optimize the circuits.
After the pre-experiment, we chose a series of appropriate arabinose concentrations, and they are listed in table.1. The negative control is the strain containing the empty vector pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the (序号) with no arabinose added.
The improvement of device construction was that we added a terminator and changed the promoter direction. In this way, we could observe the decrease of RFP intensity when the arabinose concentration increases. It indicates that the change of arabinose concentration will affect inhibitor’s concentration, and the inhibitor can influence the expression of downstream gene. We chose the CI-pR circuit to do this experiment and got the diagram of the relationship of the time and RFP intensity under different concentration of arabinose.
From this diagram we can see, when the arabinose’s concentration reaches to 0.0030％-0.0040％, the RFP can hardly express. The result proved that the inhibitor can almost completely repress the killer gene at the turning point. Also,                                 we could say inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene.
Summary:
Above all, we proved that plasmid numbers will influence the concentration of inhibitor proteins, and the inhibitor concentration will regulate the expression of killer gene which is indicated by RFP measurement results.
After connecting with kill gene, the plasmids losing on different levels will influence the expression of killer gene, which means we can sense the plasmid numbers and accordingly decide whether or not to turn on the switch of killer gene. From all these, we can achieve the goal of controlling the number of plasmids as we need.

Lyon-INSA,2012,Team:Lyon-INSA#HumanPractice_-_-_TEXT.html," property rights), and too little on alternatives, e.g. open source systems, publicly financed innovation and prizes. (2010)
In a recent paper, Claude Henry and Joseph Stiglitz (2010) argue that the open source system, which has been widely used in the IT sector, can be an alternate solution to the patent framework to promote innovation.The aim of our approach is not to precisely characterize the way the ""open source approach"" could be adapted to the synthetic biology. It is to urge the iGEM community to embark on a collective reflexion on its contribution to the development of a ""synthetic biology commonns”.
The Commons: an alternative model
The open source software's users have been in ever greater numbers for the last few years. According to a study made by Markess International in France in 2009, on 160 French companies 92% used open source software during that year. The viability of its mere founding principle explains its success : the involved software can be used freely with a license (“open source license”) authorizing it and even allowing its source code to be modified and enhanced by the licensed one. At first glance, such a model would seem to be inefficient as the software should not generate any profit : their license makes them indeed free to use. However, companies have opted for a business model involving services and proprietary software (“proprietary bricks”) that complement the open source product.
Besides, the mere nature of this emerging sector makes it very innovative : a whole community back it up by enhancing the software's source codes. This system also allows companies to make profit on a patent-free position. That is why such a successful example could serve as an inspiration for our reflexion.
From the open source software to the commons approach
The open source system functions thanks to a wide community literally owning the diverse software under license.This community defines the rights and duties attached to the use and development of this software. As a consequence, the open source can be considered as a case of commons, i.e. a resource jointly owned by a group. This vague and ancient term has covered various kinds of resources, namely natural resources (e.g. fisheries, pastures and forests) as well as the immaterial ones such as knowledge.
The commons' management has been belittled for a long time. Indeed, since the biologist Garett Hardin published his famous article entitled “The tragedy of the commons” in Science in 1968, the negative arguments he gave against the commons have tarnished it. Hardin postulates that one pursues its own interest and as a consequence if a resource ("

Collaboration
A silver requirement for the iGEM competition 2018 is to cooperate with other teams from around the world. During our journey in our biological adventure, we have met other teams from different parts of Europe, to seek their knowledge and not least, their friendship. We have chosen to make a timeline to show how we collaborated throughout our project time and to document our increasing knowledge and friendships along our way to the Giant Jamboree!
13th-15th of April 2018BioBrick Tutorial in Copenhagen, Denmark
Team(s) in the collaboration:
DTU-Denmark (our hosts), UCopenhagen (University of Cophenhagen, Denmark), Uppsala (Sweden), Linkoping Sweden (Sweden), Stockholm (Sweden), Lund (Sweden), Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden)
In April, we were invited by the Technical University of Denmark to learn more about BioBricks. During this mini conference, we learned more about how to find and use Biobricks for our project. We found out more about submission vectors and different types of assemblies. We also had a possibility to train how to pitch a project and heard a lot of useful tips from former iGEM participants. We met people from other Scandinavian teams and we shared our project ideas and challenges with them. Overall, we had an amazing time and we would like to thank again DTU Biobuilders for organizing such a meaningful tutorial.

In May, we hosted a collaboration event for a German team from Tübingen. This collaboration was very special to us, not only because 2 of our team members are German, but also one of them is a current student there. The Tübingen team was happy to join us in Oslo to broaden each other’s horizons in synthetic biology. Since both projects were at the very beginnings, we only prepared a trial presentation of our current and planned work. We also discussed some of our poster suggestions and we got feedback from professors and students from the University of Oslo for both the presentation and the poster. After a helpful feedback"

Throughout the talk the great majority of the assistants showed interest on the topic and on the information given, since they are in a vulnerable state we believe that it might be easier for them to understand the relevance of mental illnesses.
At the end, we asked the people to answer the same questions as the beginning, to measure the impact of our presentation.
We considered this activity a potential success since the information was of great importance for those who are in need of help.  W.H.O. has also recognized that the stigmatization of depression and lack of availability for treatment is still prevalent. In Mexico, mental illnesses continues to be a taboo, with the increasing depression events in the population, this sort of talks are necessary. Our plan is to keep pushing towards an open dialogue for depression.

Insights: Not responsible. We thought that our product could be made working alone with E. coli, without considering the adverse effects that this could cause in people.
Changes: it was considered to test the strategy first in E. coli and later pass it to L. rhamnosus, a microorganism better accepted by humans.
Resume
Our team went to the company Kurago Biotek, experts in cultures of beneficial and active living microorganisms along with nutrients, to talk with them and receive feedback on the initial strategy that we thought to carry out, which was to use E. coli bacteria for realization of our psychobiotic. The company advised us to use a well-known probiotic, such as L. rhamnosus, since its benefits have been well studied and its good acceptance by the human body is known. On the other hand, they advised us to use E. coli only to test our work before passing it on to L. rhamnosus, since it would be"

Aalto-Helsinki,2015,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"ose polymers into glucose units, the proper hydrolysis requires enzymes endoglucanase, exoglucanase and β-glucosidase. Endoglucanases hydrolyze covalent bonds from the middle of polysaccharide and exoglucanases cleave oligosaccharides from the ends of the chain. β-glucosidases convert oligosaccharides into glucose which are utilized for metabolic reactions.
Usually, fungal strains Trichoderma reesei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce two different types of endoglucanases and exoglucanases belonging to different enzyme families. Due to our enzyme limit, only Type I cellulases (CenA, accession M15823 and Cex, accession M15824) from Cellulomonas firmi were chosen to be expressed. We found only a couple of Biobricks which could be used for our project from the iGEM registry but those parts had complicated status. Fortunately, the sequences were available on the registry for parts BBa_K392006 and BBa_K392007 and Distribution Kit 2015 contained the gene responsible for β-glucosidase BBa_K118028 from Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Therefore, we decided to synthesize endoglucanase and exoglucanase expressing genes utilizing the sequences previously mentioned and take β-glucosidase from the kit. These three sequences will be amplified with PCR and connected with the homology ends of genes created by primers. Our plan was to make the connections with Gibson Assembly method. The cellulase genes are positioned downstream to the same T7 promoter induced by IPTG.
Figure 5. Cellulose Plasmid
E.coli strains do not naturally contain any secretion systems for endoglucanases and exoglucanases so if the bacteria has previously been researched for cellulose degradation, usually the enzymes just overflow from cytoplasm to environment when enough proteins are produced. However, BL21 strain which we were using naturally contained β-glucosidase gene in the genome but because the expression levels and enzyme activities were poorly documented in databases, we decided to use the same gene Osaka 2010 team was using from Distribution Kit. For cenA, cex, and β-glucosidase secretion, pelB-secretion tag sequence BBa_J32015 made by 2010 Duke team was synthesized prior to the coding sequences of the cellulases which would then move into cell’s periplasmic space.

Technion_Israel,2016,Team:Technion Israel#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"]) so we presume that the change in concentration            of bacteria due to life and death is negligible, k3=0.
-The chemo-repellent concentration is known for every x and t.
-There are no changes in the flux of bacterial concentration at the start (a) and at end of the channel (b).
Mathematical Model
Under these assumptions the equation takes the form:
Equation 2: The Bacterial concentration problem.
The above partial differential equation cannot be solved analytically, so we must turn to            numerical analysis tools. The implicit Euler method is one of the most basic numerical            methods for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. This method is            guaranteed to be stable and gives us the solution for the entire space in a single point in time.
Using the following discretization:
Equation 3: Bacteria concentration problem – discrete form.
And we can write it as follows:
Equation 4: Bacteria concentration problem – Final form
Given the initial condition:
Equation 5: Bacteria concentration problem- initial condition.
And the boundary conditions which are translated to the following discrete conditions:
Equation 6: Bacteria concentration problem- boundary conditions
With I being the final value of i – index of location.
The above conditions keep the flux of bacteria zero on both sides of the chip as occurs in the actual chip.           Hence, no bacteria enter or exit the chip.
The above equation was entered into the Thomas-Three-Diagonal algorithm for solving matrix equations,            giving us the solution for the entire space of the problem in a specific point in time. By advancing            in time as we solve the equation at each time point we get the solution for the bacterial concentration            for every x,t.
Model results
We ran the chemo-repellent concentration equation in Matlab -            Our code can be found here .
The parameters used:
Table 1: Parameters for chemotaxis model
Please notice, the results are normalized to enable us to show them on the same scale.
The results are as follows:
Graph 1: Results of bacterial chemotaxis model
Model conclusions:
- The peak of bacterial concentration is caused by the bacterial chemotactic              response, moving away from the chemo-repellent, and concentrating.
- The ""wave"" of bacterial concentration starts moving relatively fast, and slows              down quickly. This is due to the change in repellent concentration. The ""wave""              converges to ~7[mm].
- The bacteria react significantly less to a normalized repellent concentration of              less than ~3[mm]. This is"

Reporter Cell SBML Model
The deterministic SBML model for the reporter cell was tested separately from the other two cell types in COPASI. Figure 7 shows the model schematic. RhlR is produced constitutively. When the C4 quorum sensing molecule is absent, RhlR is unable to activate expression from the pRhl promoter, resulting in no production of sfGFP. When C4 is present, it binds to RhlR, allowing expression from pRhl and production of sfGFP.
Figure 7 Schematic for the reporter cell model. Crossed circle represents a degradation reaction.
Figures 8 and 9 below show simulations by COPASI of the reporter cell with and without the C4 quorum sensing molecule present. As was expected, when C4 is not present, sfGFP has a low value, and when C4 is present sfGFP has a high value.
Figure 8: Reporter cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of sfGFP over time in the presence of C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Figure 9: Reporter cell SBML model simulated by COPASI. Graph shows production of sfGFP over time in the absence of C4 quorum sensing molecule.
Multicellular Simbiotics Simulation
The three deterministic SBML models described and tested above were used in the Simbiotics tool to simulate the entire multicellular biosensor framework. The cells were tested as three ratios to determine which yielded the highest sfGFP production in the presence of IPTG, compared to in the absence of IPTG (i.e. the optimal signal-to-noise ratio).
Ratio 1 - 200 detectors : 200 processors : 200 reporters
The graph below (figure 10) was created using data generated by the Simbiotics software tool using default values for diffusion of the quorum sensing molecules (C12 and C4), and the inducer IPTG, and default values for membrane permeation by the three molecules. The system was simulated in the presence (blue line) and absence (orange line) of IPTG.
When the three cell types were in equal amounts, there was no difference in sfGFP production when IPTG was present vs. when it was absent.

The different types of arguments aren’t always neatly sorted out as they have been presented, but often work in relation to each other or consists of different appeals, all to make a stronger argument.
Principles in bioethics
To guide the appliance and decision-making process there are some principles that apply in all arguments:
The No-Harm principle
The principle of Personhood
The Precautionary Principle
The No-Harm principle is perhaps the oldest principle in applied ethics and dates back to Hippocrates and his thoughts about practicing medicine. It simply states that one should not cause harm to another person. It’s intuitively simple in outline but lacks better definition of what ‘harm’ is - is it only physical harm or does mental harm count as well? The answer to that question normally depends on whom one is asking. For our purpose and understanding we’ll consider it to be intuitive that one shouldn’t cause physical harm or severe mental harm KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The principle of Personhood tries to state what defines a person. Some believe a person to be someone who is able to have a reflective view over one’s past, future and present. But this definition is far too narrow, excluding babies and people suffering from dementia. Other definitions are based on a contra factual understanding: a person is someone, who under normal circumstances can be expected to reflect over one’s past, future and present. This seems broad and lacks a good definition on what counts as normal circumstances KAPPEL, K. 2011. Bioetik. In: CHRISTENSEN, A.-M. S. (ed.) Filosofisk Etik. Århus: Århus Universitetsforlag. Aarhus Universitetsforlag. .
The Precautionary Principle has many different definitions, outlines and functions. It is said to be: “[...] the most innovative, pervasive, and significant new concept in environmental policy over the past quarter century [...]” MARCHANT, G. E. & MOSSMAN, K. L. 2004.

Slovenia,2010,Team:Slovenia#PROJECT#biosynthesis#carotenoids_-_-_TEXT.html," biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. The precursor for carotenoids is farnesyl pyrophoshpate. The first three enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway produce lycopene, a red pigment found in tomatoes. The next enzyme in the pathway, lycopene beta-cyclase (crtY), can transform it to beta carotene, which is a vitamin A precursor. This segment of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway was already available in the Registry and iGEM teams from previous years (Edinburgh 07, Edinburgh 08, Guelph 08, Cambridge09) demonstrated production of beta-carotene and lycopene.
Beta carotene can be further oxidised by the enzyme beta hydroxylase (crtZ), which results in zeaxanthin, a yellow pigment found in bell peppers or corn and occuring in retina of the eye. This is the reason that zeaxanthin intake is essential to prevent eye disorders, such as age-related mascular degeneration as the major cause of visual impairment in older adults, glaucoma or cataract. The gene coding crtZ was also avaliable in the Registry but its funcion has not yet been demonstrated.
Another biosynthetic pathway of beta carotene modification is oxidation by the enzyme beta ketolase (crtO), which results in another industrially interesting compound - canthaxanthin. This enzyme, however, preferrably oxidizes only one ring of the beta carotene, which leads to formation of carotenoid called echinenone, but when the gene is overexpressed, canthaxanthin can be produced as well. Canthaxanthin can also be further modified by beta hydroxylase, which gives red pigment asthaxanthin as a product.
Figure 1: Scheme of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathways with enzymes, used in our project.
Aims
We wanted to improve the velocity, yield and specificity of carotenoid biosynthesis in E. coli using the DNA-guided biosynthetic enzyme ordered assembly. We constructed genes coding for chimeric enzyme - zinc finger fusion proteins (see scheme below) and designed two DNA programs, which specifically assemble carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes of each pathway. A sequence of crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtO and crtZ enzymes should produce asthaxanthin, while crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY and crtZ should result in the production of zeaxanthin. (see scheme below).

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Isothermal Assembly
We performed an isothermal assembly in order to insert omega+zif268 into the plasmid containing the spec backbone.
The concentration of the plasmid (previously prepared) was 157.4 ng/ul.
The concentration of the w+zif268 was 54.3 ng/ul.
Using our isothermal assembly protocol we determined we needed:
0.63 ul backbone (length: ~2.2 kb)
0.59 ul w+zif268 (length: ~0.7 kb)
2.78 ul water
15.0 ul isothermal assembly solution
Transformation of electro-competent E. coli
We electroporated our cells so they would take up the plasmids, using:
1.0 ul DNA
40.0 ul cells
500 ul LB
We plated the cells, using this protocol , on spec plates, one of which contained 50 ul of cells and the other 150 ul of cells. The cells have been incubated at 37*, and will be left there overnight. Cells that have taken up the plasmid have spec-resistance and should be able to survive. Tomorrow, we will be picking colonies and performing PCR on them to determine whether they contain w+zif268.

MAGE3 plates look good--we'll choose colonies for sequencing on Monday.
Transformation of selection strain with Vatsan's plasmid:
We're curious to see whether Vatsan's plasmid (Zif268 omega, ZFB, wp, hisura) will have an effect on the (∆HisB)∆pyrF∆rpoZ strain's growth despite the seemingly intact HisB.
Transformed mid-log selection strain (reinoculated from overnight culture) with about 100ng of Vatsan's plasmid following standard procedure.

Protocols
Protocol of microfluidic
1. design the pattern of the biochip.
2. print the pattern on the mask.
3. prepare the basic materials like clean silicon wafer, photoresist and so on.
4. spread the photoresist on the silicon wafer and make sure the thickness is 10 um.
5. with the help of the ultraviolet ray, the pattern of the mask can be transferred to the metamorphic photoresist.
6. (photographic fixing)Bake the silicon wafer to solidify the photoresist for about 2 hours.
7. (develop the pattern)wash off the photoresist which wasn’t exposure to the"
