Overview
We designed a plasmid self-digestion system. This synthetic system allows to digest plasmids into linear parts of DNA and thus disrupt the expression of the genes carried by this plasmid. In our specific containment module, this will result in extinguishing the expression of the antitoxin (Colicin immunity protein), and any plugged-in synthetic device. This will lead to activation of the colicin DNAse toxin thst will degrade  the cell's chromosomal DNA, leading to its death.
Objectives
Find appropriate restriction enzymes which have to match the following properties:
The corresponding restriction site must not be found in the E.Coli genome;
The enzyme has to have high specifity;
It has to work in wide range of different conditions (pH, T°, etc)
Choose a strong yet tightly repressible promoter to regulate the restriction enzyme expression;
Clone circuits with different combinations of the chosen restriction enzymes and promoters;
Measure the degradation efficiency of the restriction enzyme for each circuit;
Based on the best combination, design a self-disruption plasmid.
Design
According to the first two of our objectives, we should find an appropriate restriction enzyme and to choose a strong yet tightly repressible promoter to regulate its expression.
Restriction enzyme candidates:
Fse I is a restriction endonuclease which recognizes an 8bp long DNA sequence: GGCCGG▽CC (CC△GGCCGG). The reason why we chose it is because it has the lowest number of restriction sites in  the E.coli genome: only 4 copies. We decided to use MAGE to remove those sites from the chromosome ( see for more details ). However, MAGE did"

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Model#flagellin_-_-_TEXT.html," estimation is for Salmonella flagellins, it is also basically valid for the E. coli case due to their great similarity in polymerization (Kondoh and Hotani, 1974).
The Estimation of $C_{m0}$
$C_{m0}$ is the initial concentration of flagellin monomers. In our simulation, we refered to the concentration given by Wakabayashi et al. (1969), which is around $5 \ \text{mg / ml}$. Transforming mass concentration to molar concentration gives us $C_{m0} = 9.667 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{mol / L}$. Therefore we decided to run our simulation with $C_{m0}$ varying from $1 \times 9.667 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{mol / L}$ to $10 \times 9.667 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{mol / L}$. Note that $K_m = 2.8 \times 10^{-4} \ \text{mol / L}$, and that the rate of elongation reaches half its maximum speed at this concentration. The range we chose was roughly from one-third to 3 times of $K_m$.
The Estimation of $C_s$
$C_s$ is the total concentration of display sites. From our fellow teammates in wet lab, we learned that the typical concentration of yeasts obtained after cultivation is $1.107 \times 10^{-14} \ \text{mol / L}$. From literature (Shibasaki et al., 2009) we found that although the average number of protein molecules displayed on each yeast depends on the type of the displayed protein, it typically falls between around $10^4$ to $10^5$. In our simulation later, we shall assume that $4 \times 10^4$ flagellin monomers are displayed on each yeast on average. This gives us $C_s = 4.430 \times 10^{-10} \ \text{mol / L}$. Notice that this concentration is far smaller than the value of $C_{m0}$, which implies that the monomers in the solution can probably accommodate a lot more yeasts. In practice, we can concentrate the yeast suspension to obtain higher concentrations. Therefore, we decided to run our simulation with $C_s$ varying from $1 \times 4.430 \times 10^{-10} \ \text{mol / L}$ to $100 \times"

Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html," ones without light treatment or ones without PCB. We think there might be a mutation in the strain which results in constitutive expression of beta gal, or a contamination with some fungus or bacterium that does. If it is bacterial contamination this may pose a problem for the co-culture assay. Hopefully not though. This assay will be repeated with a lower density of cells, cultured from a frozen stock. Meanwhile I am looking for additional strains that will work.    Per Oliver:  “So regarding the observation that the Y190 pif3/Phyb strains have a high background of B-gal expression when taken from either later cultures or an older plate VS. from the earlier frozen glycerol stocks. I have a hypothesis: There shouldn't be a selective advantage to any cells that have a ""leaky"" or mutated gal1 promoter driving B-gal, quite the contrary since they're growing in glucose, so it would be a waste of resources to crank out b-gal. However, the other reporter gene in this strain, which is also regulated by a Gal1 promoter is the HIS3 gene, which if turned on all of the time, will give cells a selective advantage if they're on media which is depleted of supplemented histidine, i.e. old overnight cultures, old plates, etc. Since B-gal is also turned on, maybe whats happening is that we are over time inadvertantly selecting for mutation(s) in either PhyB or Pif3 (and remember, there are multiple copies of these plasmids within each cell) that enable both proteins to bind constitutively now sans light ( or hell, maybe even sans PCB).  If this is correct, then then any Gal1 promoter regulated gene would be constitutively on in such a strain. We can test this hypothesis, if we choose to later, to see if HIS3 is also up regulated and also if Pif3/PhyB are now bound sans light in a pull down assay, and whether those Pif3/PhyB plasmids have a particular point mutation that enable them to be constitutively bound. Also whether this mutation can crop up under other selective pressures, ie. growing the strain using galactose as the sole carbon source, for protracted periods of time.  So what does this mean practically, for the rest of the experiments, if correct? Well, we should make lots of FRESH overnight cultures directly from our frozen stocks,  making sure that the media has extra histidine supplemented, and freeze those down. Make more preps of the PhyB and Pif3 plasm"

This BioBrick serves to replace MHETASE, a distinguishing enzyme which gives Ideonella sakaiensis it’s renowned plastic-degrading properties. The other enzyme that fulfills and progresses this property is called PETASE, which we substituted with the Chlorogenate Esterase gene (BBa_K2187001).
With the 2 known plastic-degrading enzymes of Ideonella sakaiensis being substituted with our BioBricks, which serve identical functions, our team believes that this is enough to prove that our genetic modification will work.
We know that Lipase and Chlorogenate Esterase will serve to replace the 2 genes that are unable to physically acquire, so with this is mind, we used the predetermined Prefix/Suffix, Promoter, RBS, and Terminator to build our BioBricks off of. Once we had the forward and reverse primers included into our gene sequence, we had the complete set of nucleotides with all fulfilled requirements; with this, we used these BioBricks and transformed them into E. coli cells through a plasmid. The antibiotic resistance segregated our transformed cells, and with this, our E. coli cells should be capable of expressing the said enzymes that instigate the decomposition of PET and MHET plastics.
From transforming our E. coli cells to express our MHETASE and PETASE substitutes, we are hopeful that our results are in accordance with our hypothesis.
The BioCrew's Visionary Aspiration to Accommodate the ""Real World""
The issue that we, the Baltimore BioCrew, investigated was the significant pollution of plastic in our community Inner Harbor. Using synthetic biology, we wanted to realistically rid such waste through the implementation of a genetically modified E.coli colony that degrades PET plastics using two enzymes from Ideonella Sakaiensis, a newly discovered Japanese bacterium.
We realize that under real-world conditions, placing genetically engineered E. coli into a reputable body of water valued by the large population of Maryland is not a very flattering proposal.
Taking the negative stigma placed around E. coli into consideration, along with the potential risk of marine ecosystems' safety and the possibility of this bacteria evolving, the Baltimore BioCrew wanted to establish a project design that would make our proposal seem less like a stunt and more like a scientific solution.
To demonstrate our whole system of using E. coli K12 as our organism “model”, the team deemed that it was advantageous in the sense that it was stable, inexpensive, quick to procreate.

It has seemed to be an old fashion to just impart             children             with the skill of painting a culture dish. Therefore, we selected the form of storing ""dream"" with DNA to             let             children specifically touch the ""future"". We are the first team to adopt this form, and we have witnessed             the light             of curiosity and aspiration from the eyes of those innocent children. When we saw the DNA secondary             structure of             these ""dreams"", we were also moved, realizing that ""dream"" can be not merely a tedious text of words, but             also a             painting which can be touched and perceived. Thanks to this event, making it possible for us to touch the             soft side             of DNA synthesis technology.
Simultaneously, the understanding of “life” seems much more diverse to us.
When we think of DNA purely as a substance that stores ""life information,"" we wonder why it is             ""quaternary""? and why             not ""binary"" of 0 and 1or other systems? Of course, but this requires us to explain it in the future. Plus,             when we             first saw the secondary structure of the DNA sequence that recorded the ""dreams"", we felt very familiar             with it,             which is virtually identical as the symbol used by the aliens in ""Arrival"". The form of the circle may be a             fixed             ""grammatical structure"", with the surrounding branches expressing the specific meaning. This also makes us             wonder             whether there are really aliens who use DNA as a material to store information and use its two-dimensional             or even             three-dimensional structure as a specific symbol. This event, admittedly, allows us to broaden our             understanding and             imagination of the words ""DNA"" and even ""life"" and ""civilization"" from different angles. It is just simply             novel and             interesting.

The above simulation was done for removing Cobalt from mining waste-water effluent. It utilizes a metal binding mechanism outlined in [2] which gave us a range of viable α. We got Ks and μm from [8], β, and κ from [9]. We estimated reasonable values for D, γ. See §3.5 for calculating the value of δ.
These results are incredibly promising. They show that the bioreactor can theoretically be useful at solving real problems, and that it operates within a reasonable amount of time (6.5 hours).
2.5 Sensitivity Analysis
In order to understand the dynamics within the bioreactor, we performed a sensitivity analysis that estimates the relative effect of a single parameter on the performance of the system. Unfortunately, it is not possible to define an explicit function relating the different parameters to each other, we must perform a ’naive’ analysis; we vary one parameter while holding all other constant, and see how this change affects the performance of the system. Performance is measured by how long it takes the bioreactor to remove the large majority of the particle that is desired for bioremediation. We set some small ε = 10 − 4mol L − 1 to define a low threshold of acceptable particle concentration. For §2.5.1 - §2.5.6, we kept all the parameters at:
γ = 1.1 (unitless)
κ = 0.01 h − 1
D = 3 h − 1

and only varied the parameter whose effect was measured.

ETH_Zurich,2011,Team:ETH Zurich#Biology#Detector_-_-_TEXT.html," network design as a basis in the planning process for our band-pass filter implementation [11] . Instead of cell-cell communication via AHL for the input signal, we included our different smoke detectors which detect small volatile molecules like acetaldeyhde, xylene or arabinose.
Inverter
Where it comes from...
An inverter is a part which converts a repressor signal into an activator signal, or vise versa. For SmoColi we used TetR as an inverter. TetR binds and blocks the TetR promoter (PTet, BBa_R0040 ).
How we used it
Figure 8: What would happen without an inverter: No GFP formation..
When the inverter is not present, the band does not appear because the activation threshold of the high pass filter is at a higher value than the repression threshold of the low pass filter, thus there is no region where both branches produce an output signal. If the input signal (a repressor) is inverted we get again a nice bandpass filter. In our circuit the inverter is only needed for AlcR, for AraC and XylR the input signal is correct (they are already activators).
Quorum Sensing of the Alarm system
Where it comes from...
The luminescence operon in Vibrio fischeri is regulated by the transcriptional activator (LuxR). The lux box is a 20 bp inverted repeat sequence at a position centered 42.5 bases upstream of the transcriptional start. LuxR binds to the lux box in presents of AHL and enhance its expression. LuxR is needed to activate the σ70 RNA Polymerase. The Vibrio fischeri lux operon consists of seven genes, the first one is luxI. The luxI gene encodes for the enzyme for AHL synthesis. The autoinducer AHL is secreted by the cells to coordinate gene expression based on the local density of the bacterial population.  Furthermore transcription of luciferase in the lux operon is induced, leading to bioluminescence.
How we used it
Figure 9: Promoter for luxR, the operon (red) designed between the -10 and the -35 region (blue) of the promoter.
For our system we used a promoter which is repressed by luxR! ( BBa_R0061 ) It was designed by placing the lux box between and partially overlapping the consensus -35 and -10 site of an artificial lacZ promoter. In the presence of AHL, LuxR binds to the lux box and inhibits binding of the RNA Polymerase. ["

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and"

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack June_-_-_TEXT.html," were each restreaked on two plates on Saturday. One plate was used as a control and the other one was UV shocked.
Today, we took some of each colony and mixed it with 1mL of PBS. This was vortexed and then centrifuged for 1 minute at top speed (15000). The liquid was removed and 500μL of PBS was added. This was then vortexed. 200μL of each of the 8 samples (four controls and four UV), as well as a blank of plain PBS, were put on the plate reader. The plate reader was used to find the cell concentration as well as the fluorescence. Using these two values, the normalized fluorescence was calculated and plotted in Excel. (See ""GFP Fluorescence Reading on the co-transformed plates"" for all of this data.) Using the concentrations, each of the samples were diluted to the lowest concentrations, and the concentration and fluorescence values were measured again on the plate reader. Colonies 1, 2, and 3 showed significantly higher fluorescence values that the controls. Colony 4 did not.
We inoculated the UV+pACYC184 and the three colonies that showed higher fluorescence values so that we can make glycerol stocks tomorrow. We used 5mL of LB along with the appropriate antibiotics (Amp and chlor for the 3 combo colonies and chlor for the UV+pACYC184.)
We ligated some more HSP and pACYC184. Used 50ng (3μL of X1:16.5ng/μL) of pACYC184 and 36ng (0.4μL of HSP:99.5ng/μL) of HSP. 2μL ligase buffer, 1μL ligase, and 13.6μL water to get 20μL total volume. Started ligation at 3:30PM.
We restreaked the three successful colonies of UV+pACYC184/GFP+pBR322 on five different plates. One is a control which was wrapped in tinfoil so no UV light would reach it. The other four were UV shocked for 1 second, 5 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds. Tomorrow we'll test their fluorescence.

Local Hospital Visit
At present, the main methods of detection of metastasis are lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and imaging method. However, main methods have some drawbacks. For example, the acquisition of histological specimens causes a kind of trauma that brings unacceptable pain to patients. Meanwhile, imaging method is difficult to be used widely for early diagnosis as they may not detect small tumors, for one thing, they usually cannot detect small tumors with diameters less than 0.5-1 cm during early HCC diagnosis. The development of proteomic technologies makes it possible to screen and discover novel serum biomarkers for cancers. Scientists have already found some differential proteins which are potential cancer biomarkers, and these proteins have close correlations with cancer initiation and progression. Besides, antibody microarray, a new proteomic technology, has been established for cancer serum biomarker discovery. Antibody microarray is a high-throughput method with high sensitivity and specificity, and integrates multiple detections into a mini-system. Multiple antibodies are immobilized on the surface of chips, and then this chip can be subjected to detect levels of various proteins in a sample simultaneously [1] .
We were decided to hear more stakeholders' voice about our protein chip, and we hoped that we could have a better understanding of our project. So we read some related journals. In addition, we hoped to learn about the current information about tumor detection means and obtain experts' feasibility and risk assessment of our project through human practice activity. Thus, we went to General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University to get experts' professional advice and investigate the needs of patients.
Primarily, the female oncologist we interviewed told us some current information about methods
used to detect tumor in hospitals in china, their effect, and their advantages and disadvantages. Current detection methods mainly consist of lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and imaging method as described above. As she knows, it is generally not to rely on checking serum during clinical diagnosis, but through X-ray, endoscopy, pathology detection method or low-dose CT. Pathology detection equals to extract tissue samples from patients for testing, which is not the most accurate and commonly used method but a must before being confirming case. In addition, there exist other awesome but in-development methods such as extracting blood samples from patients and doing the"

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," areas because the productions of astaxanthin require high level of industrial technology. The labour cost in these areas are high (probably take up 15% of the total cost). When we extract astaxanthin from rice, we can set up factories in developing countries (no demanding technology is required during the production of astaxanthin), which greatly reduce the labour cost.
3. The packing cost
The packing cost probably takes up 10% of the total cost.
4. The cost of marketing
This part of cost probably takes up 30% of the total cost.
5. Other costs
Other costs mean the costs generate during storage, transport and the cost of loss unexpectedly (for example, the losses due to the humid weather). These costs take up probably 15% of the total cost of the good. But the astaxanthin extracted from rice may have a lower cost because they show a better quality when the products are transported or stored.
6. Tariff
When the product are imported from other countries, tariff should be paid and it will take up probably 15% of the total cost of the product. And little differences are shown between the astaxanthin producted by different methods.
Though the comparison of the costs for astaxanthin productions, we can found that rice can be a great kind of material to produce astaxanthin, because it can lower the price of astaxanthin greatly and make astaxanthin more accessible to the public.
Buyer behavior
In the operating process of our company, it's significant for us to master the potential customers' psychology and behavior. At present, lots of cosmetics buyers could not understand the effect of cosmetic ingredients, most of the time just according to the cosmetics brand advertising and the price to choose whether they buy or not.
What's more, we found out our previous survey, pulic have an poor understanding of astaxanthin.
Question13: Have you ever heard of skin care product that contains astaxanthin?
Question 14: Will you choose a skin care product or health foodstuff that contains astaxanthin (gm)?
If new genetically modified foods on the market, about half of people can fully accept. Especially for the consumption of gm products (non-food), the public for its acceptance will be higher. Public do not know much about our astaxanthin product at present, so we should enlarge the propaganda. Our astaxanthin product will have a larger market if it made to be a skin care product.

Supported Standards
Synthetic Biology Open Language
Synthetic Biology Open Language ( SBOL ) Visua; is an open source graphical notation that allows the user to communicate sequences of genetic parts visually using a set of standard symbols which represent common features of operons. The specific symbols used in our application are the promoter, coding sequence, and terminator. A promoter is a DNA segment that regulates the transcription of a gene. There are two types of promoters that appear in the database: regulated and constitutive. A regulated promoter must be triggered, usually by a small molecule. A constitutive promoter is always activated. In this case, both regulated and constitutive promoters are represented the same way: with a bent, right-facing arrow. Coding sequences are DNA regions that produce some protein when transcribed and are regulated by promoters, and are represented by elongated pentagonal arrowheads. Lastly, there are terminators, which are DNA segments that signal for transcription to cease, and are represented with capital T. Promoter, coding sequence, and terminator symbols which appear on the same line are all part of the same operon. To indicate sequences that are oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction, arrows point in the opposite direction. The symbols are generated using a language called Pigeon[link], which is specific to SBOL Visual.
Using SBOL Visual, it is possible for us to communicate the exact structure of the design generated by the SBiDer application, thereby enhancing user understanding. This way, the user can design and visualize their desired output in silico, prior to wet lab production.
Systems Biology Markup Language
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) captures qualitative models using standardized syntax and semantics established by the SBML community and developers. By specifying the ""Level”,  ""Qualitative Species”,  and ""Transitions"" of a qualitative model,  practitioners are capable of conveying the entirety of their model to a large community without sacrificing any nuance in their modeling of a biological network. Level is an integer value that refers to the current state of  the network entities that are being model [ ref ]. In our Petri-Boolean model"

Introduction
      Minerals and metal are the building blocks of the smartphones and computers we use every day, of the vehicles that transport us and of the buildings we live and work in. Mining is a major pillar of British Columbia’s economy, generating over $8.6 billion annually and employing over 29,000 people (Steilo 2012). Many mining operations utilised water for mineral processing, metal recovery and dust control. However, the use of water in mining has the potential to negatively affect the quality of the surrounding surface water and groundwater. Contamination with high concentrations of metals, sulfide minerals or salts can increase the mortality, reduce health, reproduction and number of species in aquatic ecosystems (Lottermoser 2010). Moreover, serious impacts on human health can occur where water used for drink, irrigation or industrial applications is affected (Lottermoser 2010).
      The community of Trail, BC has battled pollution from Teck Metals since 1975 (Hume 2016). The community is afflicted with contaminated landfills, slag deposits that leach into waterways and a substantial plume that has spread beneath the city and the Columbia River (Hume 2016). Children from the community have also demonstrated elevated levels of lead in their blood (Hume 2016). Unfortunately, First Nations communities are among the most vulnerable populations when it comes to water contamination. At least two-third of all First Nation communities in Canada have been under water advisory at some time in the last decade (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015). Particularly, Alexis Creek First Nation, Nazko First Nation and Lake Babine, all in British Columbia, have water problems spanning 16 years (Levasseur and Marcoux 2015). The current project is aimed to meet the needs of these communities by developing a new method for water remediation.

Fingerprint Ageing
The Report
Abstract
Lanosterol synthase (LSS) an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) enzyme that specifically binds to squalene epoxide (2,3- oxidosqualene), which is present in fingerprints. We successfully managed to clone lanosterol synthase into pSB1C3 and the over expression vector pQE80-L. We successfully characterised its production by a Western immunoblot using an anti-His antibody. We then continued on in the hope to purify this enzyme from E. coli using Nickel IMAC.
Introduction
Fingerprints are defined as the ridge impressions left on a surface by a fingertip. They are the most commonly used form of criminal evidence globally, either equating or outnumbering all other forms of forensic evidence combined. A typical fingerprint is composed of 95% water with the remaining 5% being a mixture of both organic and inorganic compounds from the eccrine sweat and sebaceous glands. Figure 1 illustrates the key variables that interact and influence the composition of a fingerprint.
Figure 1 - This figure illustrates the relationship between fingertip, substrate and environmental conditions which collectively form a fingerprint and its constituents.
Fingerprints are used in forensics as visual identification due to the unique ridge patterns between individuals. In dermatoglyphics, the scientific study of fingerprints, there is a key distinction between the terms ‘fingerprint’ and ‘fingermark’. Fingerprints are defined as the intentional imprint on a surface for recording purposes and often with the use of enhancement reagents to make the impressions distinct and fluorescent. ‘Fingermarks’ are incomplete (either smudged or distorted) impressions deposited incidentally on surfaces. Latent fingermarks are the most common type of fingerprint evidence found at crime scenes. The often blurred ridges add an extra depth of complexity when trying to link the fingermark found at a crime scene to the fingerprint of a suspect. Despite the heavy usage of fingerprint evidence for criminal investigations, the forensic procedure comes with its limitations. The most common evasions of prosecution in court are:
The fingerprints of the suspect were found on a movable object.
There is an absence of evidence as to when the fingerprints were placed.
Both arguments could be effectively eliminated if a test existed that could date fingermarks left at crime scenes. The area of dating fingermarks based on their chemical composition is a relatively unexplored field in forensic sciences. This is due to the lack of reliability of proposed techniques. It has been suggested in theory, it may be"

Parameter Choice
Of course this model is useless without any good parameters. In this next section you can read about our search for decent parameters and its complications.
Copy number:
First we determine the number of genes transcribed in our model. We start with 2 genes (pchBA operon and bsmt1). They are not on the same plasmid but both carry a pMB1 origin of replication. This ORI has a copy number of 100 to 300 plasmids per cell. Therefore we assume an average of 200 gene copies per cell.
Transcription:
An extensive literature survey revealed that it is difficult to predict transcription rate, particularly combined with the proper promoter dependence. It is even near impossible without good wet-lab data.

The resistances must be properly chosen to select the desired amplification gain. Excessive amplification will not only amplify the signal but also amplify the noise, which is no desired in the measurement.
Finally, the output voltage is sent to Arduino, and it will translate that in a digital signal.

Light Mediated Translator (LMT)
As a final step, we are working in the design of a humanoid chassis that will friendly mediate the communication between humans and microorganisms. We thought in a C3PO-like bust because it is a universal translator -over 6000 languages- and is a well-known sci-fi character.
In the image on the right, you can see some of the elements of the fluorimeter as well as the C3PO mask (on the left) and the mannequin (in the background) we will use to construct the humanoid interface.

Processing Silk
Preparation for Silk Materials
Step 1: Degumming
Silk is comprised of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein of the silk and our protein of interest. Sericin serves as the ‘glue’ of the silk.  Degumming separates and removes sericin and is an essential preparation step before dissolving the silk. We found that commercially degummed silk was not properly degummed for our purposes and this step had to be carried out in-lab.
Raw, improperly degummed silk.
Same sample of silk after degumming.
Step 2: Solubilization
Getting significant amounts of silk (>0.25 grams) into solution requires the use of lithium bromide [1] . Protocols with less hazardous chemicals were attempted, yet none were able to reproduce results obtained using lithium bromide. The silk is cut into small pieces and dissolved in a scintillation vial at 60 degrees Celcius for 4 hours.
Silk solubilized in a solution of lithium bromide.
Step 3: Dialysis
Dialysis of the Fibroin-Lithium Bromide solution removes the lithium bromide, and results in an aqueous solution of the fibroin protein [1] . This solution can then be processed further in a variety of ways to achieve various structures and conformations of the silk protein.
Silk solution after dialysis.
Material - Silk Films
Silk films are the simplest way of processing the silk. The silk can be processed directly after dialysis. Dialyzed silk is simply dehydrated and the remaining silk aggregates into a film (protocol link). This simplicity may prove to be an asset as researchers investigate these films for next-generation medicine. The biodegradability of the films allows for technology like conformal electronics to be bio-integrated [2] .

LMU-Munich,2014,Team:LMU-Munich#Project#Bakillus_-_-_TEXT.html," inhibits the ribosomal translation process of the sdpI-mRNA. To evaluate this small RNA and its binding site in B. subtilis we designed two strains. One ∆abrB ∆sdpI mutant strain where we replaced the PydfG promoter with the Pxyl promoter (Fig. 5B). The second construct containing fsrA under control of Pxyl and replaced PsdpRI-sdhC'sdpI with the PlepA-sdhC'gfp, where GFP is consecutively expressed, (Fig. 5C) was transformed into B. subtilis W168.
The suicide switch as well as the delay loop are part of our modelling work:
Mathematical model of suicide switch dynamics
Mathematical  model with additional sigma factor for delay
Results
The graph shows wildtype Bacillus subtilis, the ΔsdpI mutant as well as a ΔsdpI mutant carrying our generated ( BBa_K1351017 ) in addition the graph shows a wildype Bacillus subtilis carrying an antisense RNA (BBa_K1351019) sequence which should bind the mRNA of the sdpI immunity. The LUMI-assay shows a normal growth curve of Bacillus subtilis and a ΔsdpI mutant which degrades in early to late stationary phase. The two from us constructed devices show in case of the inducible immunity in the ΔsdpI mutant an almost recovery in growth behavior when compared to wild type. The antisense carrying W168-strain showed normal wildtype growth and it seems like that an translational inhibition of the immunity was not functioning.
For the suicide switch we figured that a time delay was necessary before the suicide switch kicks in so that BaKillus has enough time to do his job. Therefore we decided to test if an insertion of an alternative sigma factor would lead to a time delay. For this purpose we designed two constructs: one having an inducible promoter in front of a lux-readout and the other device carrying an alternative sigma (ECF41 BBa_K823043 ) factor after the same inducible promoter. The sigma factor has to find its own specific promoter again (PydfG BBa_K823041 ) which was cloned in front of the lux-operon.
The LUMI-assay in the graph shows that we could achieve a time delay of about ten minutes using the alternative sigma factor route. For a reasonable delay we intend to implement a series of alternative sigma factors and their target promoters to achieve a cascade and therefore increase the time delay.

The level of miniaturization is becoming more and more “minimal”, as CFPS was reported to work in 300 nl-lipid droplets ( Taylor and Sarles, 2015 ). This points out that CFPS-systems are a valuable part  for the construction of artificial cells ( Lentini et al., 2014 ). Other exciting new developments, for example DNA hydrogels based on X-DNA ( Park et al., 2009 ; Zheng et al., 2012 ), reveal that CFPS is going to revolutionize research and applications around the world.

Making Competent Cells
Prepared 500mL LB broth for making competent cells. Followed procedure that is outlined in the protocol page. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we had to re-make the overnight cultures.
Prepared two 5 mL overnight cultures (LB broth) of Top 10 cells and XL Gold Ultracompetent cells.
Helped the bioinformatics department (Bachelor of Health Sciences) take apart computers in the morning.

Sequencing
Our sequencing came back and once again, it doesn't look like the B0015 terminator is present in the construct.  So we will go back to our most recent plates (from July 17th 2009) ad select different colonies and do verification on them.  So I set up a colony PCR with new colonies, following the protocol and the cycling conditions from from July 7th 2009.  We ran the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel with 1.0 kb+ DNA Ladder.  See gel photo below.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Edu n Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," we collaborated with the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE) to develop a course module for high school students consisting of four lessons and an experimental part. The actual design of the module was performed by three aspiring teachers from the ESoE. The module consists of several online modules based on the flip the classroom concept combined with a lesson at their school to prepare students for an experiment at our university. During the experiment they will modify E. coli to express GFP. Back at school, they will reflect on ethical issues raised by synthetic biology. We already made an appointment with a school in the region to execute the module when we return from Boston.
After several feedback sessions, Marc, Lotte and Milan presented their work in front of teachers, students and our team. We are looking forward to the execution of the module and want to thank Marc, Lotte and Milan for the great work and the pleasant collaboration!

European Meet-up Munich
20/07/18 – 22/07/18
In July, we traveled to Munich for a meet-up organized by iGEM Munich. We had a great time meeting other iGEM teams, exchanging ideas and we received a lot of feedback on our design and potential problems. For instance, iGEM Düsseldorf warned us for the risk of overcrowding of the hydrogel upon long-term use. This resulted in a potential collaboration with them; we may be able to use their quorum sensing Biobrick to prevent overcrowding, or perhaps even to prevent infiltration of the material by foreign bacteria. We also received useful feedback from Julia Müller, a PhD candidate at TU München who is attempting to print hydrogels.
We also came in contact with iGEM Hamburg. They were working on a project that involves a stable platform to seed their bacteria on. After talking about it, we concluded that our gel could help the project of Hamburg and they could help us with some degradation experiments of our gel. We decided that collaboration would be very useful and thus we are now working with Hamburg.  We would like to thank iGEM Munich for the perfect organization and all the participants for their feedback and ideas.

Figure 7: Reaction of EreB with p-NPB at different salt concentrations and negative control without the enzyme (right)
Result: The lower the salt concentration the higher is the enzymatic activity while simultaneously the decomposition of p-NPB increases. However, the reaction does not reach saturation as in the reaction with different pH (see figure 6). This is intuitive since the double amount of substrate and half of the enzyme's amount were incubated.
Laccase
File:TUM13 Animation Laccasex.gif
Figure 8: Animation of protein structure of Laccase
Laccases are an important group of effector proteins that can be utilized in bioremediation to degrade xenobiotics. They are copper-containing enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of a wide range of substances. It was interesting for us as the two important xenobiotics ethinylestradiol and diclofenac can be degraded using laccases and the general function of the enzyme can easily be investigated using the commonly used substrate ABTS which results in a chromogenic product.
During the planing phase of our project we decided not to add a new laccase to the Parts Registry but instead to continue the work on the best availible laccase. The iGEM team Bielefeld Germany 2012 has created BioBricks for five different laccases during the last summer. So we contacted this iGEM team and got the advise that the laccase derived from Bacillus pumilus <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> seems to be the best choice for our effector collection. As we wanted to try this effector protein in different localisations such as cytoplasmatic, secreted, or receptor bound we converted this enzyme to RFC[25] in order to make it compatible for protein fusions.
Bioinformatics: Laccase - a secreted enzyme
Figure 9: Structural analysis of Laccase by homology
For the production of effector proteins it is always essential to know whether they are naturally cytoplasmatic or whether they are secreted. Cytoplasmatic proteins usually contain a higher portion of cysteine residues as no disulfide bridges can be formed under the reducing conditions of the cytoplasm. In contrast secreted proteins often do contain disulfide briges which make them more stable to environmental stress. The disulfide formation is possible for the secreted proteins as the oxidizing extracellular conditions facilitate"

I went to 5 booths at Minerama, one of them was iGEM. When I looked up 'Synthetic Biology,' I knew it was the field for me. It was a place where, in time, I could actually do DNA modification myself. Plus, the project they were working on sounded really neat; a microbial blood glucose sensor for diabetic patients. I went to the meeting and really felt welcomed by the team, unlike some other teams I visited. So I stuck around, visited the lab, talked to the workers, saw how much they cared about their work, and quickly fell in love with SynBio.""

INSA_Toulouse,2013,Team:INSA Toulouse#contenu#lab practice#parts#submitted parts_-_-_TEXT.html," this gate are the production of either one or the both recombinases PhiC31 and FimE. The output can be choosen at will by insering between the recombinases sites any ORF containing an RBS site.  We also designed a test Biobrick of the gate (BBa_K1132036) with an inverted RFP protein as output.
This gate can be used in any regulation system, provided that the recombinases are assembled following the promoter of your choice with your specific regulations requirements. For example, if you want to activate the gate in presence of aTc and AHL, you just have to put the recombinase after the promoter activated by LuxR/AHL (BBa_R0065) and the promoter activated by aTc under the repression of TetR (BBa_R0040).
Even a relatively small amount of recombinases can switch the DNA fragments. Therefore, it is really important to control the recombinases expression with a well-locked promoter. You can look at our specially designed regulation sequence (riboregulator) to get as low as possible any undesired expression and production of the recombinases (BBa_K1132005, BBa_K1132006, BBa_K1132007, BBa_K1132008, BBa_K1132042).
In the present design, because of the promoter, the polymerase PolT7 is needed to express the gene. This promoter have been used, in order to have an higher level of expression, it can be assimlar to a amplificator. It is why we design one parts with the gate, the RFP inverted and the polymerase T7 after a promoter (BBa_K1132038).
Resetting the gate to its basal state requires a series of excisases capable of switching back the sequences to their native state.
In the same design, we build a XOR gate BBa_K1132003.
Furthemore, if the gene is inserted inside the gate in the forward direction, the gate will not be an AND gate anymore, but it will only be activated in the presence of PhiC31 and in the absence of FimE.

I’m Zihan Li from RDFZ ICC, a person who extensively observes, explores, and ponders; among all aspects, I see Biology as one of the most intriguing. Currently, I make electronic music, go on long-distance runs, do workouts, and try to help as much people as I can by teaching, but sometimes I seem a little bit “nerdy” and serious (especially when doing work). This is my first year participating in iGEM, and I look forward to make it rock together!

Methods: Approaching Our Project
As C. elegans is a multi-celleular organism, developing a concrete approach to our project required extensive research and planning. This section outlines our general methodology to tackling the bioremediation concept.
The Nose: Chemotaxis Mechanism
After narrowing down our project idea, the first step we took was to research compounds and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) our worm could use to detect pollutants. Since our team consisted of students from across Canada, members of our team were aware of the issues surrounding the development of the Oil Sands in Western Canada, which was part of the rationale for the project. We therefore chose to work with GPCRs which bind chemicals present in pollutants such as those found in the Oil Sands.
Below are the GPCRs our team worked with, in BioBrick form.

The Nerves:
Since C. elegans is a multicellular organism, we needed to make sure our non-native GPCR was expressed in the neurons that would stimulate our worm to move towards the ligand. To accomplish this, we researched GPCRs that would normally be expressed in the olfactory (“smelling”) neurons of the worm. Then, we kept the promoter of the native GPCR and substituted the rest of the protein with our foreign GPCR. Hence, our"

Athough “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” marks the termination of J. K. Rowling’s popular novels, we recreate a fantastic world where patronus are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fight against dementors inside the cell. Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates is limited because of inhibitors generated during pretreatment in addition to monomeric sugars. Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people’s hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production.
This year we are aimed at increasing the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to composite inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, such as furans, acetate and phenol (“FAP” for short) formed during pretreatment and hydrolysis. Lignocellulosic materials such as wood provide abundant and renewable energy sources. Lignocellulosics contain sugars polymerised to cellulose and hemicelluloses which can be liberated by hydrolysing the material using industrial waste acid, and subsequently fermented to ethanol by microorganisms, such as yeast. Lignocellulose-derived ethanol can be used as an environmentally friendly liquid fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of the hydrolysates is limited because a range of toxic compounds are generated during steam pretreatment and hydrolysis of lignocellulosics in addition to monomeric sugars.
The inhibiting compounds are divided in three main groups based on origin: weak acids, furan derivatives, and phenolic compounds. Weak acids, especially acetate, which is widely known as a kind of food preservatives, could inhibit cell growth. The growth-inhibiting effect on microorganisms has been proposed to be due to the inflow of undissociated acid into the cytos"

Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit of Sigma-Aldrich was used for the study. In the kit, the red peroxidase substrate is designed to react with hydrogen peroxide to generate red fluorescence signal that can be detected at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader. First, a serial dilution of hydrogen peroxide was tested to see if the kit works in our lab. As Figure 3 showed, the three-fold serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide from 10 to 0.014 μM were linearly correlated to red fluorescence intensity, demonstrating H2O2 concentration can be measured using this kit in our lab.
Figure 3: H2O2 assay. The concentrations (μM) of hydrogen peroxide were measured at red fluorescence intensity unit (RFU) [Ex/Em = 540/590 nm]. The serial dilutions of hydrogen peroxide were tested and correlated to red fluorescence intensity.
 
 
Next, we examined the activity of AOX enzyme by measuring H2O2 production from the oxidation of ethanol. We prepared 1ml of overnight cultured E. coli displaying LO-AOX enzyme. The bacteria were centrifuged and resolved in Assay Buffer provided by the Sigma-Aldrich kit. Then, the resulting lysates were mixed with the increasing concentrations of ethanol from 0%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.10%, 0.15% to 0.2% for 3 minutes at room temperature. The tested alcohol concentrations were at the range from 0.03% (the alcohol law limit for safety driving) to 0.2% (people may lose consciousness at this level). The following procedure was according to the manufacture’s instruction. The data were read out at Ex/Em = 540/590 nm in the microplate reader (BioTek Microplate Spectrophotometer). As Figure 4 showed, the intensities of AOX activity were significantly and linearly correlated to the concentration of ethanol in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicated that LO-AOX enzyme we produced has a functional enzyme activity and reacted with alcohol concentration dose-dependently, implying we can use this assay to measure the unknown sample of alcohol. Although we cannot make sure whether AOX enzyme was displayed on the cell surface of E. coli or not in this moment. In addition, it is noted that according to the manufacture’s instruction,"

LB alginate is viscous enough to print even without CaCl2 directly on the plate. Curing is carried out afterwards with CaCl2. However, the alginate then loses contact to the petri dish surface and starts floating around. Printing on LB agar + CaCl2 proves to be the best method.

Cells were still alive after 48h in 2% w/v 15 mL sodium citrate; all samples grew after inoculation with 5 mL LB CAM.
Cryostocks were plated for I20270 (interlab positive control), I13504_J23101 (interlab high promoter), I13522 and I13521. Best samples (high fluorescence and contrast to LB agar auto fluorescence) was I13521 (RFP) and I20270 (GFP). These should be used for bio-ink.

Presentation for high school students
On April 14th, a few of us held a short but enthusiastic presentation about our participation in the iGEM competition. Our audience: a bunch of high school students.
At the moment, we didn't really have a clear idea about what direction our project would take us in, so we mostly talked about iGEM and synthetic biology on a more general level and the ethical and safety related issues that  must be adressed in all synthetic biology.
Nobody fell asleep and they even laughed at our jokes, so all in all, we believe we did a really good job!
Local TV interview by TV2Fyn
On the 25th of April the local news channel, TV2Fyn, presented a short program about synthetic biology in Odense. The focus was on the creation of artificial life and the ethical aspects related to this field of research. They talked to the head of the FLinT Center, Steen Rasmussen, and a few other smart people, including us! It's all in Danish so you'll have to trust that Mike and Jacob said some very clever things. If you should like to watch us anyway, you can do so here .
He followed us in some of our daily work in the lab and it was a great opportunity to speak to the broad public about iGEM and, of course, free publicity is never a bad thing!

In early June, we crammed ourselves into two of the university’s busses and drove off to Paris. 16 hours later we arrived in the dead of night, a bit droopy-eyed, to our hotel. After a few hours’ sleep, we ventured out into the Parisian traffic yet again to reach the European iGEM conference.
Here we spent two days learning a lot of interesting and important things about the history of iGEM and synthetic biology, how to come up with an idea and, very importantly, how to tame, use and expand the parts registry. Lars Christian got so excited that he live-b"

UCSC,2018,Team:UCSC#Design-N_-_-_TEXT.html," perform the same function as progestins: preventing pregnancy. Progesterone can do so without the harmful effects that progestins cause (CITATION!!!!).  In mammals, the progesterone biosynthesis pathway begins with cholesterol. Enzymes convert cholesterol to pregnenolone to progesterone. Figure 1 shows a highly simplified version of the reference pathway for steroid hormone biosynthesis in mammals from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to highlight the progesterone biosynthesis pathway.
The organism we are engineering, Y. lipolytica, does not produce cholesterol naturally, but it does produce a cholesterol precursor: zymosterol. In Y. lipolytica however, only the zymosterol-ergosterol pathway exists. We considered engineering three non-native enzymes (circled in blue in Figure 2) into Y. lipolytica to complete the zymosterol-cholesterol pathway, due to the common pathway to progesterone in mammals starting from cholesterol. However, because ergosterol is the yeast’s preferred pathway product, navigating through the cholesterol pathway would require completely knocking out the pathway to ergosterol (starting from ERG6 on the right). The addition of those three genes, plus the additional genes needed to take cholesterol to progesterone, PLUS a pathway knockout required too much engineering for the timeframe of our project. The enzymes highlighted in green exist in Y. lipolytica, see the end product of ergosterol circled in pink. The enzymes highlighted with white do not exist, and would need to be engineered into the organism.
Figure 2: End of pathway leading to Steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway starting from Glycolysis, to Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, to Steroid biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica. Green highlight shows that those enzymes exist naturally in Y. lipolytica and white highlight means KEGG does not have enough evidence to show they exist in Y. lipolytica.
We needed to figure out how to create progesterone in a creative way. We found that we could create a synthetic pathway to progesterone, directly from ergosterol (circled in pink in Figure 2). This was beneficial because that pathway exists naturally in Y. lipolytica. In Y. lipolytica and other fungi, ergosterol serves similar functions in fungi as cholesterol does in animal cells (Money, 2016), meaning that while the pathway does not currently exist in the organism, it is possible to convert ergosterol to progesterone.

Our results - LLPS
The Metabolic Channeling experiments with Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) were conducted in yeast cells (S. cerevisiae). Yeast was chosen because of its average cell diameter of about 5-10 µ1, which is significantly larger than the diameter of E. coli cells (1-3 µm2). Yeast was hoped to be big enough to enable the formation of droplets. Such experiments have already been successfully conducted in HeLA cells[4], which have an average diameter of more than 20 µm3.
Transformation-associated recombination (TAR) was used to achieve a homologous recombination between the vector and inserts in the yeast cells. The vector pYES2-CT, which works in both yeast and E. coli, was used for that. It is depicted in the following figure 1.
Figure 1: Vector pYES2-CT, which works in both yeast and E. coli.
The experiment was then conducted with the following steps: First, Ddx4-YFP was synthesized by IDT with overhangs to the vector. In a next step Ddx4-YFP was cloned into the vector using TAR. This lead to the following final construct in the yeast cells, as depicted in figure 2.
Figure 2: Final construct of Ddx4-YFP in pYES2-CT.
It was then tested, if droplet formation due to the Ddx4-YFP was possible in the yeast cells. For that, fluorescence intensity images and bright field images were taken from yeast cells expressing the Ddx4-YFP and wild type yeast cells (YPH500 strain). The results are shown in figure 3. In the fluorescence intensity image of the yeast cells expressing Ddx4-YFP (induction of protein expression with galactose) bright dots can be seen, indicating the formation of fluorescing droplets. A comparison to the corresponding bright field image shows, that those droplets formed in the cytoplasm of the yeast cells. The wild type yeast cells show a small amount of background fluorescence, but no significant droplet like structures could be seen. It was therefore shown, that droplets do form in the yeast cells in which the Ddx4-YFP gene was inserted via TAR.

Human Practice Overview
Our human practice is an introduction of synthetic biology and our project to the society. We aim to introduce our project, ECONEY and find out how much the benefit of our project if applied in the society. Since our project working with honey, we want to find out the understanding of people in Sumbawa about Sumbawa honey by giving the questionnaire and directly involved with the society. We divide our team into small team and explore some Sumbawa regions that produce honey to find respondent based on the target. Our target respondent is focus on Sumbawa people who work as the producer, distributor, and consumer of Sumbawa honey.
We ask for suggestions from the society and several organizations such as Network Sumbawa Forest Honey. Discussions with the society and organizations who are experts make us become more understand of the society needed. We also got very useful input for the sustainability of our projects.
Through this activity, people's understanding of Sumbawa honey is also increasing. We introduce to the public some information about Sumbawa honey such as how to distinguish between genuine and fake honey, a tool used to measure the levels of glucose in honey, until any product that can be produced made from honey."

**After meeting with our advisors, we decided to put this project on hold and focus our efforts on the promoter project**
Butanol Project
April 21-28
A rough draft of Castor and Pollux were designed using a 2A sequence to separate the different genes in the pathway. The amino acid sequences for the genes were tracked down and converted back into optimized nucleic acid sequences for Nicotiana and Physcomitrella. Sequences for the CMV promoter and NOS terminator were also found and added to the sequences.
May 12-18
More research was done into the 2A sequence, and we are more confident that we can chain together the different proteins for Castor and Pollux. This also raised concerns that the 2A sequence would leave “scars” on the the upstream and downstream coding sequences. This was addressed by searching for the structures of the proteins in Castor and Pollux and placing the 2A sequence at the least obstructed end of the protein.
May 19-25
Other pathways that utilized NADH were found that could synthesize butanol, but the team decided to stay with a NADPH dependent pathway. It was also suggested by our advisors that we could divert one of the intermediates in the butanol synthesis pathway for making a plastic as a secondary product. The proteins in the butanol synthesis pathway were checked again to make sure that the 2A sequence would interfere as little as possible with protein folding. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for stop codons and edited to remove restriction sites that could be problematic in the future.
May 26-June 1
An enzyme that could catalyze the synthesis of the plastic, polyhydroxybutyrate, was tracked down. This enzyme will be in its own construct to allow for co-transformation to make either plastic or butanol. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for errors and corrected. They were also optimized for assembly.
June 2-8
The three constructs – PhaC, Castor, and Pollux –were run through final checks.  Vector plasmids were also cultured.
June 9-15
DNA was ordered for the synthesis of PhaC and Castor. Various issues were addressed concerning problems with synthesis. As a result the NOS terminator would have to be amplified from a source, and could not be synthesized.
June 16-22
The NOS terminators were amplified in preparation for assembly of PhaC and Castor.

Membrane Accelerator
- Fatty Acid and Alkane Biosynthesis
State of the art
Fatty acids are promising biofuel precursors with a broad and bright future. An enzyme system of nine proteins is responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis in E.coli and is first introduced to iGEM by our team. We choose four crucial enzymes, TesA, FabG, FabZ, and FabI, to prove the feasibility of the Membrane Accelerator and to enhance rate of fatty acids synthesis. Moreover, we tried to further accelerate the alkane biosynthetic pathway in E.coli.
Aims
To identify and evaluate two outstanding features of the Membrane as a scaffold: the priority of products to exportation and the refinement of interaction.
To testify the feasibility of the Membrane Accelerator device in the context of fatty acids synthesis.
To upgrade fatty-acid-producing Membrane Accelerator device with alkane synthesis function.
To justify the universality of Membrane Accelerator
Achievements
4 enzyme-bearing fusion proteins constructed that localize on membrane and assemble orderly.
50% yield increase of fatty acids sinply through localizing single TesA onto E.coli's inner membrane.
24 fold of yield increase of fatty acids by localizing TesA, FabG, FabZ, and FabI onto E.coli's inner membrane.
fatty-acid-producing Membrane Accelerator upgrades by introducing additional two enzymes that convert fatty acids into alkane.
Background
We put Membrane Accelerator system into practice context to justify its versatility and efficiency.
Fatty acid derivatives are to emerge as prominent fuels in the marketplace. Their high energy density and low water solubility make them promising alternatives to fossil fuel as transportation fuels. Biosynthesis, among all the biofuels production methods, is the most sustainable, environmental friendly and less controversial one.
Initial fatty acid biosynthesis in E.coli is catalyzed by a series of nine enzymes and the final release of free fatty acids is catalyzed by a thioesterase via hydrolysis of"

With these skills I was able to give it my all on every front. Myself and a few others decided to split our efforts between lab work and fundraising. Together we were able to fund about $23,000, and during this time, these very same colleagues along with the rest of the team, have become my second family.

Obtaining materials
All listed vectors are available to iGEM teams and Registry labs and courses through the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
As of spring 2010, we recommend using linear construction plasmid backbones that are available from the Registry or that you make yourself using PCR.
Troubleshooting
In our experience, most problems with 3A Assembly come from the transformation process. Because 3A Assembly uses a triple ligation, the concentration of assembled DNA is about 10% of that produced by a double ligation process. Particularly, if your lab makes its own competent cells (and particularly chemically competent cells) it is important to test the competency. If you are having trouble obtaining colonies, we suggest that you try commercial competent cells. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Do not add more ligation product than specified and be careful when resuspending the"

In our proof of concept, we transformed two cell populations with different chromoproteins. The cells expressing the chromoproteins were mixed to form new colours from various co-cultures. We also found that different chromoproteins placed varied loads on the the cell populations, resulting in different growth rates, so that, if grown together, one coloured population would likely outcompete the other. Our Genetically Engineered Artificial Ratio (G.E.A.R.) system could work to maintain the colour of the co-culture by slowing the growth of the faster growing population.

USTC,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,"The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. when a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.
The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations."" (cite from the website)
Why PSO?
In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Compared to GA, the advantages of PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that this algorithm is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Basic Formulas of PSO
First we must be clear with several concepts:
particle:have a position and a velocity, fly through parameter space
velocity: velocity of a particle in the parameter space
pbest: The best solution a particle has achieved so far
lbest: Best solution obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle
gbest: The best solution achieved by all particles so far
Parameters used in PSO algorithm:
Number of Particles:
learning factors <math>c_{1}</math>, <math>c_{2}</math>
inertial factor <math>w</math>
range of parameter and velocity on each dimension
optimization threshold
The particles update their positions and velocities with following equation:
<math>v[] = w*v[] + c_{1}*rand()*(pbest[]-postion[]) + c_{2}*rand()*(gbest[] - position[])</math>
<math>position[] = position[] + v[]</math>
where <math>c_{1}</math> and <math>c_{2}</math> are two learning factors, we choose <math>c_{1"

Investigations into alternative genetic tools were also undertaken, most notably MuGENT and Recombineering.
MuGENT takes advantage of V. natriegens natural competence by inducing the TfoX system. The TfoX system, which is known from many Vibrio species, enables uptake and genomic integration of
DNA
parts via homologous recombination (Pollack-Berti 2010). In most cases, growth on chitin was identified as the trigger which activated the system. Regrettably, the trigger is not known for V. natriegens. Using this system, a group of researchers characterized this system in V. natriegens, making it usable by placing it under the control of an inducible promoter. Additionally, they demonstrated its potential by increasing the natural poly-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production 100-fold (Dalia et al. 2017).
Recombineering takes advantage of the fact that short
DNA
oligonucleotides, that can easily be delivered into cells by a plethora of ways, can be used to generate point mutations, knockouts and small modifications in the genome, as well as on plasmids. The homologous flanks required are relatively short, allowing for constructs under 100
bp
. Having this system available in V. natriegens means that generating new strains and gene variants is easy and quickly implemented (Lee et al. 2017).

Very recently, several groups have published their work about cell free protein expression systems (CFPS) in V. natriegens (Failmezger et al. 2018; Des Soye et al. 2018; Wiegand et al. 2018). Cell free systems offer the advantage of direct access to many cell components as well as fine control over the conditions in the reaction (Carlson et al. 2012). While these are true for all
CFPSs
, the advantage of creating such a system from V. natriegens is the much higher ribosome count (Failmezger et al. 2018).
Although the system works well when expressing plasmids from E. coli, it could be shown that expression was much higher when plasmids prepared from V. natriegens were used. Possible explanations are differences in methylation patterns, resulting in degradation of the plasmid by the system (Failmezger et al. 2018). All this could be done by using protocols very similar to well established methods"

Abstract
We further developed ""Dr. E. coli"": our project of iGEM 2010. Last year, we showed that Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) works in E. coli by injecting GFP into RK13 cells. T3SS is a syringe like organelle found in bacterium such as Salmonella which uses it to inject virulence effector proteins into a target eukaryotic cell. We think this system can be applied to direct reprogramming of somatic cells among many other things.
We tested T3SS performance and tried to make it more convenient. For this purpose we designed a plasmid backbone which can instantly produce ready-to-inject fusion proteins from ordinary biobrick part. Using it, we tried to further characterize this system by injecting a library of protein domains.
In Science Gallery we exhibited awesome photographs related with biotechnology in public. We tried to catch the pedestrians’ interest in current synthetic biology and explore their thoughts.

Workshop
Say Hi to Young Scientist Wannabe!
Synthetic Biology (Synbio) can not stop on our generation, but must be passed on the generations below us. Therefore, we hold socialization Synbio to students high school in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. Our focus is opening their minds to the real world’s problem and things we can do through science and engineering. We presented it by video animation, power point and brochure.
We hold imagination classes, in which students were divided into groups and given the opportunity toimagine bio-machine that can solve the problems in the world. Wow! The results were shocking! They have wild imagination in implantingsynbio concept clearly and precisely. Well, although some ideas seem impossible, but hey, there is nothing impossible in science, isn’t it?
BACKGROUND
Human practice is socialization activity that involving the public into the future of synthetic biology. Thus, synthetic biology as one kind of science field have great potency and implications to improve lives by solving problems. iGEM Team Brawijaya dveloping the human practice activity through school education program and social education program. The school education purpose to introduce the synthetic biology for student then social education purpose to introducing for public. Moreover, we also presenting our project of iGEM Team Brawijaya through presentation and discussion.
DESCRIPTION
School education program within Human Practice be held on senior high school in malang. Thats program begin with presentation about synthetic biology. Presenter explain about overview and synthetic biology application in many kind of field. The presentation also added with animation video to more attractive and make the materi easily to be comprehended. Then, the presentation continued with presentation about project of iGEM Team Brawijaya as an example of synthetic biology application in health field. We make discussion, allowing students to ask some question and everything that they want to know. So, we can dig up and share more knowledge about synthetic biology.
The program continued with creativity games. All of student in the class divided into 4 groups that each group contains of 8 students. Presenter was explain about some cases involving synthetic biology. Then, each group allowed to take discussion, case study and solve the problem. After that, each group also allowed to find some problems around them and have to solve the problems using synthetic biology. Result of discussion froum each group presented in front of the class. We can conclude that each group have some of great creativity and big imagine about synthetic biology. We think that is great future

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Diary#Week 1_-_-_TEXT.html," gave a presentation on their project (the production of the protein reflectin in a bacterial system), as well as their own perspectives on the competition. We then undertook a team building exercise (in both senses of the word), constructing a raised platform upon which magnetic blocks were stacked. As in all things, the Pope won.
Tuesday
We had another presentation in the morning, this time on some of the wierd biology that Jim H. has seen. Antifreeze, Carboxysomes, brick making bacteria - the basic ideas for many different projects were explained. Unfortunately, we can't really do them all...
The stores remaining from last year were collected from their storage facility. Lots and lots of pipette tips - will no doubt be very welcome. Most of the rest of the morning was organisational, setting up the lab and checking what equipment we had.
The afternoon was a series of safety talks. Now we can get on with some real biology!
Wednesday
Gibson assembly (the technique that we will be most heavily relying upon for the construction of our plasmids) was introduced today, when we swapped an RFP gene from a plasmid backbone for a superfolder GFP gene. The protocols for PCR , Gibson assembly , Gel electrophoresis , DNA extraction from the gel and e.coli transformation can be found on their respective pages. The transforming bacteria were left overnight.
We also properly began brainstorming today.
More administrative stuff as well. We were introduced to Dik in stores and Del in accounts - will be invaluable contacts in the coming weeks. People began to sort themselves out into designated roles as well.
Thursday
Mostly brainstorming today, with a little bit of bacterial plating and culture growing to shake things up. Currently, internal bacterial logic seems to be of greatest interest to the team, with the inputs and outputs being comparatively minor. This will probably have to change so we can create a cohesive project, but if a novel approach to bacterial logic is of most interest to the team, it is something promising to work with.
Once more, the format was discussion and research, with The Column acting as our open forum. See what The Column had to say by the end of the week here .
Friday
Fluorescence and its use in the imaging of bacterial colonies was demonstrated in the colonies that had grown over night.
Once more brainstorming was probably our most important component of the day, with each of us presenting short powerpoints based upon the work of previous teams. Emphasis was placed on trying to work out what parts of each project had been successful, and what the components of"

About Our Integrated Human Practices
We spent a considerable amount of time looking out into the real world to figure out how our project would best solve the issues of insulin unaffordability and inaccessibility. Key advisors and stakeholders aided the decisions we made along the way. Not only did our project integrate with the advice of individual people, but these individuals became integrated into a big conversation between us all.  Specifically, these conversations were around how we Apply the design, the Project Design itself and ultimately how we best present this project to the real world as a business.
Under each of the below headings, you fill find the conversations we had with these stakeholders which integrated into our final product. Please enjoy reading through our journey!
Project Design
Our Original Project Design
Originally when we started this project, we were facinated by the idea of single chain insulins, but were hesitant to develop our own due to the vast array of new patent applications that were on the market. Human Insulin was in the clear of any patents, however due to its series of post-purification methods and low thermostability, we thought that developing a business model that had to keep up with high transportation costs, especially when open source, would be a difficult operation.
Read the conversation below to find out how these people influenced our Project Design:
Anthony Di Franco Our foreign friend began the Open Insulin project.
Meow-Ludo Meow-Meow Meow-Meow is infamous for his work at Biofoundry.
Dr Peter Arvan An insulin researcher.
Nick Coleman Our Supervisor.
Neil Donelan Neil distributes insulin vials all across the world.
Jeni A local pharmacist.
Len Mancini A partner of Maxwells Patent Lawyers.
Edwina Wang A type I diabetic.

Anthony Di Franco
We need an Open Source Insulin! We need a team to be able to start investigating methods that could be used to increase the yield, and decrease the post-expression processing steps currently required to produce insulin.

Figures 1 and 2 show that the expression of Art-175 with no YebF secretion tag exerts no killing effect. The expression of YebF-Art175 shows a large drop in OD600. This data suggests that the YebF tag is directing Art-175 for secretion across at least the inner membrane to reach the peptidoglycan layer and exert lytic activity.
