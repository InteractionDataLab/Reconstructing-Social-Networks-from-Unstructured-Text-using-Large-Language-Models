We didn’t realize the prevalence of illegal abortions in Russia and we hope to legalize our birth control method in Russia to prevent the need for these abortions.
Trinidad and Tobago
Tatyana, Trinidad and Tobago Resident
Tatyana is a mother of one. When we spoke to Tatyana about our new contraceptive, she was excited because she had believed condoms were the only type of birth control. Tatyana isn’t a fan of condoms anymore, as she experienced a condom that broke and resulted in an unexpected pregnancy. She relayed that she didn't believe condoms are reliable. Luckily, she was financially stable enough to care for the child, which is an issue many mothers in Trinidad and Tobago face. Condoms are commonly found in local pharmacies, but information about how to use them is severely lacking. Tatyana explained that “we [women in this area] need to know more about [birth control], we want to know more about it”. Our team hopes that our brochure will inform women of available alternatives to condoms and how to use them safely.
Uganda
Basaliza Women Development Association (BAWODA)
BAWODA is group of women leaders spread all throughout Uganda. Our outreach team spoke with Joy Muhindo, the chairperson of BAWODA. She informed us that the stigma on birth control in Uganda arose because women began trying unsanctioned birth control methods with dangerous side effects. Many women heard of these side effects and assumed that all birth control methods had these potential dangerous side effects. Their group encourages condom use if women cannot access safer birth control methods. While the BAWODA women are willing to try our new method, they hope that we also encourage condom use on top of our contraception because of the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in their area. We hadn’t considered that condom use is still necessary on top of our birth control since ours cannot protect against AIDS, so this was an important reminder for us.

To anneal the two oligos, equamolar amount of each strand is mixed, incubated at 95°C and cooled slowly to room temperature.
Tn5:adapter DNA complex formation
Since this is the first time this experiment was done, the idea is to get the idea of the required amount of adapter needed in the reaction. Therefore 3 different adapter concentrations were added, namely 5µM, 25µM and 50µM. Tn5  was loaded with adapter DNA shown above by following the pipetting scheme shown on Table 2. All samples and reagents were kept on ice during preparation.

Initial Gibson Assemblies of the naringenin operon
All Gibson assemblies were carried out using the 4 gBlocks, the pSB1C3 backbone and the competent cells produced on the 10/8/18. Gibson assemblies were conducted using the NEBuilder HiFi Assembly mix. For the assembly of 4 – 6 fragments the total concentration of DNA for the reaction had to be between 0.2 – 0.5 pmol with equimolar concentrations between all the inserts and the vector (0.05 pmol each) (Table 2). This reaction was incubated for 60 minutes at 50°C. The DH5α cells were then heat-shock transformed with the Gibson assembly product. The cells were spread onto LB plates containing chloramphenicol. Negative control plates containing un-transformed DH5α cells with no DNA were produced.
Figure 11. A) E. coli DH5α colony from cells transformed with the second Gibson assembly. B) E. coli DH5α colony from cells transformed with the third Gibson assembly. C) Negative control plate of un- transformed E. coli DH5α cells showing no colonies.
For the first Gibson assembly (Table 2), the backbone had a very low concentration, resulting in a low transformation efficiency.There was no colony growth on the transformed plates indicating the plasmid had not been taken up. Additionally there was no colony growth on the negative control.
Following the lack of colonies, the amplified backbone with the higher concentration of 26.2µg/ml was used coupled with reducing the total reaction volume in Gibson assembly from 36µl to 20µl (Table 3). This method yielded two colonies from cells that had been transformed (Figure 11A and 11B) and a corresponding negative control plate (Figure 11C). It was discovered through agarose gel electrophoresis of the miniprep of these colonies that they had only taken up the 2 kb plasmid without the operon, as the only bright band was at 2"

We spent the morning and the first half of the afternoon tidyng up the lab and packing all the equipment. The lab felt incredibly empty. Lidia talked a lot with Sue.  We transferred LB solutions from the Duran bottles belonging to the Teaching Lab to some Falcon tubes.  Lunch in the Junior Common Room. Surprisingly, Luis did not prepare his lunch today. After lunch, we went to the Phillips lab for the last time and to receive the final blessing from Sue. We moved the Plate Reader with a trolley. We did several trips to move all the stuff. Bessemer has been officially invaded. Once in the new lab, we unpacked everything and tried to fit everything in the tiny space we have available. We have: Rodrigo's master student bench (who is on holiday until October), the space on the left to Javier's bench, Ismael's bench (not all of it) and perhaps Amrit's bench, but he did not look very keen about this.  At 6 pm, we had the team meeting in the Entreprise Lab (where there is free coffee and beer.) We should do meetings there more often. We launched the new lab by staying late again. After the meeting, we went back as we had to perform some plate experiments. It was again a race against against time, as at midnight all the automatic doors automatically close.  In order to speed up the protocols, we let the Petri dishes dry in the freezer. It worked. We seeded some cells on those plate and ran outside. Josh, his girlfriend, Lidia, Alberto and Yutong tried to go to the Union, but it was too late and therefore the bar closed.

Results
Investigation of the best measurement time
It was first necessary to determine when, after toluene injection, bioluminescence results were the most relevant. To do so, we determine the bioluminescence intensity of our sample (bacteria transformed with our biosensor within LB medium containing different toluene concentration) several times after toluene addition.
The bioluminescence intensity of the negative control was also determine at each time after toluene addition and bioluminescent results for each assay were normalized on the corresponding negative control bioluminescence intensity. This normalization was necessary as we are dealing with several incubation time. This enable us to handle the bacteria OD increase within our samples and ensure that an increase in sample’s bioluminescence intensity is not correlated with an increase in cells concentration.
The graphs presented below represent the bioluminescence intensity of the sample depending on the time after a toluene addition for a fix concentration of toluene injected.

The bioluminescence intensity of each sample is normalized on the bioluminescence intensity of the corresponding negative control.

1.4 Inspiration
Part Documentation
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page ""> Registry</a>. This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our <a href="" http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry "">Add a Part to the Registry</a> link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree.

We looked back to the literature and realized that we need to run a denaturing PAGE gel.  We also need to order a special primer with a hexa-ethyleneglycol spacer and polyA tail that will help us separate out the ""sense"" strand from the ""antisense"" strand.

For double and triple transformations, simply plated 200 uL onto each plate.  The reason for this is because these transformations were delayed while the single transformations were being done.  As such, we expect a lower efficiency from them.

What They Did For Us:
The two plasmids were first transformed into DH5α cells and grown overnight at room temperature in LB broth with chloramphenicol added. The two plasmids were treated under three conditions: one uninduced, one induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and one induced with 1 mM IPTG. The Protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll a operon was tested with four genes, all of which showed good expression rates (Figure 4.). The Mg Chelatase operon was tested for five genes, however the ChlH and ChlD genes showed lower than expected or no expression at all (Figure 5.). We are investigating as to why these two genes had lower expression once inducted.
Formula:
2^-(ΔΔCt) is used to calculate the fold change of gene expression after induction, in which
ΔCt(control)1 = Ct(uninduced operon genes) - Ct(Chloramphenicol gene)
ΔCt(test)2 = Ct(Induced operon genes) - Ct(Induced Chloramphenicol gene)
Finally, use ΔCt(test)2 - ΔCt(control)1 to get ΔΔCt

Experiments
The biological realization of CryptoGErM consisted of four     subprojects: integration, characterization, key hiding and key     deletion. The encrypted message and the key were integrated into     the genome of B. subtilis. The location in the genomic DNA     makes it harder to retrieve the data, since whole genome sequencing     is required. The message is protected by a digital lock: the key,     and thus doesn’t need further biological protection. The key is not     encrypted and has to be protected by a biological lock. We followed     different approaches to design a multi-layered biological lock. We     followed two main ideas, namely hiding the key and deleting the key     when unauthorized parties handle it. This system is highly flexible     and biological layers can easily be added or modified to the wishes     of the user. An overview of all the protocols and plasmid construction can be found in the Lab journal .
Integration
The first subproject is the integration, the key and message       sequences were integrated into the genomic DNA of two separate Bacillus subtilis strains. In order to achieve this we had the key       and the message sequence synthesized by IDT. Then we cloned it in       pSB1C3 to amplify it from there and cloned it in the B. subtilis integration biobrick BBa_K823023 . This  vector can be used to       integrate sequences into the amyE locus of Bacillus subtilis. From       there we integrated it in the genome of B. subtilis 168 trp+. For       message and key transmission these B. subtilis strains were       sporulated. We were able to successfully retrieve and read out our message.
Read more about the integration and our proof of concept.
Characterization
The integration vector from team LMU Munich       BacillusBiobrickbox 2012 ( BBa_K823023 )       can be used to integrate an insert into the amyE locus of B. subtilis. In order to be able to efficiently       use this integration vector we characterized BBa_K823023 by       determining its transformation efficiency. This helped us       in our project and will hopefully help future iGEM teams as       well.

Fig. 3-3-2-14. The flow of changing the promoter in fim switch(Tokyo_Tech)
2.2.1. Results of the FimB/FimE assay on the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech)
As with assays of fim swtich(wild-type), in order to assay the function of FimB(wild-type) and FimE(wild-type) for fim switch(Tokyo_Tech), we added a GFP coding sequence on the downstream of the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech). The fim switch[default ON](Tokyo_Tech/J23119)_gfp ( BBa_K1632003 ) emitts fluorescence when expressed, while the fim switch [default OFF](Tokyo_Tech/J23119)_gfp( BBa_K1632004 ) does not emit florescence when expressed. We also added pBAD/araC( BBa_I0500 ) on the upstream of both FimB(wild-type) and FimE(wild-type). pBAD/araC_fimB ( BBa_K1632012 ) and pBAD/araC_fimE( BBa_K1632013 ) can induce the expression of FimB(wild-type) or FimE(wild-type) in the presence of arabinose. We co-transformed a fim switch(Tokyo_Tech)_gfp and a pBAD/araC_fimB or _fimE in the E. coli DH5alpha strain. We measured the fluorescence intensity of the cells induced by different concentraions of arabinose. We could not confirm the inversion of the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) by FimE(wild-type). From the experimental results, FimB(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) in both [ON] state to [OFF] state  and [OFF] state to [ON] state as expected. However, FimE(wild-type) unexpectedly did not invert the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state. Instead, FimE(wild-type) inverted the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) in both [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state. In other words, FimE(wild-type) worked in the same way as FimB(wild-type).

Brown,2010,Team:Brown#Project#Light pattern#Workflow_-_-_TEXT.html," the circuit concept has been demonstrated and the ability to achieve more states is evident.
Mathematical Modeling Workflow
The following are the steps we took to arrive at our in silico model of the Light Pattern Controlled Circuit:
We first had to assess what mathematical modeling entails, as none of our team members had previously been exposed to this kind of approach. We determined, largely by reviewing past team's modeling sections, that we had to generate differential equations for each product of the circuit.
As we did not have any particular experience in this branch of applied math, we consulted with Dr. Sindi, an applied math professor at our University. This meeting helped get us on track for the creation of our many differential equations, as Dr. Sindi was an enormous help.
Each differential equation we created is accompanied by a set of parameters. The differential equations themselves, without defined parameters, merely show the interrelation of the various parts of our genetic network. Defining parameters for each equation allows the equation to be linked specifically to the function of an individual promoter or factor. Thus, we conducted literature research and reviews past iGEM teams' work to compile the parameters for our equations.
Given the wide range of sources for the parameters we collected, we made various assumptions to normalize the parameters to more realistic values. Given more time, in vitro characterization of each component of the circuit might have suggested the most appropriate values to use. Unfortunately, we were not able to get to this point, and so relied on literature and past work.
We then created code in Matlab in order to solve our system of ordinary differential equations. This Matlab file collected all of the appropriate parameters, set initial conditions and events, and used built in numerical solvers to generate solutions to each differential equation. This gives equations for the various products of the circuit over time, and calling graphing methods enabled us to visualize, better understand, and display the functionality in silico of our circuit.
Proof of Concept Workflow
Before beginning our work towards our proof of concept for the light pattern controlled circuit, we first created our own frozen stock of competent cells, stocks of antibiotics, LB, etc.
Upon gathering material for the project, we first transformed <partinfo>BBa_K191003</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K191005</partinfo>, the LovTAP expression construct and the LovTAP-repressed reporter construct. After obtaining DNA from these samples, we double transformed these two parts into BL21 E. coli on Kan+Amp+ plates. See procedure section for more details. We noted that even without the LovTAP expression part (K191003"

EDCs Degradation
There are three categories of enzymes that are reported to be capable of catalysis redox reaction with phenolic compounds. They are laccase, MnP (Manganese peroxidase), and HRP (horseradish peroxidase). We cloned several genes that encoded these enzymes into E. coli. We expressed the enzyme with the IPTG-inducible promoter (J04500), purified and tested the activity against phenolic EDCs to see if this enzyme can accelerate the degradation speed.
1.Laccase
BBa_K2354001 : Laccase Bp
This part encoded a laccase which originated from Bacillus pumilus. We codon optimized this part for E. coli and added a 6X histag at 3’ terminal to facilitate protein purification. In addition, we also added a GS linker and a BamHI at 3’ terminal for possible protein fusion experiment in the future.
BBa_K2354002 : Laccase Sc
This part encoded a laccase that the previous study had codon optimized and construct on E. coli. We added a 6X histag at 3’ terminal to facilitate protein purification. In addition, we also added a BamHI at 3’ terminal for possible protein fusion experiment in the future.
BBa_K2354003 : Laccase Tc
This part encoded a laccase which originated from Thanatephorus cucumeris. We codon optimized this part for E. coli and added a 6X histag at 3’ terminal to facilitate protein purification. In addition, we added a BamHI at 3’ terminal for possible protein fusion experiment in the future.
BBa_K2354004: Laccase Tv
This part encoded a laccase which originated from Trametes versicolor. We codon optimized this part for E. coli and added a 6X histag at 3’ terminal to facilitate protein purification. In addition, we added a BamHI at 3’ terminal for possible protein fusion experiment in the future.
2. HRP
BBa_K235400: HRP
This part encoded HRP ( horseradish peroxidase ) which originated from Armoracia rusticana. We codon optimized this part for E. coli and added a 6X histag at 3’ terminal to facilitate protein purification.

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Dr. Gerlinde Metz
Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.

-Proceeded to gel purify the band which was at the expected length and received 30ng/uL. The concentration was low, but started in-vitro transcription with an overnight incubation to ensure product formation.
8/29/12
-Eluted RNA from the in-vitro transcription ran overnight following a more extensive and detailed protocol. Quantified the RNA and received decent concentrations of approximately 30ng/uL in a 30uL stock.
-The A260/280 values were abnormal, however, since there is presence of RNA, a denaturing gel should be done in order to check the length in order to assess desired purity.
-Inoculated a 250mL flask with the RNA scaffold in 50mL of LB if more DNA template is needed to further isolate RNA.
-Reinoculated the same cultures as yesterday since subculure time was missed. Transformed LacZ-WTPUF and LacZ-mutant PUF into DH5a and plated on amp plates.
8/30/12
-To further test the RNA purified from the previous two in-vitro transcriptions a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel was cast. The two products were ran with RNAase free loading dye and NEB ssRNA Low Range Ladder.
-The two products were pure, one containing a higher concentration of RNA, although greater presence of degraded parts. The ladder shows the products are approximately 150bp, however, the ladder was not heated before loading into the gel therefore presence of secondary structure would account for the lower length seen.
-Subcultured yesterday's cultures (1/100). Induced with arabinose after 2 hrs. Read fluorescence after 4 hrs. Inoculate the same tubes as yesterday for another trial. Inoculated one tube of BL21 DE3, LacZ+WTPUF from transformation plate, and LacZ+MutantPUF from transformation plate.

The first product of the Border in 2011 was the development of a sector plan that defines the main strategic  industry guidance and the tools for the implementation of the measures identified and prioritized in this subject (Consejo Sectorial de Biotecnología, 2012).
REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
In mid-2011 began Sector Strategic Plan, developed under the Sectoral Council of Biotechnology (CSBT), with the participation of 25 companies representing public and private institutions. The plan addresses a number of issues and gives particular emphasis on the definition of a state policy for the growth of biotechnology that allows develop coordinated public policies and sustained over time, in order to facilitate the industry's growth.
The development of a bill that deals with the mechanisms and legal instruments to promote the sector is currently being worked on.That is,an integrated regulatory system that sets out the guiding principles and general rules,and definitions of the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation, but nothing dedicated exclusively to the field of synthetic biology (Uruguayan Government 2012).
RESEARCH, PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION
It is clear the impact that science has had on society and  more open lines of research findings and new appear as well as new problems are topics of conversation of citizens. However, despite this decontextualized view of science is presented in society appears as something neutral, oblivious of the implications of their occurrence. This neutral view does not consider the evolution of knowledge, know the difficulties and  what obstacles to overcome to obtain improved knowledge
Since 2008, the sectors of bio and nanotechnology have been identified as priorities by the Office Productive within the definition of industrial development strategy. During 2008 and 2009, the chassis products work in characterizing the chains and the identification of policy measures to lift restrictions on its growth. This work was carried out, in turn, part of the strategic guidelines and to comply with the goals set in 2007 by PENCTI. In parallel, since 2005, the program PACPYMES (MEMBER / EU) launched the initiative of the cluster ""Life Sciences"" to work in the promotion and strengthening of bio-business in Uruguay. In particular, the program contributed to the reorganization and consolidation of the union of the biotechnology industry, the Uruguayan Association of Biotechnology Companies (AUDEBIO). Following these lines of work, June 22, 2010, was released Tripartite Sectoral Council Bio and Nanotechnology as a tool to articulate and generate inputs for the policy sector. Noteworthy is the"

The orange boxes mark the two inner quartiles. The whiskers mark the 90-percent-quantiles. White rectangles indicate the position of the medians.
Reactions towards our particular project were also quite positive, as visible in Figure 2. However, during the conversations, almost all the adults we spoke to expressed some concerns regarding biosafety aspects of microbial fuel cells. They wanted to know, what would happen if the genetically modified bacteria we used were to be released into the environment. This strengthened our belief that a functioning biosafety approach was of critical importance for the overall project.
Figure 3: Results for our survey's questions asking people to assess the risks of synthetic biology as well as the ethical implications . Here, only the answers of interviewees who did not know about Synthetic Biology before the event are evaluated. The results are represented in the form of box plots. The orange boxes mark the two inner quartiles. The whiskers mark the 90-percent-quantiles. White rectangles indicate the position of the medians.
As can be seen in Figure 3, feedback regarding the perceived risk as well as the ethical aspect of synthetic biology was more ambiguous. Unfortunately, almost nobody told us much about their views on these topics during conversations and we only got to see the results of the survey afterwards. For future events, it might be wise to inform about the current safety standards, government supervision and security considerations in more detail, to lessen the public skepticism towards synthetic biology. Apart from that, finding out what kind of ethical concerns people have would be a very interesting topic for a future survey.
Figure 4: Our interviewee's answers to whether they had concerns towards using a cell phone with genetically modified organisms inside. The numbers inside the boxes indicate the total number of people who gave the respective answer.
The question whether people would use a cell phone, which has genetically organisms inside its battery is of high importance for us. It helps us assess if this type of technology would be accepted in everyday life. We were worried, because there is a general animosity against everything that has to do with genetic engineering in Germany. Surprisingly, 83.3 % of the people we asked answered that they had no concerns using such a device. Among the people who did not know about Synthetic Biology before the event the percentage was only slightly lower at 76.4 % (see Figure 4). This shows us that at least after getting informed about the subject, people are open to using microbial fuel cells in their everyday life.

FUEL Project
Overview
As a link to our use of luciferases in the Cas-Find project we developed an interest in biological imaging. This was largely influenced by the research of our Secondary PI, Amit Jathoul in this general area.
One challenge in the field of biological imaging is in the use of fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins that emit light with longer wavelengths. The mKeima RFP variant has been previously used as a long stoke shifted fluorophore and was the subject of the SPECTRA project of the 2013 UCL iGEM team .
Therefore as a side project we planned to alter the potential usage of the Lux Operon biobrick (Cambridge iGEM 2010 BBa_K325909 ) by inducing a red-shift in its bioluminescence via an interaction with the mKeima protein.
We hoped to show that blue light produced by E.coli expressing the native LUXoperon would excite the mKeima protein resulting in the emission of red light.
We aimed to analyse the interaction between LUXoperon and mKeima in two ways:
1. Co-expression: Express the LUXoperon and mKeima in different bacterial cells and assess whether the Fluorescence by Unbound Excitation from Luminescence (FUEL) reaction was able to cause a change in the wavelength of the light output. The gene expression in both bacteria is controlled by the arabinose inducible promotor pBAD.
2. Co-regulation: Addition of a rbs-mKeima sequence to the 3’ end of the native pBAD::LUXoperon . We aimed to assess whether there was an alteration in wavelength of the light output in these bacteria compared to bacteria contained an unaltered LUXoperon.
Experimental Design
The mKeima protein has been added to the registry by the UCL_PG team of 2013 ( BBa_K1135001 ). However as part of this side project we have submitted two unique parts to the registry that contain this protein:
1. pBAD::LUXoperon:mKeima fusion ( BB_K2060002 )
2. pBAD::mKeima ( BB_K2060001"

Loaded the wells with DNA ladder, uncut DNa, cut DNA and the ladder again. Because of the yellow band on the tray, it was very difficult to load the samples./ We intended to leave some gap between uncut and cut DNAs but  we loaded them next to each other. The wells were also closed a bit. This situation may have been because the gel was not left long enought to set.
Run the gel for 0.5 hour. But for a better resolution we decided to run it for another 0.5 hour.
Results
We saw the small 500bp DNA in the cut DNA's lane. Our DNA was highly concentrated and as shown below, the images are highly saturated.

Introduction and summary
The Metal Sensor team have been given the task of test-transforming Bacillus subtilis 168 with vector plasmid pGFP-rrnB. This involves the Bacillus transformation protocol . So far we have made up all of the solutions involved in both the MM competence medium and starvation medium and have grown overnight cultures of Bacillus subtilis in MM competence medium. We have also incubated a falcon tube containing MM competence media without B. subtilis to act as a contamination control. Today, the rest of the Bacillus transformation protocol will be completed. In addition to this, LB plates containing chloramphenicol will need to be produced.

Q3: As our project describes a method that uses recombinase to separate between the gene of interest and the plasmid containing                             the origin of replication and marker gene, we use modelling to simulate a scenario to measure                             the dilution of plasmids and how long the recombined plasmid can be degraded over time.
Nevertheless, after the interview and through further research, we conjectured that a more effective way to digest recombinant                             plasmid is through the use of endonuclease. Apart from considering endonucleases such as a DNAi                             device called CRISPR-Cas3 as a choice for further improvement in our project, our team has continued                             to find potential application that recombinase can be compatible with (See Application page).                             We also designed plasmid simulation where CRISPR-Cas3 replaces Cre-recombinase8,                             but we were not able to incorporate into our project due to the time limitation.
The system works by expressing Cas3 and CasABCDE elements that will complex together and are guided                             by CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) with its spacer which will recognize PAM sequence correspnding with their                             complementary protospacer. The DNAi device will then cleave double stranded DNA, which will be                             degraded by exonuclease activity. The figure below shows the construct design (left and bottom)                             and how Cas3, CasABCDE and crRNAs target their sites (right)
We investigated the pros and cons of using 3 different knockout methods such as Cas9, Cas3 and recombinase,                             by listing out in the following tables

PPIX Source
For our various Beelab investigations, unless explicitly referred to as biosynthesized PPIX, the PPIX we used was a HPLC-grade reagent sourced from Enzo Life Sciences. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving solid PPIX  in a 1:1 Tris-base:10 mg/mL EtOH solution in the dark and further diluted into experimental solutions.
Experiment 2: Will E. coli make our bees sick?
To demonstrate the feasibility of APIS, it was also necessary to test whether feeding bees E. coli, which is not native to the bee microbiome, has an adverse effect on their health. To test this, we designed a bacterial toxicity assay (Figure 6). We introduced varying concentrations of our expression strain, E. coli BL21 (DE3), to the bees’ food source. These tests were conducted in both healthy adult bees and Nosema-infected bees. Groups were observed over the course of a week, during which we monitored their behaviour and observed the overall survival trend. Given the success of previous iGEM teams, UBC 2015’s Probeeotics and NYMU-Taipei’s Bee.coli ,  at introducing E. coli into bee intestines via introduction into their food source [5][6], we hypothesized that the introduction of E. coli into Nosema-infected bees would not negatively affect bee mortality.
Figure 4: A schematic of our design for our E. coli toxicity experiment. For each (A) healthy bees and (B) Nosema-infected bees, there was a sugar-water only control, and a treatment group for E. coli concentrations of 0.0025625g/mL, 0.01025g/mL, 0.0205g/mL, 0.041g/mL, 0.164g/mL.
Results
Figure 6: The percent survival of healthy honeybees of that were fed a range of E. coli concentrations.
A note on the above plot, first looking at the healthy, uninfected bees, we found that only one group fed with E. coli statistically differed from the healthy bees fed only with sugar water. While this initially caused alarm,  the statistically different group was the one fed the lowest concentration of bacteria. If this effect was due to toxic effects from the bacteria, we’d expect the groups with higher concentrations to have the same or lower survival rates, which we did not see. Thus, while we’re not sure of the exact cause, we believe that the significant"

USTC,2018,Team:USTC#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," But we get nothing when we make PCR using these genes as template. And we                       heard the same unfortunate news from other iGEM teams from China. Oh, it’s too terrible and we                       have to commission another company to synthesis our genes, and the time for us to finish our                       experiment is little.
As we are not very sure which are the most suitable promoter for our sensing                       system, we ask our modeling group for help. But their ideas do not make us satisfied, because it                       will spend too much time. Now JS is nearly mad for he have to try thirty promoters one by one.
At the end of August we go to the ShanghaiTech University to take part in the                       fifth ccic (Conference of China iGEMer Community). We communicated with other iGEM teams, showing                       our project and sharing our experience.

September
It’s not very good news for us that the summer holiday is over and we haven’t                       finished our project, which means we have less time to stay in the lab than holiday. Fortunately,                       we get some suggestions and help from our seniors whom were iGEMers before. They help us to                       improve our project, especially in our modeling.
Although we are busy in study, we also seen ind time the lab and try to make                       the project better. Thanks to all people’s help, we finally finish our regulation system and                       degradation system, and our sensor is going to be finished.
In this month we share our ideas with our classmates and teachers, talking                       with them the harm of nicotine and what our project can help. They show interest in our systems                       and give some advice about making more people understand our work.

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Isolate V106 failed to grow, so I grew it again and did another protein extraction. Additionally, I tried to do an in vivo toxicity test again. 46 mites were gathered and I left them overnight on a food source before I used them for the toxicity test; only 18 mites survived the night.

I decided to investigate isolate V82 further based on its similarity to Lysinibacillus sphaericus and its overexpression of a 100 kDa protein. Lysinibacillus species are unable to grow well on most sugars, so I grew it for 3 days at 30 degrees Celsius on LB + sporulation salts only and on LB + sporulation salts with D-mannitol, D-fructose or glycerol. The colony morphology of V82 was different when it was grown on plates with an additional carbon source, as it became brownish in hue. This matches the Lysinibacillus sphaericus description. To confirm that I still had identical isolates, I performed 16s rRNA PCR on each of the plates with different carbon sources (Figure 15). All V82 PCR products were confirmed to belong to the same isolate. Additionally, I did protein extraction on the liquid cultures (without lysozyme) and loaded the extracts as well as the pellets on an SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 16).

UC_Davis,2010,Team:UC Davis#notebook#c0051debug.html_-_-_TEXT.html," cI coding region and the barcode are acting together to produce some kind of promoter function.
In order to experimentally provide data to prove this point, we removed the barcode from the RBS-C0051 construct and placed it into Chris Anderson's Promoter Screening Plasmid (Bba_J23006).
Surely enough, the phenotype was white!
We finally narrowed it down and were able to create a part in which the cI lambda coding region can be utilized without creating an unwanted and detrimental promoter function.
This part was sequenced and submitted! Sequence is available in the zip file below.
The Fix
By removing the barcode and submitting this part to the registry, we have greatly improved a fundamental part by modifying it so that it works as advertised.
As you can imagine, an unwanted constant transcription can really set you back and cause major malfunctions in your system.
With this necessary fix implemented, you can now feel confident that this fundamental part will work just as you intend!

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We have clearly demonstrated that the bar code that was attached to C0051 and other parts in the registry (as a marker that might help determine the origin of the part) contributes to the ""invention"" of promoter-like activity in the context of the cI lambda phage repressor coding sequence and LVA proteolytic degradation tag.
It is critical to recognize that this function only seems to arise (at least for now) in the context of the cI coding region and not from the bar code alone - as seen in the E1010 experiment where the presence of the LVA tag and the bar code in the context of RFP do not create a promoter function.  We would like to eventually try other coding regions upstream.
The 5'-RACE experiment seems to suggest that the transcript start site is within the bar code.  This is further supported by the experiment in which the bar code is removed and the cells no longer produce RFP.  We are also repeating this experiment several more times to verify the result.
The combination of results 2 and 3 suggest that there is some functional coordination between sequence in cI and the bar code that is ultimately responsible for promoter activity.  We are testing this hypothesis by generating various truncations of cI that retain the bar code and LVA tag.  This should allow us to ""zoom in"" on the sequence in Bba_C0051 that is responsible for this phenomenon. We expect to have this data for our presentation - please"
Harvard,2009,Team:Harvard#Daily_-_-_TEXT.html,"iferase. Luker et al found an optimized pair of firefly luciferase fragments as X --Nf Luc 2-412, and CfLuc 398-550 – Y. This was reduced from the initial as X -- Luc 2-435, and Luc 21-550 – Y, a significant decrease in overlap which presumably served to reduce constitutive activity of the N terminal fragment. In the paper by Luker et al, they found that “FRB-NLuc  and CLuc-FKBP plus rapamycin produced a maximal bioluminescence of 2x 106 photon flux units per 1 x 104 cells in a 96-well format (7 x 104 photon flux units per ug of protein), 1,200-fold greater than untransfected cells or blank wells (Fig. 1E). By comparison, a control plasmid (pGL3) expressing intact luciferase produced 3-fold greater bioluminescence (6 x106 photon flux units 1 x 104 cells transfected with 33 ng of DNA). (Luker et al, 2004).” In their 2007 paper Paulmurugan identified (NFluc 398/CFluc 394) as the ideal pair, claiming it to be an improvement upon existing combinations. This combination has according to their paper near-zero background signal from self-complementation. They claim this to be a direct improvement upon the N416-C398 pair from the Luker paper. In terms of fragment orientation they recommend Nfluc-FRB/FKBP12-CFluc, but this is only with one protein pair. They mention reduction in enzymatic activity when you attach other proteins to the N terminus of the protein, but mention that Luker had success with a protein on the N terminus of the N terminal fragment.

Collaboration
One of biggest problems during iGEM project is to learn how to work with Wiki sintaxis. As not everybody is acquainted programming with marking languages like html or xml, managing the wiki is a difficult task for every team.  
Francisco Javier Quero, team leader of Madrid-OLM team, contacted us at the beginning of the summer to ask for help with their wiki. We thought this could be a good oportunity of mentoring so we agreed to help them solve their problems. Our software team (Héctor and Blanca) did a call via Skype to talk these topics:
An explanation of how mediawiki works and the main problems they will find working with it.
Tips when saving the code, for example, separating it in different structures like navbar, main content, footer, etc.
Recommendations at the time of choosing a web template because not all the technologies available will work in the wiki and knowing this will make a big saving of time.

Tianjin,2016,Team:Tianjin#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," scientists will do further research. From the survey we also notice the public consciousness of ‘white pollution’ and how urgent and necessary we should fix this problem. At the same time, it reinforces our confidence and enthusiasm to solve it using biological method. We will definitely make great efforts to explore and figure out something meaningful to live up to public expectation.
Ⅱ: Debate
To make the ordinary students engaged in iGEM, we team Tianjin together with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association held a debate competition discussing ethical issues provoked by the application of synthetic biology, aiming to publicize the conception of synthetic biology and arouse attention to biotechnology. The debate began at 20 p.m., Sep.28th and lasted for an hour. The topic was whether it is safe to curb environmental pollution with artificial modified bacterium. Our team members were invited as special guests to watch this intense competition. During the interval, we gave out iGEM handbooks and souvenirs to audience. After that, we made a brief introduction of synthetic biology and our project. Generally speaking, the debate was very successful. We were delighted to collaborate with Beiyang Environment-Protecting Association. It was glad to see that everyone participating in the game were intrigued by this subject. The successful hosting of the debate epitomized our great publicity of synthetic biology.

Phosphorus is one of the three essential nutrients for plant growth. Phosphorus is essential in DNA and RNA. It also promotes root proliferation and improves the fruit, forage, vegetable, and grain quality of crops. If soil phosphorus levels are less than 9 ppm, adding phosphorus fertilizer could double yields from 100 to 200 bushels/acre (1).  For most of history, fertilizer has been limited to human and animal waste and plant remains or allowing floods to add phosphorus rich sediments to croplands. Nowadays, phosphorus is mined from deposits in rocks in a handful of countries (2). The strip mines to gather phosphorus are “environment wreckers.” They produce approximately 150 millions tons of radioactive “toxic spoil” a year and require “massive draglines, huge slurry pipes, and mountainous spoil heaps.” As a result, the current mines in the United States are challenged by environmentalists concerned about waterways and drinking water supplies and the prospects of future mines are limited (3). The Global Phosphorus Research Initiative estimates that agricultural demand will be larger than the world’s readily available phosphorus supplies within 30 to 40 years. Dana Cordell of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney and her colleagues in 2009 estimated that the amount of phosphorus that people consume in food is only one-fifth that being mined, suggesting huge amounts simply escape. Recapturing phosphorus lost to field runoff and human and animal waste  could greatly aid the phosphorus supply (2).
In order to increase yields, farmers add fertilizer. When they do this for years and the crops do not take up all of the phosphorus, the phosphorus in the soil adds up, as shown in the figure below (4). It is estimated"

This summer at Boston University we built software tools that helped wet lab scientists interact with their data in novel ways that produced results. Each member of the wetlab here at Boston University, used Clotho on a day to day basis to manage their data and to design their constructs. Using feedback from the wet lab, we iterated towards creating optimal tools. By using Clotho, the wet lab delivered faster and more accurate results. We hope that Clotho can prove to be a similar boon to labs across the country and around the world. Clotho is the most developed open-source software platform designed specifically for synthetic biologists by bioengineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, and a diverse spectrum of innovative thinkers.

Results
Clotho allows one to enter a variety of pieces of DNA including promoters, RBS, genes, and terminators into a database and then electronically form plasmids out of them. Besides pieces like the promoters which are considered parts in Clotho, the backbones can be saved as vectors and can be changed up in creating the plasmids. BullTrowel , Spreadit Parts , Spreadit Vectors , and Spreadit Features are a suite of tools that enable one to enter the parts, vectors, plasmids, and features into the database.
An example of a collection showing parts, vectors, and features
Collector Browser provides a way to view the library of everything already entered that allowed us to check out what parts were available to form a plasmid. Additionally, parts could be entered as features. In Sequence Viewer , features are highlighted to enable us to know where such things as restriction enzymes are in a plasmid. Once Clotho helped us to maximize the design of our plasmids, we then set out to physically construct them.

Left: The Marchantia Growth Facility, a device capable of controlling the light and airflow conditions to four plates simultaneously. Right: The Mini Growth Facility, a smaller version of the MGF, capable of controlling the light conditions of one plate.
A transformation has not yet been attempted in the growth facility.
The MGF family of growth facilities offers a low-cost, open source and easily modifiable platform for the use of marchantia in a scientific setting, which we hope will be adopted and improved by other labs in future competitions.
Hammerhead Ribozymes
We received four hammerhead ribozymes as a kind donation from the Smolke lab. These included  2 versions of theophylline deactivated cleavage, 1 version of theophylline activated cleavage, and 1 always cleaving ribozyme.
Each of these  were built into two separate constructs.
The first contained the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter driving expression of eGFP-N7, with the hammerhead ribozymes inserted into the 3' UTR
The second contained the the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter driving expression of the transcription activator HAP1, with the hammerhead ribozymes inserted into the 3' UTR. This then activated the HAP1-UAS, which was driving Venus-YFP-N7.
We had trouble assembling these constructs, which we put down to poor quality competent cells (assembly became considerably faster after the creation of a new batch). Eventually, all four 35S constructs were built using Gibson assembly and sequenced. Two HAP1 constructs were built using LCR, and verified by restriction endonuclease digest, but not sequenced
The Marchantia transformation was hindered at several stages. First, agrobacteria transformation via electroporation was repeatedly unsuccessful. Second, Marchantia transformations were rapidly contaminated, leading to the death of all selected plants (prior to them growing to the stage of being able to assay them). We abandoned transformation knowing that time constraints would prevent us from successfully assaying the results. We leave the constructs, being RFC10 incompatible, for further users of Marchantia/Mösbi to try.
Heat Shock Promoter
We received from Jeremy Solly a vector containing a Marchantia heat-shock promoter. 2 constructs were designed, containing this promoter driving Venus-YFP-N7, as well as an input for our system, driving GAL4, which activated the GAL4-U"

Product design
In this project, we, the NCKU Tainan Team,                                              have proposed an alternative way to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2).                                              Referring to the opinions and feedback from industry experts and professors,                                              we design a new factory flow to capture CO2 by E. coli.                                              Not only our device meets the specs to be commercialized, but it also demonstrates                                              high cost performance.
The emission of CO2 has been a serious problem for centuries. The steep increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 could potentially lead to a further increase in temperature and climatic change.                                              Therefore, scientists and governments may need to take carbon capture technology to the next level.
Enterprise interview
We completed the whole product design and proposed to several industrial. Through the interview with our potential customers, we modified and improved our project from their perspective. We found out what we were weak in the design and then figured out the solutions with the enterprise support.
Our major potential customer, China Steel Corporation , which is the largest integrated steel maker in Taiwan. The iron making process involves reacting iron ore with a reducing agent, like coking coal, and produces large volumes of CO2.
Taiwan's largest high-tech applied research institutions, Industrial Technology Research Institute ,                                                  which has proposed several carbon capture technologies for use in industry.
An industry-university cooperative research project ,Biofixation of flue gas CO2 with microalgae , worked on the same goal with us : reduce CO2 emission in industry with biology method.
We collaborated with King Membrane Energy Technology Inc. , which is a company that capable of providing customized pervaporation systems and membrane distillation systems for use in industries. They replace traditional energy-using distillation with advanced energy-saving membrane technology.

Silver Medal Requirements
Validate that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
As described in the Bronze Medal section, we developed a fully integrated, end-to-end design suite for microfluidic devices. We also designed 3D printed hardware infrastructure for controlling these devices, and we designed a new and original hardware solution to controlling fluid dispension using servo motors. Putting the cherry on top, we also contributed to developing algorithms that help translate LFR specifications of microfluidic devices to lower level MINT descriptions. Ultimately, the intended function of our software and hardware is to enable researchers to design, fabricate and use microfluidics with a single, coherent workflow. Furthermore, this single workflow needs to interface with low cost tools, it needs to be simple and robust, and it should allow any researcher to make a microfluidic chip with ease.
The best way to validate our workflow, our software and our hardware, would be to explore some of the microfluidic projects we did this summer. The following microfluidic designs were made within Neptune, using the LFR and MINT specifications to create the design schematics. Further, we obtained the 3D print schematics for the control infrastructure for these projects from Neptune. We designed the control infrastructure using the tutorials and specifications detailed by Neptune. Finally, we ran control tests to validate the function of our device through Neptune's control interface.

Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," or later, but I didn't think it would be on the first day of school. From that day on, we did not listen to lectures or study at school; we worked.
Two months after I started working at the Omura Naval Aircraft Arsenal, the arsenal was destroyed by bombing. That day, when the air-raid siren sounded, some students took shelter in an underground bunker and the rest of us ran to the edge of the airfield, then waited in a ditch. Soon I saw a formation of more than 20 B-29s coming from the west, and the bombing started. A stray bomb fell nearby and showered us with sand and gravel. The bombing destroyed most of the facilities, but I saw that one hangar was still standing and some people were trying to pull a fighter plane out of it. We rushed there to help them. However, an enemy plane was ahead in the smoke-covered sky. At the moment we reached the hangar, we were showered with numerous incendiary bombs. I heard someone shouting an order to take refuge. We ran between bombs burning with white flame; I saw a person who had been hit on the shoulder running with one arm dangling.
After the air raid, we learned some of the students had died in the underground bunker, and that our dormitory had burned down. Within a month, several wooden factory buildings were built between the hills near Isahaya, and we were ordered to work there. I attended the factory every day even before it was completed; if I found nothing to do I would often lie down in a sweet-potato field nearby and watch large formations of B-29s going east high above Mt. Tara-dake. It was beautiful to see the shining silver B-29s against the background of blue sky. Then, in about 10 minutes, I would see black smoke in the Ohmuta industrial area on the opposite shore of the Ariake Sea, and I could only imagine the scene of carnage over there.
The new factory was for the repair of fighter engines. My job was to smooth the face joining the crank case to the cylinder. My class graduated in March, 1945, at the factory, without a graduation ceremony or diplomas. I was 16 years old. After graduation, the student mobilization continued.

We are not interested in the future coordinates    as such, but rather in the future intercellular distance,    which is composed of these future coordinates and therefore    also is a stochastic variable. For ease of calculation, we    work with the square of this variable, which we name as R²    and define as (20).
$$     R^2=(X_1-X_2)^2 + (Y_1-Y_2)^2     \;\;\; \text{(20)}     $$
It is easy to see that $X_1-X_2$ and    $Y_1-Y_2$ are both noncentral (mean is not equal to zero)    normally distributed variables as well. Therefore $R^2$ obeys    a noncentral chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.    Before proceeding further, we have to make our $R^2$ conform    to a standard noncentral chi-squared distribution. First    we normalize $X_1-X_2$ and $Y_1-Y_2$. We observe that $X_1-X_2$    and    $Y_1-Y_2$ are distributed as (21).

We aligned the sequencing results to the original trigger sequence obtained from the second entry in the 144 first generation orthogonal toehold switches collection from the 2017 Green etal paper. Since the sequences matched after alignment, this confirmed that the trigger sequence was correctly cloned.
CAPTIVATE Kit
In recognition of the dire crisis cholera outbreaks have presented to the world, inflicting harm on millions and killing hundreds of thousands, we present a new solution to ensure a proactive response to cholera outbreaks can be mounted by targeting contamination within the water sources. CAPTIVATE constitutes a portable diagnostic kit  to test the water in local areas to determine whether Vibrio Cholerae is present or not. Cholera diagnosis requires This diagnostic kit includes Lambert iGEM’s  hardware components such as the 3-D Fuge, Chrome-Q, Chrome-Q Base, and the Electropen System. The kit also contains the wet-lab components including the Spira Swab (gauze water filter), freeze-dried Biosensor cells in culture tubes, and  a RNA extraction kit. The kit is capable of powering a phone for the Color-Q app and a cooling system needed for certain wet-lab parts of the project through a solar panel. CAPTIVATE portable diagnostic kit could work in conjunction of existing World Health Organization treatment kits which can provide a more efficient assessment to determine if    cholera exists in that water source.

The transcription of the gene cluster responsible for Type I fimbrial synthesis is dependent on the competition between fimB and fimE to turn the transcription of the fimbriae production operon fimAICDFGH on or off, respectively, by inverting the orientation of fimS, which contains the promoter for the operon (Ecocyc, 2013).  The adhesive ability of fimbrae make them important for initial binding of E. coli to surfaces.

Colanic acid
Colonic Acid is a polymer of fucose, glucose, glucuronic acid, and galactose which forms a protective capsule around the cells in a biofilm. The stress sensor RcsC along with RcsD and RcsB form a three-component system that upregulates genes involved in colonic acid synthesis. While colonic acid reduces initial surface attachment, it is believed that it assists in later biofilm maturation. (Beloin et al., 2008)
c-di-GMP
Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a small second messenger molecule that is found in bacteria, triggering different internal processes. It influences everything from biofilm formation to extracellular signalling. c-di-GMP is synthesised by diguanylate cyclases and broken down during the phosphorous stress response. In general, c-di-GMP promotes biofilm formation and decreases motility. For example, diguanylate cyclase YdeH increases the pool of cdiGMP which, in the case of this specific diguanylate cyclase, increases PGA, an extracellular polysaccharide used in biofilm maturation (Povolotsky et al, 2012).

Bile Acid Sensor
- the idea came up with Si’s final year project
- a biosensor can be produced for daily home use to detect the bile acid concentration level in blood to prevent a series of liver diseases, especially the Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) - the basic concept behind this sensor: bile acid - enzyme binding with the acid molecules – promoter – triggering the FXR gene – production of GFP - GFP is normally used as an indicator of the bio-sensor. The main problem is that the fluorescent intensity is very hard to quantified for a home-user - being inspired by the cosmetic skin colour sample card , we can make a sample card of fluorescence to give the rough concentration level of bile acid - a threshold value is required to tell the patient when their blood bile acid level is dangerous and may need a medical treatment - therefore, we will modify the linear relationship between bile acid concentration and GFP intensity level into a Hill system using Hill equation to find the threshold value - also, we may use colour indicator instead of GFP (light indicator)
Background: - Bile acids are 24-carbon steroids found in bile, which are subject to enterohepatic circulation - synthesized in liver and stored in gallbladder, helping in digestion and absorption of dietary fat and liposoluble vitamins - bile acids are highly toxic. Therefore their concentration must be tightly regulated - the level of bile acids is controlled through a negative feedback system mediated by a nuclear bile acid receptor FXR. FXR is highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney cells. It responds to bile acids and has been shown to repress CYP7A1, a key gene associated with bile acid synthesis. - Defects in bile acid homeostasis due to functional variations of FXR result in cholestatic conditions such as Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is a pregnancy-specific liver disorder characterized by pruritus (intense itch) an abnormal liver function - The dysfunction"

Part OR1A1 Document
Part: BBa_K2288000
Designed by: Ni Zong Group: iGEM17_NEU-China (2017-10-09)
Rho-OR1A1(HEK293)
Encoding the fragments of the olfactory receptor OR1A1 with Rho-tag in its N-terminal in HEK293 cells. Once the specific                                         odor, β-citronellol, binds to OR1A1 on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of                                         signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP which could be detected                                         by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. The Rho tag was added to its N-terminal,                                         which could improve the olfactory receptor to express on the surface of HEK293.
The whole OR1A1 signaling exists primarily in the olfactory epithelia cells which                                         are not easily cultured and amplified to generate the ex vivo biosensor, nor does                                         a simplified prokaryote can reconstitute the whole OR1A1 pathway. Therefore we chose                                         an easily cultured eukaryotic HEK293FT cells instead to reconstitute the olfactory                                         signaling cascade for the biosensor with a CRE-luciferase construct as the reporter.

 Pigment Extraction
Our final product from the cells will be the pigments we require to make ink, but before we can use them we must extract them from the cells. We will be producing the pigments in the cells using a method called large batch overexpression. We will have large amounts of liquid LB media in which we will have our cells with the constructs in them. We will let the cells replicate and mature before we induce the pigment production with IPTG. The way we will be extracting the pigment is via organic extraction. We will first centrifuge the cells and the liquid LB broth media in order to get the cells and pigment in the pellet. This will allow us to pour off the supernatant which will be the media to get the cells to work with. We will then add the solvent for the organic extraction and depending on the pigment it will be either acetone or methanol. This will lyse the cells as well as have our pigment dissolved in it. We will then homogenize the mixture in order to destroy all of the rest of the cell membranes and any living cells. This homogenized solution will then be put through a series of filters in order to get out the larger proteins and all of the parts of the cells, this will leave us with pigment and the solvent and all that is left is the evaporation of the solvent.
Figure 1: This image shows the process of our pigment extraction from the cells starting with live cells with pigment inside of them and ending with our pigment.
Ink Production
Now that we have our pigment isolated from the cells that produced it, we need to add it to the other components of ink to allow us to use it. The Three main components of ink are the Resin the Solvent and our portion, the colorant and in our case pigment. For our resin and solvent, we have selected gum arabic and acetone as our research revealed that these are some common materials that will perform as necessary for a proof of concept. The resin must evenly spread the colorant throughout the ink and across the substrate. The solvent contains the other parts and allows for the ink to be stored in liquid"

Formal Lab Session - 26th August 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team - carried out the restriction digests on the mini-preps reattempted yesterday (except for BBa_C0178)
Metal Sensor Team - digested BBa_J33206 midi-preps and analysed them through DNA gel electrophoresis
Promoter Library Sub-project - digested pGFP-rrnB plasmid with EcoRI and NheI
Stochastic Switch Team
Summary
Jess and Goksel working on the restriction digests
Today Lab started at 2pm, so we had the afternoon to do restriction digests for the remaining biobricks(other than C0178). Out of 12 cultures, 11 of them were grown. We used the fast digest system, which takes 5 minutes in a 37 degree waterbath rather than 60 minutes. Below are the volumes required for a double digest using EcoRI and PstI:
6ul water
2ul 10X Fast digest buffer
1ul of fast digest EcoRI enzyme
1ul of fast digest PstI enzyme
10ul DNA (miniprepped)
Total volume: 20ul
These were left for 5-10 minutes at 37 degrees, then 9ul of the total volume was added to 1ul of loading buffer, and the samples were run on the gel we prepared yesterday.

Jun 27: Last parts of the crawler
The final product of our Parts Registry Crawler: A temporary data sheet
This morning, we encountered a problem in our crawler - the same exception kept coming up, so we spent all morning fixing it. In the afternoon, we met with Linda to see what she wanted from us in order to connect her front end and our back end.
Jun 28: A new crawler
We reorganized our project so that our information is produced in a new text file, in a format and order that match that of the front end data sheet (produced by JavaScript and HTML). In the middle of the day, we met with Orit to discuss our progress and goals for the next few days. I was split off into a different project - my new goal was to create a web crawler for the iGEM archive by the middle of next week.
Jun 29: iGEM Bonding at MIT
We spent the entire day at MIT - in the morning, we met up with the MIT and BU iGEM teams to attend Professor Walter Lewin's physics lecture. Although this is his last lecture series, his enthusiasm does not reflect his age at all. His talk was very informative and interesting. After the lecture, we went to lunch and bonded with the other teams. Following lunch, the MIT iGEM team took us to their lab - we got to see their lab area, their lab robot, and their other team members. Overall, today was a great opportunity to get some of our questions answered - we each got to explain our project and then we exchanged feedback.
July 2-3: Working on the iGEM Crawler
I spent both days working on the iGEM Archive Crawler, as there were many bugs and kinks. By the end of the two days, the web crawler could extract results from the archive (years 2006 - 2011) and display the title and the content of each result.

Application Scenario
This application scenario was developed by the iGEM team Purdue 2016 in collaboration with Synenergene. In this scenario we  aim to show how the results of our project could be applied in both domestic and industrial contexts in the developed and developing world. Additionally, we seek to thoroughly outline the potential consequences of these applications in current political, ethical, and technological contexts.
The Problem
In concert with an assortment of other nutrients, water phosphates in excess of 25 micrograms per liter are known to drive the growth of harmful algal blooms (HABs) during periods of warmer temperatures ( ≥25°C). These blooms compromise water quality by choking oxygen from aquatic ecosystems and leaching neurotoxins and hepatotoxins such as microcystin and nodularin into sources of potable water. In so doing HABs cost global industry more than ten billion USD in damage and threaten both chronic and acute harms to human health every year.
This propensity for consequence was no more evident than in the Summer of 2014 when over 500,000 residents along the southern coast of Lake Erie were left without water for over 48 hours. Though this incident may seem isolated, with continued global agricultural development and a predicted 1.5-4°C increase in temperature over the next century, the likelihood and intensity of HABs will only increase in the coming decades.
As such, there is a serious need for not only efforts to address the issues surroundings HABs but with those concerning phosphorus misuse. Currently there are no federal restrictions in the US on water phosphate pollution and similar laissez-faire approaches prevail in many African and Asian-Pacific nations. Though estimates vary, like oil, phosphorus is a nonrenewable resource and, like oil, phosphorus production and supply will at some time in the"
METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," in the     Registry for designing their own genetically engineered biological systems.     In exchange, the expectation is that Registry users will contribute     back to the information and the data on existing parts and will submit     new parts they have designed in order to improve this community resource.
As an expanding database partregistry.org needs to be more organized and the standardization template needs to     be improved. Additionally, the potential of multiple ways of using each     part in different construct combination brings out the necessity for     an application to search through the database. BioGuide is the first     designed software that organizes over 1000 parts in partregistry.org as possible     atomics parts to build new biological device and systems for specific     input and outputs based on graph theory. The requirement of similar     applications and software tools are now inevitable in the emerging field     of synthetic biology. The innovative approach that makes the partregistry.org easy to use     for synthetic biology applications is the collection of standardized     parts that can be used in any combination with minimal effort under     one database. But while working on our algorithm to search for possible     combinations of parts depending on the given input and output, we have     realized that present standards are inadequate and parts registry form     must be improved.
In very near future a new format for parts registry form is needed     and few additional features should be implemented to have more control     on the database. We are planning to suggest a new format and features     for the parts registry based on the survey results we have received.     And planning to build the next version of Bioguide based on the revised     parts registry form. Along with using new parts registry standards we     will be improving the algorithm, so that the software can search through     more complex relations and returns all possible functional constructs.
Project Introduction
As the field of Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM is growing     up very fast and the number of parts in the parts registry is increasing     with the addition of more complex parts each day. After facing some     difficulty while running our algorithms on the parts registry, the need     for more effective standardization of parts entry was apparent. We have     investigated the information on parts in iGEM’s 2010 distribution and     reorganized the information on the parts registry forms according to     the needs of our algorithm. Then we have used graph theoretic modeling     to visualize the relations between iGEM Parts and to standardize the     representation of the parts as much as possible by graph theoretical     methods. This helped us to find input output relations between the parts.     Furthermore, our program BioGuide is now able to provide"

The only effect of the additional background red light is to manipulate the sensitivity of green light inducible bacteria.
To illustrate this point, we test their growth in tubes.

We observed cell populations containing the blue light inducible system grown in four tubes under same conditions, however are differently illuminated with red light, green light and blue light and in dark.
Their growing curves are approximately the same with acceptable deviation. The growth of dark exposed bacteria slightly surpassed others since they eat a lot and produce less, which should has nothing to do with repress from the light.
We may conclude that neither red nor green light has repressive effects on blue inducible bacteria.

Objective: New Salinity Test
Purpose: Reliable Results
Test: Once again the negative control has grown bacteria in it, leading us to believe that our water supply is contaminated. We have plated a sample directly from an aliquot of the saltwater, and if it turns out positive then we will know why the experiment has been contaminated. We now know to autoclave all saltwater supplies in the future.
Results of Salinity Test #2
Lsr Team: Plates prepared on 14-Jul-2015 from E. coli Top 10 transformed with S03968 grew a significant number of colonies.  A single colony was isolated and transferred into ~5mL of LB containing ampicillin and cultures overnight at 37°C in a rotator.

Objective: New Salinity Test
The sample of filtered salt water that was plated had colonies on the plate. Most of the colonies were centered around the edge of the plate. This can indicate contamination even after the filtration.
Today we autoclaved the filtered (expiration materials were checked (2019)) salt water and plated the negative control. We are doing 3A Assembly (a backup plan if the Synbiota kit fails).
Synbiota kit arrived.

In addition, chemical inducers are difficult to be removed from the culture medium, making them unsuitable for downstream water recycling process. Therefore, an alternative gene expression system specific for cyanobacterial bioprocess should be developed. Thus light-controlled system applied to metabolism engineering provides a new a strategy to induce the behaviour of non-model host.
    Professor Yang also introduce us the light-systems applied to mammalian cell, highlight the current application in the field of neuroscience.
    When it comes to the hardware of the light-controlled system, which we worried about a lot, Professor Yang provided us with the resource of the light device applied in his project. And he also suggested that since the light-controlled system is highly sensitive, the hardware is not that demanding. However, due to its high sensitivity, we must pay much attention to the impact of natural light which is inevitable while operating experiments.
    (3) What’s more, we participated in Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC) 2018 held in Shanghai, China and had the opportunity to exchange ideas with many other teams and we derived a lot of suggestions from others to increase the feasibility of our project.
    We met a member from Peking and he had a project related to VVD (an optogenetic tool which can sense blue light). He mentioned that the element sensing blue light was extremely sensitive to light, even if just little natural light existed could influence the stability of it and even could come with a reverse effect, so we would better operate our blue light sensing system in darkness or under red light.
    We also met a member from XMU-China, who came up with a valuable suggestion to our project. According to his words, the culture medium used in industrial fermentation and that in lab fermentation were totally different. In factories, cost needs to be taken into consideration, so the nutrients in industrial culture medium come from the waste produced by other industries. Thus, industrial culture medium could be non-transparent which doesn’t allow light to go through and reach the bacteria.

Introduction
    According to the expertise we’ve got, we know that optogenetics, used as a switch, has a bright future in metabolic engineering, which means our idea is valuable and practicable.

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," very fast as the iGEM becomes a bigger organization.  Moreover, other data resources like NCBI can be imported to this application, hence the user group of application is gets bigger and bigger. In such a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources and new functions should be added easily.
Before starting to think about those, first we have to ask to other teams and iGEM headquarters about the BioGuide 1.0 to see the missing points in our idea, and to check our theories. Until developing this idea we were not using professional software approaches. We were planning our weekly tasks and doing those as in the notebook.
After finding a novel software project we have to change our approach. We have to use professional software development approaches to develop such an application to be able to state the requirements exactly and to use a common language between software oriented and biology oriented members in the team.
As we mentioned above, our software can be extended, and new data resources can be imported. The requirements are changing and the problem can be understood better in time.  Extreme Programming Approach is developed for such software projects. That is the approach we are going to use in BioGuide2.0

The labeling of food derived from biotechnology is a major issue for India as its delegation at the CCFL has been seeking to achieve mandatory labeling as set out in Option 2. However, Option 2 has also raised a number of issues of concern including the enforcement, methodology, economic cost, consumer perception and difficulties likely to be faced.
Canada
In Canada, under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Standards Council of Canada has taken in the Voluntary Labelling and Advertising of Foods That Are and Are Not Products of Genetic Engineering. This states a requirement to label food that may potentially cause health and safety risks and well as have any considerable changes in nutrition and composition. Thus, there are no policies put in place for the mandatory labelling of foods detailing if they’re genetically modified unless there are reasons to do so such as a potential health and safety risks. Many food products might not be directly genetically modified but may contain ingredients such as corn or soy which have been genetically modified. To know if a food or its ingredients have been genetically modified, one would have to contact the manufacturer.
