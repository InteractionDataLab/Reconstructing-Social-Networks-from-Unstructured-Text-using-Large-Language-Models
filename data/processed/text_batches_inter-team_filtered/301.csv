Overall, Dr. Pryzdial’s comments gave us many things to consider in the design of our construct and any issues that we might have to troubleshoot. He believes that our project is an interesting exploration in the blood clotting area.
University of Alberta Hematology Department
We gained valuable insight in the development of our project design from Dr. Bruce Ritchie at the University of Alberta. Dr. Ritchie focuses on Bleeding disorders and Thrombosis and has also synthesized “recombinant blood clotting proteins, both in E.coli, and in human tissue culture cells”, while completing his post-doctoral fellowship in Biochemistry at the University of British Columbia. He supports our proposal, especially since many other competing companies producing blood coagulants (Tisseel, Duraseal, FlowSeal) utilize components of human blood. Nonetheless, he also provided us with further suggestions to consider in our design.  Specifically, he raised his concern that “the venom proteins are likely to be immunogenic [,] caus[ing] an antibody response that will be a problem for re-treatment”. However, antibodies usually take 10-14 days to form, meaning that, since our goal is to prevent excessive blood loss in an emergency situation, the formation of antibodies is not as problematic in the acute phase. His advice did however lead us to infer that our product could only be used once per person because of the high chance of an immunogenic response from the body. Although we had considered designing our blood coagulant in a bandage and/or gel form, Dr. Ritchie also suggested another application method that we could consider. This would take the form of a pre-filled syringe that could be used to apply the product to the wound when needed. This application method is already being used by Pfizer’s blood coagulant, Xyntha, which “is preloaded in a syringe as a dried powder and a liquid solvent (typically water) that mix when the plunger is pressed”. Using the knowledge he provided, we eventually decided on using a pre-filled syringe containing our construct followed by a bandage for sealing it in place. Additionally, Dr. Ritchie suggested that our product design should be easy to remove from its packaging and apply, in addition to stressing the importance of storing and applying our blood coagulant in a sterile fashion. Overall, Dr. Ritchie’s expertise in the hematology field proved to be very beneficial in aiding with the design of our blood coagulant.

The propeptide at the N-terminal would be cleaved by signal peptidases during or right after the protein secretion. When expressed recombinantly, the protein therefore requires enzymatic activation - an issue we chose to tackle by working to create a truncated, mature version of the protein. [21] A successfully expressed esp could be a good choice to tackle S. aureus biofilm through multiple pathways.
Defensin
Key Achievements
Assembly
Defensin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that contributes to the innate immune response and is present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. It is highly abundant in tissues involved in the host defence system and its amphipathic character allows it to penetrate and disrupt the integrity of pathogenic microbial membranes for destruction. Honey-bee derived defensin-1 was shown to successfully reduce the viability of biofilm-encapsulated wound pathogens, including P.aeruginosa and our main target, S.aureus. [22]
The function of defensin is to lyse the pathogenic cell by permeabilizing the plasma membrane. The surface of defensin has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Upon binding to the microbial membrane, defensin causes the formation of small channels, disrupting the integrity and increasing permeability of the membrane. This results in efflux (outward movement from cell) of vital components in the cell, thus killing it. [23]
Figure 4: Defensin interferes with the integrity of bacterial cell membranes
As our primary target in chronic wounds is the infectious bacteria S.aureus and considering that Defensin has successfully been shown to have a negative effect on the pathogenic membrane [24] , Defensin was considered a great combat protein candidate. The well-studied, honeybee-derived defensin1 part BBa_K1104301, from the Bee.coli project designed by 2013 NYMU iGEM Team-Taipei, was ordered for usage in SMITe and expressed. We planned to purify defensin and test its functionality on S.aureus biofilm both before and after it's conjugation to spider silk. A successfully produced and functional defensin would optimize the disintegration of several bacterial components of the chronic wound model by killing S. aureus, amongst other pathogens in the biofilm structure.
This could potentially be a natural antimicrobial treatment as an alternative to extensive use of antibiotics to reduce the bacterial infections.

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". It has been cloned and expressed in E.coli and extensive activity assays have been performed with it [4]. This enzyme is active in the periplasm as well, due to the toxicity of the substrate. Chloride dismutase is critical for ameliorating chlorite-mediated toxicity to the cell, by reducing it down fully to molecular oxygen and chloride ions. Additionally, chlorite dismutase is a heme-containing protein [5].
Given the further level of characterization of chlorite dismutase, our team decided to attempt to clone and express the gene encoding this enzyme, Cld, before moving on to attempt the cloning and expression of the gene encoding perchlorate reductase, given that perchlorate reductase has never been functionally expressed.  Our strategy for expressing Cld is shown below (Figure 2):
Figure 2: Expression of the Cld gene
The gene for chlorite dismutase, which we engineered to either have the signaling peptide (Cld+SP) or not (Cld-SP), is placed under the control of the lac operator. The backbone also contains genes encoding kanamycin resistance and the lac repressor. To switch gene expression off, lac repressor proteins bind to the promoter region, preventing RNA polymerase (RNA pol) from docking onto the promoter region and starting gene transcription. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is then added to turn on gene expression. IPTG is a lactose metabolite that can bind to the lac repressor, causing the lac repressor to release the promoter region. The release of the lac repressor then allows RNA polymerase to bind, triggering the expression of chlorite dismutase. After translation, the newly synthesized chlorite dismutase then incorporates a heme group, which is synthesized by the addition of levulinic acid and Fe2+. Depending on whether the signaling peptide is present or not, the enzyme is then trafficked to either the periplasm (Cld+SP) or secreted into the cytoplasm (Cld-SP). Chlorite dismutase then catalyzes the oxidation of chlorite to produce oxygen and chloride ions, as shown by the reaction scheme in the red box.
An additional advantage to beginning with the cloning of the Cld gene is that the measurement of oxygen is considerably easier than measuring the production of chlorite, which is the product of the perchlorate reductase. By measuring oxygen, we would be able to have some idea of the efficiency of our engineered bi"

BGU_ISRAEL,2016,Team:BGU ISRAEL#EthicsAndSafety_-_-_TEXT.html," insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care                                  for God's creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is                                  paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have                                  to take account of their well-being.
After meeting Prof. Glick, we were eager to learn more about how Judaism deals ethical issues regarding scientific research                                 and progress. We found a quote from Rabi Moshe Ben Maimon (Maimonidas), a philosopher, scientist, polymath and one of the                                  most important adjudicators in the Jewish religion that lived in the Middle Ages :""If men possessed wisdom, which stands                                  in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others,                                 for the knowledge of the truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries"". Maimonidas didn’t see any future                                 harm in the search for wisdom as he derived that the search and common goal cancels any violent notion.
Judaism holds an ambivalent opinion regarding genetic engineering and technologic innovation. It indicates the need of                                 finding a balance between the human's wellbeing and preserving the creation. These principals are much alike some aspects                                  in the modern approach towards bioethics.
Ethical concerns regarding the PlastiCure project
Familiarizing with the GMO concept, we discovered that there is a discrepancy between the way the public perceive bioethics                                 and the way it is studied and practiced. Reaching the public in various events, we made an effort to explain the safety                                  precocious we took in order to prevent health and environment hazards. Furthermore, we explained our motivation for working                                 with modified microorganisms to solve the problem of plastic pollution. We realized that measured ethical risks must be                                 taken in our project. Therefore, we designed several approaches to address these risks. For example:
Bacterium self - destruction switch mechanism that was developed by BGU iGEM Team 2013,                                      And allows to control the life time of the modified organism.
Enforced symbiosis between our two types of bacteria that do not allow them to survive                                      separately on PET out of our controlled system.
PlastiCure, BGU iGEM team conducted research from pure motives. Our goal was to find plastic waste a solution.                                 One of our main guide lines is to create a safe and controlled work environment. Therefore, we followed strict                                 safety rules that enable us to ensure minimum mistakes"

Imperial,2014,Team:Imperial#The i in iGEM_-_-_TEXT.html," the other hand we can argue that it is easier for scientists with a foreign background to understand and appreciate the additional challenges for teams where English is not their first language. Like the teams, these scientists are also called to break through language barriers in order to gain their rightful recognition in the field.
Recommendations
Through the data and observations considered here and discussions with linguists and universities that deal with a large influx of international students, we offer a list of recommendations that could reduce the language barrier in iGEM and it could help non-English speaking teams to communicate their projects in a more effective way.
For the Teams
Create a summary page written in perfect English. The most effective way of doing so is by writing the page in your native language as well as possible and give it to a bilingual person (in your language and English) to translate. This way the major parts of your project (overview, results, and conclusions) are not lost in translation and the judges can quickly have a look through them.
Outsource. A lot of students and scholars in many universities participating in iGEM come from abroad and may have been educated partially in English. Ask their input when writing your wiki, preparing your presentation or making your poster. Otherwise, you can find native speakers of your language in a different iGEM team, preferably one from an English-speaking university. You can ask for their help and form a collaboration.
Visualize. Try to communicate your project as visually as possible. Make animations of your systems, take a lot of pictures of your experiments and create very detailed graphs, symbols and photographs. This is an effective way English is taught as a foreign language and it can be used the other way around.
For iGEM
Create a database of nationalities of the participating students. This could give a greater insight in how truly international iGEM is. A few of the alumni could go back to their home countries and establish Synthetic Biology hubs, even iGEM teams. With Synthetic Biology being a new, ever expanding field, it is good to keep an eye on where the next innovation will appear.
Create a database of languages spoken by the participating students and make it public. This can promote collaborations between the teams and enhance the community feeling. Teams with problems in English can contact students from different teams that speak their language in order to seek help.
Promote participation of judges from more diverse backgrounds, especially from countries and universities that may not be present in the competition that year or never. This is a great opportunity for expanding the global community of iGEM and Synthetic Biology.

Aims:
According to our experiment, RNA thermometer will form a loop on mRNA to inhibit protein translation, while the loop could open if temperature increases so that ribosome can pass the loop and produce peptides. We aim to use LEGO robot to present how the RNA thermometer work in E coli. Furthermore, in order to show this processing directly and teach public some knowledge of synbio, we designed and assembled a LGEO model to stimulate protein translation.
Description:
The robot represents as ribosome, a protein synthesis machine.       The double bridge represents the RNA thermometer. The bodies of double bridge are mRNA sequence; the gap between two bodies represents hydrogen bounds. The bridge in up state means RNA thermometer form a loop to inhibit translation, however the bridge in down state means RNA loop disappeared so that ribosome can pass.      The red and blue balls represent peptides of chromosome proteins.
Show time
Hello, I am a happy ribosome; now, I bind with my favorite mRNA and start to finish my job producing peptides.
BUT, WHAT IS THIS? A loop on the mRNA stops me; I cannot walk alone the way! OMG!!! Who can help me? T^T
This loop called RNA thermometer is formed by hydrogen bounds. The bounds will break up if temperature increases.
Fortunately, the loop disappears because of increasing"

The second phase: T.atroviride homologous recombination kit
Step1 Characterize the promoters and terminators of T.atroviride as the parts
To be able to integrate more genes at the same time, we need to get more promoters and terminators using in the construction of module.
Firstly, in addition to the existing constitutive H3 promoter, we searched many papers and chose another published constitutive promoter, Phex. Then we replaced PH3 with this Phex in the above random insertion plasmid and transformed this new plasmid into T.atroviride, which can be detected under fluorescence microscope.
Secondly, as a kind of filamentous fungus, T.atroviride inhibit the pathogenic fungus through mycoparasitism by receiving the signals such as agglutinin or others. T.atroviride will twine on the pathogenic fungus, persistently upregulate some genes. The ech42 gene is such a kind of upregulated gene during mycoparasitism so that we surmised there is a kind of inducible promoter in front of the ech42 gene[2]. Therefore, we got a fragment (named it Pech42) in front of the ech42 coding region and replaced the PH3 with it as well. This plasmid also transformed into T.atroviride and was detected under fluorescence microscope.
Besides, thanks to assistance of the laboratory in our university, we obtained two more kinds of constitutive promoters, PSOD and Ptubulin to establish our kit and characterize them. This two kinds of constitutive promoters are widely used parts among laboratories, they are all used to be applied in the metabolic pathway of T.atroviride. Also, another terminator got from the part kits named tADH1 was ready.[2]
Step2 Obtain the homologous arms L1 L2 L3 and the homologous arms located in the T.atroviride genome.
We made the contact with the author of the M2S technique and obtained the homologous arms L1 L2 L3 from him. Besides, we chose the upregulated gene when mycoparasitism, ech42, and picked up the upstream and downstream of the coding region as the homologous arms located in the genome of T.atroviride.

How to put together a sponsorship package
From our experience, getting funding for an iGEM team in Australia is difficult to acquire and highly competitive. With only limited avenues available for sponsorship, you must think of the best possible way to demonstrate that your project is worth funding.
From our experience, one of the first things that users on So You Think You Can Synthesize asked was – How do you raise funds for your project? We recognized that this must be a common problem most iGEM teams face. The problem is perhaps particularly severe for Australian teams given that funding opportunities are narrow in the Oceania region.
Despite all these constraints, the Macquarie iGEM 2014 team’s fundraising efforts were immensely successful. We attribute this to our cleverly articulated sponsorship document which highlighted why our project was worth funding, and also what the sponsors will get in return for investing in our project. We wanted to make this sponsorship document publicly available, so all future iGEM teams can use this as a template, and hopefully this can help them with their fundraising initiatives. Please find the attached link to download a PDF version of our sponsorship document.
2014 iGEM Macquarie Sponsorship Support
The Macquarie iGEM team 2014 believes strongly in the important ethic of open sourcing in science, and we hope that having our documents publicly available will prove to be a massive advantage for other future iGEM teams, particularly Australian ones.

Also, we attempted to amplify the CAR gene in the PET vector (with 3 mutagenesis sites replaced) with biobrick primers, so that we could get it inserted into a biobrick plasmid. After several tries, this amplification was successful.
Week 19 (September 3 - September 7)
The team focused primarily on assays this week, including that of the PetroBrick as well as OleT. Procedures were also continued with CAR and NPT, and each were sent for sequencing, both shown to be successfully isolated when the results came in. It was decided that we would use CAR that had been not fully mutagenized, still with three NotI sites, as a piece in our construction with NPT so that we could perform assays. Mutagenesis would continue later, once we were able to obtain actual assay results. We continued to attempt to ligate JI3002 in front of NPT in a pSB1C3 vector. Following standard PetroBrick assay procedures (see earlier weeks), we were finally able to have successful assay results with proper graphical data. Instead of performing the assay with glucose, however, we used a standard mixture of naphthenic acids. Despite our earlier hypothesis that the PetroBrick would be unable to degrade naphthenic acids, we found that bacteria containing the PetroBrick were able to degrade these naphthenic acids into both alkanes and alkenes. These successful graphs are shown below.
Figure 1: The relative intensity of alkane production over a retention time in both E.coli that contain the PetroBrick, and in E.coli that are lacking the PetroBrick, as measured with GC-MS. Naphthenic acids were used as a substrate. A naphthenic acid standard was required to compare peaks.
Figure 2: The alkane and alkene mass spectrums generated by analysis of hydrocarbons produced from E.coli containing the PetroBrick as in Figure 1, using naphthenic acids as a substrate, as measured with GC-MS. Relative intensity to mass to charge ratio were compared.
Week 20 (September 10 - September 14)
We continued to attempt to ligate NPT and JI3002 together so that we could eventually perform assays with this gene. As well, we began trying to ligate the JI3002 promoter in front of CAR. After transforming both ligations and growing them on chlor plates, we noticed that for both attempted constructs, there were very few colonies. When we performed a"

Team Ingenuity at Lethbridge geekStarter workshop
Date: May 16th, 2016
Over the weekend of May 14-15, the geekStarter Workshop in Lethbridge aimed at bringing all the Albertan teams together at one meetup to exchange knowledge, seek collaboration opportunities, mentor each other, and develop critical skills – not only in the lab, but in real world settings. Here are the highlights from the Ingenuity team.
Dawson Zeng: The May geekStarter Workshop really helped our team narrow down our project idea in terms of its feasibility, while furthering our knowledge of the competition criteria. I found David and Patrick’s presentations to be very useful. iGEM HQ has constantly changed its competition criterion. Since I have been out of the competition for 3 years now, it was an important reminder of the other non-scientific aspects for this season. If only we had more of these workshops set up throughout this summer. But as I understand, we unfortunately will not be having them, with the exception of the Calgary workshop in September. I was also hoping for an opportunity to meet the other iGEM teams and get to know their projects. A 2-day workshop would also give the teams these opportunities to interact. But I know this isn’t always the case, so we’re thankful nonetheless!
Mirat Sojitra: The geekStarter workshop was really effective in giving us an idea regarding the requirements for iGEM competition. The one-on-one conversation with the experts helped us to tweak our project to give us an competitive edge at the competition. The ideas presented in the lecture given by each experts gave us information that was unique and helped us understand how to diversify our project with incorporation of different methods and also present in a proper way at the competition. Only one aspect in my opinion that could have been done better is the interaction between each of the iGEM team. We briefly had interactions with other iGEM team but if there was more time allocated for people to interact, I believe that we could have exchanged ideas and understand other iGEM team’s approaches to the competition.
Nafaa Haddou: The geekStarter Workshop was fantastic. It was definitely an enjoyable experience and quite an opportunity to speak to previous competitors and other authorities in"

Modeling
What is this program?
Synthetic biology has been developed for a decade and is being expected to evolve the academic society because of its standardization and convenience.1, 2 This novel technology has already yielded bunches of applications on the ﬁeld of pharmacy1, 2 and therapeutics3 while also showing its potential on energy industry.5 However, a standardized model is eagerly required to be established because it will facilitate the exploration of synthetic biology. Therefore, we developed the software – AutoModel, which integrates dozens of models of simple devices and stipulates the I/O interface then provides user standardized modeling path with high degree of freedom.
This python script is being expected to help noviciate to construct their model and decide how much experimental data should be collected. In the coming section, we will demonstrate how this software works and how it help

How does it work?
During the synthetic biological procedure, substantial biochemical reaction happens in vivo or in vitro. Generally speaking, those gene expression molecular level events could be represented by mass equation:4
k1[A]aq + k2[B]aq k3[A B]aq
where k1, k2 and k3 are reaction coefﬁcients. One of best mathematical representation for this reaction formula is differential equation. The differential equation is a mathematical equation about some continuously varying quantities and their rates of change in time that relates some function of one or more variables with its derivatives. Therefore, differential model is widely employed on the chemical modeling. However, constructing a precise model for any speciﬁc reaction is always complex because dozens"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," less important components of the supplement solution premix which is added to CFPS systems, and hence a minimal supplement premix could be determined. There are several different types of DoE designs. One of these is the screening design (SD), which is used to create experimental designs to determine the factors with the highest effect on a system. Another design is the surface response design (SRD), which makes experimental designs to collect data for generating models which can predict optimal settings for many factors (SAS Institute Inc., 2016). Software tools, such as JMP (SAS Institute Inc., 2016), can assist in creating these experimental designs.
Screening Design for Salt Supplements
Previous research has shown that the concentration of certain salts in the CFPS supplement premix are crucial for maximal protein synthesis activity (Yang et al. 2012). A Design of Experiments approach was used to determine which of the four salts (magnesium glutamate, potassium glutamate, sodium oxalate, and ammonium acetate) are the most important using the JMP software. A classical screening design was created with all four salts as continuous factors and CFPS activity as the response to be maximised. A concentration of ‘0’ was used as the lower limit for each factor, and the concentration used normally in CFPS supplement premixes was used as the upper limit (Figure 1). The screening design generated is shown in table 1.
Figure 1: Response and Factors for CFPS Salt Supplement Screening Design: Screenshot of JMP software program. CFPS activity was set as the response, and the response was set to be maximised. All four salts were input as continuous factors. The “Construct a main effects screening design” radio button was selected.
Table 1: Main effects screening experimental design: CFPS reactions contained concentrations of each salt supplement according to the table above. The pattern column shows whether a salt was present (✔)  or absent (X) from the system.
CFPS reactions were performed using supplement solution premixes with salt concentrations as determined by the main effects screening design. Reactions were incubated with 1.7 μg plasmid DNA encoding sfGFP (superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein) at 37 o C for 13 hours. CFPS activity was calculated as fluorescence intensity at 13 hours minus fluorescence intensity at 15 mins. This data was then used to generate a bar chart of Contrast values and a Half-Norma Plot (Figure 2 and 3) to determine which factors were having the most effect on CFPS activity. It should be noted"

We also isolated the plasmid from overnight cultures of BBa_K546000 - pSB4K5 with the Machery-Nagel plasmid isolation kit and protocol. Taq PCR of the prepped plasmid confirmed the presence of an insert of the size corresponding with the BBa_K546000 biobrick.
We made electrocompetent cells from a 100ml culture of the GFP reporter transformant. These cells were used to transform the BBa_K546000 - pSB4K5 plasmid. These cells, containing both the quorum sensing system and reporter on separate plasmids are from here called the ‘2 plasmid quorum sensing system’. Transformation through electroporation. This transformation yielded colonies on the agar plate that are green to the naked eye.
Aug. 22th -  Sep. 4th
Quorum sensing 2 plasmid system testing
Started an overnight plate reader experiment for the 2 plasmid quorum sensing system cells. Cells were grown in LB with the appropriate selection antibiotic(s). Measurements were done for wells with only the medium, medium with the reporter only cells, medium with BBa_K546000 - pSB4K5 cells and for cells with the 2 plasmid quorum sensing system. For all bacterial samples, three serial dilutions were measured and for each dilution 4 technical replicate wells were measured. We measured absorbance and GFP fluorescence. This experiment was performed three times on different days with different starting cultures to provide biological replicates. All replicates showed the same general pattern of sharp fluorescence/OD600 increase when the OD600 increased. We confirmed the presence of both BBa_K546000 and the GFP reporter BBa_K1913014 through taq PCR with primers VF2 and VR. After gel electrophoresis, the PCR product showed 2 bands of the lengths corresponding to the envisioned inserts.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," Bernardes Pinheiro (directed evolution) both delivered fascinating talks.
We have organised a collaboration with the Glasgow iGEM team as a result of the Westminster meetup - we’ll be sending them Killer Red and Killer Orange transformed in E. coli DH5α cells to run some proof of concept tests for us, and they’ll be sending us Z1 lac-repressor E. coli strains to use in our kill switch experiments.
Dan made glycerol stocks of, miniprepped and carried out qubits on the DNAse1 and Lysozyme overnights prepared yesterday. He also took samples of the overnighted Killer Red and Killer Orange to test again in the light box, and made spread plates of all the samples after 6 hours of exposure.

Log entry
Andy, Alan and Joel met with Dr John Rowe of Exeter’s Physics department today to discuss modelling problems with him. After the meeting, they decided to move forth with modelling in the coding language C, as opposed to on a MATLAB application. This is because Simulink and SimBiology were not user friendly, and often did not have functions that we needed in constructing the models.
We checked the spread plates to find they all had live colonies, meaning the Killer Red and Killer Orange kill switches hadn’t worked again.

Log entry
Joel began to further develop his Killer Red model today, moving away from a basic structure and looking a possible limiting factors like maturation rates of proteins, degradation due to photobleaching, maximum mRNA in an E. coli cell, etc.
Hannah received confirmation today that Professor Jim Al-Khalili would be happy to take part in ‘Desert Island… Science?’ - the interview has been scheduled for 23.09.16.
Andy has been designing a survey for 1st/2nd/3rd year Biosciences students to look at their perception and understanding of synthetic biology, and more specifically, kill switches. Dr Burton has offered to help us distribute the survey to new students during Welcome Week.
Today’s lab team was Dan, Eloise and Jack. Our Enzcheck Lysozyme kit arrived today, so they made stock solutions to prepare to future experiments. They transformed Killer Red, Killer Orange and Lysozyme into BL21DE3 E. coli cells, and made overnights of Killer Red in BL21DE3 and DH5α wild type cells.

Protocol: CP1.1
Notes: The experiment was done with Taq will the purpose only was to check if  the RFP was amplificated when using the primers VR og VF2. The PRC program used was c.f. the protocol but the elongation time was 1min and 30 sec while the biobrick in the pSB3T3 plamid are 1319bp long. For the PCR i used the mini prep product from freeze tube 29.
Results:
Unfortunately there was no band around 1400bp and therefore the amplification was not succeed. the upper band is probably the plamid. -- Pernm07 08:58, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

Calgary_Entrepreneurial,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Technology#_-_-_TEXT.html," the FREDsense biosensor can become a product, we needed to begin characterization of the live cell reporting system and design a prototype of how the device would work. We address progress towards prototype design and manufacture in more detail in the Operations section
In making a live cell biosensor, we need to characterize the rate of response in which an enzyme will work to produce the analyte. A kinetic model was built for the activity of a hydrolase in MatLab, predicting that a response could be detected within 4 minutes of adding the substrate to the enzyme when read electrochemically. This experiment was then performed with live cell induction of hydrolase expression. The results were consistent with the model's prediction, informing our design of the protocol for the biosensor. As we characterize the sensing micro-organism more fully, we will use predictive modeling of its behavior to develop quantitative interpretation of toxin level in solution.
Figure 7: Model prediction and experimental results correlate for the production of the electroactive compound PNP.  Experimental and modelling results for the uidA gene to cause cleavage of PNPG into PNP. Both results show that a detectable level of PNP is reached in under 4 minutes.
To take our live cell detector into the field, we needed to convert equipment that would normally fill a lab bench to a portable, user-friendly device. We began this process with the design and development of an inexpensive, small, and portable potentiostat. Required circuitry being printed onto a small circuit board. Samples would be loaded through a one-way valve into a sample cartridge (adapted 15mL culture tube) containing the cells, electrochemical substrates, and other reagents required to produce the electrochemical response. The sample cartridge also has a disposable electrode accessible to the sample. The cartridge/electrode plugs into a slot, connecting it to the circuitboard and power source. The device is also equipped with LED lights to indicate what step of the analysis process is currently running and indicate when it has completed.
While more sophisticated potentiostats function well for our detection, we will ultimately need a small portable version that functions well for our needs. We developed a custom software package within the MatLab platform to interpret and display the data obtained from electrochemical measurement. Ultimately we will want the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to convert the amplitude of electrochemical response to the concentration of chemical being sampled.

Top 5 reasons to use cells for structure generation: (1) Cells span multiple length scales enabling the generation of microscopic to macroscopic structures. (2) Structures can be directed to morph, self-heal or be easily recycled by light-inducing cell death or polymer degradation. (3) No (or minimal) requirement for material mining, a costly and environmentally damaging activity. (4) It allows the generation of structures in environments that humans have no direct access to or are life-endangering. (5) Provides more autonomy to designers/architects and opens up new innovative properties (be it cell-free or “living” structures)
The potential of Barchitecture
We researched the potential of our Barchitecture application to determine the end goal of applying biological light switches to bacterial cell adhesion and biopolymer production. Our Integrated Practices describe our conversations with architects, ARUP - the construction company, Blue Alpha - a PHB producing company and the European Space Agency, from which we designed our Architecture technology to address the following real-world issues.
Natural disasters
Space Exploration
Medical implants
Considering the increasing frequency of natural disasters, having a cheap and immediate way to generate or repair structures could be used to temporarily seal leaks. Microorganisms can be also engineered to simultaneously detect and/or feed off hazardous waste and help clean up septic systems. Thus, biological light switches would prove useful in having a way of precisely guiding the phenotypes desired from the bacteria without having to rely on direct human contact with dangerous environments.
Light control of cell adhesion for 3D structure formation
We developed (Fig1A) transcriptional and (Fig1B) post-translational light switches for the induction of cellular aggregation. The final engineered cells would be able to respond to the light stimuli and assemble into desired structures that can simultaneously produce and bind a desired polymer.
Figure 1. Light induction of cellular aggregation. A) Depicts blue-light inducible expression system of proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion. B) Depicts UV-light activation of proteins involved in cell adhesion. In both cases, SpyTag and SpyCatcher are fused to the N-terminal of a truncated version of  intimin, an outer membrane surface protein for their cell surface display. Upon light induction, the aspartate residue in SpyTag and the lysine residue in SpyCatcher will spontaneously form strong and irreversible isopeptide covalent bonds, thus inducing cell aggregation.

Sequence Description
Coding
RcsB is a receiver protein which acts as a positive regulator of a number of genes including capsule genes responsible for colanic acid production.
Coding
Dam (DNA Adenine Methylase) The methylase encoded by the dam gene ( Dam methylase ) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of the adenine residues in the sequence GATC, this protects the DNA from cleavage.
Coding
Colanic acid global regulator ygiV (B3023) increases the production of colanic acid further in conjunction with RcsB by acting as a repressor for mcbR/yncC promoter. YncC/mcbR normally repress colanic acid overproduction so as to increase biofilm formation.

Fig. 8 The relationship between the fluorescence/OD600 and the concentration of arabinose
From this diagram, we can get the conclusion that the concentration of arabinose have a positive correlation with RFP intensity/OD600.
3. Employed plasmids with different copy numbers and simulated the concentration of plasmids losing on different levels.
In order to know the concentration of inhibitor changing with number of plasmids, we chose three types of plasmids with different copy numbers to achieve this.
Three kinds of plasmids are listed below.
Table 3. The copy numbers of different plasmids.
The fragments below (Fig. 9) containing constitutive promoter to express inhibitor.
Fig.9 The circuit constructed to detect the inhibitor protein and the strengths of different promoters.
In order to detect the inhibitor protein more easily, we replace the inhibitor with RFP like circuits below (Fig. 10)
Fig. 10 The fragments constructed on different plasmids
Then we construct two fragments in the Fig. 11 on different plasmids with different copy numbers.
At first, because it’s hard to control the number of plasmids, we use the model to simulate the relationship between the plasmids number and inhibitor protein (Fig. 11).
Fig. 11 The relationship between the protein intensity and the number of plasmids.
From this curve, we can clearly know that the relationship between number of plasmids and protein intensity. The concentration of arabinose have a positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range. In the previous section, we think when protein intensity above the 24.42 units, the in-promoter will be repressed fully, so the threshold of the number of plasmids is calculated to be 210 copies.
In the wet lab, the strains containing different plasmids copy numbers separately overnight (16 h) growth in the LB medium.
Table. 4 The form about experimental set up.
After 16h growth in the LB medium, we measure the RFP intensity of seven groups. Then we calculate the relative RFP intensity by subtracting the negative control
Table. 5.The RFP intensity of different circuits on different plasmids
From the table. 5, we can know that different plasmids copy numbers will lead to different RFP intensity. More plasmids copies, more RFP expressed.

2.1.1 Project Tour
The Problem
The inspiration behind The E.ncapsulator was the inherent difficulty in delivering protein pharmaceuticals to the gut. Due to the delicate nature of proteins and the highly acidic environment present in the stomach, protein molecules are readily broken down - making oral drug delivery of protein pharmaceuticals very difficult .
There are several diseases that are treated using oral delivery of peptides. Among these are: Malnutrition (world hunger) and Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disease associated with mental retardation due to insufficient ability to metabolise phenylalanine.
In this project, we chose several different potential applications to illustrate the versatility of The E.ncapsulator. Firstly, we chose to synthesise phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), an enzyme responsible for metabolism of phenylalanine - and an enzyme that is deficient in PKU patients. Secondly we chose to synthesise the enzyme cellulase, in order to derive better nutritional value from food consumed to aleviate malnutrition around the world. Finally we chose to synthesise a small bioactive pentapeptide, opiorphin. This small molecule acts very efficiently as a pain killer and anti-depressant, whilst due to its mechanism of action, remaining non-addictive.
The E.ncapsulator system is a generic drug production and delivery platform. The project great offers potential for any problem that requires the delivery of polypeptide biopharmaceuticals to the lower GI tract.
Some statistics
In the table below we have provided some statistics of disorders requiring administration of polypeptide drugs. This highlights the need for a cost-effective and implementable solution, which is what we is offered by The E.ncapsulator.
Malnutrition (from [3])
PKU (from [4-5])
854 million people worldwide are suffering from malnutrition (12.6% of the world population)
1 per 10,000 - 15,000 newborns are diagnosed with phenylketonuria in the USA
820 million in developing countries
It occurs with a frequency of between 1 in 4.500 (Turkey and Ireland) and 1 in 10.000 in most of Europe although in Finland the frequency is lower at 1 in 40.000 new born babies.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation#Global_-_-_TEXT.html,"in by cytidin deasminases and possible resulting mutations by replication of base excision repair (BER). Cytidin deaminase (CDA) deaminases cytidin to uracil. The resulting GU base pair leads to a UA and a CG base pair during replication.       Alternatively, the uracil is repaired via the base excision repair. Thereby, uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UNG) cuts out uracil and the       abasic site (AP-site) inside the DNA gets repaired by specialized endonucleases and polymerases.
Organisms have created mechanism to repair mismatches as UG pairs via the base excision repair (BER). Thereby the mismatched base is     cut out by the uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UNG). The resulting abasic site (AP-site) is cleaved by an AP-endonuclease and the patch is filled     by a variety of specialized proteins (Krokan, Bjoras 2013).
Overexpression of eukaryotic cytidin deaminase increases the mutation rate in bacteria. The CDA1 of Pteromyzon marinus was identified     in a comprehensive screen as the most potent cytidin deaminase when expressed in E. coli. Overexpression of P. marinus cda1 increases the mutation rate to 10-6-10-5 per bp. In ung deficient strains the effect was amplified by a factor of 50     due to the lack of UNG induced BER (Lada et al. 2011).
The CDS of P. marinus cda1 was codon optimized for E. coli integrated into our mutagenesis plasmid to increase the expression.     Moreover, the uracil-DNA-glycosylase inhibitor (ugi) was added. This short protein mimics the structure of abasic sides, binds to UNG and inhibits     the UNG mediated BER pathway (Serrano-Heras et al. 2007).
Figure 5: Structural alignment of UNG-UGI and UNG-DNA complexes. The E. coli UNG-UGI complex (PDB: 1LQG) was aligned to Deinococcus radiodurans UNG-DNA complex (PDB: 4UQM). The structural mimicry of UGI (red) to DNA with an abasic side (blue) and       the binding to UNG (green) is highlighted.

To do so, we designed primers for the constructs <partinfo>BBa_K863101</partinfo> (CBDcex(T7)), carrying the CBDcex domain from the C. fimi exoglucanase and <partinfo>BBa_K863111</partinfo> (CBDclos(T7)), carrying the CBDclos domain from the C.cellulovorans binding protein. The protein-BLAST of the two CBDs gave a exact picture of which bases are count to the binding domains and which are not. To be sure not to disturb the folding anyway we kept 6 to 12 bases up and downstream of the domains as conserved sequences. Even if the CBDcex is a N-terminal domain we chose to make the domains N-terminal, so the BioBrick already carries all regulatory parts and the linked protein can easily be exchanged. This also would be nice for other people using this part.

The listed complementary primers added, besides the Freiburg-suffix, a two amino acid Glycine-Serine-linker to the end of the CBDs. This is a very short linker, but as GFP-experts and publications described GFP and CBDs are very stable proteins and should cope with a very short linker. The benefit of a short linker is that protease activity is kept minimal.

Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we showed them how to incubate the plates to help the bacteria grow. We helped them carry out an experiment that extracted DNA from strawberries and we showed them proper pipetting techniques. We also did a fun experiment with the kids with basic cooking ingredients to make a “volcano explode” to introduce chemical reactions.
We narrowed our search to a few fish hatcheries in the upstate New York region and began contacting them.
Week 3 (June 21 - June 27)
Wetlab
Internal (PstI) cut sites also found in AA & AE (switched to cutting the backbones and inserts with EcoRI and SpeI). AA+H (ZA) construct and AA+B (ZB) construct were sent for sequencing to verify the contents of the construct. The two primers added resulted in overlap, and sequencing was redone with one primer.
Flavo Subteam
Flavobacterium were re-plated, but they showed no growth after three days. Their growth is necessary to conduct ZOI (zone of inhibition) testing.
Drylab
We came up with and finalized the design of an applicator for the fish tag that improves upon the existing design. Parts were assembled through SolidWorks, and we planned to use the machine shop to build a metallic applicator.
Policy and Practices
We continued the topic of DNA in bacteria with the YOURS kids by talking about antibiotic resistance and how we only want certain genes in our own experiments. The kids learned how to pipet and load something into a gel and watched as we showed them how we run gel electrophoresis experiments everyday.
Week 4 (June 28 - July 4)
Wetlab
Had some issues growing cultures on plates. Most constructs had issues being cultured post-ligation and transformation.
Flavo Subteam
Flavobacterium was re-plated, but there was still no growth.
Drylab
Dry lab continued with the design of the applicator.
Week 5 (July 5 - July 11)
Wetlab
We had to re-culture several plasmids (pre-ligation). We also received and made glycerol stocks of five new plasmids.
Flavo Subteam
Flavobacterium growth was tested on different types of plates to see if our plates were the issue causing lack of growth.
Drylab
To market the product, the tag needs an appealing name. We brainstormed many potential ideas that may be useful in constructing a name. In addition, we researched specific tubing, clamps and other materials that we intend to utilize for the fish tag

In our project, we hope to investigate how olfactory messages are transmitted by the neuron systems. In order to decrease delay or response comparing to chemical stimulus, we choose optogenetic techniques. Since C.elegans do not have sense to light, we express channelrodopsins in pairs of neuron as light receptors. CoCHR is the channelrodopsin in trans"

As a positive control for your designed Monobodies for example for colony PCRs or sequencings we supply one single binder of our library with device BBa_K2082009 .
Additionally, we provide a protocol for our collection for using our library and even constructing your own library with our  blindfold ( BBa_K2082000 ).
By doing so we established libraries in iGEM and paved the way for every team to access the advantages of large diversity libraries as well as creating and submitting their own. This would push the iGEM parts registry extremely forward. It would be possible for all teams, to submit different plasmid libraries, encoding several binding proteins, enzymes, aptamers, or other useful proteins. So all following iGEM teams can build on it and screen the diversity for their desired protein with special properties."

I spent the entire morning figuring out why the instance variables didn't seem to maintain the values that I had assigned them using other methods within the CubeWrapper class. It wasn't until I started using the StateMachine class to animate the Plasmid cubes that I figured out why the instance variables seemed to be resetting. Because I'm working with multiple cubes that interact with each other, assigning values for instance variables in one cube does not mean the same instance variables in all other CubeWrappers in the CubeSet will have the same value. Using the UniqueId property to differentiate between the Colored, Plasmid, and E. Coli cubes, I was able to code up the flipping functionality for all three colors. However, my code only works properly if there are three cubes that are part of the CubeSet--an assumption I'm going to have to fix since we'll definitely have at the very least 6 cubes connected.
Day 33: July 13, 2012
Consuelo and I started working on enabling communication between the Sifteo Cube program and a surface application she and Wendy had been working on. Because the surface application is on a continuous loop until it is closed, we are trying to thread it in the background.

SynFlo working with just three cubes
Pilot test is on Thursday and presentation to the CS department is on Friday. Have to find a way to use more than just 3 cubes (for now, 5). To differentiate between each cube in the CubeSet so that code knows where to extract particular information (like color to use) I used instance variables to record the UniqueId of each cube (which is a permanent code of characters). I won't be able to use this method if the number of cubes in the CubeSet changes. If I try updating the UniqueId recorded depending on an interaction happening, then using multiple sets of cubes won't work. The main challenge is to ensure that the program works not when cubes are in sets of three, but any number above three. Still have to work on updating the UI of the surface application and have the textbox be updated with the color on the cubes -- am working on adapting the GnomeSurfer threading implementation.
Day 35: July 17, 2012
Was able to adjust code so that more than just three cubes can be used (amount does not to be divisible by three either). Any colored cubes can introduce color into any Plasmid cube, which can introduce its color to any E. Coli cube. I'm not"

Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
Nowadays in China, transgenic technology is often concentrated in the field of food in the public perception. Because of media speculation and improper publicity, most people are over-concerned about the disadvantages of genetically modified food/Transgenic food so that genetically related topics often raise public tensions. This leads to the fact that the drawbacks of transgenic technology are over-amplified while the benefit of GM in many areas is seriously neglected. Therefore, we are intended to present the public with the advantages and authentic appearance of GM, which will provide a more dialectical and rational way of thinking for the public.
And as mentioned, through the questionnaire for the patients with hyperuricemia and the conversations with doctors from West China Hospital, we found that the public seems to be lack of understanding and attention of hyperuricemia. As college students with a strong sense of social responsibility, we are eager to educate the citizens about hyperuricemia and we would like to receive more comments and suggestions on our subject. Consequently, to enhance our cooperation with other iGEM teams, we actively invited 3 iGEM teams in southwest China to jointly organize and held the 1 week exhibition in Chengdu Library with the theme of “transgenic and human health”.
As the idea of carrying out a science popularization exhibition came to us, we had successively contacted Army Medical University, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and Sichuan University school of life science iGEM teams who were willing to cooperate on this program.
We instantly made contact with Chengdu Library which is a first-class modern city center library playing a leading role in west region of China. In 2016, the number of readers approaching Chengdu library reached 1.09 million. Hence its adequate readers flow and strong impact on the public might increase the feasibility of our exhibition.
Gotten the supports from the library, the communication with the library stuff was plain sailing. All the four teams were associated when deciding the theme, contents and poster design. We had a good cooperation and nailed it.
On the beginning day of the one-week-long exhibition, we the four teams gathered in the library early, and handed out handbooks and little gifts to the public, introducing our exhibition. We explained the contents on the posters and answered the questions"
SCUT-China,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Modeling#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," polyketide chain from PKS. In TE domain catalyzed reactions, polyketide chains anchored on the ACP domains react with the oxhydryl on the pecific binding sites of TE domains.  Then the polyketide chains are transferred from ACP domains to TE domains. However, polyketide chains are instable when binding to TE domains and they release from TE domains, that is, release from the whole PKS. Finally, they become ripe polyketides.
The concrete equation of chemical reaction is :
After the analysis of equation above, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzed reaction is similar to the single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions. We confirm that we can apply the mechanism of single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions to TE domain catalyzed reactions by using King-Altman Method.
The graph of mechanism is written as:
Kinetic Equations and Simplified Model Analysis
In the establishment of kinetic models, we employed the kinetic equations educed from single substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions and multi substrate enzyme catalyzed reactions to each part (details in Reactions and Mechanism). Kinetic equations of enzyme catalyzed reactions (including single substrate’s and multi substrate’s) are educed from Law of Mass Action initially. We wrote out the related kinetic equations according to the mechanism in each part.
1．Loading Part
The reaction mechanism of Loading Part is Ping-pong bi-bi. The kinetic equation is :
KmAis the Michaelis Constant of substrate A when [B] is saturated.
KmBis the Michaelis Constant of substrate B when [A] is saturated.
Acoording to prerequisite of Michaelis-Menten equation, the concentration of substrates are much more than the concentration of enzyme, that Is, [A]>>[B]. Therefore, this kinetic model can be simplified. The simplified equation is:
After perfection, the final equation is:
[A0]is the concentration of DEBS 1.
[B] is the concentration of product in AT domain catalyzed reactions.
2. KS Part
(1)  AT Reaction
The reaction mechanism of AT Reaction is same as AT Part’s-------Ping-pong bi-bi. Therefore, the kinetic equation is the same.
(2)  KS Reaction
The reaction mechanism of KS Reaction is Ping-pong bi-bi. The kinetic equation is :
KmAis the Michaelis Constant of substrate A when [B] is saturated.
KmBis the Michaelis Constant of substrate B when [A] is saturated.

Greenhouse: CO2 E. coli releases is forwarded to the greenhouse included in the facility, where it aids the growth of crops there.
Water Purification Unit: Water excreted from processes like dehydration and distillation end up here to be purified, which can be used in the greenhouse to water plants.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our vision of the problems stated above is expected to have the least possible amount of waste since the byproducts like CO2 will be used in other fields and the bioethanol that we yield from agricultural waste will decrease greenhouse gas emissions while increasing engine longevity, thus leading to a much greener world.

To avoid further cross-contamination, we went back from the beginning and digested plasmids of the lysostaphin BioBrick (BBa_K525998) .
Digestion: Third attempt [✔️]
As previously done, the lysostaphin plasmid was digested with XbaI and PstI. The result of the double digestion is shown from the gel below.
Figure 3. Digestion of Lys plasmid. (1) Ladder (2)-(4) digested lys plasmid (5) Undigested plasmid.
Ligation and Transformation of pSB1A3-T7-Lys: First attempt [❌]
In this attempt, we decided to use the ampicillin backbone pSB1A3. The ligation procedure was carried out as before and continued with transformation into E. coli TOP10 cells for maximum efficiency. Unfortunately, either the ligation or the transformation procedure had failed and no colonies grew.
We suspect that the Ampicillin concentration on the plates may have been too high, and we decided to change the concentration from 100 μg/ml to 50 μM/ml.
Ligation and Transformation pSB1A3-T7-Lys: Second Attempt [❌]
This time we used a lower ampicillin concentration on the plates, but again no colonies were observed after the transformation procedure.
Ligation and Transformation of pSB1A3-T7-Lys: Third and Fourth Attempt [❌]
We repeated the ligation and transformation procedure with the same conditions another two times (as described in lysostaphin lab book week 7), however we were still unsuccessful.
To circumvent the same unwanted outcomes we resorted to changing several of the procedural steps in both the ligation and transformation process. We first increased the insert to vector ratio to (10:1). We then ligated the fragments overnight at a low temperature of 16 oC instead of 10 minutes at room temperature. The low temperature favored a slower kinetic which ensured an optimum balance between the enzyme stability and annealed DNA overhangs [1]. We also performed transformation on both BL21(DE3) and TOP10 cells to increase chances of a successful transformation. The ligation product was also subjected to purification to remove the salts and enzyme from the reaction which served to improve transformation efficiency.

Main purpose
Investigate nitrite stability in anaerobic, untransformed E. coli
Who was in the lab
Helen, Kasia
Procedure
Following Experiment 1a in order to ensure that any produced nitrite from Mutant 1 will not be consumed by any of the pathways in native E. coli.
Results
Mg of Nitrogen (as Nitrite or Ammonia) per liter measured for varying concentrations of Nitrite added at t=0.   All the experiments were performed anaerobically.  Samples were measured every 20 min for 3 hours.
Conclusions and Discussion
Under anaerobic conditions, nitrite is consumed and converted to ammonium.  Since we want to convert the nitrite to nitrous oxide, a functional prototype will require either that the pathway to nitrous oxide be designed to outcompete this pathway, or that this pathway that consumes nitrite be knocked out (and the transformants grown in a medium containing plentiful ammonium so they do not need to synthesize it).

In our survey, 43.79% of people have learned about synthetic biology, which is not the same as our expectations. It is likely that the result is caused by the object of our investigation. In our survey, there are 30 (21.90%) people whose personal professional is about the biological technology, 24 (17.52%) people whose professional has some relation with the biology, 68(49.27%) people whose personal professional has no relation with the biology, 15 (10.95%) people do not fill in the question. But the 30 people whose professional has some relation with the biology, 16(53.33%) of them have been known about the synthetic biology. This is no much difference with the overall 43.48%.
The course of synthetic biology in our school is few. Most of the professional, including the professional which is about the biological technology, are not exposed to synthetic biology. So the high proportion of synthetic biology in this survey may be related to the propaganda of our school and our team on iGEM.

Plant Synthetic Biology
Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced a an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all award, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

This     plasmid carries the Cas9 gene under the transcriptional regulation     of a mannose-inducible promoter PmanP, and a single guide RNA under     a strong constitutive promoter. For application in our project, the     idea was to replace the mannose-inducible promoter with a     tetracycline-repressible promoter PtetR. The pTetR promoter is     constitutively on and is repressed by TetR. The repression can be     inhibited by the addition of tetracycline.  If the key-spores     containing the CRISPR/Cas9 system are being revived by unauthorized     parties who are unaware of the correct treatment procedure, the     targeted area, in this case the key-sequence will be deleted as visible in Figure 9. This     way the message will be safe and secure.

Now that the receiver has received the message and was able to     successfully retrieve the correct key-spores, he can sequence both     of them. Key and message sequence have to be put into the     encryption and decryption machine. The machine is able to detect     the correct part of the full sequence by a header (GACCAAGCCTGC)     and a footer (GCACCCACCGAC) that have been added to the sequence     will converting it into a DNA string. The machine will apply the     key to the message and convert it back from DNA into the data set     that was chosen by the sender.

These were then purified, eluted with 50uL and nanodropped. The results were: input backbone: 26.2ng/uL and output backbone: 25.3ng/uL.  Then we phosphatase treated both input and output backbones, splitting each into two tubes using 25uL backbone, 3uL phosphatase buffer, and 1uL phosphatase. The two of each were combined, purified, eluted with 50uL and nanodropped. The results were: input backbone: 12.2ng/uL and output backbone: 12.2ng/uL.

Fish Populations
Purpose
The fish model allows users to see the effects of different concentrations of estrogen on a freshwater ecosystem containing algae, fish, and birds. The model attempts to capture the long-term effects of estrogen on male fish, and demonstrates how sensitive a freshwater ecosystem can be to various concentrations of estrogen. The model is stochastic and it was written in NetLogo, an agent-based modeling language which allows users to view and analyze complex interactions between agents and their environment. A stochastic model employs probability to determine the behavior of its components, thus it is the best type of model to capture the randomness of an ecosystem. The model was also demonstrated to local public school teachers so that they could help their students visualize interactions between different organisms and organisms and their environment. The current lake we are simulating is fictional, however, the code has been developed in such a way that one could substitute the parameters in our model with parameters they have received from a particular lake they wish to test.
Outline
The fish model follows a simple tropic pyramid structure. The algae is the food source of the fish, which  in turn are the food source for the birds. If no estrogen is introduced into the environment, the ecosystem is   stable and the model simulates what is essentially the predator-prey interaction. Initially there is a relatively   high amount of fish, and relatively low amounts of birds and algae. This puts a strain on the fish population,   while simultaneously making it easy for the birds to find prey due to the combination of a large food source   and low competition for that food source. Thus this leads to a dip in the fish population and a peak in the bird   population. The dip in the fish population also leads to a peak in the algae population, as the algae can grow   without being consumed as fast due to the lack of fish. This scenario puts a strain on the bird population as   there is now too much competition for a smaller food source, while simultaneously making it easy for the fish   to find food due to the combination of a large food source and low competition for that"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

Only in a sub population of the bacteria, sinI will be expressed at sufficient levels to trigger our system. Whereas sinR will be expressed in all cells.  So with this approach we can say that only a small population of the cells will get the heavy metals. If we want the other way we can switch the roles of SinI and sinR.With the normal conditions only 2% of the population express enough sinI.[2]

Expert Consultations
The changes made to “The Living Battery” following the feedback received from the farmers were then further discussed with experts in the field of Biotechnology, Biochemistry and Electrical Contracting. These leading experts provided Team Macquarie with valuable insights which allowed refinement of the design and the inclusion of features which made it a more viable product.
Fig 2. Prof. Willows alongside Team Macquarie students discussing their conceptual design
Professor Robert Willows, an expert in chlorophyll biosynthesis advised the team to use clear Mylar to line the inside of the bio-chamber, with a layer of aluminised Mylar at the bottom to reflect the sunlight back through the cells. Mylar was suggested as an ideal material as it is less permeable to hydrogen gas than other plastics and it also blocks UVB rays thus reducing UV induced mutations. Furthermore, Mylar provides a smooth internal lining for the tank which makes it harder for the cells to adhere to, thus decreasing the risk of biofilm formation.
In addition to this, Professor Willows suggested avoiding high-pressure gas tanks for the storage and instead using a low-pressure solution as it would be less hazardous and therefore a more desirable product.
Fig 3. Prof. Nevalanien teaching Team Macquarie students about biofilm formation.
Professor Helena Nevalanien was consulted for her expertise in the field of biotechnology. She brought up the issue of biofilm formation as a result of the E. coli cells settling when they were in a stationary situation. In order to address this issue, the Macquarie team introduced a small, rechargeable battery powered stirrer into the bottom of the bio-chamber. When the bio-chamber is in a stationary situation a small switch can be turned on to activate the stirrer and ensure that the cells are constantly moving.
Professor Nevalanien was also concerned with how we would separate the hydrogen molecules from molecular oxygen in the bio-chamber. To deal with this concern, the Macquarie team’s design incorporated a nafion membrane in between the bio-chamber and the hydrogen cylinder. Nafion is a commercially available, semipermeable membrane from Dupont. The fluorinated Teflon backbone of nafion gives it a high chemical stability and ionomer properties make it an ideal selective membrane for hydrogen protons which can migrate across sulphon"

We use the device to tandem express toxic protein TcdA1 and mCherry. Toxic protein TcdA1 is a macro channel forming toxin used for termite control in our project and mCherry is a reporter.
Sequence and Features
Characterization
OVERVIEW
We construct the device TcdA1 to tandem express toxic protein TcdA1 and reporter mCherry. Toxic protein TcdA1 is used to kill termites in our project.
TcdA1, one of the biggest proteins in bacteria (285kDa), is first found in Photorhabdus luminescens. It forms channels and assists other toxins across the cell membrane. It belongs to tc toxic protein family, which is widely distributed among different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
We clone and standardize the gene into standard plasmid pSB1C3. After confirmation of digestion and sequencing, we transform the plasmid into E.coli BL21(DE3) to achieve better expression level. Despite we observe that transformants have obviously turned red, we didn’t figure out the expected protein band in SDS-PAGE. Judging that the protein is considerably huge in bacteria, more improvements are needed.
BACKGROUND
TcdA1 is a pore-forming macro-protein, which can keep the ability to form a pore in a large pH range (from 4 to 11). To be noticed, at pH11, the pore-forming activity of tcdA1 is more than 100-fold greater than at pH 6. As the midguts of most insects are alkaline, tc toxic proteins are effective by feeding on insects, including termites.
In 2013, the structure of TcdA1 was revealed by researchers and reported in nature(1). As displayed in figure1a&b, the tcdA1 is composed of three parts: N-terminal a-helical domain(brown), the central b-sheet domain(green) and the C-terminal pore-forming domain(yellow). The protein has two states: pre-pore state and pore state. The pore-forming domain (Figure 1c) sticks out to form pore, changing into pore state (Figure 2).
Moreover, the tcdA1 toxin helps other toxins to enter the cell membrane. Naturally in strain TT01, tcdA1 is expressed homologously with other toxins"

After they had cooled, 400 microL of AMP was added to one solution and 400 microL of KAN was added to the other solution. Once the bottles were cool enough to hold, the solutions were poured into Petri dishes to make plates. Sterile technique was used. Plates were allowed to rest and solidify overnight and were labelled and placed in the refrigerator to store. LB + AMP plates were labelled with blue marker and LB + KAN plates were labelled with red according to standards found online.

Innoculation occured on the 14th at around 2200, leaving the growth time at around 17 hours. It should be noted the spectrophotometer is rather quirky and may require a larger amount of liquid than originally thought; this will be investigated as well, and the effected protocols modified.

The stock from the fridge appears to be dead, as after the heat shock protocol it refused to grow in the LB; the -80C stock made the solution cloudy. Both were plated onto AMP plates.

Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," translation attempts will be able to generate a read through and express the recoded gene. When aiming for complete safety and containment, this is not good enough… We therefore designed 2 new parts building on Paris-Bettencourt’s: P1003 5* [BBa_K2725012] and P1003 10* [BBa_K2725013] . These have 5 and 10 serine codons from the P1003 coding sequence substituted with amber stop codons. With 5 amber codons present in a coding sequence, probability of a read through and subsequent expression is reduced to 1 in every 1010 translation attempts, and with 10 amber codons this is reduced further to 1 in 1018 translation attempts. For more information on our probability model, see our semantic containment modelling page.
Addition of more amber codons however, also presents a problem for expression of the recoded gene in our chassis. In order to solve this we used the same probability model in order               to maximise read through in our chassis. We took the supD + terminator sequence from Paris-Bettencourt's part, BBa_K914000 and assembled this downstream of a higher strength constitutive Anderson promoter.               Higher levels of amber suppressor supD increases the likelihood of the tRNA interacting with an amber codon instead of Release Factor 1 that would release the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome and halt               translation. We designed 3 of these parts with varying strength anderson promoters in order to test for proof of concept:
J23102-supD - [BBa_K2725014] (strength 0.82)
J23103-supD - [BBa_K2725015] (strength 0.01)
J23108-supD - [BBa_K2725016] (strength 0.51)
Alternative Selection
The third lock in our triple lock system ensures that even if an environmental cell takes up an instructor plasmid, and can read and express the genes present, that those genes               confer no competitive advantage to the environmental cell. This is done by replacing the antibiotic resistance gene in the standard iGEM backbone with a gene that gives resistance to the biocide, triclosan [1,2].               Triclosan is a chemical that has previously been used in health and beauty products such as toothpaste, but today it is very rarely used. Critically, it is not used in medicine and healthcare, therefore if               a pathogen became triclosan resistant this would not interfere in our ability"

Our ongoing research investigates the medically important fungal pathogenCandida albicans, with the ultimate goal of identifying new treatment options for patients suffering from Candida infections. We use an array of genetic and genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicansfunctions.  As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome. We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of theC. albicans cell cycle, and investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system.

So to make sure students in the lab  master the knowledge of biosafety and can apply it into reality , we set up a Chinese biosafety online platform testing students’ related skills. If wanting to do experiments in this lab，they should pass this online-test first.

Release of the Protein of Interest into the Small Intestine
Our polypeptide of interest is to be released past the stomach into the intestine. Once The E.ncapsulator reaches the intestine, gut microflora will digest the colanic acid coat, resulting in the release of the polypeptide therapeutic. Colanic acid represents a rich sugar source and many gut bacteria such as Citrobacter have been found to contain the necessary enzymes to break it down. In addition, a number of phages have a similar enzyme attached to their tail fibers which allows them to break into colanic acid coated cells.

Results: Both E.coli C and K1477014 cells stimulated with IPTG “leaked” β-gal activity (Cells only).  Top10 cells were negative as expected.  β-gal activity was suppressed in all cell lines by glucose as expected.  T7 treatment resulted in an increased release of β-gal activity from both E. coli C and K1477014.  The combination of T7 lysates from Top10 cells stimulated with IPTG and K1477014 cells grown in glucose did not show any β-gal activity. .
Conclusion: Cells stimulated with IPTG and subjected to this protocol release β-gal activity.  This might be due to β-gal activity that accumulated in the media as the cells grew. Another possibility is that β-gal activity was released when the calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate solutions were added before virus lysis or perhaps released during centrifugation of the cells in the SpinX columns.
Most important however is that β-gal activity was found in the medium of lysed and unlysed K1477014 suggesting that the LacZ alpha and omega polypeptides stay combined once they are released! That is great news!
T7 treatment caused an increase in the release of β-gal enzyme from the E. coli C and the β-gal enzyme (alpha-omega polypeptide combo) from K1477014.
Unfortunately, the combination of T7 lysates of Top 10 cells treated with IPTG, which should have formed LacZ omega polypeptides and the K1477014 cells treated with glucose, which should have formed only LacZ alpha polypeptides, did not have any detectable β-gal activity.
This lack of activity could be due to the slow association of the alpha and omega fragments, maybe slowed by the Buffer Z and calcium and magnesium salts or, worse, it means that the alpha and omega polypeptides have to associate inside a cell to be joined into a working enzyme. We can study this further by letting the combination of fragments incubate together for hours in hopes that β-gal activity appears.  If it does that is great because that is the proof of principle that we are after.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety.

Our team members made a video to introduce GFP protein and relative knowledge, won the special award and had our video broadcast in the Scientific Carnival in Beijing Olympic Parks.
Our own We Chat official account
Since WeChat has been widely used in China, we decided to create our own official account to get more people know us and iGEM competition. In the past two months, we have shared introduction of iGEM competition and some details of our team's project. To sum up, we received 7731 clicks and more than 3783 persons read our passages.

Gvp cluster( BBa_K737010 ) is a 1 kbp part   contains 2 open reading frames coding for gas vesicle genes (gvpA gvpC-20) from Bacillus Planktothrix rubescens strain BC-  Pla 9402. Promotion of the sequence results in expression of gas vesicles, organelles made entirely out of protein. These   organelles contain gas and therefore provide bouyancy to the cell. This slows the rate of settling of the cells in   different water layer from Lake Zurich by gas vesicles, see Walsby 2002.
the expression situation of the Gas vesicle gene cluster in Escherichia coli JM109, from the picture, we can see   obviously gas vesicle due to the expression of bacteria produce clear separation phenomenon. The picture on the right of   the experimental group were liquid surface layer and intermediate layer of fluid sampling results, we can see that the   fluid layer surface bacteria volume density is obviously higher than that of the middle layer of fluid.
The picture shows the gas vesicle in the cells after expressed in the overall trend. We in the cultivation of the   cells into logarithmic phase after transferring them to test tube, quiet place and culture 36 hours after using Trace   stratified take liquid apparatus at the same time to each liquid layer for sampling. Then each layer of fluid samples of   blood count the number of cells with statistics. Results show that gas vesicle due to the existence of the cell   concentration in the test tube surface layer of fluid, and control group due to the action of gravity that most"

E.coil: Our responsibility to save the world!
With great power comes great responsibility. E.coil has the responsibility to produce fatty acids and save the world!
Since the mankind found the oil, our life has changed a lot. For example, we can fly in the sky like superman and we can move really heavy things just like superman. In short, oil is the essential chemical for multiple uses.
Q: Now that the oil is rather important, why we need fatty acid? I mean, why not sugar? What is Fatty acid?
A: Fatty acid = Oil!
Fatty acids with different carbon chain length and saturation levels can be widely applied to industry, food, medicine and many other aspects. Most importantly, it is a very promising feedstock for the production of eco-friendly biodiesel. And this could be the potential power source to compensate for dwindling fossil energy.
Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, however, the processes of FFA production are restricted by seasonal, regional and many other factors. Besides that, the cost of producing is so high that it cannot be intensively industrialized. Given that, our super-E.coli emerges at this significant moment and take its obligation to save our world from energy crisis.

Possible Explanations:
Used wrong inserts
Seamless went wrong
Mutations of template
Backbones not digested properly (not likely)
PRM1 and PRM2 backbones have GFP
Concentrations of both insert and backbone too low
Final Concensus: We will use another method to transform the cells"
