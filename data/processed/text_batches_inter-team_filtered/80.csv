The restriction digest from SAMS and the terminator was put on gel
It appears there is no SAMS in between the vector, the length is approx. 1500 bp which can only be sam5 or sam8

Despite of all the things that I enjoyed doing in the project there still some things that I didn't like during our work In the lab, these things can be summarized with two basic items, the first is waiting long time between one experiment and the one after, the second is having unwanted results after a very hard work. I look forward in the competition to meet the other teams and their interesting projects, in addition, I'm so curious to learn from their discoveries through their project. I'm sure that all of us will enjoy the IGEM conference in Boston and I wish everybody good luck, especially us.
Hey, my name is Ido and I’m 18 years old. I’m a member of the modeling team. I was responsible for making our mathematical model, together with the other modeling team members. I also developed our search engine “iGem Explorer” together with Itay, Tomer and Chen. In the “iGem Explorer” subproject I was responsible of doing the UI of the search engine. I love learning and doing math, and I also love to program. I had the amazing opportunity to combine both of these loves in our project. I’m so grateful that I was able to participate in this project, because I learned a LOT about modeling and software development and because I also  learned about working together with other people on the same mission.
Hey there! I’m Itay and I’m from Israel. I’m 17 years old. I’m doing all kinds of things for the team but especially modelling and programming. My scientific idol is Richard Feynman. This competition exposed me to many fields that I’ve never had the chance to encounter before, especially to synthetic biology. A quote I like: “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why” –Mark Twain

Modeling Details of Repressilator
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4.
cIlam protein only forms dimer.
Only cIlam dimer binds with pcIlam gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.

Agarose gel electrophoresis
Gel preparation
To prepare 1% agarose gel (say 200ml), add 2g of agarose powder to 200 ml of 1X TAE buffer (obtained by diluting 10X TAE stock buffer with water) and heat in microwave until all powder desolves. Gel stains should be added when the agarose becomes cool enough to touch.
For ethidium bromide gels, add 2 uL EtBr to 20 mL of agarose (makes 1 gel).
Electrophoresis setting
For electrophoresis, set constant voltage at 80V (with current at approximately 3 mA) and run for 30--60 minutes (or until sufficient separation of DNA).

Week 10 (September, 26-28)
I made a screening of the plates of the putative pREP41X + tetR-CSD by colony cracking, but results were quite strange. I started to amplify the parts to be sent to Registry of Standard Biological Parts.

After European Jamboree...
Analytical digestions of  the putative construction Tadh1·tetO2·Purg plus GFP·Tadh1·tetO4, showed negative results, so it is necessary to go back to the beginning.

I analyzed Tadh1-tetO2-Purg construction, and it seemed that something was wrong. I must return to the beginning and start everything.
I set up inocula of all the parts to begin from the scratch. Having nightmares with electrophoresis gels and Petri plates can't be good. Again, minipreps, sequential digestions, …

I tried again with no  dephosphorylated plasmid, and the the ligation plate is plenty of colonies, as well as the control plate. I made a 51 colonies screening and I found some positives clones.
I cloned Purg1, Swi6, tetR-CSD and tetO2 into pSB1C3 and transformed the ligations products into  DH5-alfa E. coli strain. No colonies in plates.

I had started two liquid cultures of 100uL of liquid from the plate flood in 1mL of W3110 and BL21.  The W3110 bacteria was visibly lysed (clear); the BL21 bacteria had some snot but was not lysed.
Procedure We pelleted the liquid from the two liquid cultures and did a 10^0 through 10^-5 dilution on each, along with a bacterial lawn control.  We also started two more liquid cultures of 1 mL from the plate flood in 10 mL of W3110. We will shake these in a 100 mL flask at 37C.

After talking to the advisors and troubleshooting our ligation and transformation problems, they came up with several ideas to help improve our transformation and ligation efficiency
First, they suspect our P restriction enzyme may not be digesting fully
Secondly, they think we should run our digestions/ligations for 2 hours/overnight respectively instead of 1 hour/30 minutes
Refer to the meeting notes for more information regarding the advisors advice

Improve the Characterization of an Existing Part
We chose to improve the characterization of the hypoxia-inducible promoter (BBa_K387003). This promoter was designed by SJTU-BioX-Shanghai in 2010 to serve as their detector for low oxygen levels. However, they did not fully characterize the part. The team only measured the activity of the fdhF promoter under two conditions: normal oxygen pressure (20%) and hypoxic oxygen pressure (< 20%). Therefore, we decided to improve this characterization by showing the activity of the fdhF promoter under varying oxygen pressures. To simulate hypoxic conditions were implemented the following method. We took up 200 uL of a sixteen-hour overnight culture into a syringe. In order to place the culture under different oxygen concentrations, we added different amounts of air into the syringe by drawing the stopper up. We chose the following air volumes (in uL) to characterize the promoter activity: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300. After creating the varying hypoxic conditions, the syringes were dipped into agar and allowed to solidify. This created a seal that did not allow any oxygen to enter. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. The syringes were incubated for 24 hours. Triplicates of each syringe was prepared in a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was read in a plate reader.
Figure 1: Experimental Set-up
Through this experiment set-up, we were able to improve the characterization of the fdhF promoter (BBa_K387003). We were able to measure the promoter activity under varying concentrations of oxygen and obtain the data in Figure 2.
Figure 2: fdhF promoter activity under varying oxygen volumes
Our data shows that the hypoxia-inducible promoter is maximally activated when there is no air present in the syringe. Moreover, the activity of the promoter showed an inverse relationship to the volume of the air in the syringe. As the air volume increased, the fluorescence measured decreased. In conclusion, we improved the characterization of the hypoxia-inducible fdhF promoter (BBa_K387003) by measuring its activity under varying concentrations of oxygen. Our results indicate that the promoter is maximally activated when there is no oxygen present and it shows a decreased activity as the concentration increases. Below are immunofluorescent live-cell images of bacteria exposed to normal air (top) and low oxygen (below)."

Why iGEM:
I've always wanted to do iGEM. I missed out on it during my undergraduate degree and when I saw that the postgraduate team is being introduced I thought it was an excellent opportunity. I was drawn to iGEM in the first place due to the chance to apply my knowledge and skills learnt at university to do some cool science.
Shahin Heshmatifar
Student at UCL studying a MSc in Biochemical Engineering. Previously studied an undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences at University of Westminster.
Why iGEM:
I had followed iGEM distantly during my undergraduate degree. I found  its concept and deliverable very interesting. After starting my post graduate degree at UCL, I found that there will be a post grad iGEM competition this year. I therefore decided to grab this opportunity by participating in the project to apply and enhance my knowledge in molecular and synthetic biology.

All work on Operation ECHO, including Wet Lab Experiments, Modeling and Wiki Designing, was done by the team members during the past few months.
Additionally, we get our basic Wet-Lab training from the team's advisor, Dr Chen(陈阳) and lab teacher Ms Yang.
Also some java-script used in my web-designing is acquired from the jQuery library .
Operation ECHO could not have been accomplished without the effort of every AutoGemers!
To Those we gave our deep appreciation
Ms. Yang and Dr. Chen for instructing us in strain construction.
Dr. Wang  for instructing on our model building.

Week 15: 9th of October - 15th of October
The Nerd Nite took place! An exciting event for students and people interested in science dealing with serious scientific topics in a humorous way, while the audience enjoys a late-bar feeling and drinking. And, best of all, we heard the best bee jokes ever this night!  (Examples:
What is the favorite TV show of bees? .... Game of drones.
Who are bees afraid of? Honeybal Nector.
Why did the bee leave the hive? It was a claustrophobee!)

Week 16: 16rd of October - 22th of October
We organised a real interesting event at our university. Together with experts in the fiel of biochemistry, medicine, biotechnology, philosophy et cetera, and a representative of our team, we held a public discussion about the general awareness of genetic engineering and synthetic biology in public. We had a quite nice talk about several themes like improving the general knowledge, explaining some legal developments in europe and future applications of genetic engineering. The publicity always had the chance to ask in between and got all their questions answered. In the end we served self-baked cakes and some drinks.

UFMG_Brazil,2014,Team:UFMG Brazil#Project#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," and that it can change the world. We think synthetic biology can help. We also believe in iGEM and we wish that brazilian students have the opportunity to be a part of it. So, what could we do to make it possible, overcoming the issues previously rose?
First, it was clear to us that we have to make science, synthetic biology and iGEM known! If the general brazilian public is aware of the importance of Science, Science would be better valued and maybe the government, as well as the private initiative, would be more interested on financing scientific projects.
To accomplish this, we gave lectures in educational centers. We covered, mid-school,  at city School Sócrates Mariani Bittencourt (fig 17),  and high school, Technical school and Graduation, at CEFET, a Brazilian federal educational institution subordinated to the Brazilian Ministry of Education of great reputation (Fig18).
Our lectures covered different fields in Science, highlighting their importance, and presented synthetic biology and iGEM to the students.
Even with all the problems that we faced on 2013 to participate on iGEM, here we are again.  In 2014, the challenges were still difficult to overcome. In 2015, we want that UFMG team can face a better scenario. So we worked harder at local, state, federal and continental levels to show how important it is for UFMG and other Brazilian teams to participate in such an interesting and instigating competition as iGEM. It is a great experience for the students where they can take risks in developing audacious projects which they might not be able to do during the undergrad life or in their own masters or PhDs projects. We also wanted them to acknowledge that Brazil is a country growing economically in the world scenario and should invest more in science as other developed countries do.
Local action: UFMG
.
To begin our quest to make Science and iGEM known and valued, we met with the Director of the Institute of Biological Sciences from UFMG, Dra.Andréa Mara Macedo (Fig19), who supported our team to attend to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. She was really interested in our initiative to participate in iGEM and also helped us to meet with the funding agencies which could support us.
We also got together with Pro-rector of Research of UFMG, Dra.Adelina Martha dos Reis (Fig 19), that helped with funding for iGEM teams since 2013.
In addition to financial support, these meetings assured less bureaucracy"

    After applying some specific values of parameter, we test three groups of (p0, c), we can get three figures. Specifically, three groups of inputs are (17,80) and (90, 60)
Pic 2   Predicted p(t) and g(t) result
    In the figure, blue line represents the p(t), while the red line represents g(t).    From the figure above we can clearly find that with time going by, both p(t) and g(t) will reach the maximum level and keep steady. Besides, the maximum value is c. The result is crucial to the derivation of the integrated model of light-input model and AND logic gate model.
AND Logic Gate Model
    According to the genetic circuit of AND logic gate together with the derivation of the original reference, we have proposed the following equation by the law of mass action and Michaelis-Menten Equation. We mainly focus on the process of the output part, the production of T7 and GFP.
    Here, x(t) represents the concentration of T7 RNA polymerase, y(t) represents the concentration of GFP. rx  represents the rate of production of activator protein. After our derivation, we can prove that
    where K1, K2 are the coefficient related with the concentration of T7 mRNA,  I1, I2 is relative to the concentration of two input substances(In our system, Arbc.), and r0 the rate of termination of the translation.
Integrated Model
    In the integrated model, we have constructed the system as Pic1 shows. For the reason that the light-input system we used, DPD-induced system has the same mechanism of CcaS/R system, so we use two crucial assumptions:     (1) The expression of the sfGFP, which is the output substance of the first gene circuit, was equal to the concentration of the input substance of the AND logic gate. That is, I1(t)=g(t) .     (2) The maximum value of g(t) is c(p0), and we get the function after the enough long time. That is, we take
when we calculate the steady state of y, which is the concentration of GFP as mentioned above.     Therefore, based on the equation , we can derive the following equation:

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html," we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Made 100ml stock EtBr bath and used empty tip top to hold the bath. Remember to cover in aluminum foil. 5ul EtBr/100ml ddH2O.
Since our concentrations are so low, we need to alter our gel purification protocol:
：*Remember to heat up elution buffer to 50C before use and let the binding buffer sit on the column for a few minutes, let the EtOH evaporate off too.
Try using smaller columns and eluting twice with warm elution buffer. Take the total volume you want and divide it in half. First round of elution, let the EB sit for 10min and then spin down. And then do it again. The problem with the spin column 50 tubes is that the silica is too large compared to the volume of elution going through, so DNA tends to get struck. Flow-through is probably not the problem.
Note: Gel purification does not work with 2% agarose gels
Note ON AGAROSE GELS: It’s okay to reuse agarose gels, we just need to run the sample off. They can be re-used for a few weeks. The EtBr will need to be added to the TAE buffer in the apparatus though and re-added each time.

For the PCR the standard protocol of New England Biolab has been used. For the retrieval of the vitamin b12 riboswitch out of Escherichia coli DH5alpha an annealing temperature of 66° was used and for the guanine riboswitch out of Bascillis subtilis an annealing temperature of 63°. PCR and sequencing results showed that both constructs were correctly retrieved.
Via 3A-assembly the riboswitch part and the inverter part have been assembled. This resulted in three types of colonies: white, pink and red. The correct construct should be around 2500 base pairs.
PCR amplification and sequencing results showed that the pink colonies where the correct construct.
Cloning the mite sensing system based on riboswitches
The cloning of the system has been done with the use of a 3A-assembly out of two constructs. The first part is called B/Gribo and contains the riboswitch and constitutive promoter. The second part is the inverter part, consisting out of the TetR QPI and mRFP as a reporter gene.
Figure 1. Schematic overview showing that the system has been constructed via a 3A-assembly out of two constructs: one containing the riboswitch and one containing the TetR QPI and a reporter gene.
Creating riboswitch part with PCR and special primers
A part containing the riboswitch has been created with the use of special primers that copies the correct riboswitch from genomic DNA. During the PCR, the primer added the constitutive promoter and ssRA-tag. This part has been dubbed B-ribo and G-ribo (of vitamin B12 and guanine riboswitch).
Figure 2. GRibo schematic overview
Creating the inverter part out of bio bricks
The other part of the construct is the inverter-part, containing the TetR gene, a promoter that is inhibited by TetR and the reporter gene mRFP. This part is called the Inv-part. The Inv-part has been created out of standard part BBa_p0140 and BBa_I13521 from the iGEM kit as can be seen in figure 3.
Figure 3. The BBa_p0140 part consists of a ribosome binding site, tetracycline producing gene and two terminators.  The BBa_I13521 part consists of a tetracycline inducible promoter, a ribosome binding site, a mRFP producing gene and two terminators.

Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated, and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception, or other activities (see the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams' exemplary work) - Done , we conducted several events over the course of the summer and into the semester as we educated members of the public on the ethical implications and scientific discoveries of synthetic biology. We held a Building With Biology interactive workshop over the summer with elementary school children and their parents to educate them about basic ideas in synthetic biology. We then held a forum on the ethics and implications of gene editing for society with other college students and members of the community. Finally, we created many videos outlining a curriculum in synthetic biology and are housing them on a website we created, www.learnsynbio.org. These videos are intended to introduce high school students to synthetic biology as a field of study, promoting greater literacy and understanding of the field within our society

Standard enzymatic digestion, ligation, attempted one more time, with sufficient optimization from the last two attempts. Used Chiam's electrocompetent cells, as it is suspected that ours are bad. Colonies observed, DNA harvested, digested to see if expected bands observed, sent for sequencing. Sequencing results show presence of an insert, but also include significant regions of ambiguity. Attemps made to send for sequencing on campus. Numerous improvements made to plasmid harvest protocol. Improvements made to journal and updates made to website. Skills gained in html, CSS coding. Problem with inverse PCR is discovered. The reverse primer tail was incorrectly designed and was fixed. Unfortunately, this means that virtually everything earlier than this was likely failing because of this error, which cost us a lot of time. Primer re-ordered.

We played a little game with them, which was to compete in brainstorming potential designs for biosafety. They are encouraged by this interesting part and came up with several wonderful ideas. We hope they would popularize this game and, more importantly, safety ideas.
We then introduced our project to them, including the serious environmental impacts of toxic aromatic compounds. It was the right time to emphasize the necessity of public concern and public scrutiny in environmental problems.
We also offered direct help with their experiments. We introduced gel electrophoresis, four kinds of restriction enzymes and standard assembly. At last, we showed them how to use iGEM parts and provided them with iGEM parts E0840, B0015, J23100, and J23106.
Model iGEM
In September 7th, the first Model iGEM was hosted by Peking iGEM. Eight iGEM teams joined this workshop. Focusing on inter-team communication, preparing for iGEM jamboree but not for prize, Model iGEM is a competition without competitiveness.
If you can't view this video, please click here .
We believe that interactions bring great insights. And we all think it was a really unique, fantastic experience. We hope other iGEM teams would be inspired to do the same, and Model iGEM will be continued to be hosted in the years after.
For several team members, it will be their first time to attend iGEM Asian Jamboree in this October. Model iGEM could be seen as a “drill” in advance, from presentation to poster. We wanted the competition to work like the Asian Jamboree as much as possible, in the meanwhile, promote the communication between teams. However, it was inappropriate and unnecessary to award any prize, for few teams had adequate time to get ready in early September.

Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.

We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.

Kelton and Clarice performed the PCR cleanup of a second CRO insert PCR reaction that we ran. The PCR was more successful this time - the bands were much more clearly visible, in all three of our Lambda samples (see the photo that Kelton will upload).
KP 5/10/13 Today we did a PCR cleanup on our Cro PCR products. We also set up a slow melt gel so we can try again on Monday to get a cutout of the insert in order to combine our plasmid and insert. We already have the plasmid, we just have to wait on the insert because it wasn’t visible in our first slow melt gel. Here is a picture of our second PCR product run on a 1 kb ladder gel:

KK 5/13/13 Today we ran our digested CRO insert on the low melt gel, and under the UV light we saw the band we were looking for. Clarisse excised the band and we performed a ligation reaction according to the protocol and using the vector that we had already run on a low-melt gel last Thursday. After incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature, we performed a transformation into DH5alpha. The selectable marker of pLAT is ampicillin.
KP 5/13/13 We ran our low melt gel with our Cro insert. After 45 minutes, we put the gel under UV light and cut out the insert. We then performed a ligation of our vector and cro insert. After 30 min, we did a transformation and inserted our newly ligated plasmid into DH5alpha.

KK 5/14/13 (Thursday) When we dropped by today two of our plates (out of four) were contaminated. The two contaminated plates, we noticed, were the two plates that were old. The other two plates had a few colonies, but the was not a significantly greater number of colonies in our plasmid + insert + E.Coli plate than there were in our control plasmid + E.Coli plate. Kelton went ahead and streaked the few colonies we had to singles. We can PCR-verify if any of them have the plasmid. Meanwhile I am going to redo the transformation today. I will plate 4 plates: one 50 microL test, one 100 microL test, one 50 microL control, and one 100 microL control.

Therefore we advise future iGEM team planning to do flow cytometry of FACS to (if at all possible) use mRFP as reporter rather than GFP.
Fluorescence Microscopy
The microscope used for fluorescence microscopy of the subpopulation clones is an Olympus BX41. The laser used to excite fluorophores is Excelitas Technologies X-cite series 120. A lumenera infinity 3 was used to capture the images. Steven Aalvink, technician at Wageningen UR molecular ecology, instructed me in the use of the microscope and other hardware.
May 9 - July 3:
General
Belwina, Marijn and Thomas transformed biobrick parts from the registry to home-made chemically competent DH5alpha cells. They spread the transformations on LB agar plates with antibiotics corresponding to the resistance in the backbone of each plasmid. Transformed parts (table 1). We isolated (Machery-Nagel nucleospin kit) the plasmids from liquid cultures of these transformation plates.
Table1. Biobrick transformations
July 4 - July 17:
General
We verified the length (through taq PCR) and sequence (through GATC lightrun sanger sequencing) of the biobrick isolated (May 9 - July 3) plasmid inserts. We also made -80℃ glycerol stocks for cells containing the parts.
434- and λ cI repressor operon construction
We designed primers with overhangs for amplification of biobricks in Benchling for subsequent Gibson assembly (GA) and ordered those primers from NEB: Primers designed for parts: BBa_B0015, BBa_C0052, BBa_I0500, BBa_K081007 and pSB1C3.  Primers:897 - 908.
We used primers 897 - 906 for Q5 PCR to amplify the parts for GA. We was unable to amplify pSB1C3 with the flanked primers through numerous attempts. We then realized that (because of the overhangs in the other fragments) the fragments all already contain 20 + bp overlap with each other required for GA. We chose to Q5 PCR amplify pSB1C3 with primers suffix-forward and prefix-reverse and use this PCR product with the previously mentioned PCR products for the other fragments.
We did a first attempt to Gibson assemble BBa_K"

The total NanoLuc activity is only present in bacteria that are transformed with a plasmid encoding the luciferase and there is a clear dependency of inducer concentration a detected luciferase activity. In the samples where a periplasmic extract was prepared the luciferase activity is highest in the samples of the secreted luciferase as the EspP-fused BAP-NanoLuc is attached to the cells and only proteins from lysed cells are present in the periplasmic extract. In the case of the samples where the supernatant of the cultures was analyzed the luciferase activity is present in both ""high"" induced samples.
As the luciferase activity only gave an indication for the subcellular localization of the cargo-autotransporter fusion protein, we also performed flow cytometry measurements. For this purpose the same cells were stained with app. 10 µM A3C5-Fab that was coupled to the fluorescent dye Dy634-NHS and 100 µM of the chemical compound biotin-atto488. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C, washed twice with PBS and analyzed using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD bioscience, voltages for fluorescence channels were all at 750 V).
For the channels FITC (biotin-atto488) and Dy634 (A3C5-Fab-Dy634, detected using a HeNe laser (633 nm) and a 660/20 band pass ﬁlter) the fluorescence signal was measured and mean values are given. The cells showed a homogeneious population in the FSC/SSC plot. The A3C5-Fab staining detected high signals up til a mean of over 4000 for the eMA-autotransporter dependent on the inducer concentration. For the same bacterial cells the binding of biotin-Atto488 could be confirmed as well. The single chain Avidin (scAvidin) cells showed absolutely no A3C5 signal but a low Biot"

Best of all, we have clear dead zones that show consistency with the corresponding viral dilutions. We are now ready to begin performing the Beta-galactosidase activity assay.
Week of 8/17/14 through 8/23/14
We tried again to get good results of the virus titer plaque assay. We are still getting a bit of contamination, although the growth is not bright yellow as the rest of the contamination has been. This leads us to believe that we are still using a concentration of cells that is too high. We have been using Top 10 E. coli cells with an A600 reading of ~0.400. We are now going to start using a broth culture of cells with an A600 reading of ~0.200.
Week of 8/10/14 through 8/16/14
During this week we restocked our supplies for broth and agar growth media, as we were running very low.
One of our advisers suggested we change the buffer we were using for our gel electrophoresis, and that when preparing the DNA mixture to insert into the gel, we should use buffer instead of DDI water, since this is what is present when the gel is running.
However, even after changing the buffer, we did not experience any better results. We tried a few times. First, the DNA of our parts did not show up at all. And again, our DNA ladder did not show up correctly.
Week of 8/3/14 through 8/9/14
During this week, the team realized that the contamination was coming from our stock of cells that was being kept in the -80C freezer. We have no idea how they became contaminated, seeing as continued to use the line of cells we froze for a week after we froze them, but before any contamination occurred. Nonetheless, one of our advisers has procured a new stock of top 10 E. coli cells for us to use.
After unsuccessful runs of electrophoresis gels, we have run out of DNA to try to measure. So, we took some time out this week to streak, grow, and purify lines of our K1477014 and K1477030 parts on both pSB1C3 and pSB1AT3 backbones.

Introduction
Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a technology that once revolutionized the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity.Though it works well in eukaryotic organisms, it is not available in prokaryotic organisms. We come up with the idea that the long repeating sequence of the TALEs coding sequence leads to it. In our project, we attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have a handle tool for gene editing in prokaryotic organisms.
Project
Background, hypothesis and workflow of designer TALE.
Modeling
Optimization of TALE sequence and simulation of the gene circuit.
Human Practice

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots,"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the effect of background DNA on the ability to screen for target DNA, linear DNA was added. The ssDNAp 1 was used in this experiment to target the EPO DNA while background DNA is present. The ssDNAp 1, EPO target DNA, background DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 µM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 1 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate. Again, the primer 051 was used as off-target ssDNAp. The plate was incubated at 21 ºC during 10 minutes. The visible absorption spectrum from 450 nm to 650 nm of the solutions was measure and the ratio 620/520 nm was calculated for analysis. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The plate view, relevant absorption spectra and ratio 620/520 nm is shown.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Indigoidine_-_-_TEXT.html," transformed cells. Except for NEB Turbo cells, all transformed host strains displayed a decelerated growth and significantly smaller colonies on plate when compared to the negative control. The blue phenotype developed late after transformation ranging from first blue colonies after 24 h and taking up to three days for visible poduction of the blue pigment. NEB Turbo showed regular colony growth and developed a strong blue phenotype upon induction with IPTG. As all host strains were able to express the functional indigoidine sythetase derived from a different species, further experiments were only conducted with one E. coli strain. Due to its simplicity in handling and sufficient expression of the constructs, the substrain TOP10 was chosen.
Improved Production of Indigoidine by Co-transformation of Host Strain with Supplementary PPTases
The expression of indC under activation by endC was sufficient for easy detection of indigoidine production on plates harboring indC-carrying cells. In order to determine, whether the amount of indigoidine production in the E. coliTOP10 cells is dependent on the quality of the interacting of indC with the PPTase, four PPTase dervied from varying origins were selected and amplified from the genome of the hosts of origin. E. coliTOP10 cells were co-transformed with plasmids coding for the different PPTases and the plasmid containing the expression cassette for indC. As reference for the endogenous PPTase activity served cells only transformed with the indC plasmid. Irrespective of the PPTase, growth of colonies was retarded. Remarkably however, colonies co-transformed with the PPTase plasmid remained of smaller size than the ones only carrying the indC construct. On the other side, indigoidine production was more diffuse in the latter cells with secretion of the blue pigment into the agar (Figure 6b, indC) and only slight blue-greenish coloring of the colonies. The four PPTases additionally introduced into the TOP10 cells were all shown to be functional (blue phenotype of the transformants, Figure 6b), but lead to the retention of most of the indigoidine within the cells. Colonies of cells transformed with thess constructs, were of convex shape and of distinct, dark blue color. Overall, cells carrying an additional PPTase showed increased indigoidine production compared to the cells relying on the endogenous entD.

ECOL the laccase from E. coli degraded 6.7 % estradiol and none of the used ethinyl estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % of estradiol but no ethinyl estradiol. The laccase TTHL from Thermus thermophilus degraded 29.5 % of estradiol and 9.8 % ethinyl estradiol. The original concentrations of substrates were 2 µg per approach. (n = 4)
The results of the reactions of the laccases with addition of ABTS are shown in Figure 29. The experimental set ups were the same as the reaction approach without ABTS described above. The X-axis displays the different tested laccases. On the Y-axis the percentages of degraded estradiol (blue) and ethinyl estradiol (red) are shown.  The degradation was measured at t0 and after five hours of incubation at 20 °C. The negative control showed no degradation of estradiol. 6.8 % of ethinyl estradiol was decayed. The positive control TVEL0 is able to degrade 100 % estradiol and ethinyl estradiol. The laccase BPUL (from Bacillus pumilus) degraded 46.9 % of used estradiol after ten minutes incubation. ECOL  was able to degrade 6.7 % estradiol. BHAL degraded 46.9 % estradiol. With TTHL (laccase from Thermus thermophilus) a degradation 29.5 % were determined.
Immobilization
Figure 30: The percentage of laccases immobilized to CPC-Beads. 99 % of ECOL, 97 % of BPUL and 79 % of BHAL and TTHL laccases were bound to the beads.
Figure 30 shows the percentage of laccases bound after incubation with CPC-beads, relative to the original concentration. The concentration of laccases in the supernatant after incubation was measured using Roti®-Nanoquant. The results showed that only 3% of BPUL laccases was still present in the supernatant. This illustrates that BPUL was successfully immobilized on the CPC-beads.

Antimicrobial gauze ( Top )
As an alternative to our Bacto-Aid, our hybrid silk could be used as an antimicrobial gauze. The gauze could then be used for larger wounds and for wounds producing a lot of fluids. The fluids was a problem that Laura Jakobsen made us aware of, and the gauze could be a way of solving this. An addition to this idea would be to dip the gauze into the analgesic Ibumetin.
Soft implants ( Top )
Soft implants have been subject of interest the last couple of years. Here it has been suggested that spider silk could be braided in a structure and grafted to the bone Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. . This would allow quicker healing of the bone and ensure the creation of proper bone structure.
Nerve scaffolds made of spider silk have likewise shown great potential. Usually bigger motor neurons will not regenerate if degraded or cut. Silk as nerves, could lead to the gain of motoric activity in extremities that could otherwise not be regained after major accidents Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. .
Some types of silk have great mechanical strengths and they can therefore be used as an artificial ligament or tendon. The combination of silk with stem cells could allow cells to proliferate and differentiate into the proper type of cells. This could potentially make tendons and ligaments heal, a thing that does not occur naturally Li, G., et al. (2015). ""Silk-based biomaterials in biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants."" Adv Healthc Mater, 4, 1134-51. .
Textiles made from silk ( Top )
Silk could be used as a textile for surgeons or for patients with skin disorders. The spider silk is compatible with today’s sterilization process, making it possible to use silk for different forms of medical interventions. Already existing silk products have shown good results towards reducing the reaction of the disease in question Li, G., et al. (2015).

July 27 - Harriet Fitzgerald
Harriet Fitzgerald is a PhD student at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research. While visiting MIT, Fitzgerald met with our team to discuss the proper tissue culture conditions our endometrial cells should be grown under. It was at this meeting that we discovered that our cells should be grown in media with charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS). Our initial experiments with the estrogen responsive promoters indicated that there was some unknown source of basal expression. We learned that standard FBS contains trace amounts of different hormones, including progesterone and estrogen. The charcoal stripped FBS eliminates this problem and decreased the basal activation of our estrogen responsive promoters. Through our discussion with Fitzgerald, our team also concluded that the induction of estrogen, specifically estradiol, should occur 24 hours after transient transfection was performed. These culturing conditions are also applicable to our final procedure to implement our diagnostic tool in an endometrial biopsy."

However, I agree that the market should be discussed separately as Xie Shiyu in Fudan University has written in his book Game Theory in Economics [22] so we will start by building the outline in which the phrase ``market failure'' stands.

Tsinghua,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#md_-_-_TEXT.html," the sorting results, compared with correct decisions and calculated the Accuracy Rate. The low overlap of optimal networks indicate adaption to DNA copy number.

Further Analysis -- Functional Motifs
After the verification, we made some attempts to summarize the core motifs of these selected optimal networks that are to the benefits of adaptation. Moreover, we wished to figure out the significant characters of these motifs and a general rule of constructing adaptive networks. We noticed that the optimal network contains some basic regulatory modules besides the 3 core topologies we have screened out. Most of the rather functional and robust networks are combinations of these regulatory modules. So we listed them and discussed their effect intensity to saturation and adaptation with further simulation.
We ranked all 111 networks that show adaptation to copy number and classified them into 10 groups. Each group represents networks containing certain core topology structures – motifs above. So we arranged the core motifs according to their appearing frequency in robust and adaptive networks.
We found that more than half of the 111 adaptive networks contain the core motif of IBA Feedforward, and very high portion of networks with best ranking also contain this motif. Both clues indicate that IBA Feedforward is an optimal network. Beside, AO Mutual-Inhibition also exists in most best-ranking networks, which shows that AO Mutual-Inhibition contributes to adaptation to DNA copy number.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B,"

The rationale behind using the fimE gene instead offimB is that it permanently inverts the promoter region meaning weak induction signals can be amplified by the Fim switch.
Table 1: Table of parts used for constructing the Fim Switch.
Implementation
To assemble the Fim switch part the isothermal Gibson assembly cloning method was chosen as it would significantly shorten the time taken to assemble 3 separate sequences compared to traditional cloning methods.  The 3 gBlock DNA fragments shown in (Table 1) were amplified by high fidelity Q5 PCR and the pSB1C3 backbone was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI.
Figure 2: High fidelity PCR amplification of the 3 gBlock fragments for assembly of the Fim Switch.  The gBlock-1 amplification is shown in lanes 1+2 (819 bp), gBlock-2 amplification is shown in lanes 3+4 (1148 bp) and the gBlock-3 amplification is shown in lanes 5+6 (939bp).
The Gibson assembly reaction re-forms the iGEM prefix and suffix regions at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the Fim switch part making the component biobrick compatible while leaving no scarring regions.  Following assembly, the plasmid was transformed into chemically competent DH5α E. coli and colonies patched onto LB Chloramphenicol agar plates.  A single patch showed the correct red colour indicative of the eforRed chromoprotein (see Figure 3).
Figure 3: Patches of the Fim Switch transformants.  Patch number 6 shows the correct red colour which indicates expression of the eforRed chromoprotein.
The red patch was cultured in LB chloramphenicol overnight and the plasmid DNA extracted by miniprep.  The plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI.  The image in Figure 4 shows the DNA bands from the digested Fim switch plasmid.

The construct above displays the proof of concept T7 LacZ switch and trigger. The switch consists of T7 promoter, a strong constitutive promoter, along with LacZ as the reporter gene. The trigger was cloned into a high copy plasmid while the switch was cloned into a low copy plasmid to ensure the replication of two different plasmids for the E. coli cell to produce proportional amounts.
Lambert iGEM used sequences and DNA shared from the Styczynski Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology to build a T7, Toehold, LacZ switch to be applied as a biosensor. We tested the Biobricked T7 Toehold LacZ Switch BBa_K2550000, the Biobricked T7 Trigger Sequence BBa_K2550001 T7 Toehold LacZ Switch obtained from GATech, and the pSB6A1 T7 Trigger on Luria broth plates with chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, and Xgal antibiotic resistance.

(Top right) Biobricked Trigger Sequence BBa_K2550001 transformed on chloramphenicol antibiotic resistance. (Bottom left) pSB6A1 T7 Toehold LacZ Switch transformed on chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, and Xgal. (Bottom right) Dual plasmid with biobricked toehold sequence and trigger sequence.
The dual plasmid transformation using the pSB6A1 trigger and biobricked toehold was successful. Since the blue expression was only evident on the dual plasmid plate and not on the plate that contained the toehold, the trigger is successful in inducing LacZ gene expression.
The transformations of the biobricked toehold construct were unsuccessful because they produced a blue color. The blue might be a result of the orthogonal switch not binding as expected or a result of overexpression from a too strong promoter. Since the trigger sequence was not transformed with the construct, the colonies should appear white as the toehold only reveals the RBS and starting sequence of LacZ when the trigger sequence. This could be due to a leaky expression of LacZ under the strong T7 promoter. The dual plasmid transformation confirmed that neither the biobricked trigger nor the biobricked"
Duke,2010,Team:Duke#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," us to synthesize combinatorical gene libraries of codon variants, and then characterize each variant's effect on gene expression. We hope that this would allow for a user to generate a library gfp fusion protein, and pick from a database of empirically determined gene expression levels. This would allow for the possibility of 'tunable gene expression levels'.
Design
Genes are composed of tri-nucleotide codons, each translating an amino acid. Each amino acid has redundant codons. It is acknowledged that optimal codons help achieve increased protein expression levels. We are generating many combinatorial codon orientations in order to modulate or improve a protein's expression level for specific design constraints.
A laboratory DNA synthesizer was used for degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis of gene fragments. By substituting a random base pair every third base pair in the sequence, a library of codon variants is generated. Using circular polymerase extension cloning ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Duke ), these libraries are transformed into bacterial colonies.
We chose GFP (BBa_K411237) and LacZ (BBa_E0033) to analyze gene expression. GFP is green fluorescent under blue light excitation, and LacZ protein reacts with X-Gal substrate, turning blue.
A flatbed scanner and camera platform were used to obtain time lapse expression information from LacZ and GFP expressing E. coli colonies in solid culture.
Image analysis techniques were used to efficiently and automatically extract, evaluate, and correlate growth and expression information. CellProfiler was used to identify bacterial colonies. A mixture-of-Gaussian automatic thresholding method was used. Gene expression is correlated with pixel intensity. This way, expression data can be obtained. Colonies can then be picked for further analysis or sequencing.
Verification
The following half time distributions illustrate the differences between populations of E. coli expressing  LacZ.

NDM: Nanomachine Detecting                                 Microbiotics
Abusing antibiotics has caused severe antibiotics contamination and resistance issues                                 worldwide. Therefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with an optical interference path,                                 recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural                                 water bodies. In NDM, there is a system for measurement: CACCI which contains chemotaxis                                 modified bacterial adhered to a polymer membrane.

Antibiotics, or microbiotics, in narrow sense, are a various type of artificially                                 constructed or naturally existing chemicals containing the capability of killing                                 bacteria or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespread around the                                 world. Patients who got bacterial or protozoan infection from surgical wound like war                                 field, empyrosis and previously regarding severe diseases such as general cold,                                 tuberculosis(TB), sexual transmitted diseases(STD), dysentery, anthrax, even cancer and                                 so forth are able to cure treating with antibiotic substances. Since the discovery of                                 penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has                                 been enlarged a lot. With properly administration of antibiotics, millions of people                                 were saved in evidently alleviated symptom. There was a time when antibiotics, along                                 with oil source for automobile, was indispensable for human beings.
Antibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibit                                 bacterial growth in their own ways. Those mechanisms including:
Inhibit the synthesis of cell wall.
Influence the function of cell membrane.
Inhibit the biosynthesis of nucleic acid.
Inhibit the biosynthesis of proteins.

We agreed that we are not thinking constantly about this durning lab work. By doing a lot of lab practice during last years we are able to follow the rules properbly and work in the lab safely. Follwoing up teh rules is a habit now.
How important is Biosafety to you and which grad would you give it. Grading between 0 and 10?
0 means not important at all, 10 means vey very important. The ranking was: 3, 10, 8, 8, 10, 8, 9. Average grade is: 8, this means that we as team in genera; do care about biosafety and find it important.
Biosafety in the lab
Week 33
Who should be  respponsible for safety and security in the lab?
Who should be responssible for security? In the organisation there is a hirarchie which explains who is responsibble for safety in the organization. In case there is a big accident in the lab these persons are responsible.
Who should be responssible fo the safety? We, our selfs, are responsible for the safety in the lab. We should be watching what we are doing in the lab.
Who should be liable in case of emergency? In case an accident happens while the lab workersare follow up the rules, as they should do. the person who granded the permition should be liable.
Communication
week 36
Is it important/usefull to inform the public about our work?
Yes, it is important to inform teh public about our work, as scientists.
Why is this usefull/important?
The information flow is at the moment as this: Scientist---->Journalist---->Public. Maybe it will be better when scientists also play a direct role in informing the public. Issues could easly be misunderstandend and represented differently by media, because of the lake of knowledge. Scientific work also needs funding and in general this scientific work is funded by public money, so it is important to inform them about the goals for which this public money is used.
What should our communicationgoal be as scientists?(to inform, to ask more attention, increase the public conception)?
Our goal should be informing teh public. It is not correct to hide information, we should clearly inform the public about the facts. We will not be able to explain all details, but we for sure are able to explain the main lines. Its is also important to clearly inform about the poss"

These same methods were supposed to be used to create the Violacein construct with and without amphiphilic fusions, but due to the time constraints, we weren’t able to assemble any of our Violacein Plasmids.
Continuous Production
The project is based on research done by Pauli Kallio et al. from the University of Turku. In the article, it was proposed that the propane producing capacity could be also tested with continuous production where the cells are grown until the steady state is achieved. Furthermore, when scaling up to industrial processes, reactor fermentation with continuous state would be commercially the best solution. Flowing product gas would be easily gathered and not disturb microbes' population sizes needed for this scale.
The steady state will be maintained with the regular feed of fresh media into a chemostat while the outline will continuously remove the same amount of media with products. Thus, the growth rate can be readily controlled by changing the diluting speed of media. Kallio's team were kind to send us their E. coli strain BL21 (DE3 ΔyjgB ΔyqhD, pET-TPC4 + pCDF-cAD + pACYC-Fdx-Fpr) which produces propane with the reaction pathway utilizing the intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis and enzymes like FASII and Tes4. Onwards from the butyrate, the reaction pathway’s enzymes are similar to our reactions'. The strain has already been cultivated on a bench scale using an Erlenmeyer flask.
Figure 10.Chemostat reactor with feed- and outline
Because the strain BL21 (DE3 ΔyjgB ΔyqhD, pET-TPC4 + pCDF-cAD + pACYC-Fdx-Fpr) produces propane only by inducing with IPTG instead of constitutive production, certain limitations are met when designing the chemostat conditions. Cultivating microbes with a maximum capacity would consume too much IPTG which is quite a valuable reagent, as a diluting rate needs to be high. Therefore, instead of exploring the maximum yield by adding abundantly IPTG, the chemostat will be used for investigating how the environmental conditions affect the product formation. The most simple way to do this is to wait until the steady state is achieved without any induction and then add IPTG. To see how change of process conditions affects the cell density, OD600 is measured all the time.
The overall media volume of chemostat will be 500 ml due to the limit of the IPTG amount."

How to work with Bacillus subtilis vectors
Many vectors for Bacillus subtilis are integrating into the genome, so do all but one that we provide to the registry.
There are some features in B. subtilis vectors that have to be taken into account, while working with them.
Cloning in E.coli
Linearisation before B. subtilis transformation
Verification of integration
Pre-Cloning in E. coli
The cloning, that means the insertion of your part into the multiple cloning site of a vector, is done by normal ligations and E. coli. However, since the B. subtilis vectors are quite large, the cloning works best if only one insert is inserted. You could try to finish your construct in e.g. pSB1C3 and then clone it into the B. subtilis vector. For convenience, all vectors carry an RFP with promoter and terminator which is substituted by your insert during the ligation.
All our vectors carry the bla gene that mediates Ampicillin resistance (100 µg/ml) in E. coli. Also, they all have two recombination sites for integration into the B. subtilis genome. In between those recombination sites, there is the multiple cloning site and a resistance marker for B. subtilis.
(Some vectors from other working groups do not carry an extra E. coli resistance, so the B. subtilis resistance is also used in E. coli but with lower antibiotic concentrations. There is also the possibility of single-crossover plasmids which do also work fine,"

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

rrnB P1
Previous studies have shown that the rrnB P1 promoter is downregulated by ppGpp[1]. That is why we decided to use this promoter as the stress sensing promoter in the stress sensor. A version of rrnB P1 already existed in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This version was made by the Berkeley iGEM team in 2008.
PCR products from rrnB P1 BioBrick separated on 1.5 % agarose. The marked products represent rrnB P1 with regular pre/sufix
The BioBrick that the Berkeley team made is in BBb format . This means that the BioBrick is flanked by a prefix and a suffix that is different from the ones that are normally used. Therefore, this BioBrick was initially not compatible with the other BioBricks we were planning to use in our construct, as all the other BioBricks we planned to use were in BBa format.
To deal with this problem, the rrnB P1 promoter was amplified using PCR. The original promoter made by the Berkeley iGEM team was used as template DNA. To make the amplified brick compatible with the rest of our construct, the standard prefix and suffix was added to our primers.
When we amplified the promoter, we amplified both the whole brick (rrnB P1) and only the assumed promoter sequence (proL). Primers for both amplifications are given below:

1) Meetup with Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
On March 10th, we invited Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo to Kyoto and exchanged opinions about each other's projects and how to proceed with iGEM activities. We specifically discussed the organizational framework of iGEM, fund-raising, human Practices and collaboration activities.
By taking advantage of their large number of members, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo established several departments for a division of work. They have a department specialized in a collaboration which is a strategy our team had not considered. This was a good example for efficient management of team organization.
We also talked about the financial support strategies of each team, such as how we started cloud funding, and they explained to us how they were raising money.
Interestingly, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo has only participated in iGEM twice so they were not sure how to meet all the standard iGEM criteria. Therefore, from our past experience attending iGEM competitions, we taught them how to interpret the criteria and design their project. For example, they were conducting science experiments for junior high and high school students so as to meet the criteria of “Education & Public Engagement” but they did not incorporate synthetic biology concepts, nor their specific project. We advised them that their Public Engagement will improve by taking in more lectures and doing practical work with DNA.
Finally, as they were having trouble looking for opportunities for collaboration, we told them about the existence of the “Meetup” page and suggested attending the Asia Conference. It was exciting to interact with other Japanese teams through our iGEM activities.
Thank you, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo!!!

TU_Eindhoven,2014,Team:TU Eindhoven#Achievements#Submitted Parts#COMPy_-_-_TEXT.html," for INP’s surface displaying properties. Therefore INP was truncated, retaining only the N- (179 aa) and C-termini (49 aa) to create INPNC. The C-terminal domain is displayed on the cell surface, while the N-terminal domain remains in the outer membrane.
Gene Design
Figure 1. Gene design of COMPy.
The protein has a TAG codon and HA-tag added at the C-terminus of the protein. The TAG codon is for the incorporation of an unnatural amino acid. With the proper tRNA synthetase any Non Natural Amino Acid can be incorporated into the protein and displayed on the membrane. The HA-tag was used for characterization of the protein. Both modifications have been made by using an overhang primer. After the modification the protein has been renamed to Clickable Outer Membrane Protein y (COMPy).
We as team TU Eindhoven 2014 state that we have improved the functionality and “ease of use” of BioBrick part: BBa_K811005 . The functionality has been improved by adding the TAG. This allows the incorporation of any non-natural amino acid. The “ease of use” has been improved by the introduction of a HA-tag to the protein. This tag makes it a lot easier to screen whether or not the protein is expressed using fluorescent anti-HA antibodies.
Characterization
Team TU Eindhoven 2014 tried to create a membrane anchor to which molecules could covalently bind. With this protein it is possible to bind anything to the membrane by using a bio-orthogonal “click” reaction. To test the functionality of the protein several assays were done.
For all the assays we used the following vectors pET29a(+) COMPy (Membrane Protein) and pEVOL-PylT-2xTyrRS. (tRNA, tRNA synthetase). Both vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) strain. Colonies of this transformation were grown LB. After culturing glycerol stocks were made. All the assays were done by culturing the bacteria from this glycerol stock. Check our Protocol Page for all the protocols of TU Eindhoven 2014.
Figure 2. COMPy labeled with Anti-HA antibody.
Antibody Confirmation
First assay done was to confirm that the protein was expressed on the membrane. This was done by adding an anti-HA antibody labeled with TAMRA dye to bacteria in solution that had been expressing COMPy. The bacteria were then analyzed with FACS. Results show that COMPy is expressed on the membrane of the bacteria ( Figure"

Polyketide Synthesis
Overview
In this project, we propose that DNA coding for polyketide synthase   domains can be standardized and reconstructed to generate chimeric   polyketide synthases that produce new-to-nature polyketides, through   which we can dramatically expand the library of antibiotic candidates.   In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we conducted   “proof of concept” experiments to synthesize a simple polyketide—  triketide lactone 1B—using a truncated erythromycin-producing   polyketide synthase assembled with biobricks constructed by   standardizing essential domains required for the synthesis of the   triketide lactone. The domains we standardized are the loading domain,   domains of DEBS1 and the thioesterase (TE) domain from DEBS3 (Fig. 1).   The loading domain is required for the direct loading of propionyl-CoA   to form a starter unit for triketide lactone. DEBS1 is a large   multifunctional polypeptide composed of two modules that incorporate   (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to form extender units. The TE domain catalyzes   the intramolecular cyclization of the triketide to form the target   triketide lactone. [1]The target product is expected to be detected   and identified from the culture broth.
Design
Candidate selection
Biosynthesis of polyketides like erythromycin, tacrolimus and many   others are guided by modular PKS genes. These genes encode large   enzymes consisting of modules of domains, forming an ""assembly line""   to extend the ketide units to form"

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate"
KIT-Kyoto,2013,Team:KIT-Kyoto#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," isoamyl alcohol. To compare the production of isoamyl acetate, we carried out a bioassay using Drosophila because Drosophila favors the fruit odor like isoamyl acetate. [1]
After the addition of IPTG and isoamyl acetate, the culture was impregnated into the filter and placed in a case containing 10 Drosophilas. We monitored the behavior of Drosophila.
This is the result. After 1 hour, 7 flies gathered to the ATF2. These results clearly indicate that ATF2 produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
4,The comparison of the ability of ATF1 and ATF2
In addition, according to the previous study [2], the ability of ATF2 protein to produce isoamyl acetate in yeast is higher than that of ATF1 protein.
It is known that both ATF1 and ATF2 protein are involved in producing isoamyl acetate.
In 2006, MIT iGEM team submitted ATF1 coding sequence. (BBa_J45006) Our new part, ATF2 coding sequence, fall under the category of the improvement of function existing BioBrick Part, BBa_J45006. Herewith, our team, KIT-Kyoto 2013 iGEM team, meets the additional requirements for a Gold Medal.

Final System
Our Sensor
The goal of our project this summer was to design a biosensor to rapidly identify cattle known as super-shedders. We are building a DNA-based biosensor as it is more reliable and cheaper than a protein-based sensor; antibodies would raise the cost of our system and the proteins that they target can get degraded during the sample preparation, whereas DNA is much more stable. A DNA-based sensor also enabled us to target a broader range of harmful E.coli (EHEC). Over the span of our project, the design of our system was influenced by our conversations with industry stakeholders . Their feedback revealed three design considerations which we would have to incorporate into our prototype. First, it would have to be cheap so that it could be scaled-up to entire feedlot or processing operation. Second, it would have to be easy to use by non-laboratory employees in the field. And third, it would have to provide a definitive measure of E.coli shedding levels within an hour to be used during routine check-up procedures or pre-processing. Our solution is the
FerriTALE strip assay. We are using TALEs as detectors for the target DNA. Our detector is coupled with a reporter, Prussian Blue Ferritin or β-lactamase, to give a rapid colourimetric output. To couple our detector to our reporter, we are making use of synthetic coiled coils to allow in vitro assembly. In order to increase the specificity of our system we have made use of two FerriTALEs, a mobile FerriTALE reporter and an immobilized FerriTALE scaffold (no reporter ability).
