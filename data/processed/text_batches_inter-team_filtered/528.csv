Education and Public Engagement
Within iGEM Wageningen, we attach great value to involving the public in our project. This is why we participated in several educational projects and presented our project at multiple conferences, meetings, and on various websites and in magazines. This way, we informed all the different target audiences, from children and citizens to students and scientists, about our project and synthetic biology. Moreover, we organized a Benelux iGEM meetup to connect all iGEM teams in The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in a meaningful way. Information about this meetup can be found here .
Education
The relatively new field of synthetic biology raises many ethical concerns. Especially when people are, for example, not educated properly about the opportunities and risks it can raise.
During other public engagement projects (see below) we engaged and informed the general public about our project, synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. However, in the activities listed in the next section we took it a step further: from informing to educating and engaging in one-on-one conversation.
Quantified Self
We collaborated with Wageningen University & Research students following the course “Quantified Self: Monitoring Dietary Behaviour”. In this course the students had to apply the idea of a quantified self (QS) to an existing project. We followed lectures on the topic of QS, to gain more insight into the topic after which we showed the students our project and progress so far. We informed them about our goals and the developed device. They"

Third , to have deeping know and interest in the synthetic biology of junior middle school students , high school students , we design for half a year's gene discovery project practice for their , from theory to practice to help and guide them to form a group and to finish  research of their interested , and recommend excellent team to participate in the iGEM competition. charge a fee to each student , get enough income, help project continues to grow.
The three parts continuously promote each other, as the primary stage of public synthetic science , can bring a lot of students for project, Can help Chinese students understanding of life science at an early age, and for the subsequent order, high order training in screening to attract more students. As an intermediate stage of synthetic biology learning, connect order and high order, provide learning opportunities for  more interested in students with further , also for advanced screening of students.
As a higher stage of synthetic biology project practice, to really interested in synthetic biology students experience the real biological scientific research process in advance, excellent teams to participate in the iGEM competition, also bring great help for the project brand.
three stages of activities to promote each other,and bring more revenue and profit, also let Geneprobe brand value is bigger, the project that promote the development and practice of our mission - to help Chinese 100 million students understand contact synthetic biology, and help students of really interested in synthetic biology can as soon as possible into the synthetic biology research to explore, to a great contribution to the development of human beings.
Our program can also cooperate with many education institutions, because our project will gather many students who interested in synthetic biology, gene engineering and life science , can get a certain number of advertising revenue.
Pitched our idea to investors and received money
We have received 30,000RMB from GUANGZHOU OUYU EDUCATION INFORMATION CONSULTING CO.,LTD and 20,000RMB from Guangzhou Gran Education Technology Company.
Minimum viable product and customers
With the help of SCUT-China, we successfully designed a serious of lessons and held the offline activities at school.
There are 36 students took part in our first experiment activity. We introduced the laboratory and apparatus of biology to them and taught them the safety of the laboratory. Finally, they were able to do the genetic modified experiment and we received our first cash flow. There were 25 students took part in the lesson and each of them were charged ￥498. We receive "

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"ding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Human Legal_-_-_TEXT.html," second document is the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety , an international agreement that seeks to establish guidelines for the safe release of GMOs without harming biodiversity.
The articles that are relevant to our project are summarised below together with our approaches to make sure we comply with these rules.
The Rio declaration on environment and development
This is a document that was produced at the 1992 UN Earth Summit and it consists of 27 principles for sustainable development.
Figure 1. Early compound testing at Syngenta (picture by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Article 15 - Precautionary principle
Those who wish to implement a technology are the ones who are required to prove that it is safe. In other words, the burden of proof rests with those who wish to use the new technology, and should not rely on others to test the product safety after it has been implemented. One specific part of this article is very interesting in regards to our project:
""In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation""
This part highlights the extreme importance of preserving the environment and as such supports the purpose of our project. While we could argue that this may justify release of our bacteria without full safety testing in cases of extreme desertification, we think that this section also relates to the conservation of natural ecosystems. Without appropriate environmental and toxicological testing we could never ensure that this would definitely be the case and we want to ensure that our project has a beneficial effect on the environment and naturally occurring ecosystems are preserved and protected rather than degraded. During our trip to Syngenta , we learned how such testing can be done (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).
Figure 2. Safety testing at Syngenta (picture by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Article 17 - Environmental impact assessments
There is a need for a thorough assessment of the possible impact that a project might have upon the environment in terms of all natural, social and economic aspects. As far as possible, we have made a formal assessment of the impact that our project will have on the environment if implemented. Our efforts can be read on the Ecology and Implementation sub-pages of the Human Practice section.
Article 22 - Indigenous peoples have a vital role
The cultural practices of the indigenous populace need to be taken into account when implementing a project.
We have tried to take this into consideration when we drafted the implementation plan"

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Write Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", we can simulate these and find out the dynamics.
Simulation basically means solving the differential equations to get the variation of the component (mRNA, protein) with time. This can be done by hand for the equations above. However, as models get more complex, implicit equations appear, which are much more difficult to solve by hand. Thus, it is essential to get the hang of modelling software such as MATLAB or R, which solve differential equations and simulate the model for a specified period of time.
Thus, we write down the model on MATLAB here, and simulate it for a time period of 200 time units. The values of the constants used for alpha, gamma etc and the MATLAB code for the same can be found on the github library link given below. The plot obtained is as follows -
Changing the parameters for production and degradation rates can give different kinds of graphs, and can be explored by simply changing the values of alpha, gamma, K etc in the model and simulating the same. However, as we can see here, the mRNA and protein levels both rise to a certain fixed value. This is known as the steady state value.
However, we can make a further simplification in this model. Generally, the mRNA dynamics are faster than the protein dynamics. This means that mRNA levels approach their steady state value faster than proteins do. Therefore, we can say make the assumption and further simplification that before the protein dynamics start to come into play, the date of change of mRNA is zero. This is known as the “quasi steady state assumption”.
Therefore at steady state,
Thus,
Now, we can replace the value of [mRNA] in equation (2) with the value given above, to get -
We can now try to simulate and plot the graph for the protein levels, and compare the time series of the two models -
Therefore, we can see that by making the assumption that mRNA is already at steady state at the start of time, the protein levels begin to rise faster than the earlier model. However, the steady state value for protein remains the same. This is because we have only simplified the model by changing the time scale and assuming that at the given time scale, mRNA dynamics are at steady state. We have not changed the steady state per se.

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," while the latter ones are the concentrations at the equilibrium state. To further expound this idea, we present the three major chemical reactions in the rhizospheric system.
\[ \begin{align}& \ce{M^2+ + pro <=> pro(M^2+)} \\ & \ce{H+ + pro <=> pro(H+)} \\ & \ce{MN + 2H+ -> H2N + M^2+}                 \end{align}                 \]
The reaction equations written above are highly schematic. $M^{2+}$ represents a typical type of heavy metal ion like $Pb^{2+}$. $pro$ stands for a heavy-metal-binding protein like MBP. $N$ is a general anion which combines with $M^{2+}$ to form insoluble salt. The first reaction is the binding process of heavy metal ions and proteins. From the literature provided by FAFU, we learned that when pH is low, hydrogen ions compete with heavy metal ions for protein binding sites, hence the second reaction. We assume one binding site of ions for each protein molecule. The third reaction captures the PSB’s ability of secreting organic acids into the soil to release heavy metals from their insoluble forms. We denote the equilibrium constants of these equations by $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$. We assume that temperature remains mostly stable in our simulation, which makes $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$ constant over time.
From our analysis in the overview, we can see that the external influences that can change the balance of this chemical system are the absorption of $M^{2+}$ of the plants, the display and degradation of $pro$, and the increase of $H^+$ brought about by PSB. The change of the concentrations of other reactants is an indirect result from the chemical balance shift. The mixture of external influences and internal balance shifts brings much difficulty to our analysis.
To address this problem, we noticed that at our scale of study which is typically in hours, the chemical reactions are comparatively microscopic, meaning that the system can be viewed as in equilibrium at all times. We can therefore imagine an “initial” state for every equilibrium state and separate the analysis of the chemical process and that of the external changes. With the help of $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$, we can also get a one-to-one map between the “initial” states and the equilibrium states.

Background
The xylose inducible promoter BBa_K733018 was of interest to our group as a means to control expression of a toxin that would function as a counter-selective marker for marker free integration of large pieces of DNA into Bacillus subtilis. Our idea was to use it to select for transfer of the 40.8kb tyrocidine operon from Brevibacillus parabrevis to Bacillus subtilis. The limitation of this repressor and promoter control system is that, as in E. coli, the repressor is leaky [1]. When used as a control for expression of toxins, it is necessary that the repressor is tight. Bhavsar et al. identified an alternative xylose inducible promoter from Bacillus subtilis W23 that showed tighter repression in Bacillus subtilis than the promoter from B. megaterium (BBa_K733018). Lin et al. used this improved repressor to control expression of the native E. coli toxin in Bacillus subtilis. Using this system, they were able to do marker-less gene deletions. We investigated the repressor activity in E. coli with the intention of using it for selecting for transfer of large gene clusters.
Experimental Design and Methods
We designed three different xylose inducible promoter constructs. The optimized B. subtilis repressor binding site in the promoter sequence was either replaced downstream of BBa_K733018 or the promoter sequence of BBa_K733018 was deleted. (Note: Two different size deletions were tested). Sequence for the optimized promoter was obtained from Lin et al. (part of sequence for mini-mazF cassette, ) and ordered as a gblock.

II. CR2 Gag-Prot-RT DH5-a Transformation
Purpose: To ligate the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT into pET-14b vector which will then be used to transform into DH5-α for future experimentation and long-term storage of the plasmid.
Attributions: The initial colony PCRs for verification of inserts were performed by Ryan Shontell. Troubleshooting and colony PCR for verification of CR2 Gag-Prot-Rt was performed by Gina Watanabe and Emily Yang. Initial sequencing using the T7 forward and reverse primers were performed by Ryan Shontell. Later sequencing performed using T7 and internal primers ordered from IDT were performed by Gina Watanabe. Analysis of all sequences was performed by John Banasihan, Ryan Shontell, Jonathan Tello, and Dr. Gernot Presting.
Materials and Methods: Our transformation protocol began with a double-digestion of a pET-14b vector using BamH1 and NcoI NEB-HF restriction enzymes in preparation for ligation. We then proceeded to ligate our CR2 Gag-Prot-RT insert into the now digested vector. We then used DH5-α competent cells, a pUC19 vector as our control and the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT ligated vector (2-fold TE dilution) to transform into the DH5-α competent cells. The DH5-α cells that grew on the antibiotic agar were then used for a colony PCR.
BLASTN was used to determine whether internal priming of would occur between the CR constructs and the T7 Forward and T7 Reverse primers. It was determined that no significant lengths of the primers would be able to anneal; however, there was the potential for extension of smaller PCR products due to partial annealing.
After running our colony PCR products on an agarose gel we saw that the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT bands were not very strong. We later optimized the PCR parameters by decreasing the annealing temperature from 65°C to 55°C and increasing the extension time. These changes are seen in Figure 3.
After this optimization of the PCR parameters the CR2 Gag-Prot-RT from figures 1, 2, and 3 were sent in for"

Paris_Bettencourt,2014,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Newsletter2_-_-_TEXT.html," the construction of a translator from     GoldenBraid (the assembly system we are using) to Biobricks,     so future iGEM teams can use our modules in Biobricks format.     A specific promoter for glandular trichomes is a few steps away     from being tested in plants and depending on the results, new     approaches will be used. The design of our cooper-activated     genetic switch is complete and we are waiting for the parts to     arrive so we can start building it.
We are also having some difficulties amplifying a gene we want     to introduce into our system to produce an extra pheromone.     Hopefully we will solve these problems soon so we can enrich the     #SexyPlant with even more features. Please summon the demons     of the failed PCRs and make them stop annoying us.
We started a collaboration with NRP-UEA-Norwich team to create     a common biosafety module, since both of our teams are working     in N benthamiana. Our biosafety module will have a male sterility     part, to prevent spreading of the genetic material, and identity     preservation part which will confer the plant a different color,     so it is easily distinguishable. This biosafety module will be fully     compatible with Biobricks, so future teams working in plants can     incorporate it in their systems.
Plan for future steps: We will test new, more complex multigenic constructions in N     benthamiana. Glandular trichome specific promoters will also be     tested with GFP in N benthamiana. Parts from NRP-UEA-Norwich     team and our own parts need to be adapted to each other in order     to build the biosafety module. We hope the last gene of our set of pathways is finally amplified     before the next newsletter is finished and that the translator is     finally built. The sooner the better. Stay tuned for our updates!

A Glimpse at Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a brand new biological research field which illustrate an increasing trend since 2000. On the basis of engineering science, SB achieve certain biology function via design and synthetise new biological parts, devices and systems or redesign and transform the existing biosystem. To illustrate, people install a computer through different parts, synthetic biology scientists hope to standardize the biological parts, and then try to assemble them together, and then accomplish a certain function system or even a new living thing.
1:The History of Synthetic Biology
In 1974, the concept of ‘Synthetic Biology’ was first proposed by Poland geneticist Waclaw Szybalski.  He predicted that the development of molecule biology will turn into the stage of synthetic biology. Then people can design new regulate part, take advantage of it to transform the natural genome, even further construct a brand new genome.
In 1978, when Nobel price in medicine and physiology was awarded to three scientists who found the restriction endonuclease, Waclaw Szybalski commented on the ‘Gene ’magazine that restriction enzyme not only benefit for constructing and recombining DNA or analyzing individual gene, but also bring us into a new era of synthetic biology.——From then on, people could not only describe or analyze gene but also construct and assess them. In 1980, on the German magazine ‘Medizinische Klinik’published the first paper which titled synthetic biology-‘Gene surgery : on the threshold of synthetic biology’
Pic 2  The Forth microbial cell——Synthetic Bacteria
In 2000, Nature published two papers in Vol.403 which introduced the research on toggle switch and ring oscillator circuit, and announced the achievement of artificial gene circuit. So far, the control modules used Switch, Cascades, plus generator, time delayed circuits, oscillator etc which can effectively control the expression of gene, the function of protein, cell metabolism and the interaction of cell.
In 2003, MIT established Registry of Standard Biological Parts for collecting standard biological parts. Scientists from all over the world could submit their modules which would simplified the design of a complicate system. Up to now, 3200 biobricks were collected and the number of it shows an increasing trend.
In 2004, the first (International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition was hold"
Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," to improve our mathematical modelling, we completed a phage assay. We used a 96 well plate and filled various wells with a specific amounts of bacteria. Then introducing various concentrations of phage to specific wells, and using a plate reader we measured the absorbance during 23 hours.
Figure 6 - Table showing the number of bacteria cells in each well. Each well had a certain number of phage added so that the concentration of phage was 2.5x10^-9 PFU. The wells labeled LB are the blanks for background, and the wells labelled T4 are only T4 phage and contain no bacteria in order to observe the absorbance of only the phage over time.
Figure 7 - Graph demonstrating the bacterial growth over time when the same number of phage was introduced to varying concentrations of bacteria. In the graph we can see that the highest concentration of bacteria grew relatively slowly in comparison to the other concentrations, and this is likely because the phage had an abundance of bacteria to infect and more bacteria were dying.
Figure 8 - Graph showing the bacterial growth curve when varying concentrations of phage were introduced.The bacteria concentrations that were introduced to the most phage grew slightly slower than the other samples. This shows that the phage may be successfully infecting the bacteria.
The results demonstrate the growth curve of the bacteria, and while the bacteria are still growing, they grow at a slower rate than they would be without the phage present. In addition, the maximum amount of bacteria decreases when phage are present. The starting OD is higher in the graph than in the legend, and this is due to the bacteria reproducing during the time period between when the original dilutions were measured and when the sample was measured after the phage were added. Our phage assay demonstrates that it is likely the phage are infecting the bacteria, as a higher concentration of phage resulted in decreased bacterial growth. Furthermore, increased numbers in bacteria result in decreased growth, and it can be interpreted that this is as a result of the phage having an abundance of bacteria to infect. This increases the rate at which the bacteria are infected and results in a less extreme growth curve."

Respectively, the repressor PhlF turns off the promoter(PPhlF) of T3, and blue light can induce the PPhlF. After the process of circuits, red-, green- and blue-light signals can respectively induce the P, PcpcG2-172 and PPhlF promoters.
Figure 2. The RGB system is encoded on 4 plasmids. The genes and genetic parts are shown.
The ‘resource allocator’ which connects the ‘circuits’ and ‘actuators’, is based on a split-RNA polymerase(RNAP) system[2]. In the system, a non-active ‘core’ fragment is constitutively expressed by promoter J23105. The sigma fragments(K1F, CGG, T3) regulated by P, PcpcG2-172 and PPhlF can conjugate with the core fragment to form full-functional RNA polymerases, and the RNA polymerases are then directed to three promoters and activated the expression of actuators respectively. It is worth mentioning that the sigma fragments are chosen that exhibited the least cross-talk. Furthermore, insulators (BydvJ, BBa_K2598010, and RiboJ[4], BBa_K2598014) were added to reduce the crosstalk among the three sigma fragments.
The actuators we chose were three kinds of color protein: fluorescent protein, chromoprotein and enzyme which can produce colorful products. The fluorescent proteins mRFP(BBa_K2598065), GFP(BBa_K2598063), BFP(BBa_K2598064) were chosen to test our system and achieve our final results because fluorescent reporters can be measured easily by ELIASA (microplate reader) and flow cytometry and the expression period is much shorter than those of chromoprotein and enzyme. What’s more, we use chormoproteins amilGFP (BBa_K2598055), amilCP (BBa_K2598057) and eforred (BBa_K2598056) to prove our concept. We also constructed a plasmid containing lacZ(BBa_K2598025), bFMO(BBa_K2598029) and gusA(BBa_K2598032), which are enzymes and can generate colorful pigments on the plates. The enzyme LacZ, bFMO and gusA can react with X-gal, tryptophan and Rose-gluc, respectively. The products of these enzymes can"

Education and public engagement
We are fully engaged in various educational events and         workshops using different communication channels         with different groups of people.          From the following activities, we not only spread our thinking but also absorbed different ideas from various walks of life.
 
We truly had a feel that it is the communication contributes a better job.         At first, we just wanted to introduce our project to the public. But it turned         out people gained a new interest and a wider approach to science and the world. At the same time, we took in new creation and suggestion that inspired us a lot!
We also made presentations to introduce synthetic biology, iGEM competitions        and the project carried out by our team to students in high school and our university. We sincerely hope that increasing people will know us and join us.
We may further initiate to educate the public.

Our talk attracted more than 400 students, most of them are impressed by our fantastic ideas.
Aim:
1、Letting scientific project exert real impact on the society, we would like to spread our project and the culture of iGEM
2、We seized this chance to learn how to teach people without standard knowledge of synthetic biology
3、We exchanged ideas about synthetic biology .
4、Introducing the iGEM competition as an example of student-directed scientific experiments on self-selected research topics.
5、Encouraging freshman to seek their own interests actively, join in laboratories and participate in biological research. 
6、Teaching freshman how to get papers from some databases and how to get in touch with professors.After the Campus Talk, we found that a lot of students are interested in"

Achievements
Redox sensing device
Two novel genes have been designed and synthesized each comprised of 5 genetic elements. Together they function as a device termed the Redoxilator that can sense the internal redox state of a yeast cell, and output a reporter signal.
Biobricks
DNA of several new biobricks have been designed and submitted including a yeast optimized GFP reporter protein, a protein degradation sequence and a fast degradable yeast GFP. (Bronze medal)
We have demonstrated that our USER fusion biobrick works as expected and documented it (silver medal)
USER fusion Assembly standard
A new biobrick assembly standard that allows the rapid construction of multi-part devices have been developed and documented. The assembly standard offers many benefits: All restriction sites are allowed, multiple biobricks can be joined in one step, the result is scar-free making it ideal for protein fusions and more. (Gold medal)
USER-fusion primer design software
A novel and very useful software tool have been developed that can automatically design the optimal primers for USER fusion assembly of 2-9 biobricks, taking several parameters into account.

We delivered a short synopsis of our device, the synthetic biology involved, and safety precautions we have outlined for our project. We then presented visitors with a five question survey using a Likert Scale to gauge public perception of both our device, and the synthetic biology methods used. The survey was a huge success with over 320 participants. With such a diverse attendance, our survey captured a great cross-section of the Minnesota community that would be impacted by the implementation of our device. The results of our survey, illustrated below, informed how and where the public would be most comfortable with implementing our device, and illustrated the need for catered education addressing the public’s major concerns prior to applying our device in the environment. Our model for gauging public perception allowed for a wide, diverse crowd to be accessed. This model can be used upon request.
Intellectual Property
Members of our team attended three Intellectual Property Protection and patenting workshops that educated them on the process of commercialization of our invention. This allowed us to develop a comprehensive business plan and perform an economic analysis of the mining, fisheries, and governmental markets that could potentially benefit from the use of our invention. We also worked in conjunction with the Office of Technology Commercialization to explore the patentability of our project, the novelty, the non obviousness, and utility of our product and how to make the best claims to patent our device or license it to Minnepura Technologies, Inc.

Documentary
In order for our project to reach commercialization and success with the public, we needed to inform ourselves as well as others of the ethics of the use of our invention. We compiled this documentary in order to inform those unfamiliar with the problem of global mercury contamination and to discuss the bioethical questions of synthetic biology as they related to our device implementation. We conducted interviews with specialists from environmental toxicology, biotechnology, and philosophy. Through our collaboration with the 2014 Colombia iGEM Team, we further examined the current mercury contamination in Colombia and around the globe.

(b) Test of VEGF-STEP in HeLa. 4 paralleled experiments were carried out, but the dynamic range was only 1.49 folds in HeLa cells.
In our dry lab, to improve the binding affinity, we have redesigned 3 receptor binding domains: VEGF-scFv, KDR Ig domain 3 and D-Dimer-scFv (Figure 6). Also, we have redesigned the DNA sequence of the tTA promoter, to enhance downstream expression (Figure 7).
Figure 6. Binding energy variation after redesigning.
Figure 7. An example for designing result (tTA promoter).
Based on theoretical calculation of Gibbs free energy, we can now design or redesign receptors in silicon to get maximum binding affinity with the ligand. With input structure of receptors and ligands, we can find out the interface of the ligand-receptor complex, calculate binding energy, and mutate some residues to improve it. Even if there is only sequence information, homology modeling can be used to predict the structure. We believe, with the input sequence or structure of any ligand, we can redesign, or do de novo design of the sequence of receptor, thus extending additional functions of our system.

When food gets  spoilt we generally tend to identify it by tasting or detecting  change in  color,   texture or smell.  Simple and comfortable these tactics are, they elude us from identifying these   issues beyond our daily context. One simple example of this would be biofilm formation in food   processing  plants  where  they  cause  extensive  losses  due  to  equipment  failure  or  necessary   extensive cleanup. In past few decades detection of quorum sensing signals in spoiled food products has added a   new dimension to study the process of food spoilage. The bacterial phenomenon of cell­to­cell   communication using signaling molecules is known as quorum sensing. Bacteria takes decisive   action  based  upon  assessing  local  cell  densities.  Cell­to­cell  communication  depends  on  the   production  of,  secretion  of,  and  response  to  small,  diffusible  signal  molecules  called   ""autoinducers"".  The  signal  molecules  are  produced  and  secreted  at  a  basal  level  during   bacterial growth. Their  concentration in the environmental medium or matrix increases as the   bacterial population expands, and when it reaches a threshold level (quorum level).  It induces   phenotypic  effects  by  regulating  quorum­sensing  dependent  target  gene  expression.  This   phenomenon occurs without any external intervention and is also referred to as auto induction.  A  very  common  quorum  system  found  widely  in  gram  negative  bacteria  is  AHL  based   communication.  AHL  or  N­Acyl  Homoserine  Lactone  is  an  autoinducer,  a  part  of  quorum   sensing  network  in  multiple  bacteria  and  has  thus  confirmed  the  role  of  inter  cell  signaling   pathway in food spoilage. They are found in milk and other dairy products which are the fastest   among  the  perishable  items  to  get  spoilt.  A  systematic  study  has  discovered  spoilage  to  be   caused by AHL producing bacteria.  This study and its results brought new perspective into how food  spoilage  can  be  prevented  by  selectively  targeting  this  signaling  pathway  and  thus   preventing microbial action to take place despite their favorable number and conditions.

Parts Submitted to the Registry
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The ""groupparts"" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts on the Registry than on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
When should you put parts into the Registry?
As soon as possible! We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better recall you will have of all details surrounding your parts. Remember you don't need to send us the DNA to create an entry for a part on the Registry. However, you must send us the sample/DNA before the Jamboree. Only parts for which you have sent us samples/DNA are eligible for awards and medal requirements.
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If"

This process is documented on the safe-by-design page. The final bandage resulted from input from stakeholders and expert on our designs. This process was further supported by a stakeholder-value analysis we performed based on the iGEM'ers Guide to the Future.
We believe that our product benefits individuals as well as society, by improving patients’ quality of life, improving public health, lowering the prevalence of antibiotics resistance and eventually reducing health care costs.   These benefits are extensively explained on the applied design page . For instance, we enabled the secretion of active lysostaphin by E. coli. This eliminates the need for expensive laboratory equipment other than the standard equipment available in modest laboratories for the production and purification of lysostaphin. This will allow scientists with all budgets to produce lysostaphin of high purity. Currently, drugs sold in developing countries are often of lower purity than drugs used in developed countries (2) . Hopefully, patients in developing as well as developed countries will benefit from a treatment with highly pure lysostaphin.
We identified the main risk introduced by our design as the escape of GMOs into the environment. We however believe that we minimize this risk using a proper adhesin. We consider the addition of a kill switch to our system in the future. This will add an additional layer of safety to Gelcatraz. However, it will make the system more expensive. This may not be desirable as it may prevent scientists with a limited budget from using our platform. In contrast, without the kill switch, the low costs of our system and its user-friendliness make Gelcatraz accessible to any scientist with basic equipment.
2. Responsible stewardship
The committee believes that scientists involved with SynBio must think and act for the advancement of all, thus also for those who cannot talk. Examples of the latter are nonhuman species, the environment and future generations. Challenges recognized by the commission are firstly our incomplete and uncertain understanding of the potential risks and benefits of synthetic biology, and secondly the risk of intentional misuse of SynBio technologies. Once again, the commission stresses the importance of prudent vigilance here, rather than being action-oriented or extremely cautious.
Insofar as we can judge with our current knowledge, the plaster as we designed it seems to globally advance people. Patients suffering from chronic wounds or burn wounds will benefit from the plaster, and so will other people as our design"

Fig. 2 Simulation of Cre Recombinase kinetics without reverse reaction
In this simulation, it can be seen that the knockout eﬃciency of Cre is around 95% after around 5000 seconds (around         83 minutes). Without the reverse reaction, this would eventually approach 100% over time. However, it should be noted         that our model deliberately ignores the reverse reaction with may occur in reality even with lox66 and lox71.
5 Model Simpliﬁcation
In this simulation, due to the high values of reaction constants, we needed to use a very small time step in the simulation         which led to a long simulation time. In order to make it feasible to simulate further models, we will attempt to         ﬁt the progress of the module with a simple system of diﬀerential equations.
Particularly, because the rate of the forward reaction is only dependent on the amount of unrecombined plasmid in the         system, and the reverse reaction is only dependent on the amount of recombined plasmid, we will simplify the system         to have only S and P where S is now the proportion of unrecombined plasmid and P is the recombined fraction. We thus         attempted to ﬁt it into a diﬀerential equation of the form
which would correspond to having the reaction system
We ﬁtted the values of r+ and r− using MATLAB, which resulted in the following graph for S and P.
Fig. 3 Comparison of fitted and simulated kinetics
As can be seen, the ﬁtted values of r+ and r− result in a curve that follows the results from the simulation of the         actual kinetic system quite closely.

Multipurpose Cell Lines
Our system has the ability to behave in different ways according to an internal toggle inside it switching states based on the chemical substances that the system is exposed to. The toggle states could generally be used to trigger events such as enzyme synthesis, transcriptional regulation, virion production, or even cell death. Therefore, one may view the bacterial cell line containing this system as a multipurpose cell line. By adding a certain chemical to a cell line, the latter may be trained to exhibit a desired behavior, and then it is not necessary any more to construct two independent cell lines.
This means that one applies an “input engineering” instead of a “DNA engineering” approach. If one extends this idea to several multi-inducible toggle switches being harbored in the same cell line, the number of possible phenotypes increases to 2n, where n equals the number of toggle switches. For example, if one would have 5 such toggle switches inside a cell line, 32 different behavior patterns would be possible.
For the purpose of creating a toggle switch that is activated in a specific phase only and not always (a multi-inducible toggle switch), as is required for stable biological automatons, we introduced the concept of double promoters to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, which can be helpful for engineering systems which exhibit a desired behavior only at specific times.

Figure 14: MazEF system
Programmed cell death (PCD) is an active process that results in cell suicide and is an essential mechanism in multicellular organisms. Generally, PCD is required for the elimination of superfluous or potentially harmful cells. In E.coli, there are several toxin-antitoxin systems, including mazEF, chpBIK, relBE, yefM, yoeB. The mazEF is one of the well-studied systems. MazEF system is a toxin-antitoxin system. MazF, which has RNA cleavage ability, is a kind of toxin. MazE, on the other hand, is the antidote of MazF. In the nature, many bacteria will sacrifice themselves and leave nutrition to the left when facing threats from dangerous environment, such as heat, lack of food and so on.
As we all know, the more E.coli, the more biological heat would release. The excessive heat is not good for cells growth. What’s more, the overhigh density of cell is an obstacle for E.coli to produce Secondary metabolites like antibiotics. So we use the PCD device to control the density of cell.
The CI expressed in oscillation device will activate PCD device. Once CI is expressed, the expression of MazE will be inhibited. No more hexamer will be formed, and MazF will show its power and the density of cell will decrease. When the density is too low to activate the system, then there will be no CI. After that, the MazE will be expressed again, and then it becomes a circle (Figure 15).
Figure 15: The program cell death system
In order to test whether this device is work, we use the T7 promoter to control the expression of CI. If the cell density decrease when CI is expressed with induction of T7 promoter, this device is successful (Figure 16).

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Test#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," is due to the additional genes transformed bacteria are able to carry out more processes. This in turn increases the metabolic burden on the bacteria and so the overall growth rate is reduced, meaning less frequent cell division. As such, over time, more transformed cells die than are replaced giving a net loss of transformed cells in a population. If this is the case, it may present an inherent shelf life on synthetic organisms.
While seemingly unavoidable, plasmid loss may not be entirely negative and instead may present a new opportunity for biocontainment. One of the key challenges with synthetic biology is controlling the modified organisms when they're used outside the lab. Genetically modified organisms may have inherent advantages as their new characteristics are from a distinct environment and, as such, efforts must be made to ensure they do not escape the environment of their intended use. Biocontainment may involve physical isolation (for instance inside a container that prevents the bacteria escaping into the wild), or genetic controls. These are called kill switches, genetic circuits inserted into the bacteria that cause them to die in the absence of a specific molecule usually provided in the growth media.
Both systems however have problems; physical containment can fail due to improper production, while kill switches effectively generate a selection pressure in favour of those with mutated kill switches as these bacteria will survive. Plasmid loss therefore may represent an effective way of ensuring genetically modified organisms do not cause damage to the natural ecosystem. In theory, if you could manipulate the rate of plasmid loss, you could control how long your bacteria remained modified, and also revert them to their non-transformed state, hence preventing the risk of colonisation after their function has been fulfilled. While this remains theoretical, it could represent an effective control on the use of synthetic organisms in the real world.

THE FIRST GM HUMAN EMBRYO: HAS A LINE BEEN CROSSED?
In April 2015, Junjiu Huang and his research team in Guangzhou, China, released a report confirming that they had genetically modified the DNA within 86 human embryos. This has prompted furious ethical debate amongst scientists across the globe, and raises serious questions about the course of gene editing research in the years to come.
Human Embryos?
Yes, human embryos, but not the type we would normally think of. It turns out that 2-5% of embryos formed by IVF consist of an egg fertilised by two sperm, instead of the usual single sperm cell. This event makes the embryos non-viable, such that they cannot result in a live birth. Huang's research team collected 86 of these non-viable human embryos from"

μShroom Mapper | Shane McCormack
With the new facilitated design method of Liquid Flow Relations, a behind-the-scenes software tool was needed to interpret and translate the LFR and UCF into a functional MINT file. This task is fulfilled with muShroomMapper; muShroomMapper takes LFR and UCF as inputs, maps the LFR into a graph with the support of NetSynth, then informs that graph with the UCF. The informed graph is then translated into a MINT file, to be placed and routed to a blueprint for fabrication.
μShroom Mapper-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
Liquid Flow Relation files and User Constraint Files greatly simplify the microfluidic design process. With the implementation of the LFR and UCF file types also came the development of uShroom Mapper, an algorithm that takes LFR and UCF file inputs and converts them into MINT file types. These file types and tools by themselves are incredibly useful, enabling researchers to specify more complex designs with greater ease. Unfortunately, alone these tools would be cumbersome and difficult to use for an inexperienced programmer.
Therefore we integrated the LFR and UCF file types into Neptune, and we integrated the uShroom Mapper algorithm into Neptune's backend libraries. To make these tools easy to use, we developed a sleek, simple and appealing user interface where LFR and UCF files can be edited and then sent to uShroom mapper for conversion to MINT. We also integrated a front end terminal that provides compilation feedback and throws errors when design rules are violated. All this to speak, we integrated uShroom Mapper with Neptune by sculpting a clean user interface that makes the design simple and efficient.
Fluigi-Neptune Integration | Kestas Subacius & Shane McCormack
After uShroom Mapper outputs a MINT specification of a microfluidic chip, designers can modify this file type to do fine-tuning and optimization of their design. A microfluidic designer can also opt to skip specification at the LFR level, and they can go right into designing a MINT file. This being said, MINT files are not the end of the pipeline, and this filetype must be converted to a microfluidic design schematic that can be used for fabrication.
Fluigi is a powerful algorithm that takes a MINT description of a microfluidic chip, and from this description it outputs a microfluidic"

Moreover, we organized a cycle of discussions called 'Café Scientifique' , where we invited wide society to learn about 5 different topics related to science. During these events, people could have asked questions and heard the answers right away from Lithuanian scientists and doctors, working on a certain field. Also, we had an opportunity to present our ideas to the non-scientific public and hear its opinions on  many issues related to science ethics. These discussions were a great success – around 50 people were participating in each of them. We also streamed the discussions online on Facebook, making it possible for people watch despite the location.
Furthermore, we participated in the annual, related with science, events in Lithuania, where we encouraged people to try out more interactive activities. One of which was science festival 'Spaceship Earth' , for which we equipped an escape room, called 'BioBreakroom'. This interactive game required to solve various tasks based on life sciences knowledge in order to get out of the room. We believe, that this kind of entertainment might encourage students to seek knowledge and actively participate in the development of scientific culture. In fact, all participants greatly enjoyed this escape room and left with a vision of how both - important and inspiring -  science can be.
What is more, from the very beginning of our project, we were collaborating with Kristupas Sabolius and other Lithuanian artists, who were interested in scientific researches and, most importantly, tried to understand what meaning the visualization has in science as it is very important in our everyday life. Workshop, which took place at 'European Researchers’ Night' festival, summarised all the ideas. During this event we unravelled scientists ambition to visualise microscopic things, unseen with the naked eye. We conducted a theoretical introduction, workshop and finally opened a protein 3D structure exhibition. During all these activities, a great dialogue was established between our team members and participants. We were discussing synthetic biology, GMO, biotechnology and every other question, that might occur for a person with a different to scientific background. After the event, we were thrilled and proud of the fact, that there are so many open-minded people, wanting to broaden their knowledge of bio-sciences.
During all of these activities, we spread the word  and experiences related to synthetic biology, biotechnology, genetic engineering, iGEM competition and much more concerning life sciences. We were happy to see that people are looking forward to knowing more"

MODELING
In order to optimize the lysis step in our system, we used a modeling of the interaction between phages and bacteria. However, the purpose of this system is also to promote therapy. With this in mind, we used our modeling to give the doctor a tool to optimize the therapy dose needed by the patient.
After working on this model for some time we reached out to Ruth Bentley from the Nottingham iGEM team, we were able to work together and to discuss different modeling aspects.
It is important to note, that even though we worked on a lot of the theory together, we implemented the model with different languages, as Ruth coded on python and our work was done in Matlab.
All our modeling codes can be found here
Download
For our modelling we based ourselves on an article [1], in which the authors model the interactions between phages and bacteria using the following equations:
Where:
S is the number of susceptible bacteria  (the one that can be infected by phages)
R is the number of mutated bacteria (the one who became resistant to phages)
I is the number of infected bacteria, and therefore will be killed by the phage after a latent time
V is the number of phages
The parameters are described in the table below:
Table n°1: the different parameters of the modelling and their unit.
We can represent the situation with the following graph:
Figure n°1: representation of the problem.
Let’s explain each equation :
The variation of the number of susceptible bacteria S over time is:
A gain equal the growth of those bacteria: +a*S
A loss equal to the number of bacteria that mutates into phage-resistant bacteria: -f*S
A loss equal to the number of bacteria infected by phages: -b*S*V
The variation of the number of resistant bacteria R over time is:
A gain equal to the growth of those bacteria: +"

I don’t know it well, I heard that GMOs are referred to as carcinogens, so I’m careful not to buy GM Foods. In addition, I don’t know the reason why we produce GM Foods.
Problem Seen from the Result
We made sure that many people have negative impression of GMOs and GM Foods but they don’t have the evidence or knowledge of their negative impression of GMOs from the results of Q3, 4, 5, or 6. On the other hand, many people are likely to understand the importance of GMOs or GM technology.
That is, many people have negative impression of GMOs with not appropriate knowledge or information but vague bad images of GMOs. The yield of GMOs are now increasing and it is predicted that GM foods will play a key role in food problem in the future. So we, HokkaidoU team, regard this prejudice against GMOs in Japan as an important problem.
Approach to Solution
To approach to the problem that we listed above, we took 2 actions.
We explained what a GMO is and how it would act when it goes inside our body and gave out paper explaining it to people who kindly answered our survey.
We described the reason why GMOs are made or how GM Foods are distributed in this paper. And we also described that eaten GMOs are digested like normal foods and DNA included GMOs is also digested and lose their function as genes.
At the last of paper, we described that however GMOs still have many uncertainties and we can’t conclude that GMOs are perfectly safe, we want people to evaluate properly with the correct knowledge about GMOs and end this explanation with that.
Actual paper for explanation are shown on below as pdf file.
Paper for GMOs' explanation (Japanese version)
We posted a video explaining how GMOs are processed after it goes into our body on YouTube so that people all around the world can watch it.
You can also watch the video on below window.
Your browser either does not support HTML5 or cannot handle MediaWiki open video formats. Please consider upgrading your browser, installing the appropriate plugin or switching to a Firefox or Chrome install.
Conclusion
In Japan, public opinions need to be changed in order to put GM foods on sale. This means that even if we went on with our project and succeeded to commercialize it, we could not sell it if public rejected it. By our approach, we hope that more people get correct knowledge on GM foods, and evaluate them using proper facts.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the expression of recombinase is, the lower the probability that inversion occurs is. That is, the more concentration of recombinase in plant cells, the fewer inversion efficiency is.
Figure 6. a) Graphic representation of the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by PhiC31 attachment sites (attB and attP). It represents the negative control of our experiment. Only when PhiC31 inversion occurs, luciferase protein will be expressed. b) Genetic construct that allows constitutive expression of phiC31 in the plant under the control of a strong promoter c) Graphic representation of the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by PhiC31 recombined attachment sites (attR and attL). In normal basis, the promoter is inverted, allowing the expression of luciferase protein. It represents the positive control of our experiment. d) Genetic construct that allows constitutive expression of phiC31 in the plant under the control of a weak constitutive promoter. e) Transcriptional unit for the expression of the Firefly Luciferase under the control of a strong constitutive promoter. f) Transcriptional unit for the expression of the Firefly luciferase under the control of a weak promoter. g) Bars chart representing luciferase expression levels before and after induction with PhiC31.
After analysing the data obtained from luciferase assay, it can be observed at Figure 4:
1) A significantly difference between the OFF and the ON state expression levels.
2) The recombinase expression under a weak promoter (pNOS promoter) shows the same luciferase expression that the constitutive positive control (genetic construct which is expressing constitutively luciferase protein under the strong promoter).
3) However, the recombinase expression under the strong promoter shows the same expression level of the constitutive weak control (genetic construct based on the constitutive expression of luciferase under a pNOS weak promoter)
The likelihood of producing the inversion event should be directly proportional to the luciferase protein concentration inside plant cell. Consequently, more quantity of phiC31 recombinase entails more probability of activating reporter gene expression. However, this experiment shows that once recombinase expression exceeds a certain threshold, the effect changes so the likelihood of up-regulating the reporter gene expression decreases.
In order to provide robust evidences to the hypothesis explained above, a subsequent experiment was performed. In this case, PhiC31 behaviour was analysed while being regulated by a weak promoter (pNOS) together with a optical density (A.t"

Working Modes
The synthetic miR Kit can be applied in three different ways:
I) Tuning: adjusting the expression
of the GOI by expressing a synthetic microRNA in the target cell/tissue
II) Off-Targeting: switching OFF the expression
of the GOI in case a certain endogenous microRNA is present in the target cell/tissue
III) On-Targeting: switching ON the expression
of the GOI in case a certain endogenous microRNA is present in the target cell/tissue
Simple Tuning Procedure
choose an interesting microRNA
create referring binding sites
order your binding site oligos
clone them into your miTuner construct
transfect your cells
measure the tuned expression!
Advancement
digestion of miR Kit construct with BamHI
cloning into viral backbone (e. g. pBS_U6 )
virus production
infection of cells
achievement of specific target cell tropism
→ further improvement of gene expression tuning

After gaining insight into each other’s project, both of us realize that we could have a further collaboration. Mutual Benefits Achieved The project of Peking is to construct a ‘synthetic membrane-less organelle’ as a multifunctional toolbox in yeast. They were planning to examine the effect of β-carotene producing in order to verify the feasibility of their project. Theβ-carotene producing consists of several enzymatic reactions.

For purpose of designing rational experiment conditions, they need to know the most efficient pathway of producingβ-carotene and the detail information about enzymes involved in the reactions. Their needs inspire us that we could offer the detail information of enzyme to our users with our software. And then we collected enzyme data from BRENDA and KEGG and integrated them into our web application. Peking got the data they needed from our software and conducted their experiments afterwards.Here is our search result page which includes physiochemical information of compound.

It's a great pleasure to collaborate with dry lab Team. What was exciting that they were really interested in our project. Mutual Benefits Achieved Fudan_CHINA planned to develop a web application for visualizing their model this year. However, they got trouble in implementing their software on the web using JavaScript language. We introduced them a high-level Python Web framework which called Django to help them build web app. Similar with Fudan-CHINA, our model is related to Probability Theory. So we instructed Fundan-CHINA to change parameters of their model to make it more reliable. Beyond that, Fudan_CHINA help us edit the wiki. They reminded us to write HTML pages based on the initial code of wiki page otherwise the garbled characters may appear.

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#ScienceCommunication_-_-_TEXT.html," to access and analyse large bodies of text, and uncover patterns within them. In our research, we used corpus linguistics to complete searches for the terms Genetic Engineering, Synthetic Biology, GMO and biosensor . We searched two main corpora which contain texts published in the media from 1995- present day, and completed analysis which allowed us to see how the media uses language to discuss these topics, and which attitudes are presented. The corpus linguistics research made us more aware of the lack of coverage of synthetic biology within media texts. It also showed how discussion around synthetic biology is populated with both positive and negative viewpoints, whilst giving indications of how we can use language to accentuate the positive, and increase clarity and transparency in communication. The report linked here is a detailed discussion of the corpus linguistics research and findings: A Corpus Based Investigation Into Science Communication.
Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines
As a culmination of our research into science communication, we have complied a set of guidelines for communicating synthetic biology to the public. These guidelines can be used for different purposes, including: to advise scientists when communicating about their work to the press; to guide in how to present to the public; and to help iGEM teams writing up their work! The guidelines start with some more general points to consider when you start to communicate synthetic biology. They also make use of the information we gained during the corpus linguistics research to suggest some more specific linguistic features to consider when communicating synthetic biology. Read the guidlines here: Breaking down the barriers: How should we communicate SynBio to the public?
Science Communication Seminars
To share our work in science communication with an audience of scientists, we held seminars with two research groups. In these seminars, we presented our research, and then opened up for discussions and debate about the issues we had raised. A lot of the scientists had stories to tell about personal experiences they’d had with science communication, and it was interesting to hear how they felt our research could have an impact!

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," during the expert discussion in Stirling , exactly these topics make gene doping different from conventional types of doping.
Health
Gene doping may be harmful to the athlete, especially when it comes to unregulated and barely tested methods. Risks of using gene doping include mutagenesis, uncontrolled gene expression levels and thereby disrupted feedback systems. For EPO, the risks include strokes and myocardial infarctions too. Gene doping might also cause acute humoral and cellular immune responses that may even invoke death. On top of this, there may be many additional unforeseen (long term) consequences.
“We can never say gene doping is safe. There may be many unforeseen consequences. ”
Steve Chinn, Health Scientist at the University of Stirling
Apart from athlete health there are also public health risks inherent to gene doping use. There is a risk of viral spreading when unregulated therapies are brought to the market, which may pose a global and environmental threat. Also, unregulated implementation may lead to use of vectors that can infect athletes’ germ line, possibly causing harm to future generations. On top of this, the desire for performance enhancement is not only present within sports. Changing DNA for performance enhancement attracts public attention, and thereby might invoke public health hazards.
“It is a big risk to have a healthy part of the population on gene doping, of which the consequences are still unsure.”
Dr. Colin Moran, Professor in Genetics and Sports Science at the University of Stirling
Responsibility
Gene doping use is, just as more conventional doping, a decision made by the athlete. As became apparent from athlete interviews and surveys, athletes are under a lot of pressure to perform well, both intrinsically as well as by external stimuli from family and coaches e.g. Furthermore, due to the possibility of germ line infections, the responsibility of gene doping might not lie completely with a second generation athlete. The responsibility issue was a topic first brought up by an attendee at our presentation at the Delft Health Initiative and a topic we then further addressed in Stirling .
Social inequality
Social inequality has been a topic of discussion within current doping. Some types of material doping are allowed since, according to Moniek Nijhuis , an Olympic swimmer who told us her story, they 'are accessible to every athlete and do not harm athlete health'. However, many doping treatments are extremely expensive and not available to every athlete worldwide. This would include gene doping. On top of that, gene doping might have a lasting effect and has the potential to interfere with many more characteristics than just genes that enhance performance. Therefore, financial status could provide the rich only with"

Protocols
Glycerol stock-preservation
Add one ml sterile 50% glycerol to a cryotube.
Add one ml overnight culture to a cryotube from step 1
Store at -80 °C
PCR
Make a mastermix of the reagents that are common for all reactions. Make enough for 0,5 extra reaction. Add reagents in the order they are listed above.
The polymerase stock must only be taken out of the freezer when needed and must be put back immediately after use.
Remember to mix thoroughly before aliquotting to separate PCR tubes, and try not to make any bubbles. Reverse pipetting works well for aliquoting.
Mark the PCR tubes on lid and side and place in thermocycler.
The annealing temperature should match the primer melting temperatures. This can be hard as Tm predictors tend to disagree.
Elongation time should be AT LEAST 30 seconds per kb of the longest expected fragment (for the X7 polymerase).

Emily's first experience with cloning! Ashlee led Emily through several practice experiments from designs made earlier in the year: making a gel, loading samples, gel purifying DNA. Ashlee introduced Emily to her research the previous semester. She had inserted the HMF-ABCDE pathway on the pSEVA251 KanR plasmid into P. putida and had validated its function, but was having difficulty inserting the dCas9 system into the pSEVA251 KanR HMF-ABCDE plasmid. The plasmid size would be close to 18 kb and this, among other affects, was thought to increase the difficulty of the cloning. Another hypothesis was that the dCas9 pathway did not have a strong terminator for the trans-acting RNA. Ashlee and Emily began work to insert the terminator. They performed a ligation of the pSEVA251/HMF plasmid and the terminator.
Clay and Sam worked on a program in Excel to codon optimize GFPs. Sucess. Unfortunately, program is clunky and requires a lot of user input for any optimization. Decision made to attempt the same task in MATLAB.

What are some important precautions?
""Of course, we must proceed with caution. For example, we do not know whether the microbiota alterations observed in our study also occur in real flights and can actually be manipulated, and what are the butyrate threshold levels to obtain the specific effects mentioned above. Not least, the picture is complicated by the fact that the complex microbiota-host and microbe-microbe interactions are still far from being understood. Research in this direction must be encouraged!""
Overview:
Our human practices did not focus on the necessary safety and FDA standards required to commercialize our probiotic. Instead, we gathered knowledge concerning the potential response that could come about if it was available to key demographics. This included individuals with diseases originating in the gut and travelers in space. We learned that a butyrate probiotic had the potential to relieve symptoms and be accepted as a therapeutic by patients. Our project design was additionally discussed and modified to create a more efficient killer of cancer cells. Further extensions of our planned bacterium in an entirely different environment were discussed but not tested in time. However, the points brought up in this research made it evident that using a HARV to culture our bacteria would be the next step in our project design if we were to pursue a space-biotic application. In the future, we would need to take our engineered probiotic and compare butyrate production between the Earth and microgravity environments. In addition, we would have to experimentally determine the metabolic levels of butyrate needed to be taken as a therapeutic alternative or reliever of disease symptoms. In terms of biofuel extension, safety testing would not be as constrained however examination of changes in virulence would still be crucial.

BugBuster Protocol
Using the Bugbuster 10X cell lysis reagent in order to purify our honeybee silk protein via inclusion bodies.
Based protocol off of the Novagen manufacturer's protocol which can be found here .
Expressing honey bee silk in E. Coli, from BBa_K1763001
See 5/18 and 5/19 for details on the protein expression.
Step by Step Protocol
Determine wet wet weight of cell pellet after spinning liquid culter at 10000 x g for 10 min.
2.5 g
Resuspend in 5 ml/g Bug Buster (1x) by pipetting and gently vortexing.
This is 12.5 ml in our case
Put on shaker or rotating mixer for 15 min at RT
Took our first fraction at this point of the full cell lysate (F1)
Centrifuge 16000 g 20 min at 4 degrees C
Took next fraction at this point of the supernatant, labeled (S1)
Resuspend pellet in same volume of 1X bugbuster as before
12.5 ml
Pipett up and down and vortex gently to get an even suspension.
Took third fraction at this point (F2)
I did not go to great lengths to get an even  suspension here, but I noticed in retrospect that the protocol emphasized the importance of this in order to get pure inclusion bodies.
Add dry lysozyme to final concentration of 200 ug / ml
For 12.5 ml solution I added around 2.5 mg of lysozyme
I did not add any DNAse because it was not mentioned on the manufacturer's protocol, but in the future I will try adding 1 ul of DNAse at this point because chromosomal DNA might have been a problem in subsequent steps.
Add 6 volumes of 1:10 diluted bugbuster (.1X)
At this point we split the solution up into two 50 ml falcon tubes and added 37.5 ml of .1X bugbuster to each tube
Centrifuge 16000g 15 min. 4 degrees C to collect inclusion bodies.
Remove supernatant w/ pipett, take next fraction (S3)
After spinning this down, there was a pellet, with an opaque and viscous substance. (Im guessing it might be chromosomal DNA)
It was difficult to remove the supernatant because the viscous liquid kept getting sucked up and bringing the pellet up with"

Furthermore, a court may issue a post-trial injunction, which is an order for the infringer to stop infringing the patent currently and in the future.  A patent holder can also request a preliminary injunction from the court, which is an order that prevents the alleged defendant infringer from using or selling the patent during the trial.
Therefore, it is important for a university or student group to learn how to avoid infringing on a patent or any intellectual property rights in order to not be forced to defend a costly and time-consuming patent infringement lawsuit in the future.  The most important thing to do is to identify which patents, if any, there is a chance you may be infringing.  The first step is to conduct an online patent search via the U.S. Patent Office.  When conducting the search, it is important to search for patents that are in any way related to your technology.  Using keywords that describe your technology and searching the assignee records for patents owned by other companies as well are good strategies.  Many small companies may not assign a patent to their company, so it is imperative to also search using the names of any known inventor, typically the owner or CEO of the small company.  In the case of larger companies, some do not own their patents directly.  Instead, they may be associated with an intellectual property holding company that that owns their patents.  Thus, you will have to research whether or not one of these holding companies is involved, find out their name, and conduct another search via that additional route.

To Do:
Meet with Adrian at 10 am in SFH.
Linearize parts
autoclave pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes

Eletrophoresis gel: We messed up and digested the wrong part.  We did Z0279 instead on Z0507.  Z0279 is already in a yeast plasmid, while Z0507 is not.  This digest will yield nothing useful to us.
Thus, we decided to begin a restriction digest on Z0507 in order to get it into pRS306.
For Z0507, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to yield 3.903 ug of DNA.  This would require 3.903 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.326 uL of EcoRI and 0.390 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  Together with 5 uL BSA and 5 uL 10x buffer, this will yield a 50 uL reaction.  Ran the restriction digest for slightly over an hour in the incubator and then placed on heating block to denature enzymes.  Placed in fridge in preparation for work with it tomorrow or later in the week.
Running the gel: As mentioned before, since Z0279 is useless when digested with the enzymes we used, there was no point to extract it from the gel.  Also note that Z0842, when cut with EcoRI and SpeI, yields two pieces of DNA that are only about 2100 bp apiece and only 40 bp from each other.  This is impossible to separate on a gel.  Due to this oversight, we must run another restriction digest for Z0842, except this would be a triple digest that cuts a unique site only in the unwanted strand and not in the insert and also not on the desired vector for the part (pRS306).
Pre-weighed tubes for gel extraction:
{
Z0842 tube #1:
Starting weight = 1.0113g
End weight = g
=> Weight of gel = g
=> used uL of QG
Z0842 tube #2:
Starting weight = 1.0150g
End weight = g
=> Weight of gel = g
=> used uL of QG"
Cornell,2013,Team:Cornell#notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," inserts, so we ran digest screens on all colonies (1-5) and ran a new gel. We saw very faint bands for some of them, and nothing for others. Additionally, Arun created a device to use the shaking power of our vortex to agitate a sample in the waterbath. We made LB cultures of pC13A, pC13D, pC13F, pC13K, pC13L, pC13M, pC13N, pAK13AC and pAK13BB. We set up new overnight cultures of pC13AS, pC13W, and pC13Y.
We ran a Gibson assembly to create pC13BH and transformed the construct.

The miniprep kit arrived, so we finally were able to miniprep our pelleted pC13BG, pC13AY and pA13AM cultures. We got transformants for the Gibson assembly of pC13BH and we cultured them. The PCR to append cut sites to pC13F again failed, so we need to extensively troubleshoot this PCR. We made large cultures of pC13BX colony 1 and pC13CJ colony 4 to miniprep and sequence. We made electrocompetent stocks of BL21. The symbol is a purple star. We later met with Bradford Condon, a graduate student who works with Professor Turgeon. He gave us a few tips on our method, including using young mycelia, and avoiding the hydrophobic disc that forms on the top of our cultures for protoplasting. The advice was that we should blend G. lucidum which has been growing for an extended period of time, and make new cultures for a short period of time with the fungal ""smoothie"". We also miniprepped pC13BM, pC13BJ, pC13BL, and pC13BK 6 & 7. The LB stock of pAK13AC was made with the wrong antibiotic so we remade it. We also remade LB stock of pAK13AB. We miniprepped pC13A, pC13D, pC13F, pC13K, pC13L, pC13M,"

As                         a possible marker of chronic kidney disease, β2-micro is an effective and portable method for                         early detection of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes and hypertension. In                         addition, team B students considered co-expression of Nanobodies with an enzyme to catalyze the                         immobilization of Nanobodies with the addition of an aldehyde group at the end of the                         Nanobody.
After the introduction of the team project, the students of the two schools raised questions and                         discussed the contents of some projects. The students of the A team of Northeastern University                         also took the opportunity to introduce some of the excellent genetic pathway design schemes of                         iGEM. Further exchanges of some views, including the design of the pathway, the problems related                         to the experimental process, the development of the practice, and the design of the website Wiki                         artwork. Everyone had a pleasant conversation during the exchange and expressed their                         willingness to carry out further cooperation.
Tag: The exchange meeting ended in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. We look forward to the                         exchanges and cooperation between the Dalian University of Technology and the iGEM team of                         Northeastern University.
CCIC in Shanghai
The CCIC exchange meeting was held at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. Two teams                         from our school went to the conference. The team participated in the trouble shooting process,                         shared some problems in the project with other teams, and got suggestions and help from other                         teams. In the poster session, we showed posters to everyone and showed our posters to interested                         students. In the exchange, we also gained a lot of suggestions and inspired. In the final                         representation. We showed the type of testing together with the students of the Tsinghua A team,                         and received a review from Dr. Zhang Haoqian, a senior iGEMER.
Cooperation with Ocean University of China
At the 5th CCiC meeting, we were very interested in the science and engineering brochure                         “SPACESHIP E.coli” designed by OUC-China. After the meeting, we contacted the OUC-China team,                         hoping for the cooperative activities of promoting the science of synthetic biology. OUC-China                         will provide us with an electronic version of comics. Our team members will carry out                         promotional activities in Dalian, including posting comic posters ""SPACESHIP E.coli"" and iGEM                         posters in various high schools in Dalian, and in 2018 10 , the results will be fed back to                         OUC-China before the 3rd of the month.
