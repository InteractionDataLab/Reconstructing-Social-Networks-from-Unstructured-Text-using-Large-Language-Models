TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Electrace_-_-_TEXT.html,". In our discussion with policymakers discussion with policymakers , most of the attendants agreed that this legislature needs to be reconsidered.
The underlying reason for this strict legislature are safety concerns. Release of GMOs in the environment is generally considered very harmful. These concerns might be considered somewhat exaggerated, since almost every GMO is in essence a crippled version of lab strain which is not viable in nature. Next to that, introduction of parts such as kill switches might provide another safety measure to make a possible release in the environment less dangerous.
The safety risks for the ELECTRACE system are limited. Firstly, our GMOs will be immobilized in a microfluidics chamber; the bacteria will not be in contact with the environment. Next to that, adding the ET system reduces the viability of the cell , so our GMOs don’t have an evolutionary advantage. To further reduce the risk, a kill switch BioBrick could be implemented.
It is of course, even with aforementioned precautionary measures, possible that something goes wrong. However, one should ask oneself whether the benefits of using ELECTRACE, or synthetic biology in general, outside the lab outweigh the risks. In our opinion, this should be judged per application and usage outside the lab should not be prohibited beforehand.
Open-source development
Open-source development of the ELECTRACE system provides large opportunities to create a broad spectrum of applications and to optimize the system. However, there are also drawbacks for this development strategy.  Firstly, open-source development requires very open communication about how the system is created and how it works. Therefore, ELECTRACE will inevitably be branded as a synthetic biology project. As a result of this, the applications will suffer from the negative framing concerning terms like SynBio and GMO. If the system is judged on the fact that it is synthetic biology and not on the usefulness of its applications, commercial success might be hampered.
Secondly, open-source development does not match with current revenue models of possible inventors and initial developers of the system.  Since everything is freely available, companies can make their own ELECTRACE system to fit their application, and the inventors have nothing to sell. To create a fully functioning ELECTRACE system, a lot of research and development, and therefore money, is needed. There is a good chance commercial organizations will not be willing to spend this money when chances for future gains are negligible.  A way to circumvent this problem would be to keep certain parts of the system “closed-source”. To get back to the analogy of smart phone OS, Google has kept certain parts of their Android closed or has closed them off again to make more"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Software Tool award , you must fill out this page.
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.

Discussion
Regarding all planned parts, the Cas construct for lactobacilli and the sucrose transporter could not be cloned due to difficult restriction sites. Therefore no knockout experiments were performed. The phosphofructokinase and fructose transporter were assembled to be tested for expression in lactobacilli.
In the course of the project, we were not able to transform any constructs into L. johnsonii. Lactobacilli survived the transformation protocol, indicated by growth in MRS medium after electroporation. All cells died  in liquid medium and on plates after incubation with antibiotics. This lead to the assumption that the pNZ124Tue vector either wasn’t taken up by the cells or the chloramphenicol-acyltransferase wasn’t expressed by the cells. For cloning purposes pNZ124Tue was successfully amplified in E. coli proving that the vector works as shuttle in E. coli. We were not able to prove that pNZ124Tue can be used as expression vector for lactobacillus johnsonii."

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Why Sensitivity Analysis? The models we use to describe a gene network are systems of ordinary differential equations. In the case of ODE models, robustness is generally studied in the context of parametric uncertainty via properties such as robust stability and response to perturbation. Although there is no standard quantitative measure of robustness, a common thread in the literature relates robustness to parametric sensitivity. Parameters whose perturbation causes undesirable changes (either qualitative or quantitative) in some output identify processes with fragility The sensitivity information can then guide the selection of the optimal mutation targets and thereby reduce the laboratory effort.
Theoretical Foundations of GSA
High dimensional model representation(HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for capturing high dimensional IO system behavior. As the impact of the multiple input variables on the output can be independent and cooperative, it is natural to express the model output <math>f(x)</math> as a finite hierarchical correlated function expansion in terms of the input variables:
<math>f(x)=f_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} f_{ij}(x_{i}, x_{j})+ \sum_{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}f_{ijk}(x_{i},x_{j},x_{k})+...+\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{l}\leq n}f_{i_{1}i_{2}...i_{l}}(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{il}) +...+f_{12...n}(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})</math>

Overview
The expression of interacting genes depends on the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN). In order to figure out optimal biological networks that can particularly function reliably when faced with fluctuation of DNA template amount (copy number), it is important to do some simulations in advance to narrow the screening scope. Therefore, it would be easier for us to search for adaptive and robust networks in wet lab and theoretically discuss certain functional regulatory motifs that are significant in showing adaptation. In our project, we abstractly analyzed gene regulatory network topologies and computed all possible three-node network structures by enumeration. We modeled, synthesized, tested and made comparisons, and finally screened 3 optimal network structures out of 19683 network structures, which show great adaptation to copy number. In order to verify the correctness of our screening process, we introduced an optimal testing case and simulated to check the results. Based on our screening results, we analyzed and concluded 9 core motifs that may be essential to adaptation. We respectively simulated these motifs and tried to explain their characters via mathematical proof. Finally we figured out a general rule of artificially constructing an adaptive network by combining core motifs.

As observed in Figure 1, the same unexpected trend is described when Munich’s Cas13a is dried with our CAHS 94205 , hence verifying our CAHS+Cas13a results.

Not only did their results help us discard a problem in our Cas13a or an experimental error as the issue, but also proved a similar behaviour of the TDPs in combination with our  Cas13a’s (which were actually based on the sequences of different organisms and purified according to different protocols) and therefore further substantiated the use of TDPs for the preservation of Cas13a.

Both the iGEM TU Delft and iGEM LMU-TUM Munich teams realized that optimal crRNA is a prerequisite in utilizing Cas13a for their respective detection purposes. In addition to sensitively detecting a sequence of interest, modeling the off-target effects of a chosen crRNA is important in assessing the reliability of the system, as it provides information about the probability of a false positive output. Both teams took a different approach: we employed a kinetic model ( Klein et al. 2017 ) while iGEM LMU-TUM Munich applied an alignment algorithm. Please find the full model here .
Biophysical modeling has the advantage of providing a unified targeting framework that is able to take into account tiny (local) off-target effects that together may add to affect the reliability of the system. However, it is computationally intensive as compared to homology search and requires the development of the software, which is already available from NCBI for homology search.
We ran 4 off-target simulations for 2 different crRNAs spacer sequences (crRNA1-3 and crRNA4) designed by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for targeting the 16s ribosomal RNA of two different bacterial species (E. coli DH5α and B. subtilis). The on and off-target activities are modeled for sequences on all possible frames on the genome (Figure 4). From the simulation results, we deduce that the crRNAs specifically target the different bacterial species.

The enzymes catalyze the conversion of hydrophobic intermediates of primary and secondary metabolic pathways, detoxify natural and environmental pollutants and allow fungi to grow under different conditions. Fungal genome sequencing projects have enabled the annotation of several thousand novel cytochromes P450, many of which constitute new families.  Previous reports demonstrated that the white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium has been shown to possess biodegradative capabilities 2,3,7,8-TCDD. The degradation of more highly chlorinated DDs by P. chrysosporium has also been demonstrated. Based on the fact that P. chrysosporium genome contains 148 CYP genes, it is possible to assume that some P. chrysosporium CYPs are involved in the metabolism of PCDDs. Unfotunately, The specific 2,3,7,8-TCDD-metabolizing enzyme has not yet discovered  in P. chrysosporium.2,5
Prokaryotic CYP450:
Bacterial CYP102A1 is a water-soluble fusion protein between CYP and NADPH-P450 reductase containing FAD and FMN. Interestingly, CYP and the reductase domains of CYP102A1 are significantly homologous with animal CYP and its reductase, suggesting it maybe the eukaryotic origin of CYP102A1 (Omura 2010).  These cytochromes are involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, in the utilization of hydrophobic low molecular substrates, such as alkanes and aromatic carbohydrates. These enzymes also have monooxygenase activity towards different organic low molecular substrates. Cytochromes C450 play an important role in the degradation of environmental toxins and mutagens. The hydroxylation activities of these enzymes towards PCDDs are much lower than those of mammalian CYPs.1

Required Devices
The three required constructions shown various fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.5, as shown on graph and bar chart below.  As shown on corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm, the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm is linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter.
Theoritically constructions I20260 and J3101 were similar, constructions and alignments in sillico matched perfectly. The difference between these constructions lies on the assembly way. However we obtained, as some other teams (University of Oxford, Paris-Bettencourt and ITESM-CEM), significant GFP expression difference. There is probably a Biobrick standard  construction problem, which relates to the traited question on our Phylosophy subsection.
Entire Anderson library of constitutive promoters (J23100-J23119)
Our team achieved the 19 constructions of the Anderson library. Constructions were first designed in a software(Geneious v. 6.1.6)and then relized on web lab using iGEM 2014 Distribution kit. Verifications were made by eletrophoresis gel analytic PCR amplification and sequencing. Glycerol stock of 3 colonies per constructions were conserved and used for the measurments of GFP expression.
Unfortunatly, we did not collect satisfying data for the 19 constructions,although assays were repeated several times. The data profile was repeatable under people, apparatus and strain. Strain carrying promotorless vector seemed to had higher fluorescence intensity than strain containing constructions from the Anderson library, that explains negative curve on Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm graph. However exploitable data were collected for 5 constructions (100, 104, 105, 107 and 118) for which  the relationship between corrected GFP fluorescence and OD 600 nm was linear that corresponded to the expected profile for a constitutive promoter (See graph Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity according to OD 600 nm). Corrected GFP fluorescence intensity at OD 600 nm = 0.45 of these 5 constructions were presented on bar chart above and compared with registry data on table below.
Ratio were calculated dividing constructions corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm by construction 100 corrected GFP fluorescence at 0.45 OD 600 nm.
Results were similar to registry results for the 100, 105 and 107 constructions contrary to constructions 104 and 118 for which data were significantly divergent.

In our experiment, we use GFP as an indicative of the efficiency of miR-21-sponge-6s and miR-21-sponge-2s as mir-21 detectors, and quantified the mir-21 expression in the cells through the plasmid pHAGE-pre-mir-21. Then we gathered our data and plotted them into two standard curves on excel. Through comparing the slope of standard curves of miR-21-sponge-2s and miR-21-sponge-6s respectively, we determine that miR-12-sponge-2s is more sensitive than miR-21-sponge-6s.

""Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result."" - Oscar Wilde
PAST
Two-hybrid screening is a way to determine protein-protein interactions or protein-DNA interactions. The system utilizes the response of a protein with two catalytic domains which in cooperation catalyzes a reaction/process (e.g. syntheses of a compund or activation of transcription). Seperation of the two domains into individual peptides results in inactivation of the protein due to spatial seperation. The function can however be restored if the two domains are brought in close proximity, which can be accomplished by linking each domain to proteins or a protein and DNA that interacts with each other. Thus, coupling of the response resulting from the catalytic activity of the two domains with a reporter gene, enables for dertermination of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.
Our design is built around the catalytic activity of the adenylate cyclase in E. coli, which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphat (cAMP) from ATP in the bacteria. The catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase can be divided into 2 fragments; T18 and T25. When these 2 subunits come together, it enables the production of cAMP"

On April 1st,                             our team and the teams in Jiangnan University held a meetup for a more detailed assistance provided by our team leader on how to succeed in meeting cardinal dues in iGEM competition and which aspects should be given high attention.                             We also imparted several tips on team management.                             In turn, Jiangnan iGEM team promised whatsoever help they are capable of to us.
During Conference of China iGEMer Community,                             our team with them also gained a chance to have a deeper glance of our mutual projects.                             By this chance, both of our projects had undergone the test from questions come up by each other.
HKU
During the Asia-Europe Meeting in Shen Zhen,                             our team had a brief discussion about us projects with Hong Kong University (HKU).                             On 27th July, we went to Hong Kong to have a thorough and impressive meeting with the iGEM team in HKU.                             Both of us had a great interest in each other’s project and would like to seek further collaboration.
Euro-Asian meetup
On July 25, 7 members of our team went to Shenzhen to attend the iGEM2018 Asia-Europe Meeting held by BGI-CHINA and TU Delft.                             After three days, we are gratified that our design ideas have been recognized by friends from all over the world.                             During the presentation and poster session,                             we received a lot of support from other university’s iGEM teams.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#team_-_-_TEXT.html," can always keep up a positive atmosphere even in the darkest of times, and she smiles perpetually whether appropriate or not.
Over the summer, she has learnt many things, including how to write and, to some extent, understand HTML code. That in itself is quite an accomplishment. In the few hours left where she isn't working on iGEM (or sleeping), she likes to spend with her family and friends or just lying on her sofa watching TV.
Nobody knows what the academic future holds for Louise as she isn't really one to plan that far ahead. One could imagine her writing a Ph.d., possibly concerning cancer development, but we all look forward to being surprised!
Maria
If you are roaming the halls of SDU after midnight and you find yourself being spoken to in the imperative by a small woman, ordering you to fetch her more pipette tips, you've probably met Maria.
She is a 5th year biochemistry and molecular biology student. She is currently 24 years old but plans to change that some time in March next year. She shares a house with Sheila and their cat Clive. None of them are lovers (as far as we know). Maria has been heavily involved in the lab work, and although her main focus has been on developing the photosensor, she has been busy answering questions from all corners of the lab, earning her the title of Lab Mom. Additionally, she has accumulated a significant number of nicknames, such as Queen of Unfunny Land, Shorty, Hamster, the Little One and Eagle Eyes. Don't even ask.
When she's not being benignly bullied by her teammates, she enjoys walking, baking cakes and folding her clothes with disturbing precision. In the future you will probably find her bossing people around in her own lab, while simultaneously answering never ending phone calls from confused lab rats.
Marie
Marie is 20 years old and has just begun her third year of studies of biochemistry and molecular biology. Her work in the iGEM project has primarily been focused on creating the retinal generator along with Tommy and Christian, which has probably been quite a handful.
In the rare hours when she's not working on iGEM, she earns a little extra money in IKEA by helping people find the bookcase that’s exactly right for them, or she spends time with the people closest to her. When she's alone, she knows of nothing better than to sit in a comfortable chair with a good book, jazz on the radio and a glass of white wine.

9. Repeat the washing procedure (step 8) using 500 µL of the Wash Solution.
10. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge for an additional minute to remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
11. Transfer the GeneJET spin column to a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of the GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to touch the membrane with the pipette tip. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 2 min.
Note. An additional elution step (optional) with Elution Buffer or water will recover residual DNA from the membrane and increase the overall yield by 10-20%. For elution of plasmids or cosmids >20 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 70°C before applying to silica membrane.

PCR Purification
Materials:
PCR mixture
Thermo Scientific GeneJET PCR Purification Kit
Protocol:
1. Add a 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to completed PCR mixture and mix thoroughly. Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow.
2. Transfer up to 800 µL of the solution from step 1 to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow-through.

Back again to our SynRT, we made an improvement that we did a site-directed mutagenesis of sfGFP (BBa_I746916) and got sfGFP（BbsI free）for Golden Gate assembly. We would like to constructed a standard part of sfGFP(BbsI free)(BBa_K2541401). However, after several trials, we failed in ligation, then we decided to request TUST_China to help us. We sent them our plasmid for fluorescence measurement and primers for the construction of sfGFP(BbsI free). Luckily, they finished the construction for us and provided useful suggestions in ligation: you can increase the ratio of insert to vector, from 3:1 to 10:1. After the construction, they sequenced and sent it to us, which was correct.

We really appreciated it that they helped us in such an important experiment. Hoping that we can build long-time friendship and work for synthetic biology.

This year we collaborated with XJTU-China from Xi'an Jiaotong University and we helped them measure fluorescence, so they could get the relation between the concentration of psicose and fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, the relation between different concentration of psicose and pPsi promoter activation efficiency was obtained. We helped them verify that their Device A  (figure 7) works.
Figure 7. The plasmid backbone of device A.
PsiR is a repressor protein that binds to the pPsi promoter, rendering it inactive. Psicose and PsiR repressor proteins are combined to form a negative regulation induction system (similar to the IPTG and LacI), and psicose is added to the system to induce EGFP expression.
When they measured the Device A, the results were not quite as expected. They suspected that both LB culture medium and psicose in the system may probably make the bacteria grow. What’s more, the amount of psicose solution added to the system is not consistent, so different osmotic pressure may lead different growth conditions of bacteria. When our team did the measurement, we cultured the bacteria to OD=0.6 and then re-suspended the bacterial precipitation with MM culture medium."

TU_Darmstadt,2017,Team:TU Darmstadt#project#chitinase_-_-_TEXT.html,"] , we originally decided on this specific enzyme. Its enzymatic activity has also previously been tested on chitin pentamers. ChiA1 breaks down these chitin pentamers in two dimers and one N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) unit [8] . Its implementation would then give us a bigger variety of chitosan molecules.
The N-terminal domain in the ChiA1 is responsible for its catalytic activity. The C-terminal domain plays an important role in the hydrolysis of chitin, and is the reason ChiA1 has such a high affinity to the substrate [6] [8] [9] .
Figure 1. Structure of ChiA1. The Model shows the 3D structure of ChiA1. Structural Data from RCSB PDB. [10] .
Mechanism
A Chitinase's function is to break down chitin-oligomers into smaller molecules. ChiA1 turns chitinpentaose into two molecules of chitinbiose and one molecule of GlcNAc, by attacking the glycosidic bonds between the monomers [8] .
Figure 2. Mechanism of ChiA1. ChiA1 breaks down the glycosidic bonds between the GlcNAc units of a chitin pentamer, thus creating chitin dimers.
Methods
We ordered the chiA gene via IDT sequencing. First, we inserted this gene into the pUPD vector using a GoldenBraid assembly as this is a simple and fast cloning method [11] . For cloning the chiA gene into the pSB1C3 vector, we used the BioBrick system [12] .
After cutting the pUPD vector, which contains the chiA gene, and the pSB1C3 vector, with the restriction enzymes XbaI and PstI, dephosphorylating the backbone and subsequent ligation, we inserted the chiA gene succesfully into the pSB1C3 vector with an Anderson promoter with defined cleavage sites (BBa_K2380025) .
We used the same protocols inserting the chiA gene successfully into the pSB1C3 vector with an inducible promoter system. We altered the restriction enzymes to NheI and PstI for the pUPD vector with the chiA gene in order to exchange the Anderson promoter which is located on the pUPD vector. We have cut the pSB1C3 vector containing an AraC promoter system (BBa_K808000) with the restriction enzymes SpeI and Pst"

Part 1 is to validate whether the glutamate can regulate the gltAB promoter through GltC and to map glutamate concentration to tetracycline resistance. We chose GFP as our signal and will test the intracellular glutamate concentration, the transcription level of GltC, GFP, and the florescence intensity with different extracellular glutamate concentration.

Our project this year was to express human amyloid beta protein variants  in E. coli as a system for studying the molecular basis of aggregation. This research will contribute to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.
Human Practices
By interviewing physicians, educators, and community members, the Human Practices subteam was able to understand Alzheimer's disease from many different perspectives. We are showcasing what we've learned through an educational video aimed to increase public knowledge and destigmatize those living with Alzheimer's.
Dry Lab
The Dry Lab will be supporting the Wet Lab to develop an algorithm for NGS data analysis and modelling. We will also be collaborating with the Human Practices team to create a NGS video game.
The Team
From our members to our sponsors and all those have helped us along the way, nothing would have been accomplished without our team. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.

Homology Modeling Molecular Dynamics Enzyme Models Pulling Simulation KM for CsADH2946 References
Summary
The three enzymes in our crocin pathway are relatively newly discovered and thus poorly characterized, with no structures available. In addition, we were only able to find enzymatic parameters concerning one of the enzymes, UGTCs2 (1). Via homology modeling we could draw the conclusion that UGTCs2 and CaCCD2 are monomers while CsADH2946 is a tetramer. We could also ensure that the N-terminal was facing outward from the protein and could safely put a His-tag there for purification. Furthermore, the extensive 100 ns MD simulation of our models verified that the models were stable in solvent and that we could further work with the models to estimate the binding affinity between enzyme and substrate. Steered molecular dynamics simulations showed that CsADH2946 is specific to its substrate crocetin dialdehyde and that it has an affinity in the µM range to the substrate. The estimation of KM from the experimental activity measurements also showed that CsADH2946 has a high affinity towards the substrate crocetin dialdehyde, in agreement with Steered Molecular Dynamics results.
Homology Modeling of the Uncharacterized Enzymes
One of the first things we noticed when looking at our selected enzymes was that no three-dimensional structures were available and the enzymes were poorly characterized in general. To be able to get structural information we turned to homology modeling.
The idea of homology modeling is to construct a 3D-structure by mapping the amino acid sequence onto a template – i.e. a known structure of a related, homologous protein through sequence alignment. For this to work you need a template with a solved 3D-structure. The quality of the model is determined by the alignment with, and, the structure of the template. Thus, ideally, you would like a high-resolution structure with high sequence identity.
The tool we used to generate our homology models was SwissDock /2/, a fully automated protein structure homology-modeling server (2, 3, "

Silicatein-Alpha Characterization
We have decided to use scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and a live dead assay (specifically, the Baclight Bacterial Viability Kit from Invitrogen).   Further assays will be done once the two constructs are used within the same bacteria.

IoT (internet of Things) technology currently shows multiple application in aquaculture management.
Li is majorly concerned about the biosafety of our design and we also think it is a key point on whether our product can be sold on the market or not. Let’s pay more attention on safety of our device!
Contact with fish farmers
To make our project and device have practical meaning, we contacted with different fish farmers and presented our project and device to them. Thanks to their feedback, we had better understanding about what fish farmers actually concerned about. In addition, we also found that most of the farmers are lack of basic scientific knowledge to deal with outbreak of fish diseased and ammonia nitrogen. This inspired us to put some effort on publicizing scientific knowledge among fish farmers.
Crab Farmers
Yancheng, Jiangsu Provice, China
Crab is one of the fresh water creatures that are extremely sensitive to water quality and to be specific, ammonia concentration. Therefore, we interviewed some crabs farmers to see what they think about our project.
Key point
Individual farmers lack of cultivation knowledge, so factory farming is not implemented on a large scale.
Experience still plays an important role in assessing pond water quality.
As for the pond water detection, online equipment is expensive while offline kits are complex and abstruse.
According to our communication with the crab farmers, we feet it important to design a product that farmers without much knowledge can use easily. Let’s make a convenient, cheap online device to help the farmers!
Sturgeon Farmers
Beijing, China
Since it is important to and learn about their opinions about ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with several farmers in Beijing, paid visits to their ponds and had face-to-face talks with farmers to get more information.
Key point
Fish farmers themselves do not care about biosafety, they only care about how customers think about their aquatic product.
Changing water is an efficient but expensive way to improve the water quality, only big companies can afford 200 thousand yuan per month on changing water.
Our project should aim at self-employed fish ponds instead of those big aquaculture companies.
Good water quality does make fish more tasty and fish can be sold for a higher price as long as the fish tastes good.

OUC-China,2015,Team:OUC-China#Project#Magnetic Receiver_-_-_TEXT.html," ferritin per cell, we explored a method for valuing protein concentration per cell, and tried to make it more convenient.
After biomineralization, we take a little bacterium that resuspended by PBS, and obtain the concentration of bacterium by Hemocytometer Counting, which is marked as C1(cells/ml). The other bacterium suspension is disrupted completely. After centrifugation, the suspernatant containing ferritin is used to do SDS PAGE, and then the optical density of the protein sample is obtained by using the gel imaging analysis system, then we can calculate the concentration of the sample, which is marked as C2(μg/ml).
The protein concentration per cell is marked as C, the formula as follows.
C=C2/C1 (μg per cell)
To obtain C2, we did SDS PAGE as follows. (Note: the SDS PAGE should be repeated for several times to get more accurate data.)
Lane 1, 0.5mg/ml BSA; Lane 2-4, ferritin suspernatant; Lane 5, suspernatant of bacterium containing empty plasmid; Lane 6, 1mg/ml BSA; Lane 7, 0.25mg/ml BSA; Lane 8, 0.1mg/ml BSA.
We use bovine serum albumin (BSA) at differernt concentrations to establish the standard curve that reveals the relation of optical density and protein concentration.
Firstly we used the gel imaging analysis system to establish the standard curve and directly calculated the concentration of samples. But the error was so big, that meant the arithmetic of the software couldn’t meet us need. So we established a new standard curve by simply changing the formula. Two new standard curves calculated from two SDS-PAGE pattern are as follows:
Fig.14. Two standard curves
To our surprise, the relation found from new formula doesn’t show the linearity we supposed before. Besides, we found that using gel imaging analysis system to analyze optical density has poor precision that the results have big difference between each other. We speculate it’s probably due to the grey level image processing by the system.
Unfortunately we still can’t conquer the problem that the targeted protein band is hard to measured if the band color is too deep. The stability of the results also troubled us. We decided to try Matlab to analyze our data for future work.

This gel has a dark band on the soluble fraction lane in the first row which is where our chromoprotein plus his tag should be. This is promising because it confirms our chromoproteins have the his tag present in them we Gibsoned in.

Safety and ethics
Prof. LAM Hon Ming is a faculty of School of Life Sciences in Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He is also a director of molecular biotechnology program and Center for Soybean Research in CUHK. His research field involves genomic and functional genomic studies of soybean and identification and characterization of functional genes to improve abiotic stress tolerance and disease resistance in plants. Prof. Lam helped us reflect upon the real life application of our project and led us to some new potential ideas regarding future application. He also talked extensively about safety and ethical issues that were relevant to synthetic biology and our project in general. The interview has greatly helped us to explore the non-technical aspects of our iGEM project that we have not yet examined in depth.
Interview with Professor LAM Hon Ming
Fig 1. Interview with Prof. Lam Hon Ming from Chinese University of Hong Kong
On the 26th of August 2014, the HKUST iGEM team recruited a group of members to interview Prof. Lam, director of the molecular biotechnology program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). We aimed to consult Prof. Lam about our main project- “Pneumosensor: Finding Pneumo”, in particular the safety and ethical aspects.
We have asked him for the general outlook of synthetic biology in the context of Hong Kong and of the world. He kindly replied by describing synthetic biology as a “promising way to make new things.” He agreed that synthetic biology is no longer confined in the field of biology but has since become an interdisciplinary field. He mentioned that synthetic biology has been “especially successful in bacteria” and proposes synthetic biology as a prospective area of science because it has the potential to provide  “new ways to handle environmental problems for which the later generation will try hard to further work on.”

MICROALGAE
Microalgae chloroplasts are an attractive platform for the production of recombinant proteins, and are targets of considerable research aiming to optimise carbon fixation and lipid biosynthesis. Despite this, the potential of chloroplast transformation is currently underexplored, due to it being time-consuming and costly. It is further hindered by the lack of standardised genetic parts available. We are developing biological methods and open-source hardware to remove these bottlenecks and building a library of modular genetic components for Chlamydomonas chloroplast.
Introduction
The traditional approach to production of recombinant proteins in bacteria is significantly limited, because bacteria lack most post-translational modifications, and are likely to produce proteins as insoluble aggregates. On the other hand, mammalian expression systems have poor expression yields, require complex media and growth conditions, and are very sensitive to contamination with pathogens.
The use of microalgae chloroplasts as an alternative expression system solves most of these issues and offers many other advantages. Microalgae chloroplasts have very efficient protein expression. They also have a range of post-translational modification pathways, and possess chaperones and disulfide isomerases, which allow for the correct folding of multi-component proteins. Unlike in higher plants, metabolic energy in microalgae is not directed towards maintaining complex differentiated structures, further enhancing transgene expression (which can total up to 30-50% of a cell’s dry biomass).
In addition to the outstanding transgene yields, microalgae are also very amenable to farming worldwide and outside of labs, as autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic growing conditions are all possible. They have a generally-acceptable-as-safe (GRAS) status and store well. Such properties render microalgae chloroplasts an interesting chassis for production of edible vaccines and virus-like particles. These can be used in developing countries, where classical vaccines are unaffordable and hard to store and apply safely.
On top of providing an attractive expression platform, chloroplasts are the target of a lot of research, aiming to"

Training Future iGEMmers
We assisted our school's next iGEM team and shared our experiences; like the hard works, assignments and spent precious time to                  come up with an intricate project. This interaction was really important for us as they were exploring synthetic biology for the                  first time as some high school students who were about to step into a project.
We believe in inspiring people; trying to get them in this endeavor to make synthetic biology known by more people. We believe                  that this way; science will be a primary branch in the development of our world and preferred by more and more people; all with                  fresh new ideas, approaches and different perspectives.
Since -just like we were- high school students are incredibly impressionable; we wanted them to be attracted to this field from                  such a young age in hopes that they will be passionate scientists, making major breakthroughs. They are our future and we wanted them                  to see the infinite possibilities from renewing our Earth to whatsoever they can imagine.
To us, the conference taught that further steps have to be taken with our project and the range of our human practices, that we have                  to reach out to more and more people and to show that, the problem we are focusing is not just the problem of our country, but the                  problem of the whole world and that we are all of changing.
Understandably so, every future iGEMmer was a bit anxious; but we could see the determination in their eyes. They had many questions                  aiming to understand the concept and the challenges they were about to face. We explained them the process and how to overcome the                  obstacles in their path. Perhaps from the presentation, we have done back in April, they had some familiarity with what we were doing                  and actually, some were influenced by that presentation while signing up for the project.
We wanted them to see that iGEM is beyond the lab bench; having many aspects to it other than just the lab work. They were                  surprised when we revealed that we have done many outside-the-lab works to contribute to our project. We also assured them how                  necessary teamwork and time management is in iGEM; and how they will learn so much about everything while preparing a project.
In full awareness of how very little can make or break something, we are proud of inspiring our successors and we hope many among                  our peers there will be future synthetic biologists.

The Edible coli is a proposal for this, but could only be accomplished through synthetic biology.This of course implies some ethical issues as discussed in the ""Ethics"" section. Synthetic biology and genetic modification, first and foremost, have a great opposition to overcome, regarding implementing these techniques in the production of food.
Apart from these considerations, for the Edible coli to become a reality, several more experiments has to be accomplished which will be discussed under next steps.

5 Marketing Plan
Industry Description
Our product is applicable to two industries: eduction and small-scale research. The biotechnology education market is steadily increasing as new discoveries come to light and equipment costs decrease. As biotechnology becomes more relevant to daily life, interest in biotechnology eduction has surged, from GFP transformation kits to participating in iGEM Highschool . There is also a growing applicability of biotechnology in a variety of contexts, from textile restoration to citizen science.
Target Markets
We have identified three markets: Education, Citizen Science and Field Research.
Education: Our primary market is science education in UK secondary schools. At present, schools are reported to have too little equipment for effective practical work and unable to offer a full range of practical lessons.  Better science laboratory facilities in schools should be a top priority . New facilities enable the pupils to gain a better understanding of the subject through more ‘hands on’ experience .
Field Research: A range of fields, from textile conservation to evolutionary biology, require the use of biotechnology, in particular PCR.
Citizen Science: Citizen scientists is a term used to described amateur or nonprofessional scientists that has gained popularity in recent years, including in research , science magazines and the maker community . As it is is difficult to estimate an accurate figure of molecular biology citizen scientists, we choose to approximate the size of a group by using the example of the DIYBio network. DIYBio presents a growing citizen science community of molecular biologists, biotechnologists and bioartists. Projects range from microbe mapping to yeast printing . DIY Science can be considered as an alternative approach to scientific experimentation . One common barrier is access to the technology, where cost and skills are both problems.
Market Analysis
As of January 2013 there are 3,281 state-funded secondary schools in the UK with approximately 3.2 million pupils. Science departments receive £9.89 per pupil . Schools submit yearly budgets on the July 31 . This results in approximately 32 million pounds allocated yearly towards secondary school science education.
We choose to approximate the citizen science group by examining the DIYBio network. As of October 2013, there are 42 groups DIYBio"

OUC-China,2015,Team:OUC-China#Note Book#Lab Journal_-_-_TEXT.html," PCR identification shows that the ligation of E and K1 last week is failed. Cun Wei did PCR identification of K3E, there are no target bands on the gel.
Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did gel extraction of K1, K3, J and E which had been digested. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did two ligations respectively. Both transformations were failed.
We found the problem of assemble, and ordered new T4 assemble. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did four groups of transformation: a) competent cells was spread on the plate without antibiotic. b) Plasmid was transformed into competent cells. c) Product of ligation was transformed into competent cells. d) The product of digestion was transformed into competent cells. Bacterium of a), b) and c) grew on the plate. This shows that the double enzyme digest and transformation has no problems.
Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan digested a lot of K1, K2, K3 and E. Ligation was down after gel extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan transformed product of ligation into DH5α competent cells. Bacterium of all experimental groups grew on the plate. The PCR identification shows that the ligations of K1 and E, K2 and E, K3 and E are successful.
Fig.6. The agarose gel electrophoresis shows that there are target bands on the gel, the target sequence band K1E is expected around 1040 bp, K2E is expected around 996 bp, K3E is expected around 1053 bp.

Restriction digest on EF1, EF2, EF3 and EF4
Gel electrophoresis of digestion, result: EF1 and EF3 appear to have an insert. The insert of EF4 is too short, between 1500 and 2000 bp (might just be ech) and EF2 appears to have been cut by only 1 enzyme
Also, restriction digest overnight results in an extra very weak intensity band at 600 and one between 1500 and 2000 bp
This result has been seen before on just ech. It might be due to an extra restriction site on the ech gene. The two bands could result from this same band. The addition of both bands would then be the same as the insert.

Cyano and Co-culture expert Daniel Ducat
In the beginning of our work with the three “Trinity” organisms we stumbled across several questions:  How should the growth media be composed?
How can we effectively use our cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus as a sugar producer?
How can we prevent the other organisms from overgrowing S. elongatus?
The synthesis of sugars in S. elongatus, especially aiming at a co-culture with heterotrophic organisms, has previously been shown by Dr. Daniel C. Ducat from Michigan State University. His Synechococcus cscB strain produces and exports sucrose in salt stress media. During our brainstorming sessions at the beginning of our iGEM journey, this strain was often named as a main example for the use of cyanobacteria in a co-culture. Finally, we decided to contact Dr. Ducat and asked him for advice and good ideas regarding co-cultures with cyanobacteria.
Luckily, he was on a symposium visit in Germany in May 2018 and offered to visit us and provide us with the cscB strain. In a private meeting, he suggested to use a sps (sucrose phosphate synthase) overexpressing Synecchococcus strain. Thus, we would be able to have sucrose production and export, without having to induce high salt stress in the culture media with NaCl. Although sucrose production would be less effective we could prevent the negative effects of salt stress"

Our Design
We constructed an operon that would enable us to regulate the expression of the gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with the fluoride riboswitch, called CHOP (Figure 5). We ordered the synthetic operon from IDT DNA with overhangs that have homology to the pSB1A3 vector so we could clone our operon in with Gibson. We used the pSB1A3 vector because we are regulating the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and we need to use the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, that is kanamycin resistant. We constructed the operon so that it is easy for future users to use Gibson cloning to add a new “promoter riboswitch segment” by cutting with HindIII or a new gene by cutting with XhoI. Check out our part BBa_KK2990000 for the correct overhangs for Gibson.
Figure 5: Schematic of the fluoride riboswitch regulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP)
How CHOP works:
Using the ΔcrcB E. coli strain, which can accumulate fluoride intracellularly
The Riboswitch detects fluoride
Fluoride activates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme
Which allows for the growth of bacteria on agar plates with the antibiotic chloramphenicol

    Last southern summer, Brazil, as a tropical country, faced an enormous dengue fever epidemic problem. Dengue is transmitted by infected mosquitos within the genus Aedes, which lay its eggs in standing water containers. During brazilian summer, it is used to rain a lot and, if there are rain-water-exposed recipients, the chances of spreading dengue fever increases.
    Based on that issue, Brasil-USP and UFSCAR-Brasil teams organized a play to be presented to children,and, in a playful manner, aware them about dengue's disease danger and transmission, as well as to counsel them on how to avoid a new epidemic. Our teams met children from ‘PROVIM Dom Luciano Mendes de Almeida’, a communitarian center intended to attend children from a not so wealthy neighborhood (São Carlos VIII) in São Carlos/SP, and presented them a play called “The Mighty Bacteria against Dengue”. At that presentation, it was possible to show them a little about dengue fever disease symptoms, a little about what one may do if under those symptoms and ways to prevent it of happening.
    With that, we were able to introduce, in a very simple way, how science - in especial synthetic biology - could help. Both of our projects (UFSCar-Brasil team’s and Brasil-USP team’s) were represented at the play by two super bacteria: a mosquito-repellent one and a rubber-digester one.
    By the end of the day, all those children were divided in groups in order to plan Crotalaria juncea, a plant that helps in dengue control. Children’s feedback was"

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"ingham High School and MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound summer program students . We allowed them to brainstorm and ask questions on the safety concerns involved in synthetic biology experimentation. SynFlo allowed students to kinesthetically work with Microsoft Surfaces and manipulate Sifteo cubes which simulated working with E.Chromi experiment .  An animated contamination could also be simulated; allowing students to appreciation basic biosafety issues and understand the severity of impact if safety regulations are not followed.
Safety issue concerns
As a computational team, we did not create new BioBrick devices, but simulated the hierarchical creation of these devices in the MoClo Planner software.  In effect, laboratory safety can be increased by exposure to software simulating synthetic biology experiments, as our user study student subjects expressed increased understanding and appreciation of both the theory and technical aspects of Golden Gate Modular Cloning after testing the MoClo Planner software. Various errors and warning messages were created in the software itself to educate students on how to create a BioBrick which were refined with each user study.  We used Eugene , a software program created by the Densmore Lab at Boston University , as part of the back-end algorithm for creating rules and generating permutations of biological parts in Level 1 of our program.  In addition, we created our own software rules in the primer designer regulating the use of fusion sites and the order of our synthetic biology constructs as they become Level 2 modules (see Design).  While we did not create concrete BioBrick parts, our efforts indirectly inspire safer creation of BioBricks in the future.
Keeping ourselves and our users safe
The Institutional Biosafety Committee, under the Wellesley College Office of Environmental Healthy & Safety regulates biosafety concerns on campus.  However, we are a computational team and do not work with biological organisms or hazards in our local lab environment.
The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction lab does test iterations of our software projects with human subjects.  Before each testing session, participants were asked to sign consent forms detailing the voluntary nature of the study, the task involved in the study, and informed the participants that if at any time during the study they experienced discomfort they are permitted to stop and leave.  We were extremely sensitive to a user’s physical, mental, and emotional demands during each study, taking notes on physical and verbal cues from students; we were very assuring during the study, and informed our users that any crashes or technical difficulties were our fault as designers and programmers and in no way their fault or responsibility.  After each study the user task was altered or refined further to clarify the task and increase student comfort in testing"

SSRI
Summer Science Research Institute
The Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI) connects New Haven high school students with research labs at Yale University. The SSRI invites guest lecturers to present Friday lunchtime workshops that supplement the students’ work. On July 24, Lionel, Holly, Jessica, and Erin had the opportunity to give a brief overview of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the controversy surrounding them, and our own summer project. After quickly reviewing the history of synthetic biology and its applications in biofuels and agriculture, we dove into a discussion of the ethical issues related to the synthetic production of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug derived from the wormwood plant. Students compared the economic and human consequences of producing artemisinin traditionally and synthetically. They weighed the importance of stable pharmaceutical prices and accessibility to medicine against the cost of driving thousands of farmers out of work. Then we transitioned into a discussion of five important ethical considerations that guide our assessment of emerging technology — public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation, and justice and fairness — and how they might apply to the production of biofuels using microbes. Finally, we explained our workflow for porting MAGE into cyanobacteria and rhizobium. The SSRI students asked many great questions about the MAGE cycle, especially regarding the synthetic oligos that are repeatedly introduced into the cells. It was enlightening and gratifying for us to explain our project to our peers who were interested in research but hadn’t really heard of synthetic biology or GMOs (besides Monsanto).

LGBTQ Survey
In August, Yale iGEM sent out an anonymous survey to the iGEM community to gauge how open and welcoming the iGEM community is to LGBTQ individuals. iGEM is an ideal organization to survey as it is a small community with members who come from various backgrounds. The results of the survey show a large distribution in how members perceived their work environment"

This enabled them to carry out their project successfully as they were able to use all the parts that they wanted. We transformed all four parts from storage into the E. coli DH5α strain before mini-prepping, nano dropping and posting to them. This was repeated when the first package did not arrive.
SVCE Chennai
We filled in team SVCE Chennai 's survey on lab techniques to pass on our experiences of protocols that worked, and others which didn't, in order to help them improve efficiency for other iGEM teams in the future.
Illinois
We were in regular contact with Illinois UIUC throughout the project. We planned to test their promoter systems in our flow cytometer to provide a measure of cell variance for them and they would try to integrate our copper chelator Csp1sfGFP with their promoter system to see if that would create more even expression and maybe reduce the protein's expression issues. As we both were delayed in getting our part constructs prepared we ran out of time to carry this out fully.

Figure 8. The EL222 blue light repressible system.
EL222 is expressed constitutively. In the absence of blue light, the EL222 monomer is unable to bind to the promoter, allowing RNAP to transcribe the target gene, hence the ON state. When blue light is present, EL222 dimerizes and sits on its binding site in the promoter. This blocks the binding of RNAP and represses expression of the target gene, resulting in the OFF state.
Figure 9. Gene circuit for characterization of EL222 blue light promoters.
mRFP, the reporter, is placed under the blue light inducible promoter, PBLind, and repressible promoter, PBLrep, respectively. Different degradation tags such as YbaQ are fused to the end of the mRFP gene.
To elucidate the strength, sensitivity, and leakiness of PBLrep, and its inducible counterpart, PBLind, we performed many rounds of characterization experiments. This was essential in providing us with insights for its subsequent integration into bioproduction to drive target gene expression. The characterization involves the use of mRFP as a reporter placed under the control of the promoters. However, the output was not representative of the ON/OFF status of the promoter as a result of the accumulation of mRFP, which has a long half-life. To resolve this, we introduced degradation tags of varying strengths so that the mRFP produced would be targeted for quicker proteasomal degradation (Figure 9). This improves on our previous model for promoter characterization.
Figure 10. Blue light repressible control of enzyme expression.
Both enzymes, F3’H and FNS, are placed under the control of PBLrep. In the presence of blue light, expression of enzymes are repressed. Switching off blue light will enable enzyme expression.
Through our characterization experiments, we also found PBLrep to be better suited for our system due to its relatively lower leakiness, further justifying our choice of a repressible system. Hence, we replaced the chemically-inducible promoters, which were originally used to control the expression of our biosynthetic genes F3’H and FNS, with PBLrep (Figure 10). To verify that our blue light repressible system works as intended, we demonstrated that cells that were exposed to blue light throughout the course of biosynthesis had a significantly lower yield.
Our project thus built upon the landmark study on optogenetically-regulated bioproduction in"

1.3.3 Method
Figure 8. input device
Figure 9. verification device
Process:
1. Co-transform our input device and verification device into BL21(DE3) competent cell and plate it onto a selective plate, incubate it at 37 ℃ for 14 hours.
2. Pick 3 different single colonies numbered 1, 2, 3 into 3 tubes of LB broth with its corresponding antibiotic and incubate it respectively at 37℃ for 8 hours.
3. Add 5ul of previous single colony cultural from each tube to two new tubes named A,B respectively with M9 broth in it. Add 0.1ul IPTG to all A tubes (1A, 2A, 3A) while add nothing to all B tubes (1B, 2B, 3B). Incubate them at 37℃ for 4 hours.
4. Measure the fluorescent intensity by the enzyme-labeled instrument.
Prediction:
a) If the fluorescent degree in cultural tubes with IPTG showed much less weaker than in the tubes without it, then it indicated that the device had achieved its function for reducing the expression of Cre protein as expected.
b) If the fluorescent degree in the cultural tubes with IPTG showed almost same or even stronger than in the tubes without it, it meant that the devices had lost its function. However, there may be 3 reasons which are responsible for its failure. The first reason may be the failed function of riboregulator to repress the translation process. Secondly, despite the strong repression dueing to the riboregulator, the leakage expression of Cre protein can still express a little bit Cre protein which may cause the same result of a device without riboregulator. Thirdly, the low production of lacI in BL21(DE3) bacteria is unable to repress the operon efficiently which leads to the high expression of both taRNA and cre mRNA and thus weaken the function of riboregulator.

After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.

Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Project#Mutation#EpPolI_-_-_TEXT.html," rate of the chromosomal DNA was observed (Troll et. al 2014). During replication, the EP-Pol I is replaced by DNA-Polymerase III. This leads to the conclusion that with increasing distance from the replacement point the frequency of EP-Pol I mutations decrease (Allen et. al 2011). In this paper, they also wrote that the EP-Pol I synthesizes 400 nt to 500 nt after the ori, but during a skype conversation with Manel Camps, he said that this is not the case. It seems that the mutations are randomly distributed over the plasmid and that only a few base pairs at the start are synthesized by DNA-Polymerase I. According to Alexander et. al (2014) the EP-Pol I generates more than one mutation per kb. The substitution of the four different bases has various probabilities (figure 1).
Figure 2: Base substition. The substitution frequencies for all bases made by the EP-Pol I are shown. Figure adapted from (Badran et. al 2015).
EP-Pol I system
For an efficient use of the EP-Pol I it is recommended to use the E. coli JS200 strain, that carries a knockout of the native Pol I as well as a temperature sensitive DNA polymerase I, which can compensate the knockout at a certain temperature (Camps et. al 2003). With the use of JS200 it is possible to switch between EP-Pol I (mutation phase) and DNA polymerase I (no mutation phase). At 30 °C the DNA polymerase I is active and synthesizes the plasmids, because it is more efficient and faster than the low fidelity EP-Pol I (Camps et. al 2003). When changing to 37 °C the DNA polymerase I is no longer active and the EP-Pol I begins to mutate the DNA sequence (Alexander et. al 2014).
To effectively occupy the EP-Pol I we use a two-plasmid system developed by Manel Camps (figure 3). One plasmid has a pSC101 ori (Pol I-independent) and the EP-Pol I sequence and the other plasmid has the ColE1 ori and our Evobody sequence. Therefore, only the plasmid with the Evobody sequence will be mutated. This is a directed evolution, because only the target DNA sequence and not all the available DNA is mutated (Alexander et. al 2014). By applying this system to the JS200 strain we are able to switch between a mutation"

UESTC_Life,2013,Team:UESTC Life#Results and Discussion_-_-_TEXT.html," DhaA+P2A+HheC gene incubated in LB medium with 2,3-DCP(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration of 2,3-DCP and its mediate product epichlorohydrin were measured by GC.
γ-HCH Biodegradation and F2A cleaving achieved
Growth of E.coli strain MC1061 transformed LinA+F2A+LinB and LinA gene in LB medium with inducer and 5Mm γ-HCH  respectively, as the substrate was monitored in batch culture. The result was screened by GC analysis(Fig.4). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass and γ-PCCH et. But the available column is limited that the intermediate product can’t be detected. Through SDS-PAGE analysis, F2A could cleave LinA and LinB(Fig.5). LinB would degrade the intermediate product ofγ-HCH.
Fig.4. E.coli MC1061 carried LinA and LinA+F2A+LinB gene incubated in LB medium withγ-HCH(5mM) at 30℃. The concentration ofγ-HCH were measured by GC.
FIG.5. SDS-PAGE analysis. Supernatant and sediment collected after breaking cell. Lane1 and lane2 are blank control; in the lane3 and lane5 LinA and LinB are solved in the buffer.; in the lane 7 and lane8, F2A peptide sequence has cleaved LinA and LinB, both of them are solved. The most of protein, LinA+F2A+LinB, is in the sediment as an inclusion body.
P2A being an excellent linker in chimeric protein
As for P2A peptide sequence, it didn’t cleave the DhaA and HheC, and the chimeric protein was linked by P2A peptide. (FIG.6).
DhaA+P2A+HheC gene were expressed in E.coli strain MC1061. Separating supernatant and sediment of the broken cell liquid and used colorimetric method to detect the activity with TCP and 1,3-DCP.(FIG.7). DhaA+P2A+HheC in supernatant has activity of DhaA and HheC, while in sediment, it doesn’t have this ability.
Only if four single HheC compose as a tetramer can it catalyze dehalogenation"

1. 100 µl of chemocompetent E.coli cells were defrosted. Thaw on ice.
2. Agar plates were taken out of 4 oC to warm to room temperature.
3. 10 µl of ligation reaction or 2 µl of plasmid purified DNA was added to cells. The cells and DNA were mixed by gently flicking the tube.
4. Cell and DNA mixture was left on ice for 20 minutes.
5. Mixture was placed in 42 oC water bath for 90 seconds.
6. Mixture was put back on ice for 2 minutes.
7. 1 ml of LB (without antibiotic) was added to cells.
8. Cells were allowed to grow for 1 hour at 37 oC in a shaking incubator.
9. Cells were then spun down and the supernatant discarded.
10. The pellet was resuspended in the 100 µl of remaining media.

Plasmid Purification
1. 1-5 ml bacterial overnight culture was pelleted by centrifugation at >8000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature.
2. Pelleted bacterial cells were resuspended in 250 µl of Buffer P1 and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube.
3. 250 µl of Buffer P2 was added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until solution becomes clear.
4. 350 µl of Buffer N3 was added and immediately and thoroughly mixed by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
5. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm in a microcentrifuge.
6. The supernatant was applied to a QIAprep spin column by pipetting.
7. The QIAprep spin column was washed with 500 µl of Buffer PB by centrifugation for 1 minute and flow through discarded.
8. 750µl of Buffer PE was added to the QIAprep spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute and flow through discarded.
9. The QIAprep spin column was spun for an additional minute to remove residual wash buffer.
10. The QIAprep spin column was placed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge and the DNA eluted by adding 50 µl of H2O to the QIAprep spin column and centrifug"

Cooperation
Capacity for teamwork is one major feature and character of the iGEM competition . Since we first met team frankfurt at the Achema our paths crossed on several occasions. During these occasions we came up with the idea to give them support by modelling their enzymes. The simulations group performed modelling studies for three enzymes of the Frankfurt iGEM Team.
For the Saccharomyces HMG CoA Reductase and Sulfolobus GGPP Synthase we were not able to build homology models, but their Saccharomyces FPP Synthase (SFPPS) worked out. The results for the developed models can be seen in the following pictures.

Side view of SFPPS
Surface charge of SFPPS
The Sulfolobus GGPP Synthase (SGGPPS) sequence contains 262 residues in 1 molecule. We used 1VIZ chain A, 2F6U chain B and 3VK5 chain A.
For the target sequence of the Saccharomyces HMG CoA Reduktase (SHMGR) with 536 residues in 1 molecule. Hence the target sequence was the only available information we identified modelling templates by running various PSI-BLAST iterations. We used 1DQA chain A (Human Hmg-coa Reductase) and 2R4F chain A (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a Reductase). Unfortunately, our hybrid model could not be improved by copying parts from other models.
