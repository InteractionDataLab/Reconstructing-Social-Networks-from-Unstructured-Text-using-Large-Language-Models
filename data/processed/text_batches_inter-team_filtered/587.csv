Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," Like Lsr, the Lux system is important in bacterial quorum sensing. The operon consists of a Lux promoter and its regulator, LuxR. The system is controlled by the signal AHL (N-Acyl homoserine lactone), emitted by the gram negative bacterial species V. fischeri. After diffusing through the cell membrane, two molecules of AHL bind with two molecules of LuxR protein. The complex then binds to the promoter, upregulating transcription of downstream genes.
We plan to ligate the LuxR operon with a fluorescent protein gene. If the circuit works properly, the bacteria will fluoresce when surrounding bacterial population sizes increase.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Project#Chemotaxis#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"B and CheY are important to understand chemotaxis of single cell.
Figure 1[1]: Chemotaxis signaling conponents  and oathways for E.Coli.
The model based on Spiro et al. (1997) [1] was used to identify candidates of the chemotaxis receptor pathway. The methylation level of receptors, phosphorylation level of CheY and CheB were studied from Spiro’s model(Figure 2-Figue3). With receptor concentration per cell equals to 8x10-6mole/L, the lower threshold concentration of chemoattractant that the bacterium start to detect is 10-8mole/L. The saturation level is 10-6mole/L  in which concentration or higher the bacteria’s movements to chemoattractant are less efficient. In addition, the relation between chemoreceptor concentration and the lower threshold and staturation level were also studied (Figure 5).
The quantity that links the CheY-p concentration with the type of motion (run vs. tumble) is called bias. It is defined as the fraction of time spent on the directed movement with respect to the total movement time. The relative concentration  of CheYp is converted into motor bias using a Hill function (Euqation 1)[5]. A graph describes bias against CheY-p concentration was shown in Figure 5.
Figure 2: [Phosphorylated CheY]/ [CheY]
Figure 3: [Phosphorylated CheY]/ [CheY]
Figure 4: [Phosphorylated CheB]/ [CheB]
Figure 6: The dependency of Bias on the concentration of CheY-p
Simulation of chemotaxis of bacteria population
The part of modeling focused on creating the movement model of bacteria population for chemotaxis. In order to accurately built this model, the following assumptions are made based on literature:
1) During the directed movement phase, the mean speed of an E. coli equals 24.1 μm/s, varying speed between 17.3 μm/s  and 30.9 μm/s [7]. Whereas during the tumbling phase, the speed is significantly smaller and can be neglected.
2) E.Coli usually take previous second as their basis on deciding whether the concentration has increased or not. Therefore, in our model the bacteria will be able to compare the concentration of chemattractant at t second and t-1 second.
3) In our model, we ignored that E.Coli do not travel in straight line during run, but take curved paths"
Michigan,2014,Team:Michigan Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the irreproducibility of protocols. Furthermore, 100% of respondents indicated they would use a database like this to browse and download protocols, and over 85% indicated they would upload and maintain their own protocols if such a site existed ( click here for a complete list of results ). With these data and interest in hand, we set out to build ProtoCat.
Aims
The aims of this project were threefold:
To start an iGEM software team at the University of Michigan and populate it with a diverse population of students.
To construct useful software for laboratory scientists. We designed the protocol database project based on our own and other's frustrations in identifying reliable and effective scientific protocols.
To use our basic project idea to survey a wide range of scientific students and professionals to determine exactly what the best iteration of this project would do and adapt our goals as such.
Methods
Our project is based on Django, a free, open-source web framework, written in Python. Django allows us to create a simple, database-driven website which:
• can be hosted on any server (or locally).
• is modular and can be molded to specific individual needs.
• is built on a well-documented , easy to learn framework.
Our web application can be downloaded from Github and easily installed on any computer with Django/Python. Our implementation uses an embedded SQLite database, although a number of databases can be used.
Success
- Formed a brand new iGEM team! On top of that, we all learned new languages for this :)
- Reached out to and engaged the scientific community to create awareness for the problem and prioritize the development of a solution.
- Created ProtoCat, a functional registry for laboratory procedures.
Future Directions
- Variable protocols with integrated calculators: Our next step is to allow users to create calculator functions for specific tasks, and embed them with the protocol.
- vendor information: allow direct linking to reagents, materials, etc. from vendors.
- in-app purchasing: allow users to directly purchase reagents, materials, etc. that are included in the protocol, through third-party vendors.
- protocol timer
-As far as the team goes, we plan to reach out to more people next year; as fun as this smaller group was, we want to ensure that we have a greater variety of skillsets and thought processes to contribute to the best project possible

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Project#Labwork#Week1#Week2_-_-_TEXT.html," BBa_J04450 (with plasmid PSB1AT3). The cells were cultured on ampicillin-covered agar plates overnight after being treated with both the BioBrick DNA and the competence inducer calcium chloride. Only 10 colonies emerged on the ampicillin-covered plates - 2 cultures transformed with BioBrick BBa_I13522 and 8 cultures transformed with BioBrick BBa_J04450.
These cultures were then placed in some nutrient broth and left overnight to replicate and amplify the plasmid concentration. Today, we will process these cultures of cells by extracting and purifying the plasmid DNA - this will then be used in DNA electrophoresis to confirm that the DNA inherited by the ampicillin resistant bacteria are the BioBricks we inserted.
Observations
The above image shows the appearance of the 10 tubes after a night of incubation in the shaker. Tubes 1 and 2 showed yellow, translucent cultures, whereas tubes 3-10 showed red, translucent cultures. This is because tubes 1 and 2 contain E.coli transformed by the biobrick BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) which encodes Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) whereas tubes 3-10 carry the BioBrick BBa_J04450 (with plasmid PSB1AT3), which encodes RFP (Red Fluorescence Protein).

Making up Solution II
The procedure states that Solution II should be made 'fresh' so we had to make it today and before we carried out the rest of the procedure. The solution is made up of the following:
2ml NaOH (1M)
1ml 10%SDS
7 ml water
Because the volumes and the molarities of the recipe were given and because the solutions of NaOH and SDS were made up already, there was no need for calculations.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," that can be used to improve efficiency of agriculture. The last presentation was given by Asst. Prof. Dr. Dirk Stemerding from the Dutch Rathenau Institute. He initiated an interactive and ethical discussion about how science should take social aspects into account like societal needs and values and how it should communicate to the society. It was very interesting to hear the opinions of so many young researchers!
After the talks we had a really nice lunch together with the other iGEM teams in order to regain strength for the upcoming poster presentations. The poster session was a breathtaking experience: It was overwhelming to see how much effort even undergraduate students can put into their projects! Next to providing antiserums against snake-poisons we were informed about the extensions of the genetic code, which demonstrates the diversity and innovation each iGEM team spreads into the world of science! This showed us yet again, how proud each team id of their scientific ambitions. After listening to each project description and building cooperations, all iGEM participants joined for a big photo. Last but not least we all met up for a united BBQ and celebrated each other’s achievements.
We want to thank all participants for this event and especially the iGEM team from TU Delft for organizing of such a big and well prepared experience! :)
German Meetup in Dresden
From the 30th of June until the 2nd of July we participated in the German-Wide iGEM-Meetup. We were invited by the iGEM team Dresden to visit them in their beautiful city. After a long adventurous ride across Germany we arrived in Dresden in the late afternoon. On Friday evening all teams met at the park for some icebreaker-games and a party afterwards. It was amazing to meet people who share the same passion – synthetic biology.
On Saturday every participating iGEM team gave a short talk about their project and some captivating discussions followed. After the student talks Marcel Thiel from Promega gave a talk about qRT-PCR troubleshooting. In the early evening team Dresden showed us around the city and surprised us with a Tortilla-Party. Having their iGEM Goes Green project in mind they served a variety of delicious vegan food and paid special attention to environmental sustainability.
On Sunday they held an iGEM Goes Green workshop to inform us how to reduce our carbon footprint in and outside the lab. It is disturbing how much waste we produce in our labwork and how easy it is to reduce it. The workshop was really impressing and energized for thinking. Furthermore they organized a collaboration speed dating where all teams could discuss about possible ways to help each"

Denitrification
This week we modified our PCR protocol to adjust for the homemade taq polymerase we were using. Template DNA was boiled for 10 minutes on its own to replace the initialization step. This is because this polymerase could not tolerate the 95 degree heat during the regular initialization step. Another modification we made was to boil our primers for 5 minutes prior to adding them to the master mix. This was done to discourage the formation of primer dimers. Finally we also attempted a touch down PCR which started at an annealing temperature greater than the Tm of our primers and gradually worked its way down to below the Tm of the primers. This was done to increase the specificity of our reaction and also eliminate the formation of primer dimers. Unfortunately these techniques still saw the formation of dimers, preventing us from performing a PCR purification. Again, the gel purification procedure did not lead to successful purification of our target gene. Due to the problems we have had so far our goal for next week is to perform an assay experiment to try and determine which of the Pseudomonas putida strains we have access to can actually degrade carbazole and therefore contain the pCAR1 plasmid.
Week 10 (July 2-July 6)
Decarboxylation
The main goal this week was to repeat the transformation and verification steps that were done previously with AAR for the petrobrick (submitted by the University of Washington). This involved transforming the petrobrick into E.coli, colony PCR for verification of a successful transformation, followed by mini-preparation and restriction digest. Results were submitted for gene sequencing. If the sequencing results come back as being successful (showing a high rate of complementarity), we will proceed forward with the production media protocol in an attempt to produce hydrocarbons.
Desulfurization
Top 10 E.coli cells were transformed with R0011 (IPTG inducible promoter in psb1C3 backbone), and resulting colonies were tested using cPCR.  Colony PCR was performed on cells containing the catalase biobrick. Catalase is 2217bp long but since biobrick primers add about 200bp, bands of 2400 bp were expected if the part was present in the biobrick. These bands were observed, indicating that the KatG-LAA gene was"
NAU-CHINA,2017,Team:NAU-CHINA#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," has been put into the development of control measures of Fusarium ear blight. Scientists, growers and food processors aim to develop effective control measures, including the reduction of mycotoxins.
Based on the above literature review, a questionnaire is designed to survey consumer groups’ opinions on FHB.
First, we would like to know whether the consumer group is concerned about wheat safety. Second, we try to give a simple test on the knowledge of the damage of FHB. By the way, we send the correct answer after people finishing the questionnaire. So they can get a feedback as soon as possible. Third, we want to introduce the biological control to the public.
This is our questionnaire
We have analyzed the data we have collected. The analysis results are as follows:
We have collected 411 valid questionnaires (all completed) at the end of the survey.
The participators come from 30 different provinces in China. Most of them are between 18-35 years old and have a bachelor degree.Here are results:
1.The concern about FHB
The survey shows that Only a few( 14.84%) respondents pay attention to the safety of the wheat in daily life. And some consumers(63.99%) have no idea about the situation of FHB. Some reasons for t having no appropriate approach to the information. Besides,Most consumers(74.94%) express their need to learn about the FHB and its damage,inculding36.25% o have a strong need.
2.The knowledge about FHB
The similar 4 questions shows people do not know the basic knowledge of FHB.There is a knowledge gap in wheat food safety. Over a half of the  respondents express they know few about wheat scab.We set an interference option about aflatoxin. But we find people have a more clear recognition of it  for 38.44% of the respondents can choose the right answer about the toxin FHB brings. Besides we set a feedback to all respondents after the respondents finishing the questionnaire. We hope they can know a little more from the questionnaire.
3.Summary
To summarize, though the results of the survey may be a bit partial and incomplete to some extent due to the small sample size, it is undeniable that people's knowledge about wheat scb is insufficient. Especially after we have learned consumers have a high request on the quality of food, we consider it is important to know the wheat scab and toxins involved.
Our NAU iGEM team aims to know exactly the public recognition of FHB, and  popularize the basics of FHB, its hazardous effects to people"

Meet Arashk Gasroddashti
Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.
When I saw you, it was dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin at first sight ;)

The star peptide- extending our results to other geometries
We should note that the only variable involved in this reaction is the distance between the active sites of the two enzymes involved in the reaction i.e. the point of production and the point of degradation. Combined with the fact that diffusion is a random process and equally likely in any direction, our results can be adapted to other geometries beyond a two enzyme tether. UniMelb iGEM informed as that they are able to synthesize two, four and six member systems.
As long as we recognize which distance, D, we are concerned with, the model can be adapted to any number of systems and an amplification factor, A can be defined as:

Using this relationship, we can predict the relative efficiencies of each of these systems by calculating their amplification factor normalized over the number of molecules in the system. What our results suggest is that increasing the number of enzymes attached in the system will always increase the efficiency of the setup although there will naturally be limitations to the number of enzymes that can be attached in one system.
Visualisations of the two-member, four-member and six-member systems that UniMelb iGEM are able to synthesize. The current setups alternate the two enzyme species.

Each fermentation process was maintained for 12 hour at 30 oC, and both of the end pH was                         around 4.6. Several samples were taken out carefully at some time points.
2) Product analysis
The comparison was made for product quality by using different strains. The results showed that                         the recombinant strain (NZ9000/pGMcA) had a little lower growth rate with regard the original                         host, but the function of the combinatory module was fully confirmed by measuring the content                         of the yogurts. The original host did produce GSH during the whole process, but the recombinant                         cells raised GSH concentration up to 11.8mg/l, which is quite comparable to the data in our                         laboratory. They also proved that the original host can produce a small amount of SAM during                         its growth process, but the introduction of our composite module did improved the SAM                         biosynthesis greatly. Moreover, high density (1.0 x 109/ml) of the strain NZ9000/pGMcA gave the                         good potential for their continuous biosynthesis of GSH and SAM in human gastrointestinal                         tract.

BIT,2018,Team:BIT#Hardware#Microarray_-_-_TEXT.html,"The chip is mainly divided into three materials:
PMMA layer, PDMS-CI mixed layer and pure PDMS layer: The PDMS-CI layer is a magnetic film layer, which is mainly made of CI and PDMS. It is one of the electromagnetically driven control elements and will be control liquid drive under the action of electromagnet. The pure PDMS layer is the main constituent material of the chip, which is used to implement various preset functions in the chip, and the PMMA layer is used for supporting the PDMS chip body.

3.3 Advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages: Compared to conventional peristaltic pump drives, electromagnetic drives are less expensive and smaller. The basic liquid drive can be achieved by simple electromagnetic action. In addition, the combination of the electromagnet and the magnetic film can also be used for the design of the solenoid valve to controlle the channel switch.
Disadvantages: The chamber size parameter of the chip has a great influence on the liquid driving effect, and the parameter exploration is more complicated. The PDMS-CI hybrid membrane production process is complicated and takes a long time. In addition to this, electromagnetic interference will also affect the experimental results.
3.4 Detailed steps to make the chip
3.4.1. Making CI-PDMS film
1) Add a 2:1 mass ratio CI powder and PDMS prepolymer to the centrifuge tube for thorough mixing and then add and mix the PDMS: curing agent mass ratio of 15:1 (curing agent density close to 1).
2) Vacuum pumping using a vacuum pump
3) Turn off the vacuum pump, deflate, and evacuate
4) Open the vacuum pump Check the operation of the silicone machine Note the change file
5) Use a clean piece of silicon (be careful not to touch the surface with your hand) into the  spin coater . Pour the vacuum-filled CI-PDMS mixed glue on it (note the amount of control).
6) After the silicone is finished, place the silicon wafer on the foil paper, put it into a 60 ° C heating box, and heat it for 1 hour.

Experiment: In a 96-well plate, initial concentrations of glucose ranging from 0.01% to 0.05% of the culture were studied. There are several possible effects that it could exert on cell growth and the hypotheses are stated below:
1.The lower the initial amount of glucose in the medium, the shorter the time taken for the population to reach saturation level.
2.The lower the initial amount of glucose in the medium, the lower the growth rate prior saturation level, but no delays on the time taken to reach saturation.
In addition, we also know that a lower amount of glucose means that the population will grow less and saturate at a smaller value.
Figure 1: Glucose growth curves We can see that initially, there is an exponential growth phase followed by saturation of growth once glucose has been used up. In this diagram, effects of different glucose concentrations on growth rate are not apparent. Instead, a more informative measure is the growth rate during the exponential growth phase. As we know, if the OD curves follow exponential expression in the form of:
y=yoexp(rt)
where r is the growth rate, t is the time in hours, y is the absorbance/OD over time and yo is the initial absorbance/OD, we can simplify the relationship such that:
log(y)=log(y_o+ rt)
So when we plot log y against t, there is a linear relationship in the exponential growth phase, so we can estimate the growth rate r from there.
Figure 2: Log data of optical density showed for exponential region for the first 150minutes of growth.
Visual assessment of these plots shows that between time=0-150 mins, there is a linear phase, so we fit a straight line (red) to estimate the growth rate. After 150 mins, the  growth starts to saturate and the exponential relationship no longer applies, so the points were discarded.
The estimates of the growth rates shown in the table below show if different glucose concentrations affect cellular growth rate in the exponential phase:

Open House
August 8 and 9, 2014
At Open House for future students and their guardians, we set up a booth on iGEM. At the booth we had slide presentations about what iGEM is and what we are doing in iGEM. We also had mini lectures for small groups with posters. Visitors could look at E. coli and S. cerevisiae through a microscope and E. coli glowing with GFP protein expression. E. coli and limonene were displayed to smell the difference.
For many of them, this must be the first time to get in touch with genetic engineering. These firsthand experience will boost their familiarity with the subject. The trophies and certificates we got in the past were also displayed, to emphasize the fun of participating in a competition and to trigger an interest among high school students. We asked all of the visitors to fill in the survey about genetic engineering. We invited more than 200 students to the booth.

Undergraduates
The 2010 UIUC-Illinois iGEM team is primarily self-administrated. Three returning members (Meagan Musselman, Steve Waltersdorf, and Francis Lee) organized recruiting, applications, and choosing of a new team. They then lead discussion leading to project selection. Each member has contributed significantly through lab work as well as administrative efforts, particularly fundraising and grant writing (Tom Hsaio, Francis Lee, and Steve Waltersdorf), publicity (Amanda Chang), financial organization (Bob Cooper), coordinating the wiki (Matt Entler) and writing newsletters (Erin Borchardt).
Advisors
We have four advisors who have been incredibly helpful and supportive. Starting during the spring and continuing until the Jamboree, the team has had bi-weekly hour long meetings with Dr. Chris Rao, Dr. Yong-Su Jin, Joanne Manaster, and Courtney Evans.
Dr. Rao and Dr. Jin have been extremely helpful in providing advice on trouble shooting lab procedures and structuring the presentation.
Dr. Jin has been gracious enough to support our work within his own lab space, and and has even taken steps to ensure that the next year's team will continue to have their own dedicated lab space.
Courtney Evans has been extremely helpful with administrative questions and providing contacts.
Joanne Manaster has helped arrange outreach events such as GAMES camp and the Surrounded By Science TV Show. She has been very supportive in this area and discussed with our team the ethical implications of synthetic biology and how best to interact with the public.
Bacterial strains were donated by the Slaugh and Vanderpool labs, located on the University of Illinois - Urbana Champaign campus. We have also contacted several other professors across the UIUC campus who have all been extremely gracious and willing to discuss research with us.
Further Support
Our team would not be where we are today without the support of The Institute for Genomic Biology and its director Doctor Harris Lewin"

Introduction
Current chemical synthesis based on a petroleum based platform have led to a disruption of environmental systems and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of greenhouse gases. The accumulation of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, is already creating dramatic changes in the worldwide temperatures and climate [1]. In 2016, our planet has reached the warmest global temperature ever recorded [2]. Human activity has been shown to be the main impacting factor of the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations during the last 150 years [3]. It has been proposed that even if the carbon dioxide emission stops immediately it would take 1000 years for the concentrations to return to normal level [4].
Climate change is one the most important issue affecting our modern world, and we need to consider alternative ways of life to reduce our environmental impact. Several measures are being taken by scientists and industry to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas as much as possible, with carbon dioxide as the main focus. We have let this issue be an inspiration to us and came up with the main idea of our project. Inspired by nature, the idea is to utilize carbon dioxide as a carbon source for a system that could produce useful products while reusing excess carbon dioxide.
Our project aims to use the carbon fixing ability of a photosynthetic microorganism to produce a carbon source that can be utilized by a wide range of microorganisms that are already used in industry for the production of chemical products today. For our photosynthetic microorganism we chose the cyanobacteria Synechocystis. We chose Synechocystis over, for example, microalgae because as a cyanobacteria it generally grows faster and have more tools available for genetic engineering [5].
The basic design
Since the carbon source is a major part of the cost for running industrial biosynthesis, utilizing carbon dioxide could be a major advantage not only from environmental perspective but also from an economical point of view"

They act on three main points: make the university campus sustainable and environment-friendly (sorting and waste recycling for example), inform and raise awareness through conferences, debates, documentary projections and promote a more sustainable lifestyle (biological and local sale of baskets, but also by organizing responsible cultural events). The 6th of April, LUPA invited us to an event aiming to inform and raise awareness concerning synthetic biology as an ecological solution. This conference was the opportunity to present iGEM and all the solutions that synthetic biology brought to sustainable development. Then we took this opportunity to present our project which has a strong environmental impact. This, in turn, opened the students’ eyes to new possibilities to improve our society
Conference: “ What will Synthetic Biology Bring to the Future?”
Poster of the conference intitled ""What will synthetic biology bring in the future?"" (26th September 2018)
We organized a scientific conference to promote and offer a better understanding of synthetic biology. During the Parisian meet-up, we have discussed with the Saclay Team and the Bordeaux team. We got along very quickly and the 3 teams wanted to do a collaboration since the 3 projects are focused on the environment. So our team proposed to work together on the set up of the conference which will be about “What is the impact of synthetic biology on sustainable development?”. After several discussions, we chose to talk less about the impact of synthetic biology in sustainable development but more about the role of this science in our future. The new subject was then “What will synthetic biology bring to the future”. Our 3 teams were looking for speakers specialized in synthetic biology, in bioethics and in Law to talk about all the sides of the subject.
Three speakers had accepted to participate:
- Alexei Grinbaum: Researcher in philosophy laboratories of sciences (LARSIM) in CEA-Saclay. Specialist in quantic information, he teaches ethics of sciences at ENTA, at Evry University and at Pasteur Institute. He is also a member in the commission of reflexions in ethics of research in sciences and technologies of High-tech (Cerna). He was invited by the iGEM Bordeaux team.
- Aliaa El Dairouty : PhD student in Public International Law at Paris Saclay University within the framework of the doctoral school “Sciences of the Human and Society”, in partnership with the Executive management of the Armament. She was invited by our team to participate in the conference. Her"

BioBrick-A-Bot Version 1.0 is made up of 2 LegoRoboBricks, called ALPHA and PHI. Here we provide the open-source RobotC codes for ALPHA and PHI. Other iGEM teams can build their own 'bot's, based on our construction specifications and then download our software. Please note that, you will need to replace the Lego NXT firmware with RobotC firmware to run the software.
BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0 will be made up of 3 LegoRoboBricks, called ALPHA, PHI and MU. We will also implement Single-Master-Multiple-Slave Synchronization, so that it will support user-defined LegoRoboBricks too. Other iGEM teams are encouraged to build and share various user-defined LegoRoboBricks to extend the functionality of BioBrick-A-Bot. We will collaborate with other iGEM teams, and make other user-defined LegoRoboBricks available for download on this website.
The files on the wiki were frozen on October 22, 2009 at 12:00 AM EDT. For the latest copy of the code, please see the Sourceforge version.

On the 20th of March, the team was assembled and we had our first meeting on the 25th where some of us met each other for the first time. A lot of expectations had to be matched, and we spent the next few weeks getting to know each other through team building.
In the beginning the biggest process was to come up with an idea. Several brainstorming methods were used, but the list of ideas suddenly became endless and an abatement process had begun! At our first introduction to the wet lab work, at the BioBrick workshop at DTU on the 2nd to 4th of May, we had cut the list down to just four ideas, which was discussed with the other two Danish iGEM teams attending the workshop; from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. A few days after the workshop we finally decided on the project: Edible coli!
The next few weeks we spent researching about how to design our system and the possibilities of our idea. The idea slowly evolved and we decided on which bricks to use from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts and which bricks to make ourselves.
Mid July we finally began working in the wet lab, starting out with a crash course organized by our instructors. Since then, we"

2.  Via the stimulation, the team is able to learn after a certain period of time that how much Aflatoxin B1 will be remaining. According to the results, the fusion protein is able to degrade 50% of the toxin within 3 hours and reach a 70% degradation in 7 hours. It is an amazing information to our team that how great the ability of degradation of syn-MSMEG5998 is.
3.Since the cofactor, F420 is not easily accessible and the control variables are complicated, it is difficult to construct an enzyme model by fully working in wet lab. Fortunately, with the modeling techniques, the team is able to systematically conduct analysis under limited data and resource; therefore modeling enables us to predict results for wet lab and assist the whole project.

Faster production = would reach steady state at some point as too much BBI might stop bacteria from producing
Work equations out that he derived; make sure units are consistent
Degradation - might be in the bloodstream, not before the skin
Diffusion coefficients: testing would be necessary for peptide flow through membrane; for skin, could probably find from literature; or ask yourself, can we just find the diffusion coefficients rather than testing bunch of membranes?
In our case diffusion is too fast that equilibrium is achievable.
Make sure to state assumptions and a way to justify it.
MATLAB: solving ODEs; recall ENGG 407 lecture
Tuesday, July 5th
The rest of the team continued to work on the diffusion model based on Dr. Nygren’s suggestions. Based on Noshin’s work, there were too many unknowns that we could solve for if we decided to solve the equation as a function of time. Therefore we went back to Fick’s first law where the diffusion was a function of concentration over area. This however had unknowns such as protein solubility that we weren’t sure of
Adhesive? Gave the green light that the assays are doable
Backing Layer? Gave a similar opinion that the assays are doable
Membrane? REASONABLE
Quantifying about how much peptide go through
Use of other peptides? (Since we want to quantify diffusion, maybe we could use something that is cheaper)

Symposium event with Stockholm and Uppsala
We had the great pleasure of collaborating with the Uppsala and Stockholm iGEM teams of 2018 in the intersection of our human practices efforts. Their topic of choice aligned itself perfectly with ours in terms of both objective and essence. The opportunity to join forces arose organically following a series of fruitful video conferences outlining the aim and plan of action of each team. All agreed to host a symposium regarding psychological stress and the exciting topic of biohacking and its ethical implications.
After nearly 3 months of logistics planning and contacting potential speakers, we made the travel up to University of Uppsala to organize event. Prior to the event Uppsala had finished their handbook on stress management, outlining stress management strategies on an individual level. We had the privilege of contributing to the final product with a small essay on the importance of an authentic work environment. Authenticity is a concept of convergence between action and personal values or beliefs and lack there of has been directly linked to higher levels of occupational stress. The essay will be made available as part of our work on management for human practices or as an edited version in Uppsala’s handbook . Our team and Uppsala chose to inquire into prevalence and nature of occupational psychological distress in academia and, in particular, as related to iGEM. In addition, different approaches to stress management were investigated in hopes of developing a set of tools for stress alleviation. While team Lund decided to focus on proactive strategies implemented at the organizational level, Uppsala emphasized interventions on an individual level.
The symposium consisted of several lectures on different topics related to occupational stress as well as a moderated panel discussion on bioethics. In addition, Uppsala hosted a mindfulness session consisting of breathing exercises designed to alleviate stress and arousal. The entire event, titled Limits of Life, was open to the public and oriented in a popular scientific manner.
After a short introduction by the teams, Will Wright of the iGEM Foundation took the stage to briefly outline the iGEM competition and discuss his experience with iGEM teams, their organization and common issues experienced by participants related to their project. The presentation was then followed by a lecture on the science behind stress and burn-out by the distinguished psychiatrist and professor Marie Åsberg. Prof. Åsberg discussed her research on occupational well-being and the emergence"

He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification ratio. It is very important for us to consider                         more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,                         the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the                         production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.
Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that"

We're working closely with the Wellesley HCI software team this year.
In June, we hosted the Wellesley team at BU where we discussed our projects and started planning how we could work together. The following day we visited their campus for a brainstorming session where we started to discuss software tools that our team could use in the wet lab.
The MoClo Planner
The MoClo Planner is a software tool that the Wellesley team has developed that will assign the fusion sites and generate the primers required to utilize the MoClo Assembly method to create genetic devices. In the two brainstorming sessions, our team worked with the Wellesley team to explain and help develop the ideas that led to the implementation of this tool. We also tested the software on July 30th and provided the team with feedback and suggestions for the next stages of the tool's development.
Corporate Collaborations
As we continue collecting characterization data from our flow cytometry experiments, we have been working closely with a group of computer scientists at Raytheon BBN Technologies to help analyze our characterization data.

SECA_NZ,2017,Team:SECA NZ#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," These are expensive to install and maintain and have been known to cause controversy in some communities due to the large amounts of noise they generate early in the morning when they are switched on. One company, sells their SIS frost Protection System for between $3000 and $6000 per hectare (Moss, Date Unknown).  An alternative to this are smaller, transportable fans which can be cheaper initially but can result in larger labour costs. A number of small New Zealand firms sell these fans e.g. Tow and Blow, which cost approximately $40,000 according to one source (ASB Blog, 2017). Helicopter flyovers are also implemented by some growers, with the civil aviation authority having developed guidelines for wine growers using this method to protect from frosts (Civil Aviation Authority, 2017). Precision Helicopters Limited is one emergency service that can fly helicopters over a section providing emergency frost resistance. We have contacted PHL and are awaiting a quote from them for covering a small vineyard. Further market analysis is needed to assess how these methods compare to one another in both effectiveness and cost.
It is clear that many of these mechanisms are incredibly costly for farmers but act to give growers peace of mind that their livelihood will not be ruined by one poor season. More market analysis is required.

The format is ‘experimental group + days + hours + minutes xxx’, (such as ‘3111111’ meaning the third group at 11:11 on the 11th), which is beneficial to the unified automatic processing. 3. The few overlapping points of two plaques are considered to have no effects on these two, so use Photoshop to change the connections as the background color, in order to processing uniformly. 3.2 Calculation of the plaques’ area 1. After reading the photos, select the appropriate threshold to transform the photos into a binary image, according to the light conditions. 2. Identify all the connected regions, and remove the smaller ones (maybe caused by useless bacteria or lens’ dust). 3. Because of the light and its reflection in every photo, the edges of culture dishes are always lit, which require removing the large connective regions in the edges. 4. Calculate the area of the other connective regions, which is all the plaque area. 5. Use the area above as the relative number of bacteria, and pixel as the unit. Similarly, the number of bacteria growth rate is in unit of pixel/ unit time. And it is the same way if ‘the number of bacteria’, ‘the relative quantities of the bacteria’ and ‘the rate of bacteria growth’ in the paper is not particularly described.    1.4 Results and analysis 4.1 Figure of the changes in the number of E. coli and Bdellovibrio

Furthermore, it is to select some appropriate forms of S-shaped curve and if the fitting results is relatively good, the data are regarded to be consistent with the S-shaped curve, that is to say, the image processing method is credible.

2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.
3. Define the Biobrick promoter strength at the temperatures and selected substrates.
Methodology
According to the characterization made by Team Edinburgh 2009, the Pyear promoter (BBa_K216005) used by Bristol 2010, works
best in minimal media and complex media with a nitrate concentration of 40mM. Using this reference, we added 40mM of KNO3 to
every growth media in the different temperatures for Bristol 2010 - BBa_K381001 and UTP-Panama 2011 – BBa_K672000.
4. We used nine falcon tubes of 15 mL. Three tubes for every different substrate at the three temperatures.
5. To each tube we added 10 ml of liquid LB, Minimal Media or Saline Solution and KNO3 40 mM.
6. Tubes corresponding the different substrates were inoculated with BBa_K381001.
7. Tubes were incubated at 37°C, 8°C and 23°C for 24 hours.

Golden Gate Cloning
What is Golden Gate Cloning?
Golden Gate cloning 1 is a rapidly developing technology that utilises Type IIS Restriction endonucleases (Type IIS RENs) and allows rapid and simple construction of multi-gene constructs  - an otherwise time-consuming process. Unlike the more commonly-used Type II RENs, Type IIS RENs cleave downstream of their recognition sequence, meaning that the recognition sequence is removed from the assembly product. Due to the removal of the recognition site from the assembly product, the reaction is irreversible meaning that the reaction will always tend towards the desired product. This allows for multi part assembly in a single digestion-ligation (dig-lig) reaction dramatically speeding up the process and efficiency of cloning whilst producing a recombinant plasmid that is free from unwanted sequences.
How does Golden Gate Cloning work?
The Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo) assembly standard 2-4, defines a fixed set of sequences to the overhangs produced when parts are released from their vector by the TypeIIS enzyme. The sequence defines the position the part will occupy within the final construct. In order to achieve this, the part must be flanked by standardised, predefined overhangs that fit the MoClo standard. The overhangs used in the MoClo standard are shown in the figure below. The advantage of using any standardized assembly system is that, as well as dramatically speeding up the cloning process, it allows us to share our work with other laboratories and iGEM teams.
How has the Green Canary project utilised Golden Gate cloning?
The Green Canary project has utilised Golden gate cloning and the MoClo standard to assemble all the constructs required for the project from previously synthesised level 0 modules. Specifically, the enzymes used are BsaI to assemble level 1 constructs from level zero parts"

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
bioLOGICS: Logical RNA-Devices Enabling BioBrick-Network Formation
Vision
Until today, 13.628 biobrick sequences [1] have been submitted to partsregistry, thereof 102 reporter units and 12 signaling bricks. Since then, people are trying to arrange these single biological building blocks in such a manner that allows producing special biotechnological products (metabolic engineering), developing biological sensory circuits (biosensors) and even giving microorganisms the ability to react on multiple environmental factors and serve both as disease indicator and drug. These examples and further promising ideas were implemented on previous iGEM-competitions. [2] [3] [4]

4. An Underengaged Public.
5. Conclusion.
What is “human practices”?
As a team we wanted to analyse and address the society’s relationship with science, and more specifically, synthetic biology.
After researching society’s views on synthetic biology we perceived four important problems that we could solve:
1. Cooperation between scientists is lacking.
2. The public does not perceive synthetic biology to be safe.
.3. The key skills required for synthetic biology can be intimidating.
4. The general public are not as engaged as they should be.
Cooperation is lacking: collaboration with St Andrews
We believe that cooperation and collaboration are two of the fundamental principles behind the success of synthetic biology. By always keeping these themes at the forefront of our thinking, we could allow them to permeate through our entire project whether it was working directly with another team to reach a common goal, or just making software on multiple platforms to allow more people to use it.
Eastern iGEM
We were delighted to be able to work closely with the St Andrews iGEM team, who are based just across the Tay Bridge, about 12 miles from Dundee, also on the East coast of Scotland. It was really useful to meet with them and share our experiences. As described later in this section, we worked with them to put on a discussion on the pros and cons of synthetic biology’s place in society to coincide with the World Schools Debating Championships, which were held in Dundee in 2011.
Towards the end of the project we found out that the St Andrews team were having troubles cloning their antimicrobial peptide generator part into the pSB1C3 plasmid. We were pleased to be able to help them troubleshoot their experiments and by working together we were able to successfully clone the part.
The main problem St Andrews were having seemed to be related to the production of new plasmid backbone via PCR with the iGEM specified primer design and specified RFP part. We were able to overcome this problem by carrying out some of their"

Jeffrey J. Tabor, Ph. D.
Jeff Tabor builds synthetic genetic control systems to engineer complex biological behaviors such as pattern formation and social interactions.
His projects at Rice University include engineering cellular sensors that respond to unnatural inputs such as light, building genetic circuits and signal transduction cascades to process sensory information, combining sensors and circuits to rewire metabolic pathways, engineering new modes of cell-cell communication, and combining all of these technologies to program synthetic social interactions and pattern formation. The research builds upon his work as a postdoctoral fellow in Christopher Voigt's laboratory at University of California, San Francisco where he programmed bacterial communities to function as a light responsive photographic film and work as a parallel computer to perform the image-processing task of edge detection.
The research, which was supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) from the National Institutes of Health, demonstrated that complex multicellular behaviors can be engineered by the stepwise assembly of well-characterized genetic modules.

From him, we know that a specific feature of the apoptin used in our project is that it only enters into nucleus of solid tumors but stay in cytoplasm of normal cells. We consulted him whether the apoptin could be used as a biomarker as well. He said that we should first use nude mice to figure out whether SMMC-7721 cells can multiply in vivo by subcutaneous injection. This part is really inspiring and actually made us changed previous experiment design and we changed to use the nude mice. The result turns out to be very good.

Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html,"oprotein structures are found in different lineages and have three independent origins, suggesting functional convergence [ 3 ] (Fig.1).
Fig.1 Origins of chromoprotein structures
Aim
1.Design and validate the applicability of a set of chromoproteins originating from corals in Aspergillus niger.
2.Introduce the mitochondrial retention signal to chromoprotein coding genes for targeted localization.
3.Standardize the measurement of chromoprotein encoding gene induced colorization.
Approach
The XL1 Blue MRF’ E. coli strains which contain plasmids with chromoprotein encoding genes aeBlue , eforRed and amilGFP respectively and DH5α E. coli strain containing
mRFP were obtained from Braunschweig UR and Uppsala UR.   Then the palettes of those chromoprotein transcriptional units were tested for applicability in Aspergillus niger. Besides, we synthesized and then Gibson assembled a chromoprotein encoding gene (eforRed) which was codon-optimized for Aspergillus niger. A mitochondrial retention signal was added to this codon-optimized chromoprotein encoding gene for targeted organelle localization. Afterwards protoplasts were transformed with all chromoprotein constructs, normal and codon optimized, in order to be expressed in A. niger N593.
Results
The aeBlue, amilGFP, mRFP and eforRed chromoprotein genes were succesfully inserted into an in-house vector. After their sequence was confirmed by single read sequencing, protoplasts were transformed with these chromoprotein encoding genes. Then they were inoculated on complete medium plates without uridine supplement. We thereby created selective pressure since the A. niger N593 strain owns a uridine autroxophy gene.  However, unlike the E. coli transformants (Fig.2) the Aspergillus transformant colonies (Fig.3) did not show colour.
However, when performing PCR with the fungal genomic DNA as a template, the products appeared to be of the right size, giving the expected bands which were around 700bp after gel electrophoresis, see Fig 4.
The eforRed chromoprotein encoding gene was codon-optimized for A. niger and synthetic construct blocks were ordered and fused via Gibson Assembly. This synthetic construct contains a removable mitochondrial targeting sequence. The colony-PCR of E. coli transformed with this codon-optimized eforRed with mitochondrial retention sequence displayed the expected bands after gel electrophoresis, which were around 750 bp,"

Cambridge-JIC,2014,Team:Cambridge-JIC#ExecSummary_-_-_TEXT.html,".  We also built a heat-shock promoter mösbi-module, from the DNA provided by Christian Boehm, which would enable smart environmental sensing in Marchantia. We were fascinated by hammerhead ribozymes, which could be evolved in and isolated from S. cerevisiae to control cleavage of RNA transcript, and hence expression, in response to a given ligand - and which could be cascaded to create logic elements. These hadn't yet been used in plants.  We kindly received samples from the Smolke lab, and assembled these into standalone constructs and mösbi-processing/input modules.Unfortunately, problems in the later stages of transformation prevented us from assaying our constructs in vivo, and incompatibility with RFC10 prevent us from submitting these to the registry. We submitted many of the candidate promoters, along with new reporter localisation sequences and fundamental Marchantia tools as digital parts to the registry.
We struggled at various stages with assembling our constructs. They usually were large, and consisted of many parts, and came from a range of sources. To try to improve our efficiency on larger constructs, we successfully tested the newly optimized Ligase Cycling Reaction, and used it to build some of our larger constructs.  However, this came at a great time cost. We realised that to truly make use of the rapid transformation cycle of Marchantia, and to enable future members of the plant synthetic biology community, a method of sharing reusable plant parts was essential. To pave the way for this, we collaborated with Valencia and UEA-NRP, the only other iGEM teams working in plants, to author BBF RFC 105, which sets up a standardised PlantSyntax for plant parts. We submitted mösbi-modules to the registry that enable the assembly techniques described in the paper, to insert input promoters, and reporters into module cassettes.
Appreciating that consumer biotechnology/synthetic biology in the home currently has many questions to answer on issues of safety and practice, we realised that it was crucial for us to assess these issues in the context of mösbi. We researched these issues and produced a paper addressing them as a way of demonstrating our responsibility. Acknowledging our responsibility to address these issues beyond the scientific community, we will also be hosting a session in the annual Cambridge Science Festival on October 26th, at the Cambridge Science Centre. We aim to educate the wider public about the potential of plant synthetic biology and Marchantia, as well as to address their concerns on genetic modification. We hosted students from the St. Paul's School collegiate iGEM team to inform them"

Such universal “transform&go” type of secretion tool would represent a tremendous improvement for recombinant protein production or other biotechnological applications as secretion in E. coli remains a challenging problem.
Our plan was simple : we wanted to use mutagenesis tools and a strong selection design to build a door from an existing f1 bacteriophage porin. We were inspired by this filamentous bacteriophage virions escape strategy which are able to escape E. coli’s grasp through the porin without ever injuring their host.
Can the Gatekeeper revolutionize biopharmaceutical and industrial enzymes production ?

Our main corporate partner, Canon Solutions America, was very helpful in funding our team and allowing us to compete this year. Without them, our participation would likely not have been possible. We are grateful for their support and for the opportunity we had to meet with them and discuss the iGEM experience.
Integrated DNA technologies generously provided all of the DNA synthesized for our project. This included gBlock fragments of the different genes involved, primers, and even whole plasmids.
We are thankful for the free Gibson assembly and Q5 PCR Master Mix provided by New England Biolabs. Obtaining our target construct (BBa_K2268004) would probably not have been possible without their help.
We received a complementary supply of buffers we had difficulty preparing on our own. QIAgen's support made it much easier to purify DNA from our bacteria.
A special thanks to Kingsborough Community College - in particular, the Department of Biological Sciences and the Office of College Advancement. Without their help and continued support, we would not have the space or the funding streams to complete this project. Also, a thanks to the Office of Student Life for supporting student travel (from last year) and to the entire CUNY system."
TU_Delft,2010,Team:TU Delft#Lablog_-_-_TEXT.html,"The first attempt at measuring fluorescence was made in adherence with the protocol proposed by the USTC team of 2009:
1. The overnight cultures of E.coli Top10 carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 and I13401 (LB, 37 ℃, 160 rpm) were measured for OD600 (see table below) and diluted 1:100.

2. 100 μL and 300 μL aliquots of the diluted cultures were pipetted into 96-well plates in three-fold.
3. The plate was incubated at 37 ℃ while shaking for 3 hours.
4. The fluorescence and OD600 were measured for 16.30 hours with intervals 10 minutes by means of the Biotek Synergy plate reader with the excitation filter set at 485nm and the emission filter at 520nm. LB medium was used as blank reference.
Note: surprisingly no over night growth of the cultures was observed in M9 minimal medium containing glucose. This a larger volume of inoculate (in LB) was used for a second stab at over night growth in M9.
Plasmid purification of overnight cultures carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 in pSB1A3 was performed using the Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid isolation kit yielding sufficient plasmid DNA. These BioBricks can in future be placed under control of a low to medium copy number plasmid for comparison with high copy-number plasmid expression.

Uppsala,2015,Team:Uppsala#nic_-_-_TEXT.html," with you team and think about this question before the conference.
The future of iGEM technology: What new or future technologies could be the future of iGEM. The sky is the limit, so anything from current technology that is not yet available to iGEM labs, to technology that is only in your imagination.
Unsolved ethics: Is your project suitable for supervillains? Are there ethical considerations that the teams have missed? Let’s help each other gain new insights into our projects and prepare ourselves for questions that might come up in Boston in September.
Funding the fun: The road to Boston How much money do you need to raise? Do companies sponsor you with materials and equipment? What are your sponsors getting out of sponsoring you? How do you contact companies and how persistent are you?
After iGEM: Unexpected applications How would you make the projects be made available to the community? Can you think of aspects of the other projects that might have applications that the teams have not yet considered?
It was clear that a lot of great ideas had come up, and with the curiosity sparked, we went back to the main hall. It was time to present the winner of the mini-jamboree. Which team had the best presentations?
The winner of the Nordic iGEM Jamboree 2015 was Stockholm iGEM with their affibody based biomarker assay (ABBBA)
Randy presented the award to the winning team and gave us an inspiring speech.   After the pleasantries, people headed back to the accommodation for a pause in the hectic schedule. Next up was dinner.
After a delightful dinner and a lot of interesting conversations, it was time to explore the nightlife of Uppsala. We had an incredibly fun evening together, but you can’t party forever.
The sunday was spent strolling around the city, looking at some of the sights of Uppsala.
After a lot of laughs and many interesting topics discussed, an awesome weekend had come to an end. Meeting like-minded people on a event like this has created a great amount of ideas and inspiration, which we will use when we maintain the growth of synthetic biology in the exponential phase.

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"os consists of the desired mutation flanked by 50 bp long homolougous sequences flanking the position of the introduced DSB. The last three nucleotides at both ends are connected via phosphorothioate-bonds providing the stabilization of the donor oligonucleotides and protection against digestion (Reisch and Prather 2017).
The donor template was designed to exchange four basepairs at the beginning of the dns gene with a three basepair stop-codon (figure 4). In this way, the knock-out is ensured through the premature translation termination as well as a frameshift in the sequence.  The spacer sequences targeting the genomic sequence was designed using the CRISPR design tool of Geneious which utilizes the algorithm developed by Doensch et al. (2014).
Figure 4: Alligment of the donor template and the V. natriegens genome.
The alligment shows that the the donor template differ in two nucleotides from the dns-CDS of V. natriegens. The first nucelotide  leads to the conversion of an aminoacid to a stopcodon whereas the second, missing nucleotide leads to a frameshift.
Metabolic Engineering
With Vibrigens we aim to speed up synthetic biology in all of its facettes. For that we designed a workflow for accelerated metabolic engineering in high-throughput. We use the Marburg Collection to construct whole pathway libraries, benefit from natural transformation to introduce it into our chassis, enable fast product screening with biosensors and implemented directed evolution for further pathway optimization.
Workflow for Metabolic Engineering and Design of Pathway and Enzymes
Our workflow
One of the central elements of synthetic biology is the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle.   It illustrates the workflow of how systems like metabolic pathways, genetic circuits or anything else are constructed and evaluated.   The first step is to design the system basing on the existent knowledge about the system.   Then the system is built and its functionality is tested. The results of these tests describe the ‘Learning’ part of the cycle.    They are used to make an improved design.   Finally, a new round in the
DBTL
cycle can be made and the system gets improved in each round of the cycle.  For our approach we decided to establish a workflow for metabolic engineering, which bases on the
DBTL
cycle and combines the existing principles of metabolic engineering with the advantages of the fast-growing organism V. natriegens.  First of all, we use the Marburg Collection to construct a library of pathways with different combinations"

Isolated Parts
From the recently arrived spring 2011 IGEM plate, the following parts were isolated: Bba_E0430 (RBS+YFP+Promoter), Bba_E0240 (RBS+GFP+Promoter), Bba_R2000 (Promoter that works best with the previous composite parts), Bba_E0020 (ECFP), Bba_E0032 (EYFP), and Bba_K156010 (BFP).
Miscellaneous
TAE buffer was prepared from the 50X TAE stock. Approximately 40 LB+Ampicillin agar plates were made because many of the parts contained gene that encode for Ampicillin resistance. Almost all used glasswares were autoclaved and kept for future use. Lab bench was cleaned with 70% ethanol and paper towel. QIAcube was received for demo and would stay for approximately one week from Tuesday (6/14).

BFP2
Plasmid prep were created from the BFP2 culture plate and incubated for approximately 16 hours for plasmid amplification. The resulting plasmids were isolated by miniprep and quantified with nanodrop. The DNA concentration in the two samples are 16.5 ng/uL and 14.9 ng/uL, respectively. While such values are below the normally acceptable range of 20 and above, we still run electrophoresis on them. No band was detected in the gel.
Pbad
Pbad promoter biobrick was obtained from the spring 2010 IGEM plate, and transformed into E. coli bacteria. The bacteria were then plated onto agar-based LB+Ampicillin growth medium. Lots of cultures were found on the next day after the overnight transformation. Instead of uniform appearance, however, each plate was composed of both dark or light colonies. Plasmid prep was done for each of the color type (pipet tip was used instead of metal loop) and each tube was incubated for 12 hours. On the next morning, the tip in each tube was found to contain a spiral, string-like thing and most of the plasmid preps were not opaque. After the miniprep, each of the plasmid was quantified with nanodrop. Their respective concentrations were 10.0 ng/uL and 8.3 ng/uL. They were also"

With this data at hand, we went back to the experiments where we assessed the cytotoxicity of azurin on the HeLa CCL-2 lc cells.  The effective azurin concentration was then determined as 2 nM.
CONCLUSION
We manage to quantify the amount of azurin in our bacerial lysate and thus to defone the cytotoxic azurin concetration (2 nM) against p53 + cancer cells (HeLa CCL-2 lc).

The reaction was run with the following thermocycler program: 95C for 30sec, cycle start, 95C 30 sec, 55C 1min, 72C 2min, cycle end, 18 repeats, 72C for 30min, 4C hold. After the PCR reaction had gone to completion, 10ul of 50mM MgCl2 were added to each reaction tube and the contents were thoroughly mixed. 1ul of DpnI (equivalent to 20 units) were added to each tube and the contents were thoroughly mixed. The reaction was incubated in the thermocycler following the program: 37C for 120min, 4C hold. Since samples were transformed into chemically competent cells, purification was skipped and samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The additional bands at ~300bp visible in lanes 5, 6, 7 and 8 are PCR products that span the distance between the two sets of primers of the double mutation.
Testing of the Pulse Generator
A pulse generator for synthetic biology must fulfill several criteria in order to be considered functional. Before activation of protein expression, leaky expression of the target protein should be as low as possible. However, upon induction, protein expression must increase markedly and remain at a high level until expression is terminated by the second signal (tetracycline). Having completed one version of the pulse generator before freezing of the Wiki ( K142027 ), we have been able to perform limited tests on the construct. There were two major concerns with respect to pulse generator function. Leaky expression from the target plasmid (we chose lac-controlled fluorescent protein generators) was obvious and we approached the problem by adding a LacI wild-type expression cassette to the target plasmid. (For a more advanced assembly the constitutive LacI wild-type expression cassette could be added to the pulse generator to reduce cloning effort for the user.) Another concern was that leaky expression of LacI IS could repress the lac-controlled promoter of the target gene despite absence of tetracycline making the pulse generator unresponsive to IPTG.

Stretcher is up and running
gave it a few test runs
Some problems with it:
the godet has too much friction/attraction to the thread. As a result, the thread is unable to pass from the 1st godet to the 2nd. The 1st godet drags the thread along with it, so I am unable to advance it to the 2nd.
it is extremely difficult to wind the thread around the 1st godet and then guide it to the 2nd by hand.
it is extremely difficult to unwind the thread after removing it from the ethanol. It comes out as a soggy, clumped mess.
It might be best to have the collection spool out in dry air
Some observations
It is very easy to catch the fiber onto the 1st godet and just let it wind around it.
We may just switch to a 1-godet design, where 1 godet both stretches AND captures the thread
However, here there is the problem of recollecting the thread after it has been spooled and withdrawn from the ethanol.
A godet speed of 150 seems to be close to the speed at which the thread is coming out of the tubing.
to reduce friction of the godet, we tried polishing them with acetone (they are made of ABS plastic, and acetone dissolves it).
Sri gave a great suggestion:
Wind the thread around the 1st godet.
Once all of the thread has been extruded, reverse the 1st godet, and feed the thread to the 2nd godet.
update:I tried this, it didn't work. The godet still tugged the thead back, even when it was running in reverse. This doesn't make sense to me, but it did it.
I think I got it!

Each case of bovine mastitis can cost up to $300, and permanently damages infected cows so that they produce 10% less milk for the remainder of their milking years, causing additional losses on top of the initial $300 cost. Since farmers can identify the strains of bacteria that cause each case of mastitis on the farm using a special culture plate, choosing a specific bacteriocin for treatment is more precise than the traditional broad-range antibiotic cocktail. Bill also said that the microscope and app we were designing would be more convenient than current management techniques for bovine mastitis.
7 months and 13 interviews later, we turned inspiration into Legendairy results.
FINDINGS: Our dream of curing, preventing, and detecting mastitis can become a reality.

Myth: Transgenic maize can cause harm in humans.
The corn marketed as StarLink™  is one of the reasons this myth has spread, they produce a protein endotoxin as insecticide.  This raised concern since it could be allergic or harmful for humans and, since the US Environmental Protection Agency could not find certainty of no harm to humans, the corn wasn’t approved for human consumption.
Fact:  Conventional maize is transgenic.
A transgenic organism is an organism that contains a gene or genes transferred from another organism (this could be from the same or from a different species). According to an article by the CANIA (an institute of nutrition of Venezuela), maize crops  are the ones with the highest level of domestication in cultivated plants. This means that man, considering the properties like the size or the resistance to heat, selects the crops. The selection of the best species is necessary to improve the quality of the product.
Because of the cultural features, a lot of options are available. Either natural or induced, causing the existence of many varieties and hybrids.  We can call all these hybrids “transgenic”, because they contain genes from others plants. Therefore, all the corn that we consume is a transgenic organism with a mixture of genes that our ancestors considered the best options to improve the maize.
The corn marketed as StarLink™ is not only an example of genetically modified organism (GMO) with issues, but also an example of the regulations of the GMO don't allow the release of a product that can be harmful for humans.
Myth: Biotechnological modifications of crops and foods are very different from traditional methods.
Reality: Biotechnology has helped the traditional agricultural methods.
In the last 10,000 years, people have used their knowledge to improve food production. Farmers used to cross their plant to obtain features of interest. But this method was highly unproductive since a lot of effort was placed in obtaining a desired feature.
Genetic modification is a more efficient and accurate tool that has allowed scientists"

BioBrick 2.0 Intein Monomers Spidroin Constructs Intein Passenger NikR ER
BioBrick 2.0
Overview
While developing our modular platform, we conceived a BioBrick-compatible standard with improved flexibility that enables the integration of conventional cloning methods into iGEM’s workflow. This construct, once inserted into a backbone, allows cloning through Golden Gate assembly and Gibson assembly. At the same time, our construct has a LacZ reporter which can be used to screen plates for successful colonies. We are proposing our BioBrick2.0 as a new standard, which could facilitate an improved cloning process for future iGEM teams.
Reporter
The lacZ reporter allows for blue-white screening. It can be displaced by compatible constructs through BioBrick assembly, Golden Gate assembly or Gibson assembly. Blue-white screening is based on the inability of commercial E. coli to metabolise galactose or structurally similar substrates like X-Gal because of a lacZ deletion mutation. Once lacZα is provided through a plasmid, X-Gal can be metabolised to an easily detectable blue compound. This screening can also be used for subsequent cloning where the displacement of lacZ results in white colonies.
Compatibility
For Golden Gate assembly, BsaI cut sites and defined overhangs were added. The BsaI overhangs are based on Vladimir et al. 2018 [1]. CCAA was chosen for upstream and ACGG for downstream. For Gibson assembly, a defined area of homology was designed. BsaI can be used to open the plasmid, removing the reporter and exposing the Gibson overhangs.
BioBrick2.0 standardisation
One of the oldest problems of biological research which persists nowadays is the lack of standardization in experimental design, which impacts reproducibility and therefore reliability of results. Especially with the advent of DNA cloning, sequencing and omics techniques, there has been a growing need for a connecting thread which would simplify the bundle of data generated by these new experimental techniques. Arkin and Endy from MIT were the first ones who tried to address the issue by publishing a standard registry of biological parts which didn’t have considerable success [1]. However"

Label two pipet tip boxes or similar with the strain, your initials, the date, and either 150 uL or 100 uL.  Store at -40C overnight
Day 3
Thaw 100 mL of Inoue transformation buffer.  Keep on ice.
Prechill the centrifuge to 4 degrees
Take samples of each of the (3) overnight cultures, and return to the shaker.  Take the OD600 of each on a spectrometer.
If one of the cultures is at .55 or just over, proceed.  We had a good batch from a .575 OD  Otherwise, keep taking ODs every 45 minutes until one of the cultures reaches .55
Place the .55 OD600 culture on ice for 10 minutes.  Keep the culture(s) that are below .55 on the shaker in case you mess up.
Pour the chilled .55 culture into a sterile 250 mL centrifuge bottle
Centrifuge at 2500g for 10 minutes at 4C.  Balance with another bottle with 250mL water.  The pellet may have some black streaks in it- this is normal.
Drain the medium and aspirate any remaining medium out of the bottle if you have a vacuum trap.  Otherwise just keep the bottle upside down on paper towels for 2 minutes.
Add 80mL ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer"

Defining the initial state of the system
The initial concentrations of the constitutive proteins (AiiA,  LuxR, CI -constitutive synthesis- and CI:CI -due to constitutive  synthesis-) were estimated based on the efficiency rate of their  promoters, number of promoters per cell, degradation rate of their  mRNAs, translation efficiency and degradation rate of the proteins.  Initial concentrations of AHL:LuxR complex, the dimer of complexes, CI  and CI:CI due to complex activation were set to 0, given these  are all due to the action of AHL. Number of copies of both cI and rcnA promoters are 10 based on plasmid copy number. RcnA and Unk were  estimated experimentally and set consistent to the observed rate.  Concentration of"

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement because the detection limit for our plate reader is up to 100000 which correspond to nearly 0.78µM fluorescence.

Brown-Stanford,2011,Team:Brown-Stanford#REGObricks#Biobrick_-_-_TEXT.html," of our characterization of part BBa_K656013 was a determination of the construct's compatibility with the biobrick assembly method. Because we lack the sequence data for this part, we performed the basic biobrick restriction digests (EcoRI, XbaI ,SpeI , and PstI) on our urease construct to determine if there were any cut sites within the operon itself.  Our construct did indeed contain multiple biobrick restriction sites, specifically EcoRI and PstI, both of which cut our operon into multiple pieces. Again, because of our lack of a sequence for this part, it is impossible to say for sure where in the operon these cut sites exist; fortunately, neither XbaI nor SpeI enzymes cut our operon into distinct pieces, allowing us to incorporate the construct into biobrick submission plasmid pSB1C3. Therefore, the part we created is compatible with standard biobrick assembly, but should not be used with the outer restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI. For the most up-to-date characterization and data concerning part BBa_K656013, please visit the part's page here
Judging
Successfully cloned and biobricked complete Sporosarcina pasteurii urease operon. This construct was successfully transformed into 5-alpha competent E. coli with plasmid backbone/vector pSB1C3. The biobricked urease operon has been added to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts as Part:BBa_K656013 .
Qualitatively characterized and demonstrated the ureolytic functionality of part BBa_K656013 in 5-alpha E. coli.
Are working to quantitatively record the ureolytic activity of E. coli transformants expressing part BBa-K656013 through our conductivity protocol, and will post this data to the part's page in the registry
Characterized standard biobrick restriction sites within part BBa-K656013. The part contains EcoRI and PstI cut sites besides those intended for standard biobrick assembly. Therefore, any construct or assembly should utilize only XbaI and SpeI restriction enzymes when working with part BBa_K656013.

The Idea: Its all about standardization...
iGEM’s core idea is standardization: genetic elements are modified to easily combine them. Similar to electrical engineers biologists shall be enabled to construct large and more complex systems with fewer difficulties. A central element of this idea is the Parts Registry. Scientists have access to a huge variety of standardized genetic element, the BioBricks. This collection is constantly growing. Thereby it contributes to the successful diffusion and the acceptance of synthetic biology and it is the basis for and of great benefit to all researchers, supporters and participants of the iGEM competition.
Yet over time our team has come to the conclusion that iGEM’s core idea, standardization, is not fully implemented in the Parts Registry. Accessing the Registry frequently to plan a project using BioBricks, one very quickly realizes that the part descriptions are often unstructured. There are excellent examples of well-structured and organized descriptions. Unfortunately a defined standard is missing.
That fact can hamper the entire planning and research process. It is sometimes tiresome"
Nanjing_China_Bio,2012,Team:Nanjing China Bio#Online_-_-_TEXT.html," also put forward numerous constructive comments according to our topic.  For example, one of the respondents rise the problem that the long description of the BioBricks could not be revised when uploaded; another respondent thought it inappropriate for the official to change the assessment standards of the official awards frequently. In conclusion, we hope the iGEM committee can set up an exchange platform to enhance the communication between different teams and check the validity of the parts submitted.
