Synthetic Biology Exhibition during the  HKUST Information Day
Date:  29th September, 2018
Time:  9:00 - 17:00
Venue:  HKUST Academic concourse
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is considered as a type of renewable bioenergy that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. However, microbial fuel cells still pose advantages and disadvantages like other types of renewable energies. In order to minimize the disadvantages and to make MFC a best-suited renewable energy source for Hong Kong, the HKUST team tries to bring the idea of MFC to the public and raise further discussions for improvement of our design. We did this by organizing an exhibition booth during the HKUST Information Day with the following aims:
Promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs.
Promote renewable energies as part of our project theme of environmental sustainability.
Integrate stakeholders to our product design by demonstrating our project and conducting surveys for the users to discover the public’s concerns and an area of focus for product improvements.
The university's information day aimed to provide undergraduate admission information for high school students from all over Hong Kong. Visitors in this events, therefore, mainly consist of senior high school students and their parents with the urge to find out more information about our university and the programs offered. We took this opportunity to conduct our public engagement and education for potential high school students to learn more about synthetic biology and will one day join us to improve our society.
To enhance active engagement, we have used 3D DNA and plasmid models to introduce the basic concepts of DNA as a coding tool for all living organisms and how recombinant technologies can combine functions of different organisms for the benefits of humans and the environment. Students were able to enhance their knowledge through hands-on trials of finding complementary sticky ends in individual plasmids and combines parts together by “ligation”. A mini-game of “How to build your own MFC” was also introduced to test"

Figure 4-3-1.Wolfcoli system
We aimed to introduce a red-light-dependent gene expression network and the band-detect network into the Artificial Cooperation System. (Fig. 4-3-1) These two systems were integrated and linked together by applying OmpR.  OmpR usually works as a regulative factor of red-light sensing system, and we utilized this to regulate the band-detect network.  OmpR is a transcriptional regulator, which activates the expression of cI and LacIM1 in this system
During dark nights (Weak light intensity) (Fig. 4-3-2)
Light drives the sensor to a state in which phosphorylation of OmpR is inhibited. Since unphosphorylated OmpR doesn’t bind to OmpC promoter, there would be only basal expression"
Tec-Monterrey_EKAM,2012,Team:Tec-Monterrey EKAM#Modular_-_-_TEXT.html,"ucleotide synthesis has a limited sequence length that can be reached without errors, so larger constructs require the use of subcloning, which further expands the project’s cost. This is when the In-Fusion tool comes in handy, as it makes it possible, through flanking site recombination, to construct precise DNA molecules by joining several fragments. This allows for the synthesis of separate sequences to be ordered and then these fragments to be used in a single reaction that will end up with the final desired construct, with the modular design strategy implemented.
Having the option to easily manipulate different sections of the genetic construct makes it possible to debug a genetically engineered system by switching the involved components and using trial and error, so malfunctioning parts can be edited. This property also makes it easier to characterize certain parts by enabling the use of different expression assemblies. A module can be constituted by a switchable promoter or reporter gene, for example, offering the opportunity to reuse systems that have been proved useful to study new single parts.
Promoters for P. pastoris
Ever since the potential of genetic engineering became apparent, we have seen a rise in the use of synthetic biology to develop full-fledged systems working for the very interests of mankind. The idea that a basic system could potentially be used in the production of a whole range of molecules suggests that this kind of multi-directed manufacturing could be designed to optimally synthesize any given product at a given time. This is when the idea of a modular biofactory comes up, and the proper strategies for its design and execution were the focus of the project. When working with P. pastoris as an expression system, a need for a controlled expression evidences a lack of related parts in the registry. Therefore, the characterization of four inducible promoters is presented. The registry’s insufficiency of expression tools for alternative systems like this yeast is thus addressed. P. pastoris offers an expression system that has proven useful in substantial protein production, especially in molecules requiring post-translational modifications. Cultures of this yeast are able to achieve relatively large cell densities, allowing greater amounts of biomass to be used for production. Also, this organism is non-pathogenic and regarded as biologically safe, making it a relevant alternative for expression systems.  Using GFP as a reporter for the strength of each promoter, the detected fluorescence is registered as proportional to the level of expression of the gene. The emitted radiation can be quantified by a fluorescence microplate reader, as well as by fluorescence microscopy, using specialized software (ImageJ) for an objective appraisal of the images. The results here presented reveal the successful implementation of the promoters in"
Cornell,2015,Team:Cornell#policy_-_-_TEXT.html," formation of more dangerous pathogens.
Furthermore, FishPHARM has the potential to be a more reliable, enduring solution, as it would be more difficult for Flavobacterium psychrophilum to develop any evolutionary countermeasures to such a system. It should be further noted that agents such as amoxicillin have uses in medicine, and that encouraging the development of strains resistant to such drugs could have deleterious consequences for human health.
Risk Assessment
iGEM Collaborations
This year, Cornell iGEM has collaborated with Yale iGEM by engaging in the team’s discussion about utilizing non-model organisms as part of projects and research. This dialogue was to address the increasing amount of iGEM projects that have centered around these non-model organisms, instead of Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yale iGEM identified our project team as one that was using a non-model organism as part of our project, and have thus asked us to share our experiences working with our non-model organism. We were more than happy to share our experiences working with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, our bacteria of interest that we were trying to tackle with fishPHARM. Because F. psychrophilum is not a bacterial strain commonly worked with, we occasionally had trouble finding necessary information from scientific journals. Luckily, we were able to collaborate with a professor who had worked with F. psychrophilum and was able to provide us much needed insight into the organism. In collaborating with Yale iGEM, we share their sentiments in the hopes that future iGEM teams will be able to utilize a greater variety of non-model organisms for their projects."

The Big Idea
Developed an outline for our system as a device made up of three parts - a sensor, an adaptor, and a pigment producer.  Our idea is to develop different bacterial strains that are sensitive to different concentrations of an inducer.  Certain concentrations of the inducer will cause violet pigment production, for example, while other concentrations will cause cyan pigment production.  This overall aim requires further attention as to how we will develop multiple sensitivities.
Synthesis and primers
Finalised the sequence for our melanin biobrick on the ApE plasmid editor. Pictorial version shown below:
Restriction sites are all within the registry prefix and suffix and will be used to join the gene to the plasmid backbone.
Primers have been ordered from Invitrogen and should get here next week.
Also examined the vio genes using the Gene-designer from DNA 2.0 with the aim of optimising them for synthesis. As the vio genes are origonally from the chromobacterium we looked at optimising codon usage for E. coli as well as adding a B0034 ribosome binding site to the beginning of each gene.
Modelling
During the course of this week we have been reading about mathematical modelling of gene circuits. We now have some useful books and several papers. We are looking at using either Matlab, or software related to the Systems Biology Workbench. We may well use Cell Designer to work on our circuits graphically.

WHU-China,2015,Team:WHU-China#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"  Since the young dentists and the young scientists are actually college mates here, we received massive trusts and kindness during the whole process. However this also pushing us to try our best in our iGEM project this year.
2.The more direct the show is, the larger the impact could be. ""You won't worry that much until your college mate check and tell you that you got a bad tooth."" one of our mates said. Actually this kind of examination is a relatively new activity in our campus and we successfully caught tons of attention during the process, which means this is a new efficient way to advertising oral caring.

In practice, we invited two graduate students in College of Stomatology who have the Practicing Doctors Certificate to do examination of oral cavity of participants in our university.
Fig.1 Certificated oral condition exam.
Fig.2 Students doing the examination. We have a busy time during the practice. Firstly, we encouraged everyone who  was interested in our practice to fill a form about his or her daily habits such as the time they cost on each teeth brushing, the frequency they brush teeth in one day, and whether they have tried some assistant methods such as mouth wash to keep the oral hygiene. After finishing the questionnaire they could accept the examination for free, and the dentists would curtly told them their teeth condition and the knowledge about prevention of dental caries. During their waiting time, we also had lots of interactions.  After that, we took photos of their happy faces withfronting their teeth and invited them to do the Lucky Draw,  where we prepared lots of prizes relevant to teeth health, from toothbrush to mouthwash, and most people were accompanied with satisfaction, happiness and also the prizes. At the same time, we distributed the leaflets which contain the introduction of the iGEM and our project, also some basic information about dental caries.

This practice lasted for nearly three hours, about fifty people joined us. And averagely we achieved our goal that raised public consciousness about dental caries prevention in our campus. Through the practice, people began to care about their teeth and may want to see the dentists, do some cure of their dental caries. Also they wish we can finish our experiment, finally find a way to control or even cure the disease. We not only devote to research the cure of dental caries just in library, during the practice, we got the data about how people are troubled"

Trouble we meet in project
At the beginning of 2018 SZU-China team, we had a brainstorming to decide our topic. We carried out three topics which were all close to daily lives and we didn’t know which to choose.
What we did for project
To strengthen the communication between iGEM and the public, we designed an applet named biocompany and post our ideas there. It’s a platform for the public to engage in the iGEM.
How would the project be
With the comments that people gave in Biocompany, we finally decided our project, cockroach terminator. For more details about our applet, please read our applet part.
Trouble we meet in project
When we were designing our experiment, we still knew little about iGEM and many aspects of our project needed improved. We also wanted know what other teams were going on.

<partinfo>BBa_J23101</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_J23106</partinfo> could not be cloned upstream of these devices because they produced amounts of LuxI protein that give a high metabolic burden for E. coli, so it was not possible to study all the combinations as transformants could not be obtained in some cases. For each part, a measurement system was built, exploiting the production of the reporter gene GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) to evaluate the ""switch on"" condition of every self-inducible promoter. Many different combinations were explored, in order to provide a library of promoters able to initiate transcription at the desired culture density.
Modulation of plasmid copy number
Sender and receiver devices were assembled in an unique part (such as <partinfo>BBa_K300017</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K300014</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K300015</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K300016</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K300012</partinfo>) in high copy number plasmid <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo> or low copy number plasmid <partinfo>pSb4C5</partinfo>.

Night of Art & Science
For lunch, we met team TU Delft 2012. We had a short, but nice talk about our projects which are both on olfaction by micro-organisms!
After that, Renske, Jon and Wlada prepared some posters for the Night, and at 19:30 it started. From that time until 02:00, Tom, Wlada, Elbrich, Arjan & Renske explained their project, the beauty of micro-organisms, the use (or not) of washing your hands and more to many of the 4000 people walking around in the Aa-church.

Benjamin Devreux :
Benjamin is a master student in bioengineering in chemical and bio-industry. To put it simply, Benjamin will always disagree with you. Why ? Just to bother you, of course. He loves to grumble on everyone and about everything. But in reality when he makes something, he makes it right. For iGEM, he’s ready to make more than 150 petri dishes to make you happy. And thanks to him, we can explain our project to everyone with a simple but efficient video.
Benjamin in one song ? Surely, “Beat it” (Michael Jackson).
Damien Fivet :
Damien is a master student in bioengineering. Damien is clearly the father of the team. During hard moment, he’s the one that you send to negotiate with your opponent. He’s always calm and peaceful. Furthermore, Damien is the one who has a calendar in his hands, reminding you all the things to do and when. Without him, we would never have done anything in a timely manner.
Damien in one song ? Surely, “Hold that tiger” (The swing ninjas).
François Tyckaert :
François is a master student in biology. He is our DNA sequencing expert. He is also the redhead of the team (well, one of them). He has plenty of explanations for your lab’s problems… Maybe too much but never mind that, it’s often quite useful for the rest of the team.
François in one song? Surely, “Bare necessities” (The Jungle Book)
Grégory Godefroi :
Grégory is a master student in bioengineering. To describe him in few words, he is a hard worker. Ready to work a lot, at all time of the day or night. He’s also a true master in chemical physics field, or maybe not. Ask him, you’ll see. Grégory was also the guy who forced us to go outside (not for pleasure or to enjoy the sun, just to catch some pokemons ;) ).
Grégory in one song ? Surely, “Gotta catch em all” (Pokémon)
Joaquin Guzman :

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved"

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#ODF_-_-_TEXT.html," Digispark pretends to be a keyboard, that types the results extremely quickly into the computer it’s plugged into. The interpreter software can intercept this, along with other keyboard events for changing the settings to provide useful output.
As processing is shifted onto the device it’s plugged into, data analysis is much easier as readings can be automatically logged and exported to spreadsheets. With Judd-UK’s feedback, readings can be marked with ‘recording numbers’, making it easy to do batch measurements. Also based off their feedback, we added a button to export only the ‘recorded’ data to csv. See the collaborations page for more details.
Showing Judd-UK our fluorometer and densitometer.
This framework makes the device easier to modify as a few lines can be changed on the webpage rather than reconfiguring the Arduino board or rewiring the circuit with different components. This in turn also reduces the risk of irreversibly damaging the hardware through bugs in the code. Website programming is much more forgiving than Arduino programming, allowing people with less experience to modify the software. It is also much easier to debug as computers can spit out error messages to the screen.
Moving the complicated processing to the device it is plugged into also means you can use cheaper components in the fluorometer, further reducing the cost. It allows smaller and fewer components to be used, making the device more portable and easier to build.
The interpreter is designed to be used continuously. While the fluorometer is logging data, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to change the options.
Instructions
Our digisparks came with pins free - if yours do too, solder the pins to the board first so you can more easily swap components out if it doesn’t work.
To snap them simply use 2 sets of needle-nose pliers at the point you want them to break and twist.
If you don’t already have a soldering iron check your electrical engineering, physics department or local hackspaces. Most of the time they’ll give you instructions, but if not or you just want more guidance there’s lots of advice online on how to get started soldering. We were lucky enough to be trained by our physics teacher, but sparkfun’s guide looks pretty good too! Don’t hold us responsible for your safety - if in doubt ask someone who knows what they’re doing.
Our one warning is about the light sensors (TSL235R) - the pins are easy to break and they are fairly expensive so be careful with them!

Note there’s just one LED - if you solder both the optical density and fluorescence LEDs seperately and use pin"

6. Selectivity study:
Olivier ROSSEL developed a new electrode architecture he compared to the FINE electrode. The FINE electrode used is the one developed by Paul YOO and Dominique DURAND (Cf. Figure 7).
Figure 10: FINE electrode, h = 0,5 mm [9].
Olivier ROSSEL tried to improve this electrode replacing each measure point by a small tripole and by deleting two external ring. He called this electrode the FORTE electrode for “FINE with Original Recording Tripolar Electrode” (Cf. Figure 11). The main difference between these two electrodes is the inter-poles distance in the longitudinal way.
Figure 11: FORTE electrode, h = 375 μm [9].
Figure 12: Two fascicles represented in the electrode. These disposition of the fascicles is the one used for the simulations made to obtain figure 13 and figure 14 [9].
The activity of two fascicles is simulated (Cf. Figure 12) and the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the output signals are compared (Cf. Figure 13). The first difference we see is the signal from the FORTE electrode is attenuated 20 dB compared to the FINE electrode. In figure 13, we see that when only one fascicle is active, the FORTE electrode makes it possible to locate the active fascicle much more easily than the FINE electrode.
Figure 13: Peak-to-peak tension received by the tripole n (from tripole 1 to tripole 13) for the red and black fascicles [9].
Moreover, in the general case of a simultaneous activity of different fascicles, the signals from the different active fascicles are summed at the level of each tripoles (Cf. Figure 14). We can see that for the FINE electrode the amplitude measured makes it impossible to differentiate the active fascicles. However, for the FORTE electrode, since the small tripole is locally sensitive, we can’t see the difference between the figure 13 and the figure 14. It is easy to differentiate the active fascicles.
Figure 14: Simulated ENG for FINE electrode (A) and for the FORTE electrode (B) for the two fascicles in the case of a simultaneous activity. The contribution of each fascicles is designed by the color avec the fascicles in the figure 13. Each fascicle contains around two hundred active axons [9].
Finally, we see the FORTE electrode can"

Lund,2018,Team:Lund#Design#Theory_-_-_TEXT.html," that VHb is localized in the cytoplasm and to a large extent near the cell membrane in both Vitreoscilla and E. coli [12]. These two observations indicate that VHb indeed transports oxygen to the respiratory chain, since if VHb is not in proximity to the cell membrane, it has high affinity for oxygen and vice versa, if bound the affinity is greatly reduced. Since respiration occurs around cell membranes, it seems highly plausible that VHb transports oxygen to the respiratory chain via direct interaction.
Other supporting experiments include showing that VHb can stimulate oxygenase activity [13][14] and even itself serve as a terminal oxidase [15]. The latter was shown by cultivating cells with no terminal oxidases under aerobic conditions, in which only cells containing VHb could maintain an aerobic respiration. Moreover, it has been shown that VHb protects from oxidative stress [16][17] and that increased expression levels are correlated with increased cell growth [18].
The putative mechanism is illustrated in fig. 2. When VHb is free in the cytoplasm, it has a high affinity to oxygen and binds accordingly. Then, anchoring to the cell membrane causes a decrease in affinity and a subsequent oxygen release. This oxygen may then be consumed within the respiratory chain.
Figure 2: VHb binds to membrane and releases oxygen
Previous research
Several studies have investigated the influence of the VHb expression level on the cell growth and the production of various desired products. In 2010, Sanny et al. managed to increase production of ethanol in E. coli by as much as 119% when expressing VHb in their ethanol-producing strain. However, they found that when they increased the VHb expression level by inserting the vgb gene into other plasmids, the ethanol production decreased to levels below that of the strain with no VHb expression at all, indicating that only low levels of VHb expression were beneficial [20].
Yu et al. studied the effect of VHb on the production of the biopolymer poly(β-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) in E. coli both by integrating the vgb gene into the host chromosome and by keeping it on a plasmid. What they found was that chromosomal integration if vgb increased PHB content in cells grown in flasks to 83.8%, as compared to the non-vgb carrying strain where the content was less than 70% under the same conditions. However, when the vgb gene was instead carried on a plasmid, both PHB production and cell growth were far lower than with"

Result - Memory System
Outline
The basic idea of this memory system was first developed by KULeuven during the 2008 iGEM competition. This memory system is applied in our referee system to memorize that the inducer (lactose) has been added or not. When the inducer is removed, the function of whole device can be switched to a contrary one. (It can only be switched on once and can never go back). Therefore, the memory system maintains media colorless until the lactose is added.
Component Descriptions
Strand A
PcI434 (BBa_R0052) is inhibited by cI434-LVA(BBa_C0052) protein .
The promoter PcIIP22 (BBa_R0053) is inhibited by cIIP22 (BBa_C0053) protein.
Without any control, the promoter PcI434 is stronger than the promoter PcIIP22 in transcription.
RBS (BBa_B0031) on strand D have a better efficiency of transcription than the RBS (BBa_B0033) on strand E.
The promoter Plac (BBa_K091110) is inhibited by lacI (BBa_K091121) protein.
Principle and Mechanism
The memory system in our bacterial referee has three stages:
Standby phase: bacteria grow in lactose-free medium.
Lactose-accession phase: lactose is added in medium.
Lactose-consumption phase: bacteria eat all lactose, and the medium does not contain lactose.
Standby stage: the medium is colorless
When bacteria grow in the lactose-free medium, the lacI (BBa_K091121) protein is produced by constitutive promoter and represses the Plac (BBa_K091110) promoter. Therefore, green fluorescent protein with LVA tags (GFP-LVA) (BBa_K145015) is not expressed in the medium. Since the transcription activity of the PcI434 promoter is stronger than the PcIIP22 (BBa_R0053) promoter, cIIP22 (BBa_C0053) can be produced and re"

Safety
Slide over the picture to know some useful tips to work at the lab:
1. Do your project ideas raise biosafety issues?
Every project in Synthetic Biology should be assessed in terms of biosafety. It is important to evaluate all the risks the new projects could cause. In our project we additionally discussed a lot of ethical issues before we starting working. One of them, which was highly treatedaddressed, was the problem of mutations. Organisms can change and we cannot control all these changes, that means that when we design a modified organism with a specific target and a specific purpose, one cannot rule out that it can mutate and stop working as expected.
This topic has been analyzed through several discussions carried out in Bergen (Norway), Banyuls (France), Barcelona and Valencia (Spain) after showing our fantastic short—film. This film is part of our Human Practices project (available in our Ethical issues section: https://2012.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Ethics )
Public and environmental safety
We work with two kinds of organisms. Escherichia coli is a gram-negative bacterium that dwells naturally in the colon of some organisms, including humans. Some strains can cause serious food poisoning in humans, but laboratory ones are harmless due to some genetic restrictions. In addition, we are using ampicillin resistance genes in our plasmid as a selectable marker for bacterial transformations. Moreover, we also have special containers for biological material for storage and disposal.
In addition, we are using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The strains we are using are disabled outside the laboratory because of amino acid deficiency. So, they are not expected to survive outside the laboratory.
All biologically-contaminated material, including Petri dishes, broth, inoculation plasticware and others were systematically destroyed by autoclaving.
None of our designs or parts are highly hazardous to the environment since they mainly involve environment-sensing genes and fluorescent proteins."

Social Media Report
""I hate social media. I have Twitter, just so I can tell people what to buy.”
Louis C. K.
Introduction
As part of our iGEM project we wanted to raise awareness on synthetic biology. As such it seemed beneficial to have a successful social media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation. Opportunities for green marketing: young consumers . Social Media Influencing Green Buying
Our Strategy
The design of our logo consisting of a light font and a picture of a leaf combined with an electrical plug, was determined in the start of April. We sought to make a simple logo that showed the essence of our project, The PowerLeaf, not only in name but in brand as well.
During spring we narrowed down the relevant hashtags of our Twitter and Instagram to #science, #igem, #sdu, #gmo, and #forsksdu. These hashtags were used at relevant occasions and generally helped expanding our reach on social media. A few times we even used a couple of silly hashtags like #adventuretime and #lifechoices when we found it appropriate.
A complete relaunch of our social media platforms was made in the start of April. One of the changes we made was the setup of the Facebook page and Twitter account, that we changed to resemble an enterprise.
Results
Looking at Figure 1 we see the number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year. There is a sharp increase around the start of April, this correlate nicely with the relaunch of our social media. Since we started using the Facebook page on March 1st, we have seen an increase of followers on 44%.
Figure 2 shows the number of unique interactions with our Facebook posts each day. Some posts gained around 200 interactions per day, while the highest amount of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"F-Regulated-LuxI in Figure 7. OmpR-Regulated-RhII is basically similar to OmpR-Regulated-RFP where RFP is replaced by RhlI synthase which produces OHHL. In MicF-Regulated-LuxI, GFP of MicF-Regulated-GFP is similarly replaced with BHL producing quorum synthase that is LuxI.
Putting it all together
This is our final product in the signaling pathway which is a combination of OmpR-Regulated-RhII, MicF-Regulated-LuxI and micF RNA. The final goal of this project in the signaling section is to achieve a highly sensitive on-off switch mechanism in the OmpR dependent regulatory system depending on the kinase and the phosphatase activity of the BAR. See OmpR-Regulated-RhII/LuxI in Figure 7.

We added the coding sequences for seqA , ugi and cda1 via gene synthesis.
We assembled the mutagenesis genes by Gibson Assembly and added BBa_B0031 in the     process in front of each mutation gene. To easily assemble six genes the synthesis was done in two steps. At first dnaQ926, dam and seqA respectively emrR, ugi and cda1 were combined. Sadly the first assembly could only be isolated without the dnaQ926 RBS. In the     following step both synthesis intermediates were combined by BioBrick Assembly . To add the RBS in front of dnaQ926 and to add a terminator behind the construct     the complete genes were cloned into BBa_K516031 . The complete coding sequences with     ribosome binding site were cloned downstream of our modified PBAD to obtain the final construct BBa_K208117 .
Figure 4: Schematic view of the cloning process leading to BBa_K208117 .
To assess the effect of seperate expression of dnaQ926, which is a very strong mutator in itself, this gene alone was cloned into BBa_K516031 ,     added downstream of our modified PBAD, which yielded BBa_K2082116 .
Figure 5: Schematic view of BBa_K2082116 .
Reporter
To characterise our mutation systems we did reversion assays . Therefore, we needed reporter proteins, which activity could     be easily measured. We decided on beta-lactamase and gfp as reporters because of the easy detection assays.
Before deciding where to put the stop-codon we put a lot of effort into identifying suitable positions. We had two concerns:
Can we make sure that the stop-codon is outside of the okazaki-fragments?
Can we make sure that every single base pair change, that does not change the stop codon to another stop codon, reverts the reporter back to function?
First first points is due to the irregular distribution of mutations when using the error-prone polymerase I. Because of the enzymes role in processing     okazaki fragments these region are hotspots to mutations. The mutation rate of a hotspot region would appear higher than that of the main part of the mutated region.
To solve this problem we choose to create two different reporters, where"

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," college students knowing prions(405 out of 559 =72.4%) is much higher than that of bachelors(75 out of 396 =18.9%), masters(31 our of 72 =43.1%) or even doctors(23 out of 38 =60.5%). Even the percentage of people with high school or below education knowing prions(41 out of 204 =20.1%) is a little higher than that of bachelors. Maybe you can comment that the number of masters and doctors we research is too small to make the conclusion, but the data for hundreds of bachelors and undergraduate college students can reveal the strange phenomenon.
We find two explanations for this phenomenon. The first one is that the change of education theories and courses in universities and high schools may cause the students nowadays to know more about subjects out of their own majors. Nowadays many colleges in China expect their stuents to learn general knowledge of all kinds of subjects to equip them with basic comprehension of these fields and help them make correct decision when choosing their majors. Even high schools are trying to lead  students to learn more in the subjects they are interested in. However, universities in the past encouraged students to learn more about their majors as they can and become proficient in their fields, thus resulting that students who don't major in biology know little about prions and this can explain why there are less percentage of bachelors(graduate students from univiersities in the past) know prions than undergraduate college students and high school students. Another explanation is deviation in choosing our samples. Since we spread this questoinnaire on the Internet and many of our team members major in biology, their classmates or friends in the same major may be more likely to have connection with them on the Internet and willing to answer these questions about their interest. This may cause the invalid statistics of the group of undergraduate students.
Now let's see the relationship between people's attitude to the application of prions and their knowledge of it.
We can conclude that answerers haven't know about prions are more likely to be worried about the application of them in industry than those who know something about them while yeast prions are impossible to infect human beings. This result can explain why it is important to           popularize general scientific knowledge to the public to avoid misunderstanding.
In question 5, we try to explain that yeast prions are safe enough for application and scientific research, after which we could see the changes of attitudes of the answerers.
After our providing some knowledge about yeast prions, we are glad to see these who haven't known prions"

RBS design begun. Library calculator run using 34 N's as a constraint in the ""Constraints"" field. Nothing used in pre sequence field. First 60 bp of original superfolder GFP used as ""coding sequence"". Clay started working on MATLAB program for codon optimization.
Friday, May 23, 2014
The transformed colonies took over 24 hours to grow - something unusual for this strain but something Ashlee had observed since after she inserted the HMF pathway and attempted to insert dCas9. We picked six colonies for overnight growth to do more cloning tomorrow.
Design of GFPs continues as Clay works on program to optimize genes. Question asked: which GFP should be optimized? GFP mut3b and superfolder GFP both present advantages and disadvantages. Met with Chiam Yu to discuss effects of codon optimization on translation. Acquired data from previous codon optimization project, which will serve as the basis for our fast/slow codon optimization.
Saturday, May 24, 2014
Memorial Day Weekend? How about lab cloning weekend! Only one of the 5 terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 ligation colonies grew. Ashlee conducted plasmid preparation of the terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 vector and digested this (the backbone) and the dCas9 system (the insert) with restriction enzymes AatII and AflII.
More RBS library calculations run. Problem: since TIR is dependent on the first 60 bp of a coding sequence and our variant GFPs will differ in this region, how can we ensure that an accurate library is developed?
Sunday, May 25, 2014
The 5 colonies still did not grow. Ashlee prepared a gel and ran the dCas9 and backbone digestions and gel purified them. Colonies had not been growing well for Ashlee in the latter half of the semester as the plasmid size increased above 12 kb, so a new strategy would have to be pursued.
Back to Top
Monday, May 26, 2014
Due to a string of failed clonings with the broadhost vector pSEVA251 and the large inserts, new designs are evaluated! Instead of creating a plasmid with the HMF pathway (7.5 kb) and dCas9 system (5.5 kb), we shall add the HMF pathway and dCas9 to the P. putida genome using homologous recombination.

Each point was definitely helpful, and something that I had not fully considered at that time.  This has been true during this summer research program thus far, as well as through previous years of experience-- but the more that I learn, the more I realize how little I actually understand in the world.  However, I only feel that much more energized and excited to fill in the gaps and pursue what I don’t know.  Today was a very full day-- we learned a lot of hard biology, we chatted about how museum-goers would experience our product, we discussed how to bring up this sensitive topic… I feel optimistic and ready to move forward tomorrow and the rest of the summer!
6/9/2015: Day 7
Today was an intense session of brainstorming.  We spent the morning coming up with three separate, very different possible museum exhibit ideas and designs to show Romie and Anja during our Skype call at 2:30.  Our current ideas are affectionately titled “BacMan”, “BacFarm”, and “Bac to Mars”, and I’m excited to pursue work on any of them!
During the call, they were both very pleasant and seem very committed to cultivating a creative space where museum-goers can learn in novel ways, and I’m definitely excited to work closer with them over the next few months.  We left the Skype call with the intention of beginning to pursue one of the ideas (probably the Mars exhibition, affectionately titled Bac to Mars) with the more specific technical goal of furthering our understanding of Cornerstone markers-- figuring out how to get the screen to recognize multiple and respond differently to a set.  By then, we were pretty worn out from a day of such brainstorming and creative thinking, so we spent the last hour helping transcribe interviews gathering information for another project happening in the HCI lab. I’m looking forward to coming in tomorrow and tackling markers.
6/10/2015: Day 8
We began the day with the goal of further exploring and understanding the Cornerstone Marker documentation.  We were able to program our app to detect and act if two markers touched the screen at the same time, but discovered that the app was inconsistent when identifying individual marker codes.  As the markers that the lab already had were a little worn out and folded on the corners, we decided to try printing out new markers and fiddle around to see the smallest marker that the app could still accurately detect.  Using the MarkerFactory application, we created, saved, and printed new markers"

Andreas: Found some information on using Lactobacilli as our cloning organism for the project. The Edinburgh 2007 iGEM team used a Lactobacillus strain (probably acidophilus?) for their yoghurt project. They created a vector which they successfully used in both Lactobacillus and E. coli. The vector is available as BBa_I742103 and the project link is attached below: https://2007.igem.org/Edinburgh/Yoghurt/Design#Gene_Expression_In_Lactobacillus I also found out that many Lactobacilli have pretty short generation times (down to 25 minutes), so that shouldn’t be a problem either.
Andreas: They have now released the contents of the DNA kit plates which will be sent out to the teams. BBa_I742103 is not included in these kits, which means we will have to order it separately. It might be a good idea to check whether there are any other BioBricks we need that are not included in the kits, so that we can order them from the BioBrick foundation. Such parts might be antibiotic resistance cassettes, for example, if we need to use any specific antibiotics when working with Lactobacillus. Here’s a link to the DNA kits of the 2010 competition:

This would allow iGEM projects (and other projects where genetic engineering is used) to pass this hurdle on their way to releasing their constructs into the environment where they could be used for the real life purpose they were built for. This does not, of course, means that any constructs can now be released into the wild, as the properties of the construct still need to be considered, but that the issue of antibiotic resistance will no longer be present.

It's important to understand the difference between the software darwin and the utility dwndiff. Over the summer, the team produced dwndiff, which is a command-line utility for producing what are called ""diff"" files suitable for use with genomic data. darwin, on the other hand, is the overall vision of the software team: to produce a solution for tracking changes to all sorts of genomic data. Given input files in FASTA, GenBank, or ApE format, the dwndiff utility can speedily produce output files which can be used with an external version control system much more easily. Examples of such version control systems include git , svn , and hg .
Using dwndiff is somewhat complex at first, but let's start with the most obvious solution: the ""help"" command:
$ dwndiff --help       Usage: dwndiff [OPTION...] FILE...       dwndiff is a command-line tool to format DNA sequences for use in version       control systems. It is intended to be used as a backend for version control       tools which act upon biological data. It defaults to 'format' mode, where it       formats a given DNA sequence (through stdin, or the given files) to a special       format, appending the '.vcsfmt' suffix. If given the '-c' option, however, it       will take two files, convert them to .vcsfmt format if necessary, and produce a       .vcscmp file which can be used in version control software.        -p, --preformat_loc=DIR    Location of pre-existing .vcsfmt files for given       input DNA       -w, --write                Write output to file(s) instead of stdout       -c, --compare              If two files given, produce unix diff-compatible       comparison .vcscmp file       -v, --verbose              Produce verbose output       -?, --help                 Give this help list       --usage                Give a short usage message       -V, --version              Print program version        Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional       for any corresponding short options.
Let's break this down into multiple cases:
Given a genomic file, convert it to a version-controllable format, which we call vcsfmt.
Given two vcsfmt files, find the difference between them and produce a file to be put under version control, which we call vcscmp"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,". The general matching relations could be written as (n1,n2,n3...)->(m1,m2,m3...), where (n1,n2,n3...) represents chains in the template and (m1,m2,m3...) represents the chains matched in the species for (n1,n2,n3...) respectively. However, it is only  part of the matching relation because details, such as the matching positions of parts in the template, are ignored.  The next question is: how to validate each matching?
As defined in Chain-Node model, details of distribution of binding are stored in the forest. Matching of chains could not solely determine the overall match -- whether the template and the species have the same structural pattern. However, it is not easy to compare tree structure directly. We designed an algorithm to do this based on the principle: If the template and species have the same structural pattern, it must be possible to isolate the template from the species after replacing the ST part with its matchings. We first replace the ST part of the template with its matchings in the species. And then, we remove the chains which are not matched and the associated trees -- containing leaf nodes whose corresponding parts are on those chains. If the species after removing has the same Chain-Node structure with the template after replacing, the template and the species have the same structural pattern and in brief, the template could be matched to the species. We also illustrate this idea in figures.
However, there is one problem of this algorithm. Consider a LacI dimer template, whose Chain-Node model has two chains with one part on each and one tree with 2 leaf nodes. And there is also a LacI dimer species, it has the same structural pattern with the template. The matching should be (T1,T2)->(C1,C2) and (T1,T2)->(C2,C1) according to the algorithm described above. However, there is indeed one matching since the two matchings are the same. The underlying reason is that the two chains of the template are equivalent: it makes no difference to the tree structure (Huffman code of each node) if they are exchanged. Hence, several equivalent chains should be matched to a certain set of chains in the species only once.
The algorithm of species matching is of the most importance since it provides technical support for structure-based description of species and reactions. It costs most of the running time. We will try to increase the efficiency of the codes of this part.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

MSMEG_5998 ( BBa_K2382001 )
This is an enzyme that could degrade aflatoxin with the aid of coenzyme F420. It belongs to the F420H2-dependent reductases family from Mycobacterium Smegmatis.
F420-Dependent Glucose-6- phosphate Dehydrogenase ( BBa_K2382002 )
The working condition of MSMEG_5998 includes the help from coenzyme F420. F420-dependent glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (FGD) is the enzyme that reduces the F420 being used by MSMEG_5998 and make it available again.
T7 promoter & Lac operator and RBS from PET-29a ( BBa_K2382003 )
This part originated from pET-29 a (+) Vectors, and it is composed of T7 promoter, Lac operator, and RBS.
Thioredoxin with polylinker( BBa_K2382004 )
This part previously functioned as a DNA recombination and repair protein in E. coli. It is also found that Thioredoxin is capable of increasing enzyme activity of our protein, MSMEG5998. We designed a polylinker that has multiple restriction cutting sites at the end of this part for future iGEM teams who want to make their protein more effective.

Michigan,2012,Team:Michigan#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," recombinase bearing high sequence homology to FimE and other fim recombinases, was discovered in 2006 by Xie et al and also catalyses inversion of the fimS region. Our concept harnesses HbiF to convert the FimE-activatable expression system described by Ham et al., 2006 into a bidirectional switch capable of binary states dependent on the presence and expression of either FimE or HbiF recombinases. Team Michigan’s submission of HbiF, BBa_K880000, possesses a protein fusion standard RFC25 suffix to facilitate circuit regulation or protein quantification.
In contrast to FimE, HbiF catalyzes the rotation of fimS from the “off” to “on” position in vivo.
Rationale
A Tightly-controlled, stable switch
A system utilizing both FimE and HbiF has several advantages beyond available multi-state biological circuits. As the binding site for HbiF becomes a FimE binding site after inversion, the system contains a remarkable number of reusable components. One recombinase can flip the fimS sequence only after the other recombinase has acted. This limitation allows the host to remember its previous state as the inversion region is flipped; it will not respond to duplicates of the same signal and instead allows for all target sequences to accumulate in one state. The switching sequence can also theoretically flip back and forth without generating new component and without being depleted.
Cheaper Biomanufacturing
A system utilizing both FimE and HbiF as actuators would allow for the creation of a genetic circuit that works in a manner analogous to a push-button switch.  Current expression systems often rely on inducible promoters systems, such as pBAD and the lac promoter, requiring a constant administration of inducers making them more analogous to a switch that is actively being held in the “ON” position.  The constant administration of inducers, such as arabinose and lactose, are a component of the high operating costs of biomanufacturing.  FimE and HbiF in concert with separate inducible promoters could be used as a push-button switch where a short exposure to one of the inducers would trigger recombinase expression resulting in inversion of the switch and a new set of protein expression.  This “push-button switch” would eliminate the need for constant administration of inducers, resulting in a reduction in operating costs for biomanufacturing.  This “push-button switch” would also improve upon the recombinase system described in Ham et al., 2006 as"

Introduction
This is the protocol for making a 5x Tea solution.
Materials
4 HEB Ready to Brew Iced Tea Bags
757 mL of diH2O
10-15 Coffee Filters
.2 µm Filter
Procedure
Boiling the Water
Heat up the distilled water in the microwave until it begins to boil. This should take around 3-4 minutes, depending on the microwave. However, due to the fact that the water does not have any impurities, it will not bubble like normal water would when boiling. YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN HEATING THE WATER UP BECAUSE ONCE SOMETHING TOUCHES THE WATER, SUCH AS A TEA BAG, IT WILL INSTANTLY BEGIN TO BUBBLE AND MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS.
Steeping the Tea
Place 4 tea bags into the boiling water to steep for 5 minutes. Be careful to not burn yourself.
First Filtration
After steeping, filter the tea through a 10-15 in order to strain out the large particulates.
Second Filtration
Pour the tea through a .2 µm filter in order to strain out smaller particulates.
Note- You might have to run the tea through more coffee filters in order for all of the solution to filter through the .2 µm filter

Mind the Gut: Effectors
We started our work with TPH1 characterisation. We prepared two inoculations of seed culture in LAB media and chrolamphenicol until the growth reached to the optical density of 0.5-0.6. We induced one of the culture with 1mM IPTG and left them overnight in shaking incubator.
Meanwhile, we also prepared 25mM Tris-2 mM EDTA lysis buffer at pH 8.5.
Wednesday 26th
Mind the Gut: Effectors
We centrifuged the whole culture and resuspended with 2ml of lysis buffer.
We lysed the cells by sonication (10 cycles of 10s with 15s break in between) and measured the concentration of TPH1 protein using Bradford assay. Meanwhile, 100mM MES buffer at pH 7 was prepared for making tryptophan solution.
We then made different concentration of TPH1 in 120 ul of tryptophan-Mes solution.
We also prepared solutions with different concentration of 5HTP as a control for the experiment.
Finally we plated the first seven columns of 96 well plates in increasing order of TPH1 concentration and the rest of the columns with increasing 5HTP concentrations which we expected would remain constant.
We expected the fluorescence to increase with increasing TPH1 concentration however, we got mixed result. We had performed the assay with excitation at 320 wavelength and emission at 420 nm. However, the paper we had based our assay on advised execution at 300nm and to measure emission at 330 nm, so we decided to repeat the process with these changes.

We centrifuged and lysed our cells by sonication.
We performed the assay according to the protocol with only changing the excitation to 300nm and emission at 330 nm in fluorescense plate counter. We had good data, as the fluoresense increased with increasing concentration of TPH1 and remained constant for control sample. Yayyy!

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," conditions for restriction digest detection via polyacrylamid gel. Starting with pretty bad results of blurry gels, we changed  from TAE to TBE gels and determined the right volume of restriction enzymes and reaction times for complete cleavage of the DNA substrates.
After setting up the right conditions for the DNA-Page, we tried to run the DNA methylated by Dnmt1. Unfortunately we had some complications with the gel polymerisation and salt concentration. We improved the conditions.
We continued to test activity of Dnmt1. After changing the reaction buffer which before consists out of HEPES as buffer substrate to Tris and adapting the pH to 7.0 we finally managed to get nicely and sharp looking gel pictures.
We also received our first precursor linkers for Dnmt1 out of the Modelling software and ordered them as Oligos. Using the RFC standard we constructed our standard construct for circularisation with inteins and Sortase A. The constructs contain a mRFP or ccdB selection marker as placeholder for different linkers.
We tested our linear Dnmt protein at 37°C and 65°C and over a wide timespan. We could clearly see an increase in methylation over time. Although we are using a truncated version of Dnmt1 our protein is strongly active and quite specific as it almost no de novo methylation could be detected. The starting construct for circularisation was transformed in our pSBX1K3 Expression vector.
Further cloning of circularisation standard for Dnmt1(731-1602) using golden gate cloning after our RFC standard method was conducted.
Dnmt1 was exposed to a temperature gradient between 37°C to 57°C and behaviour was characterised. Unfortunately this method failed, as DNMT1 did not show any methylation even at 37°C.
Essays with new substances was run to ensure methylation was still possible. The linker oligos arrived and were cloned into the circularisation construct.
We expressed of 4 circular DNMT1 constructs in Rosetta (DE3). Constructs were: DNMT1 without linker and with rigid linker for sortase circularisation and DNMT1 with flexible linker and with rigid linker for circularisation with inteins.
The four previously expressed proteins were lysed using french press and purified using a His trap column. Analytic gels were run to ensure purification of DNMT1. In parallel, sortase reaction was tried using GFP, but showed not to be working. Subsequently we decided to drop sortase due to little time left.

We were helped greatly in this regard by Associate Prof. Maike Bublitz, from the Biochemistry department, who provided us with purified TEV protease and guided us on how to purify the protein using a nickel column, which was kindly lent to us by Prof. Matt Higgins, also from the department.
Figure 3: SDS-PAGE gel from purification, the ladder used was Benchmark Protein Standard from Novex. Lanes 2 and 4 show wash fractions, 3 supernatant, and 5-8 elution fractions. The part was expected at a Mw of 74kDA
It appeared from our SDS-PAGE gel, however, that we may have used too strong a wash for our purification, and washed our protein from the column before we got to our elution fractions. We tried some of the fractions in the plate reader to be sure, however there was no increase in sfGFP over time.
In vivo Cleavage Assay
Following this setback, we instead decided to characterise the cleavage in vivo. A member of the Biochemistry department, Matteo Ferla, kindly gave us a plasmid with TEV protease which was compatible with our part, and was IPTG-inducible. We co-transformed it with our plasmid and induced subcultures from an overnight growth with varying IPTG levels. We used three biological and three technical repeats and used a BMG CLARIOSTAR platereader to obtain sfGFP readings over the course of 10 hours in order to obtain end-point fluorescence and dynamics of the reaction.
Figure 4: End-point analysis of induction and cleavage. Cells were grown overnight in M9 media and subcultured down before being induced with arabinose at 0.1% w/v and IPTG. They were then allowed to run in a BMG CLARIOSTAR platereader for 10 hours. Three biological and technical repeats were averaged and the SEM used to make the error bars.
After removing anomalous results and calculating the average and standard error, we were able to plot a graph comparing the non-quenched strain, quenched strain, and quenched-strain with the TEV-protease plasmid co-transformed. The end-point analysis showed that the induction of the TEV protease did indeed relieve quenching of the fluorescence. The levels of unquenched and Qu"

As the phages and their properties are not known, working with them might not be safe As there was a shortage of living mites for the in vivo display anyway, we decided to switch to an in vitro phage display method.
Nevertheless, the results obtained up to then in the mite phage display experiments have been analyzed and the following binding site motif was found:
Figure 13. Consensus sequence of recovered phages in in vivo Phage Display in V. destructor. The legend shows which aminoacid has which properties. The letters ""N"" and ""C"" in the graph indicate the N-terminus and the C-terminus, respectively.
in vitro
For an in vitro assay, vesicles of the T. molitor midgut and V. destructor have been produced, according to the protocol . In short, cells were lysed, lipids were separated and then left for reassembly. These vesicles should have no phages attached on the outside, due to the way they were prepared. The only chance of having phages that are naturally occurring in mealworms or Varroa mites was thus that they had been trapped inside of the vesicle during the preparation steps and so relatively low. Unfortunately, the titer of phages bound to the vesicles prepared from V. destructor decreased dramatically after the first round of display and dropped to 0 after the second round. This indicates that the phages did not bind to the vesicles in a way that is strong enough to keep them attached during the separation step of vesicles with attached phages from phages that have not bound. The reasons for this might be investigated and the protocol used for this phage display might still be optimized.
Varroa Isolates
Staining Isolates
To provide an alternative to currently available pesticides, we wanted to adapt Cry toxins to kill V. destructor. Cry toxins, also known as Bt toxins, have been used commercially for decades and can limit the environmental impact of pesticide use 1 . Cry toxins are produced by the insect pathogen B. thuringiensis. Their mode of action can make them highly specific to certain species of insects.
While over 800 Cry toxins are known, research on the workings of these toxins mainly focuses on conventional pests such as the Colorado potato beetle, cabbage moths and mosquitoes.

And the Bluetooth module sends the information of ammonia concentration to the user’s mobile phone during the detection process.
Safety
In our first plan, we install a valve and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the bottom of the detection cell. Once the detecting process finishes, the valve opens and the water sample flow into the pool through the microporous filter.
In our second plan, we make the breeding and detection cell separated from other parts of the device, and can be pulled out like a draw. We can then pour out the bacteria solution and autoclave it for sterilization. As for the detection cell and pump tube, the only component in pump that will contact with the bacteria we choose sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to sterilize.
Cost
In our researches we find that most fishermen are aware of the serious consequences of excessive ammonia. Yet instead of monitoring the water precisely, they always decide whether to clean the pool merely by experience. The main reason, we believe, is that ammonia detection machines are rather expansive. Many of them are priced at over 10000 yuan each, and even the cheapest one could cost more than 2000. Our device, by contrast, is much more available, which costs approximately 300 yuan each.
Hardware
3D printing technique was applied in constructing the detection system. We employed a 3D printer, FlashPrint Creator Pro, and produced some components with ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) material.
Pumping System
For pumping water in and out the detecting cell, we bought two Kamoer peristaltic pumps NKP-DE-S04 (6V, 5W) which weigh 110g, with the silicone pump pipe (service life≥200h) with internal and external diameter of 1.0/3.3mm. The pump can transports more than 11mL water per minute. Each pump has a pipe inserted into the hole on the lid of detecting cell. One for pumping pool water into the cell, and another for pumping it from cell to the cup.
Detection System
We printed a frame of the detecting cell, and fixed two pieces of quartz glass on it, to imitate a cuvette. Quartz glass has relatively high light transmission, thus can be an alternative for cuvette, which is expensive. The columns at the corner are designed to help to fix the glass, while the outreaching bar enables users"

Introduction and theory
Synthetic peptide chemists have long produced peptide-based materials in vitro. Star-shaped peptides are a promising type of biomaterial being explored in the field of nanomedicine (Sulistio et al., 2012). Star peptides can have several biomedical uses, such as acting as drug delivery vehicles (Sulistio et al., 2011) or linkers for other biomacromolecules. Star peptides generally take the form of several linear peptide arms linked together in a central core. One way of linking these linear peptide arms together is to used covalent bonds such as those in disulfides. Typically, disulfide bonds are formed synthetically by taking several linear arms and treating them with an oxidant in vitro. Here, we introduce a new approach to forming star peptides using E. coli and synthetic biology. Thus, we aimed to show how the peptides synthesis and disulfide bond forming machinery of E. coli can be used to form disulfide linked star peptides and key star peptide precursors.
 
Synthesis approach
E. coli naturally possesses the capacity to form disulfide bonds. In native strains, disulfide bonds are naturally formed by an array of enzymes which are part of the Dsb family (e.g. DsbA and DsbC) (Kadokura et al., 2003, Kadokura and Beckwith, 2009). Normally, these enzymes are found in the oxidizing periplasm of the cell. However, several new strains of E. coli have recently been engineered which contain an oxidizing cytoplasm conducive to disulfide bond formation. One example of this is the SHuffle cell line (Lobstein et al., 2012). The cell line contains mutations to key enzymes responsible for the reducing nature of the cytoplasm, namely thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor). Furthermore, the Shuffle cell line over expresses the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC to the cytoplasm. Together, these mutations allow SHuffle to fold disulfide-bonded proteins in the cytoplasm at a higher success rate compared to non"

Methods
Device Construct
The parts were presented kindly by the team TJU. All the plasmids were transformed into E.coli DH5 alpha competent cells (made by the Ca ions method). We extracted the plasmid by the OMEGA Plasmid Mini Prep Kit (D6943-02). BBa_I13504 was cut by XbaI and PstI. J23101, J23106 and J23117 were cut by SpeI and PstI. The I13504 was inserted into the 3 vectors above by T4 Ligase. Finally the devices we constructed were transformed into E.coli DH5 alpha. All enzymes we used in the study is from TAKARATM. The restriction maps is below.
Cultivation
The cultivation of our bacteria was performed in test tubes (16cm long, diameter is 3cm) filled with 5ml LB medium. The incubator was kept at 37°C and 260 rpm shaking frequency. Chloramphenicol was added to each media. Chloramphenicol was added from a 1000X stock stored at -20°C for a final concentration of 25 µg/ml.
Measurement
Cells were washed by PBS twice in order to clean the medium. Measurement was processed by LSRFortessa, the channel was 488nm/510nm. The data was exported by FCSDiva as .fcs files. If one cell's FITC value is higher than 103, we believe that the cell is colored. We calculated the ratio of colored cells in total cells. The ratio*100 was set as the unit of the device's strength.

WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Project#light_-_-_TEXT.html,". We essentially had the same fluorescence as our negative control, and even when we induced with 250ng/mL of ATC we saw no fluorescence. This led us to run a few more experiments to troubleshoot the plasmids.
Figure above: Troubleshooting reporter mechanism.
Our original positive control was under control of constitutive promoter, J23100, and was the only thing we got to fluoresce. We were concerned with competing translation start sites so we cloned a plasmid that modified the RBS to allow for EYFP to fold properly, but fluorescence only got weaker. We then decided to swap out the pTet promoter and lo- and behold got fluorescence. Our next step was to swap out the reporter mechanism of our experimental plasmids.
Figure above: In the dark, when promoter not active.
No statistical difference w/ and w/o chromophore. Both Hybrid and Regular systems leaky.
Figure above: In the light, when repressor isactive.
Some difference with aTc present. Hybrid very leaky.
Results
Figure above: Final Light experimental data
Normalized fluorescence is compared to the positive control after subtracting the negative fluorescence value. The Hybrid 0 aTc results in light ended up fluorescing even less than the negative control, implying the system is completely off, which is what we ideally want.
Another thing to note is that the system isnt working 100% as expected, but it is still promising.
When comparing light to dark values, the general trend is there, but the promoters driving the tetR are very leaky. There is so much tetR in around that it is dominating the system; with no aTc around, there is so little fluorescence, but once we add a meaningful amount of aTc, we are able to see results closer to what we expected. In the dark, we want our fluorescence to be relatively high, comparritive to the positive control, and we want the system to be highly repressed in the light (without having to induce with aTc).
When we compare the hybrid promoter to the normal cpcG2 promoter, it seems like there is a bigger change between dark and light in the system. In constant light, aTc is known to degrade, which would bind up less of tetR and cause greater repression. Hence, in the light we do not know how much of the repression is due to the strength of the promoter, or the reduction of aTc. It is apparent that the hybrid promoter is leakier than the original- even with a high concentration of aTc we see very"

The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"",      and ""What is the purpose of existence?"" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Just in early October, we received an official phone call from National Health Commission , answering our concerns in the e-mail. Its official firmly declared, till now, no institute or enterprise is permitted to apply a clinical treatment with cellular immunotherapy, while several clinical trials have been approved.    Through our research on policies in the field of cellular immunotherapy in China, we discovered that the attitude of government is quite vague. For years, regulations concerned have swung chaotically from encouraging drug-innovation to strengthening supervision. Yao, an expert in law of health, showed his worries towards the lack of a special committee responsible for cellular immunotherapy. He analyzed the deriving history of regulations concerned, optimistic about its application prospects in China. It would be a good idea to have an outline of the current ethical and political situation in China, he suggested.
Begin Reading
In this paper, we discussed current ethical and political problems in the field of cellular immunotherapy, comparing regulations concerned in China with the ones in other developed countries. It is important for people in the field to be aware that only with refined legal system and ethical instructions can this advanced therapy truly work. This kind of insight into thinking about national conditions and the function of interdisciplinary communication was essential to our project design and execution.
Integrated Human Practice
Introduction
Through our Bench-to-Bed approach, we take every effort to make our STEP system perfect and responsible for the world, involving experts in different field into our project. Initially, it was created for cellular immunotherapy. After contacting pathologists and experts from pharmaceutical industry, we paid close attention to cancer treatment. Under the conduction from Prof. Huang and other computational biology experts, we intensify our modeling and develop a distinct and persuasive model on molecular interaction and system output. What’s more, response from ethicists, jurists, hospital administrators and National Health Commission helped us add ethical and juristic considerations to our STEP system, leading to a paper investigating the major interest of cellular immunotherapy in China. An Oncologist responsible for clinical trials of immunotherapy also provided a precious view on our target identification in anti-tumor molecule work. Professionals from Shanghai iDrug Center and pharmaceutical industry proved the application prospects of STEP.    To clarify the integration of our Human Pracitces through every step of our project, an outline flowchart was made. Check it below~

The bistable is a very interesting tool. Its structure allows using   any combination of either markers or functional genes which can have   many applications in basic and applied sicence.
Here we show some ideas for possible uses for our basic and improved   flip-flop system:
Application 1 – Big scale production of killer proteins
An applied use of the flip-flop could be the production of proteins   that are highly toxic or even lethal for those bacteria that produce   them (called “killer proteins”). Using the bistable we could get   bacteria that synthesize those proteins only after a certain signal   given in an optimal physiologycal moment or growth state that we want.   This way we could be able to have bacteria that grow until reaching a   certain density, and then inducing the change in the flip-flop state   making our bacteria to synthesize fast an efficiently our favorite   toxic protein. This has obvious advantages for antibody production,   purification of useful molecules in clinic or any other industry etc.
Application 2 – Basic Research
A very extended way to regulate protein function among all life beings   is postranslational modifications that set a protein or a complex in   two different states. One of the best known of these modifications is   phosphorylation. A protein can have several sites where can be   phosphorylated and depending on where the phosphates are, the protein   can be active, inactive, or can do different tasks. To study this   phenomenon, scientist use either phosphomimetics, which are aminoacids   (specifically glutamic acid and aspartic acid) that imitate the shape   of a canonical phosphorylation but do not function as such or   non-phophorylatable residues. That way it is possible to study the two   states but only in separate cells. Thus, cloning the two mutant   versions of a desired phohoprotein (constitutive"

Exact details                              about the functionalization and purification conditions can be found in the Protocol section.
Figure 1. Reaction scheme for the methacrylation of dextran.
Hydrogel synthesis
We polymerised the methacrylated dextran chains by radical polymerisation under cryotropic                          gelation conditions; the polymerisation reaction is carried out at subzero temperatures, with                          frozen water acting as porogen. Dissolved substances are concentrated in the liquid microphase,                          which are small non-frozen regions in the mixture. In this phase, the gelation of the dextran                          hydrogel occurs, generating a hydrogel with an interconnected macroporous structure. (1) After                          24 hours of reaction at subzero temperature, the gels are thawed, melting the ice crystals                          and thereby removing the porogen. Subsequently, the gels are washed to remove unreacted chains                          or unreacted radical moieties. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to confirm the                          macroporous structure of the dextran hydrogels, as can be seen in the Result section.
Optimization of the dextran hydrogel synthesis conditions
During the optimization process of the hydrogel synthesis, we ran into one major problem:                          the instability of the hydrogels. The first synthesis attempts resulted in very brittle hydrogels                          which could not be used for further experiments. Several conditions were                          investigated to find the optimal polymerisation conditions. First of all, we increased the degree of                          substitution (DS) by adding more glycidyl methacrylate to the dextran functionalisation reaction. A higher                          degree of substitution results in a higher crosslinking degree, which would hopefully result in more stable hydrogels. (1) Using Scanning Electron Microscopy, it was determined that a degree of substitution of 60 yields the optimal microstructure.                          Attempting to enhance the stability of the hydrogel further, we investigated different concentration ranges of the radical polymerisation                          initiating compounds TEMED and APS. Varying the concentration of both compounds from 0.2 to 5X the                          concentration described in the paper by Plieva et al. (1) and attempting different combinations,                           did not result in more stable hydrogels. Changing the environmental conditions turned out to be essential.                           By carrying out the initiation at 4 °C, we could delay the onset of the polymer"
DTU-Denmark,2016,Team:DTU-Denmark#substrate_-_-_TEXT.html," by cold pressing organic rapeseeds. As cold pressing does not allow for filtering of the oil, small fibres remain in the oil. These fibres are removed by allowing the oil to sediment for 1 month before extracting the sediment. Besides the fibres from the plants and residual oil, the sediment contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons in high concentrations, making the sediment unsuitable to be recycled in the process or used for animal feed, rendering it a “true waste” in the sense that it is only useful for generating heat through incineration. Figure 10 shows an overview of the process. The sediment constitutes 1-1.6% of the biomass of the product, amounting to 1 - 1.92 tons annually. These figures are based on the 4th. biggest producer in Denmark Grønninggård. The largest with an estimated 80% market share is not willing to provide production numbers (Personal communication).

During the experiments using this substrate we experienced a lot of problems with the OD measurements because of the high content of plant fibers. Through pressure filtering, a transparent sample was extracted. We demonstrated that Y. Lipolytica grows very well on this waste stream. S. cerevisiae on the other hand is not able to utilize this carbon source as seen in figures 11-12.

Glycerol Byproduct
The push to find an alternative to fossil fuel has increased demand and production of biodiesel tremendously in the last two decades. Biodiesel is produced by a base-catalyzed transesterification by a short chained alcohol and triacylglycerols derived from natural sources as seen in figure 13. This reaction produces 0.102 kg glycerol pr. liter biodiesel 9 . The increased production has resulted in a plummeting of glycerol prices making it a promising substrate for industrial fermentation.

To confirmed that we could use gene E in people's gut, we test is' efficiency when it is cultivated under 37℃
However, we found it surprising that it would be much more efficient when in 37℃ than in 42℃.

Then, we test the expression of gene E under the control of some other conditions such as the induction of different small molecules. If we want to terminate the therapy, we could feed our patient with small chemistry molecules, which could terminate bacteria’s life.
So, we construct the gene circuit, putting gene E downstream T7 promoter, and induce the expression of gene E under small chemistry molecular, IPTG. These diagram below illustrate the efficiency of gene E which is under T7 promoter. Under the induction of the IPTG, the gene E can strongly inhibit the growth of E.coli.

On the other hand, we found that, even when we use the BL21(DEe)pLysS, which could express toxin protein, the results showed some leaking expression, which make it’s growth curve below that of control group (which contains the same vector without gene E). However, the effect of gene E in experiment group can be seen clearly after the addition of IPTG.

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

Their results showed that the 59.1% of the tested milk contained dangerous levels of the M1 type aflatoxins. (Perez et al, n.d) Chemotaxis is a conserved mechanism among bacteria that involves the molecular sensing of a variety of compounds important for cellular development. This mechanism enables the organism to detect a molecule of interest and move towards the concentration gradient by triggering several signaling pathways. The aim of this project is to design two biomolecular mechanisms that will enable the organism to detect and move towards a molecule of interest that would normally not be detected: Xylene. The first of such mechanisms consists of a xylene sensor which will trigger the expression of MCP protein Tsr-CCW, those proteins are the flagella movement regulators setting the Che family protein chain reaction that incites either smooth swimming or tumbling; The second mechanism will promote the expression of a reporter protein, allowing us to measure the concentration of xylene in the medium in a near real-time way.             Objectives
Identify the presence of xylene in liquid media using colorimetric techniques.
Construct a BioBrick to identify different concentrations of xylene using GFP.
Construct a novel mechanism using the BioBrick model that promotes the movement of ""E. coli"" on the medium following the concentration gradient of a contaminant as xylene.
Determine the appropriate way to insert the constructed plasmid into Escherichia coli RP8611 CGSC.
Determine the social, economic and ecological implications of identifying xylene as industrial residue.
Increased movement speed by the over expression of flagellum and the addition of ATC to the medium.
The ability of expressing extracellular pili-like appendages called nanowires that enable electron transportation (cellular respiration) in adverse (electron acceptor deficient) conditions, is a shared characteristic among several microorganisms. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is capable of producing such nanowires when grown in low concentrations of O2 and metal ions. The genes mshA, pilA, and gspG have been targeted as the main nanowire coding genes, while omcA, mtrC, and gspD confer conductivity to the nanowires as they code for the cytochromes needed for electron transport. This project intends to transfer these mechanisms into a more convenient model organism, Escherichia coli to create a synthetic strain capable of expressing electrically conductive nanowires. Preliminary experiments suggest that ""E. coli"" HB101 does not present nanowires, so it is a"
