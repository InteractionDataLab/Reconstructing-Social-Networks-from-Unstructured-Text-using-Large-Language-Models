Part IV: Popularization of Science
Introduction
Stereotypes and various pieces of information about science are spread in such a way that people sometimes find it hard to decipher the truth about everything that is said. The public, but also non-biologist scientists, may sometimes have to look for a reliable source to make their own opinion.
We are convinced that we have a role to play and have decided to involve ourselves in several actions.
First, we organized three conferences with cutting-edge experts:
“Bacterial swimmers can penetrate biofilms, making them vulnerable to destruction.”  by Romain Briandet, expert in Surface Hygiene/Bioadhesion in May 2012. This meeting enabled the Lyon-INSA iGEM team to discover the amazing properties of Bacillus subtilis swimmers and their potential as a tool for biofilm control.
“Synthetic Biology : Biotechnologies revival?” by François Képès, national and international SynBio expert in September 2012. François Képès initiated a debate on the paradox that synthetic biology raises. Paradoxically, synthetic biology aims at improving the industrialization of its products with normalization, but also intends to be more creative by setting free from existing constraints.
Olivier Brette in September 2012. The stakes of intellectual property, science and innovation were presented and discussed with the assembly of students and staff from various scientific fields (mechanics, informatics, economic intelligence, ethics…).
Then, we organized meetings with non-biologist scientists and the public:
From May to September 2012 : Open debates on the stakes of SynBio with staff and students from Mechanics, Informatics and Telecoms INSA departments but also staff from INSAVALOR (Research and Development, Research Valuation of INSA-affiliated company) through the “Filière Ingénieur-Entreprendre” (Entrepreneurship formation). Participation to the iGEM Entrepreneurship Division was first considered, but the rules were not clear enough to motivate these non biologists to participate to the iGEM competition.
September 2012 : The Researchers' Night. Since 7 years, this event has been taking place on a single September night in about 300 cities all over Europe. The main goal of this night is to put researchers in touch with the public. Thus, they can explain what they"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," year's interlab study and measured five GFP expression plasmids in 8 different E. coli strains. In addition of measuring according to the standard protocol, we were able to improve upon the protocol in order to make measurements more comparable and allow the analysis of more strains at once.
Entrepreneurship
For the entrepeneurial part of our project, we firstly created a business-plan for a possible commercial cause. Secondly, we took a look at enabling factors for startups resulting from iGEM via a survey, and analyzed what makes iGEM projects become a startup.
Hardware
We were able to refunctionalize a conventional 3D-printer by replacing the plastic printing head with a syringe pump. For that purpose, we were able to print most of the new parts of the bioprinter via the 3D-printer itself. The low costs of rebuilding the printer allows the design to be adapted easily by other labs as well, thus allowing other groups to easily adapt our technique.
Software
Since the Ultimaker 2+ standard software is not versatile enough to allow for all requirements of bioprinting, we modified the software code in order to make the printing system more adaptable and perfectly suited to the needs of printing live cells. A number of parameters can now be specifically addressed and are tailored to bioprinting.
Measurement
The majority of our measurements focussed on the characterization of procaryotic and eucaryotic membrane proteins and includes various techniques. We could confirm the functionality of four biobrick devices and identify mRNA stability as a crucial factor for high surface presentation of membrane proteins.
Model
In our modelling project we have developed a mathematical model for the polymerization of multivalent proteins and cells.

The model helped us to decide the best junction to be targeted by our fusion protein (junction with the least sgRNA posibilities). For EPO, it generated an array of 12 sgRNA at Junction three, with PAM sequence at position 232 bp of EPO CDS. For detailed information on the gRNA array model, please visit the model page .
4.2 Barcode DNA for Nanopore Sequencing
Design: We developed a tool useful for the generation of DNA barcodes within the sequencing adapters to identify samples’ subjects. The resulted barcodes can be used for ONT MinION sequencing and allow the possibility of multiplexing.
Results and interpretation: To use this tool, please visit our improvement page .
4.3 Nanopore Targeted Sequencing
Sequencing by ONT MinION Rapid Adapter kit: random adapter integration
Design: To prove the potential of targeted sequencing, we used our fusion protein during library preparation of  specific DNA samples and sequenced them with ONT MinION. We run sequencing tests to determine whether different types of DNA molecules can be identified during data analysis. Once this analysis was done, we tested the DNA product from an integration reaction with our fusion protein and sequencing adapters.
Results and interpretation: We prepared a solution with a mix of different DNA molecules that ranged from plasmid to linear DNA of different sizes. This solution was used during library preparation, and after transposase reaction was stopped, an extra DNA molecule was added to assess whether unadapted DNA is sequenced. The total number of aligned reads for each reference molecule, presented in figure 21 indicated that small linear DNA molecules (600 bp) are not identified during data analysis. This does not mean that these DNA molecules were not read, but their alignment was not possible with our working pipeline, probably due to the size of the reference. These results also indicated that, when DNA molecules are added without the first transposase reaction (the case of PCR 3 that is unadapted), the reads generated are much lower (> 3%) than equimolar concentrations of molecules that were fragmented by the transposase reaction (PCR 1).

FREDsense Technologies
We are building better biosensors.
FREDsense has developed a novel system for quantitative, real-time detection of various toxins in any sample. We use a biosensor with an electrochemical output to create a system that is portable, fast, and unlike anything else in the market
See how we're different. >
Toxic Chemicals Are Bad.
Detecting toxic compounds in our environment is an ongoing struggle that we face, whether the underlying issue is a public health or an environmental protection concern.  The biosensing market worldwide is already an $8.9 billion market and is expected to grow to $18.9 billion by 2018. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge; development of petroleum related industries, specifically the oil sands, has led to large volumes of contaminated water that must be remediated before release into the natural ecosystem.  However, current methods of testing are either too slow, labour intensive or do not accurately report the relative toxicity. Thus, the 2013 iGEM Calgary Entrepreneurial team is building a better biosensor based system to report on the general toxicity present.
The Pitch
Who Are We?
We are FREDsense, an early venture start-up company focused on designing and implementing novel biosensor systems for oil sands applications. Our goal is to commercialize a product that was initially started as an iGEM project in 2012.
What Do We Have?
Our toxin biosensor system is designed to be rapid, on-site, and require little to no sample prep, providing a distinct advantage against competing technologies presently available to oil sands service companies.
Are We Needed?
With growing regulatory bodies increasing the financial contribution to analytical based monitoring instrumentation, there is an emerging market surrounding specific toxin sensing for oil sands applications.

Tue, June 4: We're back at BU today, and this time we're spending the day hearing presentations and giving presentations of our own. We got to learn about the BU team's iGEM projects, which were in their developmental stages, but still very interesting. Then, we presented our own projects and got some feedback from the BU team. This was our first presentation, and it was pretty clear that we need to work on some of our public speaking skills, but overall, I think it went pretty well. Afterwards, we got a tour of BU's wet lab--including getting to see their awesome flow cytometer--and went bowling as a whole BU-Wellesley team.
The whiteboard after an intense brainstorming session
Wed, June 5: Sravanti joined the Eugene DeSyne subteam, and I'm really glad she did! We got a lot done today. After listening to some user-input recordings for the paper prototype of Eugene DeSyne that the HCI lab had previously worked on in the spring, we came up with a list of likes and dislikes for the user interface design. In particular, my group decided that we didn't want to have to use very many light-boxes that can clutter the screen, and we liked the idea of being able to switch between or hide different working spaces, similar to the Mac OSX multiple desktop feature. We spent most of today working on two different preliminary ideas for the interface, which we'll present to the rest of the lab tomorrow, during our first SCRUM meeting of the summer.
Thur, June 6: Today, we had our first SCRUM and received a lot of valuable feedback from the lab, and especially Orit. Thus far, one of the biggest challenges for Eugene DeSyne has been trying to design a rule-creating system that has both a low threshold (i.e. it is easy to use/understand) and a high ceiling (i.e. it is powerful). We've been looking to technologies like Tern , which is a tangible wooden-blocks based language and Tinkerblocks , a visual block-based language that one of our very own Wellesley professors is designing. Orit pointed us in the direction of Scratch , which is easier to use than Tinkerblocks (which assumes basic Java programming skills) and is more powerful than Tern (which can only give a robot a limited set of instructions, like turning, making"

Team Fungal and Plant Laccases:
The identification of positive yeast clones and determination of the phenotype (M+ or MS) was done by PCR with the primers 5AOX-Phenotype-FW and TT-Phenotype-RV. The result of the PCR was: no GFP integrated clones and three tvel5 integrated (1.9 kb and 2.2 kb) clones. The cassette, including tvel5 and his4, was recombinated by a single cross over, because the 2.2 kb PCR product of the aox1 gene has been formed. Minimal methanol medium was inoculated with these three positive clones with the M+ phenotype.

Frozen stock of each strain about to be put into the incubator for overnight growth.
Our team worked closely with Vanderbilt University’s iGEM team over the summer to help them troubleshoot issues they had been having regarding a promoter and to come up with questions to ask our panel.
Vanderbilt had issues concerning part K314100, which is a constitutive promoter. There were concerns that the promoter had nonhomogeneous expression despite its identity as a constitutive promoter. Additionally, Vanderbilt asked us to test another part, R0010, under the same conditions. We took their parts and induced them with IPTG to determine their effectiveness. We ran a total of 6 induction experiments, three using our lab’s induction protocol and three using their lab’s induction protocol. The parts were transformed and induced in DH10B as well as MG1655. The specific protocols we used can be found under the “Materials and Methods” section of the wiki.
Our protocol required the growth of a stationary phase culture to begin the experiment. After leaving a tube of culture sitting in the incubator overnight, we took that culture out the following day and diluted it in a new culture to an OD of 0.1. We grew that culture for another 2 hours. Afterwards, we prepared 8 serially diluted IPTG concentrations in corresponding mixtures of LB and antibiotic. Then, having pipetted those solutions to different columns in a 96 well plate, we pipetted the newly grown cultures into their separate rows. We incubated 3 of these plates for 7 hours.

We explained the obstacles to                  bioethanol use, how bioethanol is a rival to petrol. Our aim was to bring awareness and on a platform that                  reaches to thousands regardless of profession, we consider ourselves successful.

Colony PCR
Colony PCR was done to verify propagation of pACYC1Duet-1_Lin-Tn5 after transformation from 28-06-2018. This plasmid contains the Lin-Tn5 or Tn5-Lin insert, which can be checked with primers 029 and 030. There are two ways for colony PCR. The first one is picking a colony and directly resuspending the cells in PCR mixture. The second one is resuspending the colony in MilliQ, heating the suspension, centrifugation the broken cell pieces and taking the supernantant for PCR. In orde to test the efficiency of both methods, I tested both simultaneously. 22 colony PCR were performed by picking the colony and direct resuspension in the PCR mixture, while 20 colonies were picked and heated prior to pipetting the DNA into the PCR mixture.

In addition, it is noted that according to the manufacture’s instruction, the substrate (ethanol), bacteria (E. coli) or LO-expressed E. coli has a basal level of fluorescence intensity. To count the measures clearly, you should subtract the background intensity.
Figure 4: AOX enzyme activity assay. The various concentrations of ethanol were reacted with E. coli displaying AOX enzymes. The assay was performed using Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The readout was presented in arbitrary unit to show the enhanced AOX activity caused by alcohol concentration in a dose-dependent manner.
 
 
Taken together, we cloned the AOX genes, tested our expression system and performed protein analysis followed by the enzyme activity assay. Now, we’re ready to examine the chemical properties of AOX enzyme in an electrochemical experiments and apply it to the analyzer."

70% believe antibiotics are used in the treatment of viral and bacterial diseases.
45.7% believe that scientist, due to their knowledge, are dangerous.

The population of Mexico often perceives science as something beyond their understanding and reach, this lead to a poor basic education and promotion of STEM fields and also fewer investment from companies and the government in science research and education.
This overview gave us the motivation to work really hard towards creating something that could contribute to change the perspective of people in our country about science and hopefully, the initiative from governmental departments and industry companies towards supporting science research and STEM education fields.

This is where the members of the workshop pleasantly surprised us. Out of their own initiative, they wanted to bring the project to their home countries. Not knowing much about the pork tapeworm earlier, they realized it might be a problem in their home country. Together with diagnost-x they will spread awareness for T. solium in their communities. Once the test is ready for field, these are the communities where we will tackle the tapeworm first. 
Cystinet
Participation in Cystinet conference
In the beginning of June we were invited to participate at the conference of the interdisciplinary network of scientists and physicians Cystinet that deals with the global challenge of T.solium    infestation in human and animal. One of our team leaders travelled to Riga, Latvia to present our approach to develop affordable field diagnostic for the disease.
It was a great opportunity to get in contact with several specialists on the topic and we made valuable contacts in questions of scientific exchange and possible future collaborations for clinical trials and sample acquisition.
We hope to keep up a good and productive contact to the organisation and are optimistic that together we may come one step closer on finding a solution to the growing amount of T.solium related diseases.
Long Night of the Sciences (LNDW)
What is the Long Night of the Sciences (LNDW)?
More than 70 scientific and technology-oriented institutions opened their doors in the night from the 24th to the 25th of July in Berlin to communicate science in a playful and understandable way to everyone. Visitors got the opportunity to take a nocturnal look at the diverse worlds of science and research, which are normally inaccessible for them.
Diagnost-x contribution to the Long Night of Sciences
Presenting our project not only to scientists, but to everyone who is interested is immensely important to us in order to show that neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are worth working on and that we have come quite a way already! Since we aim to raise awareness in the public for NTDs, we took the chance to present our project to a broad audience at the LNDW. In this night, around 10.000 people from all over Berlin, including kids, students and adults, were entering the Charité Crossover building in which we were presenting our work. With several attractions for kids as worm gummy bears, ‚catch the worm‘-games and image search games, we could also explain -in an understandable and playful way- to our youngest guests the importance of proper"

Synthetic Biology Promises
We believe in the potential of synthetic biology as a responsible force for good. The field is routinely mentioned as one of the most important emerging technologies that is likely to make a substantial impact in medicine, environmental remediation , agriculture, architecture and much more. Great examples that foreshadow what Synthetic Biology could become are Jay Keasling's Antimalarial drug or the brilliant FREDsense biosensors .
The BioBricks Foundation has done tremendous work in opening up Synthetic Biology to researchers around the world and iGEM in particular is inspiring and educating the synthetic biologists of the future.
How We Can Deliver
Our ability to keep the promises of Synthetic Biology will depend on the amount of talented people that can contribute. The tools and supplies for Synthetic Biology are still prohibitively expensive. This excludes all but the leading universities and companies from becoming involved.
In order to deliver on the potential, we need to radically increase access to working in Synthetic Biology. iGEM again is leading the way by expanding towards high schools and citizen science. But for, the tools of the trade have to become widely accessible.
Accessibility includes affordability, but it goes beyond it. This is where we come in. We have dedicated our organisation to the creation the accessible tools necessary to make synthetic biology as inclusive and powerful as possible. We want to contribute to the infrastructure that enables the growth of the field, so that in a few years we have not five or fifteen examples of real world Synthetic Biology applications, but hundreds or thousands.
The First Step
Ultimately, we want to provide tools that enable the synthetic biologist to think about functionality of the system and its social and ethical implications, without having to worry about cost or restrictions of biology.
Our first product is Darwin Toolbox, and it represents our first step in a long walk towards our goal. Darwin Toolbox is a user-friendly, affordable lab-in-a-box containing a PCR machine, a centrifuge, and a gel electrophoresis device and visualizer. Darwin Toolbox will be the ideal entry device for biotechnology citizen scientists, iGEM High School teams and undergraduate students. It aims to foster a new culture of curiosity and discovery for young synthetic biologists.

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

Adding Biobricks to the Parts Library of Shanghaitech
We provided our three promoter parts constructed this year for Shanghaitech, helping to build up their parts library of input and output biobricks. Shanghaitech is aiming at creating an intercellular connection between bacteria containing different input/output circuits. We are looking forward to more data showing the performance of our input elements working with their system.

Offering Biobricks to RDFZ-China
Biobricks to an iGEM project is like bricks to a skyscraper, without which a project cannot even start. This is why when RDFZ-China asked us for some essential biobricks, we offered without hesitation. This year, RDFZ-China is paying attention to helping solve the petroleum leakage issue in the soil. Rather awesome!

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Software
Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Overview Step1 Step2
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in different environments, be that within humans or by bacteria in soil. It is a nitrogenous species that is involved in the nitrogen cycle. With further research, development and integration into various systems, the future of medicine and agriculture could involve NO sensors.

NO sensing
Many NO sensors exist, but usually have problems with specific and quantitative NO detection (Bedioui, F .et al. 2002). To do this in a more specific manner, a comparator circuit system can be put into place. The circuit could involve multiple sensors that sense different reactive oxygen and nitrogenous species. Within this system, short interfering RNA (siRNA) could be implemented to inhibit the expression of certain enzymes and proteins. This would produce an overall output that corresponds only to NO levels. To give a visual quantitative output, the use of bioluminescence can be augmented. The brightness would relate to the amount of NO within a cells environment.
Furthermore, as mentioned previously, the E.chromi project can be incorporated. In addition to its application in disease communication relative to NO levels, different sensors can be incorporated into the system to accurately measure all nitrogenous compounds (Pang,J .et al. 2003). The levels of these can be qualitatively measured through the resulting coloured product.
Agriculture
NO can be produced by nitrifying bacteria during oxidation of ammonium (Lipschultz, F. et al. 1981). These gases can be released into the atmosphere. NO is also converted back to atmospheric nitrogen in a reductive process called denitrification. The differences in the bacterial species that compose soil flora produce and reduce nitric oxide lead to different levels of NO in soil, which can affect soil fertility and thus agricultural yield. Besides soil flora, soil composition, temperature, water levels (Davidson, E. 2012), tilling and fertiliser quantities (Civerolo, K.L. et al. 1998) can all affect the levels of NO"

Structures i and ii contain a single operator, whereas structures iii and iv contain a triplicate of operators adjacent to each other. The triplicate repeats of the operator were designed to allow stronger and more reliable repression, in an effort to reduce leakiness of expression. In the interest of characterizing and developing an optimal system, a total of five different operators were chosen, for a total of 20 unique composite regulatory parts.
We continued our efforts to validate the presence of our parts that we have miniprepped. Additionally, we “synthesized” some of the small parts such as promoters, notably pTetR due to the several failed attempts of isolating it. We also received several plasmid vectors for use in B. subtilis from iGEM HQ, which were streaked over the weekend. Unfortunately we had some troubles with contamination, as such we are still trying to obtain the necessary parts.
We spent a few days preparing for our first outreach program at Calgary’s Science Centre. The topic was Food Science. We practiced (and enjoyed) a protocol for the extraction of DNA from strawberries, which ultimately resulted in strawberry daiquiris. We also explained to the public the molecular mechanisms behind certain food-related phenomena such as why banana’s go brown, and why browned meat tastes better as well as the flavor of unami.
Week 6: June 16 - 20
Our ‘synthesized’ parts - pTetR, pC1-lambda, pC1-434, pC2-P22, RBS x2 - were ligated into plasmid vectors, and subsequently validated. We now have all of the parts necessary for the assembly of our constructs. Additionally we prepared constructs for synthesis, a total of 20 distinct reporter genes. The genes will vary with respect to 2 different RBSs, and 5 different operators (repressible promoters). Additionally, we created one set with a single operator, and another set with 3x of each promoter directly adjacent. We would like to be sure that our reporter is tightly regulated, eventually we will perform a quantitative analysis of each.
After further investigation into literature and discussion, the crRNA strategy may not be as viable as initially thought. The upstream ‘cr’ sequence must be complementary to the entire RBS, which is a problem because it must also be complementary to the target DNA sequence - a sequence which we have very little control over. According to the literature"

Hello! My name is Fabian Rohden and I study Biology in the fifth semester.I heard about iGEM from some Biomoleculer Engineering students and really liked the idea of working on an interesting project in addition to the normal university studies. Through iGEM I hope to learn a lot about synthetic biology but also about the organization of science projects.

It’s already the third iGEM competition for me and since it may be the last (as a student), I’m already a bit melancholic. Nevertheless the upcoming “Giant Jamboree” in Boston motivates me even more to put as much effort as possible in our project to make it the best TU Darmstadt iGEM ever!

In 2012 I were already of the party with our first participation in the iGEM-competition. It was an unique experience and I had a lot of fun at that time. After my pause in the competition last year, I am now ready to lend a hand again. Until now I've passed my B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt and started my master's degree with a specialization in structural biology. So I hope I'll be able to support my team optimally and to contribute it with some useful results in bioinformatics. Like the last time I am looking forward to the competition and the other participant student-teams. In particular, I am very curious because of the speciality that the whole competition will proceed at the MIT this year.

The Public
bTB in the UK is a highly contentious issue with many different sides to the argument of how it is spread, what the current problems are and also what is the best way to eradicate it from our farming industry. As opposed to debating this issue, we as a team took to the streets with some simple facts, aiming to make people more aware of exactly how damaging bTB is to the UK. When we started we believed that not enough people were aware of some of these key facts. The best way for us to demonstrate this as a team was to engage with the general public armed with clipboards and a simple survey. Our results were interesting to say the least...

Survey
We conducted surveys in Exeter as well as in Wadebridge, a small town in the North of Cornwall. The survey was simple. It asked how aware the individual believes they are about the issue of TB in cattle in the UK. It then goes on to provide some of the facts that we as a team found most shocking about bTB. Although the majority of people believed they were aware of the issue of bTB, only 5% of people knew it is against EU law to vaccinate cows against bTB. This backed up our theory as a team - not enough people are aware of the devastating impact bTB has on the UK farming industry.
Interviews
As well as conducting the survey, we wanted to film members of the public in order to gauge some of their reactions to the facts in the survey. We also asked them to make any comments on what they had just been told. Our facts were:
The cost of a single bTB breakdown on a herd in a farm in a high risk area in 2012 was £34,000; 4
The UK loses the equivalent of an average size dairy herd every other day due to the culling of TB infected cattle; 4
DEFRA will invest £1 billion over the next decade in order to combat bTB. 4
We chose these facts as they offer a good, quick and easily understood way to explain the situation of bTB in the UK.

Module 3: Gene Guard
Containment is a serious issue concerning the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. To prevent horizontal gene transfer of the genes we are expressing in our chassis, we have developed a system based on the genes encoding holin, anti-holin and endolysin. We are engineering anti-holin into the genome of our chassis, where it acts as an anti-toxin, and holin and endolysin on plasmid DNA. In the event of horizontal gene transfer with a soil bacterium, holin and endolysin will be transferred without anti-holin, rendering the recipient cell non-viable and effectively containing the Auxin Xpress and Phyto-Route genes in our chassis.

Design
The Gene Guard system is designed to limit horizontal gene transfer by making use of the protein coding sequences submitted to the registry by Berkeley 2008 as part of their Cell Lysis Cassette. These proteins are Holin, Antiholin and Endolysin. Holin is a protein that forms pores in cell membranes and anti-holin binds to holin, inhibiting its action. Once pores are formed by holin, endolysin can access the periplasmic space and degrade the cell wall, causing cell lysis.
In the GeneGuard system, the antiholin gene will be on the genome of our engineered bacteria under the control of a strong promoter. The Holin and Endolysin genes will be present on the same plasmid as the two auxin genes and the chemoreceptor gene. The idea here is that the presence of the antiholin will prevent the cell from lysing from the effects of holin and endolysin. In a different cell, i.e., one that does not have antiholin on its genome, the antiholin and endolys"

Ran gel at 200V for about 65min, until the dye just ran off the bottom (remember, our DNA strands are tiny)
●
After staining half the lanes and placing under blue light to confirm proper separation, we used the stained gel as a template to extract the correct DNA band
●
Using our post-extraction staining method, we confirmed that we had successfully extracted a piece of unstained gel w/ the desired DNA band!
Tuesday, 9/20
●
Ran rest of DNA in one gel, 10uL DNA per lane
●
Used 1uL DNA ladder, 10uL DNA + 10uL SB
●
Because we didn't want to waste DNA, we decided to use the leftover DNA +sample buffer stock from yesterday as our sample to stain.  (In retrospect, this was a very bad call.)
●
Ran at 200V for 45min, then continued to watch gel until dye just ran off, as yesterday. Total of around 65min.
●
This time, the sample/DNA ladder ran faster than the DNA in the other wells.
○
When we used the same extraction method as yesterday, we missed the vast majority of the DNA.  We hope that we got enough to move onto the next round.
○
We realized our mistake when we stained the remaining non-extracted gel and saw the DNA bands we meant to have extracted.   (The ladder did not provide sufficient guidance, we realized, because with nucleotide strands this small, base pair composition affects migration in a significant way.)
○
We cut out the stained bands and saved them as well, just in case we ultimately need to salvage DNA. We would need to find a way to get rid of the stain in order to move forward with this DNA.

Being a renowned worldwide competition, iGEM also emphasises the significance of the intellectual property rights. After some investigation, it was found that patent was still applicable in iGEM related products by fulfilling certain requirements. It is believed that intellectual property rights would indirectly affect the prospect of the synthetic biology.
The tri-stable switch has previously been worked on by Brown University iGEM team in 2006 and 2007. Although the team did not complete their circuit construction, the idea was originally theirs. Hence, we ventured on an investigation based on articles and interviews with experts regarding academic originality. Some sources mentioned that our team is able to patent the invention as long as nobody has previously filed a patent application. Moreover, some patents are only applicable in the scope of a specific area, depending on the country in which the invention has been filed. We therefore might be able to patent tri-stable switch since Brown University is located in different country. Nonetheless, the idea has long been published on their iGEM wiki page - a public domain, resulting the invention to lose its novelty.
Although the tri-stable switch is non-patentable, we can still patent the application of tri-stable switch as long as we have not uploaded or shared our application to a public domain. We however think that it is too early to do so as we have yet refined the complete designs for our application. Tri-stable switch has various applications, and beneficial functions are not just limited to biosensing. People can therefore develop tri-stable switch accordingly and claim rights when an appropriate application has been established.

Improvement
     A fusion protein is composed by joining of at least two domains that are encoded by separated genes and finally translated as a single polypeptide. And the linker that connects protein domains often plays an important role.
     To enhance the function of fusion proteins and provide a proper folding of proteins, NCTU_Formosa 2018 modified the linker between Sf1a (spider toxin) and lectin (orally active protein) by elongating short linker AAA (3 a.a.) to GS linker (18 a.a.).

SDU-Denmark,2012,Team:SDU-Denmark#officialjudging_-_-_TEXT.html," seems to be the exact opposite: there is a lot stricter and more restrictive jurisdiction in Europe, while the American rules along with the public opinion tend to be in favor of innovation and support new technologies. The authors also cited statistics that reflected the contrast between the two continents in public support at the edge of the new millennium: while great majority of Americans were willing to buy and consume products made by bioengineering, Europeans highly refused to do so, however they admitted that German opposition seemed to be declining at the time. Recent facts doesn’t reflect this decline though, as for instance in early 2012 the German BASF – producer of the GM potato Amflora, which is one of the very few GMOs licensed in the EU – announced it is outsourcing its biotech operations and research facilities to America due to the lack of acceptance of these technologies in Europe from both the public, both the legislators. Maurice Moloney’s words summarize the result with a great adequacy: “It is ironic that much of the science that created modern biotechnology came from Europe and yet Europeans have been deprived of the environmental benefits such as the reduction of the use of pesticides and improved soil quality as well as the more obvious economic benefits of cheaper food and agricultural products.”
3. Jurisdiction in Europe
3.1. Antecedents
Before the currently effective regulations – mentioned below – were accepted by the European Parliament and the Council, the European Union used to apply a de facto moratorium on biotech products by refusing to approve their presence in the Common Market between 1999 and 2003, as World Trade Organization (WTO) concluded in the EC-Biotech case in 2006.  WTO’s process was initiated by the US, Canada and Argentina – the main exporting countries of products to the EU effected by the moratorium. Ironically, despite the EU had to bear the wide international opposition, European farmers and companies did not benefit from the acts considered to be protectionist such as the GMO ban or the 1989 ban on importing beef from cattle treated with growth hormones – which for the record has also been found to violate an international treaty, namely the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards of the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement – as the amount of imported agricultural products did not reduce, only the countries of origin changed to those that produce non-GM crops and meet without hormone treatment (i.e. Australia, Brazil).
3.2. Current regulations
After the EC-Biotech decision, the EU did not appeal, as it already had regulations that were in harmony with its international obligations. The most important sources of community law ruling"

SDU-Denmark,2013,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour32_-_-_TEXT.html," economy of the system. That is, does the increase in velocity through the pathway result in increased product, or does the substrates exit the pathway at an unintended point. Based on the literature, intermediates after the reaction catalysed by IspD pass directly through the pathway, while there exists a reversible exit to vitamin B1 from DXP.DXP1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
It has been implicitly established that the increase in velocity through the pathway does not exclusively represent an increased exit to vitamin B1. Otherwise, there would be no increase in product, at all. So, the question is (in plain English) how much, exactly, can we increase the speed of the pathway before it starts leaking - before the amount diverted to the exit surpasses the increase in amount of product. This can be seen on the plot below.
It is noticeable that the increase in speed leads to an increase in the B1 vitamin producing term. At increases up to 100 percent, the exit term is unproblematic, while it seems at increases above 200% that the reaction would become uneconomical, as growth of this term is exponential. However, this is not of concern, as such increases in speed through the pathway are far higher than what we hope to achieve.
In conclusion, the simulations showed the rate limiting steps to be the reactions catalysed by Dxs, IspG, and IspF. We chose to concentrate our efforts on overexpressing the genes of dxs and ispG. The choice not to clone ispF was made in the light of the fact that an increase in speed through the pathway of more than 100 % was futile in terms of economy.

UCLA,2016,Team:UCLA#Protein Cages_-_-_TEXT.html," protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites with the intention to induce disassembly of the cages by treatment with thrombin protease. Future directions of this project consist of loading anticoagulant drug molecules into our mutant cages and assaying for the release of the drug molecules upon disassembly in the presence of thrombin.

Methodology
The main goal of the project is to develop a mechanism for targeted drug delivery.  By incorporating protease cleavage sites into our protein cages, we control disassembly of the cage simply by providing it with a specific protease. The protease we decided to work with is Thrombin, a crucial member in the blood clotting cascade. Its role in Thrombosis makes it a key target in many of our leading causes of death including, heart attacks and strokes. By incorporating Thrombin cleavage sites into our cage and using Thrombin as our targeting molecule, we hope to directly combat heart attacks and strokes using our drug delivery mechanism.
The design of the project involves three distinct steps.
1. The first step revolves around the design of our mutants derived from the wild type cage. Because of the sensitive nature of these protein cages, there were specific criteria that we had set to maximize mutant formation and guarantee disassembly of our cage once it came into contact with the protease
Design mutations away from any possibly secondary or tertiary structures.-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to avoid disruption of the protein cage. It is difficult to gauge which sequences are crucial in cage formation so by avoiding mutations in secondary or tertiary structures, we hoped to mutate a region that would have a minimal impact in cage formation and thus cage disruption.
Design mutations on the exterior of the cage.-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to allow for easy access by the Thrombin protease. By placing the mutation on the exterior of the cage, we hoped to reduce steric hindrance to the protease and maximize chances of cleavage.
Design mutations near the linker region (ONLY FOR PC Quad)-The main reasoning behind this criteria is to help disassemble the cage. In the original design of the wild type PCquad cage, it is understood that the there is a linker region that serves as the backbone of a subunit thus proving crucial to the cage structure. By mutating a region close to the linker, we hoped to maximize chances of cage disassembly.
Using these criteria, we designed 10 mutant cages for PCquad and 3 mutant cages for O3-33.

The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  generates  greenhouse  gases  that  are  damaging  the  atmosphere  and  impacting  the  global  environment.  Energy  from  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind  and  solar  is  difficult  to  store  for  times  when  the  wind  is  not  blowing  or  the  sun  is  not  shining.
In  order  to  build  a  sustainable  energy  source  for  energy  on  demand  we  are  creating  a  system  using  living  organisms.  E.  coli  will  be  engineered  to  synthesize  lactate  which  will  then  be  used  to  feed  a  Shewanella  biofilm.  Shewanella  is  a  bacteria  that  can  transfer  electrons  to  a  cathode  and  produce  a  current  to  light  a  bulb.

These plates were incubated for 21 hours at 37 ℃.  Growth inhibition circle was not observed on the plate without farnesol (B). While, inhibition circle was observed on the plate with farnesol (A). These results indicate that it is difficult for Staphylococcus aureus to grow in the presence of farnesol.
We considered that farnesol has high effect against inhibitory the growth food poisoning bacteria because diluted farnesol affect staphylococcus aureus.
Effect of farnesol on growth of E.coli
We thought about a possibility that farnesol may affect E.coli, which produces farnesol, because E.coli is also a bacterium. Therefore, we examined whether farnesol affects E.coli.

Furthermore, we digested the chromoprotein expression parts for aeBlue and eforRed, ran a gel electrophoresis, extracted desired fragments from the gel and subsequently purified the DNA.

Investigators: Anna, Kevin
Today, we ligated the extracted and purified DNA of our constitutive chromoprotein expression cassettes encoding aeBlue and eforRed. The products were our combined constructs of Las- or Rhl-autoinducer synthase LasI and RhlI and constitutive eforRed chromoprotein and aeBlue expression cassettes respectively. A PCR of the terminator (B0015) was performed with Q5 polymerase in order to gain more DNA material for digestion and ligation.  The ligations of our combined constructs of autoinducer synthases LasI (flanked by RBS and double terminator) and constitutive eforRed expression cassette as well as RhlI (flanked by RBS and double terminator) and constitutive aeBlue expression cassette and the LuxR transcription factor expression cassette were transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue MRF'.  The last action for today was to inoculate an overnight liquid culture of our ampicillin resistance cassettes equipped with either Rhl-, Lux- or Las-dependent promoter  in LB Medium with different ampicillin concentrations (100 µg/ml, 250 µg/ml, 500 µg/ml and 1 mg/ml) to test for potential leakiness in a different medium. Cultures were grown overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm.

Today, our aim was to combine the chromoprotein expression cassettes with the double terminator (B0015). Thus, the chromoprotein expression cassettes were digested, a gel electrophoresis was run and insert fragments were extracted from gel while the vector part was dephosphorylated. Afterwards purification of vector and insert parts was performed and the DNA was"

Hi everyone!
I am Shan Jiang, this is my first year attending the iGEM competition. I am involved in almost every aspect of our team this year. As a fresh man I don't know how I became a team leader, maybe it’s like a famous poem‘I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country to the life and death, irrespective of the personal will and world.' Actually I am a better soccer player than a biologist →_→ .
Hi everyone! My name is Yueyi Xu, I am a member of SIAT-SCIE. I am in charge of some wet lab work and Human Practice job. I’m interested in biology and chemistry. Since I joined the iGEM group in SCIE, I’ve learned a lot of skills such as to research data, create ideas, cooperate and communicate with other members. Above all, I have learned a lot and experienced the excitements that exclusive for iGEMers.
Hi everyone!
I am Yixuan Zhao.For my role in our team, I am the Human Practice group leader and a member of lab group. Thanks to this incredible experience in iGEM competition,I've had the chance to communicate and cooperate with friends who are also interested by biology.

    ""It seems that my interferon inducer works. If they were clever enough, they should never choose the BBa_R3572 as the relay."" A voice in the darkness says.
    Now only Kant and that started time bomb are left in the darkness. Kant Clearly knows that his primary target is to turn off the reversible toggle switch before the amplifier begins to work. He quickly turns on his adaptable luminescence torch, gets to the bioswitch part, and finds that the pBAD promoter has almost reached to the critical expression level. He quickly searches in his mind to recall the methods of declining the pBAD expression level and quenching this process. He suddenly remembers that when he was preparing the wGEM competition, he occasionally learned that phosphogluconate has the unique function to quench this process. Then Kant immediately turns off his torch, takes the battery out, removes the electrode and pours all the phosphogluconate electrolyte into the reversible toggle switch part.
    The timer still counts: Five, Four, Three, Two , One，Zero ...
    After a depressive silence, Kant slowly walks out the BioX research Center.
    ""Where is that guy?"" John asks.
    ""Gone."" Kant says absent-mindedly.
    ""Gone? How can you let this risky guy escape?"" John blamed. But Kant says nothing.
    After a short period of silence, John suggests:"" Shall we make a proposal to suggest the government closing all synthetic biology labs and prohibiting all relevant research instantly.""
    ""No,"" Kant replies, ""Prohibition won't eliminate the risk, since the risk doesn't stem from the synthetic biology technology itself, but rather stems from people's avariciousness and conceit. We are both victims and accomplices."" Then Kant just gazes to the far distance in a poker-face.

NUS_Singapore-Sci,2018,Team:NUS Singapore-Sci#Overview_-_-_TEXT.html,"le cell anemia in mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (Dewitt et al., 2016). Each year, about 250,000 newborns worldwide are diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, with symptoms such as clogged blood vessels and lowered oxygen delivery to tissues - resulting in excruciating pain (Ledford, 2016). For such inherited or acquired genetic diseases, the CRISPR-Cas9 system holds much potential for treatment via base editing, especially those with no current treatment available.
However, with the current technology, non-specific targeting of the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a huge barrier in using genomic editing. Recent work has shown that while the CRISPR-Cas9 system can target genomes to make specific edits, a high percentage of non-specific editing still exists (Q. Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang, Tee, Wang, Huang, & Yang, 2015). Since edits made to DNA are permanent, these non-specific edits on somatic cells will be passed on to daughter cells. This could lead to irreversible damage done to the genome which could potentially be fatal. While scientists currently do not have a way to eliminate or minimise off-target effects, an alternative method is to modify the genome without editing the DNA strands.
In this project, we propose to develop a genome editing system that can target RNA strands instead, as RNA strand editing is transient and reversible. Recent work has shown that another Cas family protein, Cas13, has the ability to target specific RNA strands and degrade RNA, effectively lowering target protein levels (Cox et al., 2017). The RNA-targeting Cas13 enzyme functions in a very similar manner to the aforementioned Cas9 enzyme where both carry out cleavage of nucleic acid strands with the help of unique guide RNAs (gRNAs).
In light of this new CRISPR-Cas13 system, a team from Broad Institute in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) successfully designed a CRISPR-Cas13 system that performs A-to-I editing (Cox et al., 2017). Our team therefore aims to utilise this CRISPR-Cas13 system to make another type of base edit to RNA strands, specifically the C-to-U edit, called RESCUE (RNA Editing System for C-to-U Editing). RESCUE comprises various components: RESCUE Editor , RESCUE Reporter and RESCUE Model . We hope that the development of this system can diversify the current repertoire of RNA editing methods and allow for transient treatment of genetic diseases as compared to direct genome editing.

UNICAMP-Brazil,2009,Team:UNICAMP-Brazil#Coliguard#Differentiation_-_-_TEXT.html," absence of CRE-recombinase expression (most cases), the resulting Worker cell has this construction fully operational, resulting in a cell capable of maintaining its cell cycle but unable to conjugate due to the presence of the finOP genes (Worker cell’s characteristics). On the other hand, the expression of the CRE-recombinase will result in the excision of this entire construction, resulting in a cell unable to maintain a complete cell cycle, but capable of conjugation (Killer cell’s characteristics).
Why is this difference related to conjugation capacity?
Conjugation plays an important role in recognition and destruction systems (see the specific sections for further information). In view of this, it’s very important to inhibit conjugation of the Worker cells, since they must concentrate on metabolite production and be unable to recognize and eliminate contaminants.  The conjugation inhibition will involve a system knows as finOP. Briefly, this system consists of an antisense RNA (finP) and a small protein (finO)(9). The antisense RNA prevents traJ transcription, which lies immediately upstream of the operon and, in turn, is essential in activating the entire tra operon transcription(10). As for finO, it binds to finP and traJ, thereby allowing the duplex formation(11). Thus, for the correctly function of this system, both finO and finP must be expressed.
Why can’t Killer cells complete their cell cycle?
The inability of completing cell cycle works as a security device, as it wouldn’t let the Killer cells to proliferate and take over the entire culture, thus resulting in loss of productivity.  This security system works in two ways: (1) It maintains a low basal proportion of Killer cells, in the absence of contaminants. (2) It guarantees a quickly return to the basal proportion after the elimination of contaminants.
As discussed previously, it’s very important that the proportion of Killer cells could be increased in the presence of contaminants. On the other hand, it’s even more important that this proportion can be quickly restored to the basal levels after contaminant elimination. The inability of completing cell cycles makes the Killer cells proportion directly and almost exclusively dependent to the specific stimulus trigged by the presence of contaminants. Thus, as soon as this stimulus ceases, the proportion of Killer cells would be drastically reduced, given that they would be unable to reproduce and proliferate.
How will the basal proportion change in the presence of contaminants?
The answer is AI2 (auto-inducer 2). AI2 is a member of signaling molecules used in bacteria quorum sensing, produced by both gram-positive and"

Hygromycine can be used as a selection marker. The resistance gene encodes for a hygromycin B phosphotransferase, which inactivates the antibiotic by phosphorylation [68] . In the iGEM 2009 project of Heidelberg hygromycin B was used for selection of cells which performed a stable integration of the transfected Plasmid.

Zeocin
Zeocin shows a high effectiveness in a wide range of organisms. Mammalian, insect and yeast cells are effected as well as prokaryotic cells. It damages DNA by intercalating and causing breaks and therefore cell death. The zeocin resistance gene encodes for protein which binds zeocin and prohibits DNA destruction[ 71 ].

Neomycin
The aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin is produced by Streptomyces fradiae [69] . Neomycin is a selectionmarker for many different cell types. The resistance gene encodes for a phosphotransferase which inactivates neomycine by phosphorylating it [70] .

Cellular components as tools
GPI
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid. During the posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells, it becomes attached to hydrophobic C-termini of proteins that have a special singnal peptide on them. This signalpeptide leads their translation into the ER, where the hydrophobic C-terminus will be replaced by a GPI anchor. Because of its hydrophobic nature it attaches the bound protein to the cell membrane [54] .
[TOP]
Sar-1
Sar-1 GTP-binding proteins direct the transport of molecules inside of veiscles from the ER to the golgi and the other way round. Being an anchor for COPII molecules that cause the budding of vesicles off the membranes, it needs a domain to attach to the ER membrane [55] . The C terminus of the Sar-1 protein fullfills this task. Therefore one can use the C terminus as an ER targeting sequence for other proteins.

Glasgow,2017,Team:Glasgow#ANDGate_-_-_TEXT.html,"For an indirectly interacting genetic AND-gate the inputs do not themselves act together as the output. The indirect gate we planned can be generated by splitting the RNA polymerase (RNAP) protein from Enterobacteria phage T7. T7 RNAP is a single subunit RNA polymerase that is most commonly used for strictly-controlled recombinant protein expression in E. coli. T7 RNAP begins transcription only from its cognate pT7 promoter sequence, and has complete orthogonality (no cross-reactivity) with E. coli promoter sequences. In addition, the T7 RNAP produces extremely reactive gene expression responses. Three hours following induction of T7 RNAP expression, a gene product expressed from the T7 promoter (pT7) may represent 50% of the cell’s mass [3] . Interestingly, a proportion of the purified T7 RNAP protein is often found cleaved into two subunits, one small (179 aa), and one large subunit (701 aa). If these two cleavage products are expressed as separate polypeptides within a cell then they are capable of driving gene expression from a pT7 promoter, although at a moderately lower efficiency than the wild-type single polypeptide protein [4] . A Split T7 RNAP genetic circuit represents an indirect AND-gate when each subunit is controlled by a separate transcriptional activator and the pT7 promoter drives expression of an output such a GFP. No previous iGEM team has attempted to split and test a T7 RNAP AND-gate, although many have utilised pT7 ( K1321338 ) and T7 RNAP ( I716103 ) for protein over-expression.
We wished to build constructs of both split-GFP and split-T7 RNAP AND-gates by controlling the expression of split subunits from well-characterised orthogonal small-molecule regulated promoters within E. coli. Figure 2 shows a genetic diagram of our plan for testing the two different AND-gate circuits. It was an aim to quantify the difference in output GFP fluorescence level between the directly interactive split-GFP AND-gate, and the indirect T7-gate. If time was to permit, then testing would proceed to swapping input control of the gates over to the xylulose and autoinducer-2 regulated systems. Herein we will refer to each promoter + split protein construct as a “module”, i.e. a full AND-gate will require the presence and activation of both relevant modules.

Manchester,2017,Team:Manchester#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html,"2. Our project will have to have an ‘inventive step’ that is different from other previous patents - and not just an obvious thing to do for someone who has the average level of understanding of our subject area
3. Is it industrially relevant? Will our idea be commercially useful?
4. Is it excluded? Some types of invention are not patentable due to the ethics involved, including many biotechnology related ‘inventions. Also, one cannot simply patent a pure scientific discovery
In addition to checking whether our invention can be patented, we will also have to balance out the commerciality of our project. If we were to patent this project, would it only cover a very narrow scope of protection? If so, could competitors easily ‘get around’ our patent without infringing us by producing a similar system with slightly altered components? Would the invention ultimately have a good chance of making us or our company more income to cover the cost of developing the idea and protecting it? If not, there would be no point in spending time and money on the patent in the first place.
Phone Call with Dr. Linda Kahl - BioBricks Foundation 29/07/2017
We wanted to confirm our understanding on the Intellectual Property side of our project in the context of the iGEM competition and the use of BioBricks. We then reached out to Dr. Linda Kahl, Senior Counsel & Director of Ownership, Sharing and Innovation for the BioBrick Foundation .
From our call, we gained some information regarding the BioBrick Public Agreement and what it means for Users and Contributors. We learned that the User and Contributor agreement only protects users against the claims by the person who signs the Contributor agreement and it would not protect users from any third party claims. This means that if a User submitted a patented part into the iGEM Registry and the patent owner does not sign the Contributor agreement, the User would be liable for a patent infringement lawsuit.
We realize that this may possibly have had happened in the past with previous iGEM teams that are unaware of IP issues. However, Dr. Kahl explains that it costs at least 3 million dollars to pursue a patent infringement lawsuit. Therefore, it is highly unlikely for anyone to file a lawsuit against iGEM or the BioBricks Foundation unless there is 3 million dollars or more worth of damages.
We then briefly discussed the Intellectual Property rights in the context of our business plan. Dr. Kahl advised us to consider the patent landscape to see who else is working in our field of interest. We were also advised to carefully examine the claims of the issued patents"

Afterward, some people played volleyball or joined in a huge game of soccer.  I had brought my kite, so a few people and I tried to fly it, but there was barely any wind.  It would only be windy enough to fly the kite for a minute or so at a time.
Week of August 3, 2009
My goodness, it's August already!  This week was ""Operation Migration"" - everyone on the team was migrating new and/or old tools to the new Clotho core framework.  This meant that Richard and I moved Spectacles into Clotho.  All sorts of little problems arose, and some of them took a while to figure out how to fix.  The major ones were changing our temporary files to use the system's tmp directory and getting our images to load when running Spectacles from Clotho (the latter of which Richard finally figured out today).  Everything should be working now.  I've also been making a few icons for the various tools that have now been ported into Clotho.  Finally, I've been working on connecting Spectacles to databases through Clotho's database connection, but things aren't quite working yet.  Either I'm missing something that Clotho needs for the database connection to work, or the database piece is still buggy.
Week of August 10, 2009
Unfortunately, this week was not as productive as I had hoped.  At first, there were some issues with the database connection code, so it wouldn't run.  After some time and help from Bing, it finally worked.  Yet the next day, it mysteriously stopped working again.  Finally, by the middle of the week, all the problems seemed to have been solved, and I could focus on connecting Spectacles to the database and looking up parts.  This however, was not trivial.  I had tried some stuff and put together some code by Thursday's meeting, and showed the team the gist of what I wanted to do.  From the meeting, I realized that different users may have the relevant pieces of data stored differently, even after taking bindings into account and using the Clotho keywords.  I am now adding in an UI for the user to specify the object that contains information about parts; the fields that contain name, id, type, and sequence information; and the term to match to filter the results by.  By late Friday afternoon, I found it"

This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."

This is an overview of our project
Cancer development is a complex process requiring the coordinated interactions of numerous proteins, signal pathways and cell types. Its detection infers that certain characteristics of the tumor are different from corresponding normal tissue and can be seen and measured as biomarkers of tumorigenesis. Detection of disease is not the same as its diagnosis. Identification of disease does not require recognition of symptoms but also detection of specific features that would indicate the presence of certain disease. Diagnosis based on symptoms is not acceptable for cancer because symptoms usually appear when tumor is large enough to be able to detect. Therefore, finding appropriate cancer biomarkers in minimum amount of biological fluids such as serum, urine and exhaled breath and detecting them in patients would improve diagnosis and prove the presence of cancerous cells. Biomarker is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal or pathogenic processes. Appropriate biomarkers may be able to define risks and identify early stages of tumor development, assist in tumor detection and diagnosis, verify stratification of patients for treatment, predict outcomes of the disease and help surveillance for disease recurrence. Improved and timely diagnosis of cancer will positively affect treatment outcomes and increase cancer survival rates. Detecting cancer as early as possible will help to reduce the cancer burden (Etzioni et al., 2003).
Screening tools are needed that exhibit the combined features of high sensitivity and high specificity for early stages of cancers... Screening tools
Screening tools for biomarkers are needed that exhibit the combined features of high sensitivity and high specificity for early stages of cancers, and which are widely accepted, affordable, and safe to use. There are various types of cancer biomarkers are known such as protein biomarkers, peptide biomarkers, volatile biomarkers, cell based biomarkers, and circulating free DNA biomarkers. Careful selection of these biomarkers in cancer detection is important in diagnosis. Protein biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been implicated in various types of human cancer and, therefore, will be used as targets of the proposed study. Their combination in one simple, easy and portable test detection assay or test system would generate a fast diagnostic methodology.  CEA is"

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," out to Austrian and German biofuel companies in order to learn more about the use of palm oil and palm kernel oil in this industry. Biodiesel Kärnten GmbH doesn’t use palm oil for their biofuel production, but they kindly provided us with a report on fuel from the Austrian Environment Agency. According to this report no palm oil is used for biofuel production in Austria, but imported HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) that is used as biofuel, is mainly made from palm oil.(2)
The VDB (Verband der Deutschen Biokraftstoffindustrie) is an organization that represents German producers of biofuel vis-à-vis politics and general public on a national and European level.  Wolf-Dietrich Kindt from the VDB helped us to gain more information about the use of palm oil in the German biofuel production by answering our questions. Our team learned that the reason why palm kernel oil isn’t used for biofuel production is the higher price and drawbacks in handling in comparison to palm oil. We also gained more insight into the palm oil certification standards that need to be met for biofuels in the EU and we were told that the use of palm oil in the EU is likely to become phased out in the next years.
Thanks to these conversations, we knew to exclude biofuel from the potential applications of our project.

Plantation owner
The ethical aspects of our project are very important to us. We thoroughly looked into the working conditions on oil palm plantations and thought about the possible consequences of our project on the people involved in palm (kernel) oil production. Additionally to literature research, we were able to conduct an interview with an oil palm plantation owner from Malaysia. He asked us to keep him anonymous though, as he’s afraid of getting in trouble for legal reasons and we respect his wish. We’ve learned a lot about the Malaysians’ point-of-view in regard to palm (kernel) oil, environmental and economical issues from this interview. In contrast to Europe, it seems to be that there isn’t really that much of a concern about deforestation, species extinction and the like.
Our interview-partner didn’t seem opposed to our project and thinks that"

Automated Deployment : Our server has automated deployment capabilities. Server-side applications are bound with the Product branch of Git. All codes pushed to the Product branch will be deployed to many servers over the world in ten seconds. In order to prevent fault codes from being deployed to the servers by mistake, all the testing branches will be deployed to the testing server real-timely to be tested by developers.
Unit Testing: Our server applies automated unit testing to dealing with uploaded back end codes. It will test the basic legitimacy and function of the codes, including robustness testing with respect to illegitimate uploaded parameters, legitimacy testing on data legitimacy, status testing of the database and testing of function realizaton, etc.
 
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, two additional goals must be achieved:
Provide a convincing validation, testing the performance of the development -- experimentally (can be outsourced) or by other teams and users. Note, even if the algorithm or tool turns out not to work that well, the Gold requirement is fulfilled if the test is good and the analysis convincing. Validation may include: preferably experiments, informatics analysis (complexity, run time) of an algorithm, or user studies.
Analysis of pathway finder (k-shortest pathway search):
We use a specail heuristic algorithm , A* search algorithm , to find  more than one path connected two nodes in a given network.The run time of A* depends on structure of the given network. The space complexity is the number of edges plus the number of nodes. In our back end, we test this algorithm. The average of time which database reading costs is 1""40, the average of time which Vars initialization costs is 0""70, the average of time which SPFA(abbreviation for Shortest Path Faster Algorithm) costs is 0""37, and the average of time which Serialize costs is 0""21.
And the second goal can be any one of the following:
Make your software interact / interface with the Registry.
You can directly enter the precise number of Standard Part, you can get its types in BioBrick Assistant Windows .then you can use blast tool with the sequence from BioBrick Assistant.By comparing the homology between the sequence of the part and in our database, we could predict its impact on the target body when injected to some extent.
