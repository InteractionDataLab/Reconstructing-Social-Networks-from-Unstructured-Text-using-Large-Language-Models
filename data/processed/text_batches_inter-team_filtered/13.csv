Ail
The 3D structure of the Ail Protein (PDB).
Ironically, in order to make our minicells as non-toxic and safe as possible we had to look toward the likes of the bacteria that caused the Black Plague. While it may seem strange, bacteria that have such success when infecting the human body have developed the best ways to avoid the traps of the immune system. For our innocuous minicells, the only source of harm to the body would come from an overreaction of its own immune system. Therefore, equipping our minicells with the immunoevasive tools of virulent bacteria actually makes them less harmful.
Our research led us to the Ail protein from Yersinia enterocolitica. Ail is just one of three invasion proteins cloned from Yersinia species, invasin probably being the most widely known.  When present on E. coli, Ail confers a phenotype of attachment and invasion, though invasion is primarily"

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," For those reasons, we decided to stay in touch and update each other about problems and solutions, which formed the base for our collaboration. An example of our similar approaches was found in the way both our teams dealt with our intended use of split luciferase. Both teams intended to use reconstitution of a split luciferase as a way to create a read-out signal from the chemotaxis pathway. Unfortunately, we found out that luciferase could not be split again after reconstitution, making this approach impossible. These findings were shared between teams, after which we composed a strategy to find alternative approaches for this problem. We split up this task and shared outcomes with each other, which lead to our current solution to this issue.
In the future, we also aim to integrate our engineered bacteria in the autonomous robot AROMA from Zürich. We hope their biosensor will improve the range of detectable concentrations, while also broadening the range of substrates that could potentially be bound.
European  meetup in Munich (20 – 22/7/18)
During the European iGEM meetup 2018 in Munich (20th - 22nd July 2018), we contributed to the organisation by organising a Teambuilding Workshop for approximately 40 students in total. This workshop was inspired by both Amy Edmonson’s TEDx talk: ‘How to turn a group of strangers into a team?’ and the story about the Thailand cave rescue. We discussed the ways people with different cultural and academic backgrounds who did not know each other before, had to work together in one team to achieve their mutual goals similar as in the Thailand cave rescue. This truly reflects the collaboration within any iGEM team: all individual team members of the separate iGEM teams have one common goal: make the project succeed and win as much medals as possible at the Giant Jamboree, and teams consist of members with different cultural and academic backgrounds. In situations comparable to the Thailand cave rescue, especially good communication within a group of strangers, is essential in order to complete the task.
After the theoretical part, the participants got the chance to experience how difficult it is to communicate in a group of strangers by completing the ‘blindfolded rope square task’. In teams of 10 members, they had to make a perfect square out of a 15 meter rope within a 20 minute time limit, without knowing each other’s names. For this challenge each individual was blindfolded while holding the rope, which they were not allowed to let go of. Almost every team managed to make a perfect square in time.

Safety
One of our major goals was to not only conduct the lab work safely but also think beyond our project up to the clinical application of our wound patch. Therefore, we combined the clinical expertise of our team members with our knowledge of biotechnology to design a project that was not only innovative but also specifically designed to be as safe as possible for clinical applications.
Live Bacteria in Finished Product
Chronic Wounds are considered to be non-healing because of two major factors: wound infection and a non-physiological, ineffective inflammatory response [1] .
With an already infected wound and likely impaired immune response we were hesitant to create a ‘living’ bandage i.e. one which contained bacteria themselves, which could potentially aggravate the chronic wounds in two ways. Firstly, multi-species biofilms have been shown to be symbiotic, e.g. by ‘passive resistance’ when the resistance of one organism protects another strain or species which on its own would be susceptible to the therapeutic agent. This process in particular could be detrimental when live bacteria are incorporated into a wound dressing - the bacteria would likely have resistance genes used for selection and could therefore potentially protect the bacteria infecting and colonising the wound [2] . Secondly, even just cellular debris of bacteria can be strongly immunogenic and might further interfere with the inflammatory response, which has already been highly altered in chronic wounds. In particular the Toll-like Receptor 4, part of our microbe detection system, reacts strongly to bacterial membrane components and has been shown to inhibit healing of chronic wounds [1] [3] .
Spread of the therapeutic substances
In our decision-making process, we originally wanted to focus on staphylococcal infections and biofilms formation on implanted medical devices, which share many of the issues of chronic wound infections [4] . One of the major concerns with this project proposal was that in order for it to be applicable to real-life situations, the proteins added to the implants would have to be kept from seeping into the surrounding tissue and blood stream to avoid potentially grave, or at least unknown, secondary effects. This was one of the reasons we settled on our SMITe project.
With SMITe, the same concern"

Week Two - 24 June to 30 June
Monday
Researched more project ideas: phytoremediation of heavy metals and other pollutants in the soil, bacterial signaling chain, bioavailability of iron in food
Bacterial signaling chain idea is extremely well developed in a powerpoint
Advisor meeting:
Discussed bacterial signaling chain idea in detail
The professors had reservations about the novelty of the project as some teams have done similar light communication ideas
The professors suggested looking up flash vs glow luciferase kinetics for more information regarding optimal activation of the bacteriorhodopsin/halorhodopsin
Methanotrophs:
the low expression of the gene in vivo makes the project difficult
look into MAGE codon optimization
Fire alarm cut meeting short, so another meeting is planned tomorrow
Tuesday
Continued research regarding phytoremediation of heavy metals, bacterial signaling chain, and bioavailability of nutrients in food
Jen and Advisor Meeting:
Completing the methanotroph project would require using a lot of MAGE and is not very suitable for an iGEM project. The project is also very risky as it might just not work and we would have very little to show for it.
Phytoremediation is troubling the advisors: they both do not like using plants and are not sure about how useful phytoremediation is as it is never utilized in practice due to a very slow remediation rate.
The light communication signaling chain project is well developed and is a definite possibility. The professors are slightly worried if one bacteria lighting up will be strong enough to trigger the next bacteria.
The bioavailability of iron project however is going strong. The advisors liked how the system was well characterized but also novel to igem .
They suggested a probiotic aspect to the project as a delivery system.
The advisors suggested to research one project in extreme detail for the next 24 hours.
We choose the bioavailability of iron and other nutrients to research more. Specifically, developing the probiotic and secretion ideas more fully.

If the WB800 strain was in fact a protease knockout, no proteolysis would be expected and either a minimal or no clear zone would be detected. Our results showed no signs of clearing resulting from protease activity in the WB800 strains, demonstrating that this strain was in fact deficient in proteases compared to the WT168 strain. This property made it ideal for protein expression.
Figure 1: Wild type (WT) B.subtilis 168 and WB800 B.subtilis grown on an LB milk plate.
Our E.coli expression vector, pET15b, is a well-known and characterised system for inducible expression that has been demonstrated to work. The expression vector we chose for expressing insulin in our Bacillus secretion system, pUS258, was constructed in our lab by a PhD student. This vector is an E.coli/Bacillus SHUFFLE vector that is also integrative in the  B. subtilis genome. Integration of the gene (i.e. in our case, an insulin construct) inserted into pET15b into the B. subtilis genome results in the knockout of 2 amylase genes, AmyE. It was important that our integrative vector did not integrate into a protease gene that was knocked out in our WB800 strain – had it done so, integration would not have been successful. In order to demonstrate that this vector was in fact integrative and did knockout these two genes, our transformants were plated onto LB+starch plates. If integration was successful, the amylase genes would be knocked out and thus no amylase would be produced to break down starch. When flooded with iodine, the LB+starch plate would not show any clearing of starch around the colonies. Our results showed that many colonies did not break down starch, and starch break down occurred in only a few colonies. This demonstrated that the pUS258 vector was in fact integrative and functional. Hence, we were able to effectively demonstrate that our expression systems, particular our B. subtilis expression system which was not well characterised, were both functional and favourable for protein expression.

FREDsense Technologies
We are building better biosensors.
FREDsense has developed a novel system for quantitative, real-time detection of various toxins in any sample. We use a biosensor with an electrochemical output to create a system that is portable, fast, and unlike anything else in the market
See how we're different. >
Toxic Chemicals Are Bad.
Detecting toxic compounds in our environment is an ongoing struggle that we face, whether the underlying issue is a public health or an environmental protection concern.  The biosensing market worldwide is already an $8.9 billion market and is expected to grow to $18.9 billion by 2018. Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge; development of petroleum related industries, specifically the oil sands, has led to large volumes of contaminated water that must be remediated before release into the natural ecosystem.  However, current methods of testing are either too slow, labour intensive or do not accurately report the relative toxicity. Thus, the 2013 iGEM Calgary Entrepreneurial team is building a better biosensor based system to report on the general toxicity present.
Who Are We?
We are FREDsense, an early venture start-up company focused on designing and implementing novel biosensor systems for oil sands applications. Our goal is to commercialize a product that was initially started as an iGEM project in 2012.
What Do We Have?
Our toxin biosensor system is designed to be rapid, on-site, and require little to no sample prep, providing a distinct advantage against competing technologies presently available to oil sands service companies.
Are We Needed?
With growing regulatory bodies increasing the financial contribution to analytical based monitoring instrumentation, there is an emerging market surrounding specific toxin sensing for oil sands applications.

CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan,2017,Team:CSMU NCHU Taiwan#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," an enzyme called MSMEG5998 (a F420-dependent reductase group A (FDR-A)) and the gene sequencing, which could degrade aflatoxin. Also we worked intensely with Dr. Matthew Taylor, who works for CISRO, Australia, gaining valuable advice and assistance.
Our team made a recombinant DNA and sent it into yeast, which would become the MSMEG5998-producing factory. Additionally, we designed Thioredoxin fusion protein to assist enzyme folding that increases efficiency and productivity. Due to safety concerns we picked yeast. The merits are that the recombinant DNA techniques of yeast has become more mature, and yeast is considered safe and common in foods.
Our key technique is that the gene sequence must be overexpressed and produces protein, in the meantime, we have to prevent the proteins from becoming inclusion bodies, because inclusion bodies would affect the enzyme activity tremendously.
The capsule of the antidote would also made of genetically modified yeast. It is designed this way so that the enzyme would be released in the gastrointestinal tract, degrading aflatoxin in intestines or liver through the circulatory system, preventing chronic intoxication.
We named our antidote “Aflatoxout”, implying that we want Aflatoxin out of our bodies. If livestock eat Aflatoxout, the enzymes would degrade aflatoxin in their gastrointestinal tracts, eliminating these toxins that may cause harm to the livestock as well as humans that consume these livestock.
Business Model
Since we are developing something that no one has ever created before, we have to discuss with food safety professionals and animal husbandry professionals to see if our product is really what people need and something they would consider buying it. We set some goals when we met with professionals:
Introduce our Project
Learn from their expertise and use that knowledge to further develop our project
Make contacts for potential future collaborations
We started to meet with several professionals from different fields like doctors, feed companies, farmers, drug factories and so on. They all gave Aflatoxout great feedbacks and said that Aflatoxout may become the most efficient way to keep aflatoxin away from living beings. We were strongly motivated after these numerous meetings.
Then, we came to visit food safety expert, Dr. Kun-Yu Wu. Dr. Wu suggested that we pivot our goal from human treatment to animal treatment because it is an easier start due to limitations in law regulation and techniques.

Picked level 1 colonies from GST, PR and PDF (supposed) level 1 plates, but the negative plate had some white colonies so the water we used was indeed contaminated. Picked and grew all white colonies to test them. If they are TSHH also then we will have to redo luc+ level 1s again!
Infiltrated the leaves with salicylic acid and/or ethanol at 5% each.
Emily set up PCR to isolate luc+ part with primers 22 and 23. This will isolate the luc+ from the spectinomycin plasmid to put into the pSB1C3g.
Ran Luc+ samples on gel and extracted the DNA.
Measured Luc+ DNA concentrations and set up digest for 30 minutes only due to time with 15minutes to denature. Ligated over the weekend (16 degrees for 4 hours and final hold 4 degrees).
Cut off infiltrated leaves and flash froze them. Stored at -80 degrees over the weekend.
Results of gel run on 31/08
64+65 = bands at 1800bp, however white colonies show bands at the same positions as the 35s TSH/TSHH minipreps. Also bands at 1000 bp

Results
At the beginning of the experiment, it was found that the yield of BC was higher than that of G.xylinus cultured individually when cultured with E.coli at pH=5 ，so we first construct the PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid and verify its effect on BC yield after overexpression.
The results show that the overexpression of PGM has no significant effect on the increase of BC yield.
We acquire genes of PAsr from K12 genome of E.coli via PCR
We acquire genes of PGM and c-di-GMP from genome of G.xylinus.(With and without PGM)
Construction of vector PPGM-PGM-pSEVA331. Transformation of plasmids into E.coli.
Verification of homologous recombination via colony PCR
Co-culture of E.coli and G.xylinus
Second, we found a strong promoter -J23119, linked it with the PGM, at the same time                                 linked it with c-di-GMP which is a signal molecule could improve the yield of cellulose                                 synthase.
The results show that the yield of BC was not significantly increased, but the yield is increased compared to PPGM-PGM-331 plasmid, specially  J23119-c-di-GMP.
We acquire gene sequence J23119 and complete its linking with PGM and c-di-GMP
We insert gene segments into plasmid pSEVA331 and transform it into chemically-competent E.coli.
Verification of homologous recombination via colony PCR
Co-culture of E.coli and G.xylinus
Third, due to G.xylinus is co-cultured with E.coli in the environment of pH=5 as we                                 designed, we also try to linked PGM with the acid-controlled promoter PAsr, and linked                                 c-di-GMP with PAsr. We explore and compare the effects of overexpressing PGM and                                 c-di-GMP on the yield of BC in the environment of co-culture and pH=5. At the same time,the effect of it and pH-responsive promoter PAsr on BC production will be                                 compared.
The results showed that the yield of BC was further improved than that of the second step, especially when PAsr was connected with c-di-GMP, and the yield of BC was significantly improved under mixed culture.
We acquire gene sequence of PAsr＋PGM via PCR
We acquire gene sequence of PAsr＋c-di-GMP via PCR

Porine-pIV leaky-Marciano : BBa_K2093000
The BioBrick that we submitted encodes a mutated version of the pIV porin from the filamentous bacteriophage f1. Those secretins are quite interesting since their opening are controlled by phages (1). When expressed in E. coli, this porin is localized in the outer membrane. The mutation confers a ""leaky"" phenotype to the bacteria, i.e. periplasmic content is released in the culture supernatant (2). Spagnuolo and his team used a random mutation technique, followed by a positive selection to get those leaky mutants. Indeed mutants having trouble to stay entirely closed or opened (leaky), were obtained after mutations in the C-terminal secretin family domain; GATE 1 and GATE 2 and in the N-terminal (periplasmic portion) which could be involved in the controlled opening of the gate.
This property is potentially useful for secreting recombinant proteins or metabolites. When expressed in E. coli strains lacking the endogenous lamB outer membrane protein, the pIV allows the bacteria to grow on oligomaltosides (tetra-, penta-, hexa- and hepta-maltose) as carbon source.
The part is expected to work under different promoters. Furthermore this part contain a sequence which allows the protein to be inserted in the outer membrane of the bacteria.

Determination of concentration with Nanodrop resultet in not reliable data. Therefore quantitative 0.7 % agarose gel was run with 5 µl of each sample. 5 µl 2 log ladder was used (100 µg/ml). PCR Band (3.8 kbp) in line 2 was estimated to 75 ng. This gives aproximately 15 ng/µl. Intensities of 2 kbp band in line 4 as well as lines 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 correspond to approx. 150 ng amount (--> 30 ng/µl).

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," population less than 10% of animals produce more than 95% of the EHEC produced by the all cattle (Chase-Topping et al., 2008).  These cattle with such high bacterial loads are known as ""super-shedders"" as they contain anywhere from 100 to 100,000 times as many colony forming units of these bacteria (Chase-Topping et al., 2008). Super-shedders are kept in holding pens with normal cattle. By excreting high amount of EHEC, they can lead to contamination of ground water, vegetables and surrounding cattle. In the case of other cattle, a contaminated hide of an animal increases the risk of spreading the contaminant to the meat where it could causing illnesses to consumers. If super-sheddering cattle could be detected in feedlots and prior to their entry the processing plants, a significant risk for the contamination of water, vegetables, and meat could be eliminated.
Our Goal: to design and build a synthetic biology system capable of detecting EHEC, detecting super-shedding cattle, and preventing contamination.
The Solution
Before embarking on our project, we asked ourselves “how does the industry view this problem?”. Therefore we began discussions with the industry that continued throughout the development of our project. This information was then used to inform the design of our project. We believe developing a product-based project should involve both the industry’s and end-user’s input at all steps of development. Their input could then be incorporated into the design of the overall project, addressing their concerns and needs. This core belief has led us to build a system for the needs of the industry. To read more about our user-focused, informed design approach to human practices, click here.
To detect EHEC bacteria in a sample we developed a unique detection strategy combining tools available in iGEM as well as the literature. We designed DNA binding proteins that allow us to capture sequences only found in the pathogenic E. coli coupled with a chemically modified protein nanoparticle that acts as a rapid catalyst to create a readable colour change in a matter of seconds. To aid in tuning our system we created a mathematical model to predict the amount of DNA binding proteins needed for varying levels of sensitivity, alongside two spatial models to demonstrating how our system works. Finally, we designed a physical prototype of our system and were able to obtain some preliminary data as to its functionality. More on the scientific details of our project can be found here .
In addition to the EHEC biosensor we have been working on, we felt the need to give back to the iGEM"

To generate a hydrophobic surface, both flow and control mold are exposed to vapor deposits of TMCS for 10 min by placing them into a sealable plastic container with 1 ml TMCS filled into a plastic cap.
For the control layer, 30 g (60 g) of a 5:1 Sylgard mixture (25 g Part A:5 g Part B) (50 g Part A:10 g Part B) is prepared, mixed for 1 min at 2,000 rpm (~400 × g) and degassed for 2 min at 2,200 rpm (~440 × g) in a centrifugal mixer.
The mixture is poured onto the control layer mold and degassed"

L’encapsidation du génome phagique est particulière chez le bactériophage lambda. Elle est guidée par la séquence Cos . Cette caractéristique permet l’encapsidation spécifique de séquence d’intérêt.
On observe sur le schéma ci-dessus que l’encapsidation du génome commence et se termine par les séquences Cos . Tout ce qui se trouve entre ces séquences est encapsidé. Cette particularité est utilisée en biologie moléculaire depuis de nombreuses années pour la création de banque d’ADN et d’outils moléculaires nommés Cosmides.

b) Confirming BioBrick Bba_K1352002 construction using DNA sequencing
Our Ag43+FLAG+MCS(-)β-hairpins was sequenced by the DNA Sequencing & Services Unit, Dundee University.
Sequencing primers spaced approximately every 600 bp were used to ensure good coverage. Fragments were combined together using Clustal Omega and yield a high confidence reading along the entire sequence. It confirmed the absence of two β-hairpins at expected locations; open reading frame remained unaffected. Our construct sequence was identical to that of the protein product of Bba_K1352001, with the exception of the protein sequence encoded in the β-hairpins.

Get Clotho Now!
This is the notebook of Doug Densmore, the instructor for the team. My primary role is to develop the Clotho infrastructure that will be used to implement the various projects of the actual student team members. Clotho is meant  to be a larger design environment which applies various principles of platform-based design from the electronic design automation (EDA) community within Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) to synthetic biological tools. The main aspects of PBD are its strict adherence to the separation of computation, communication and coordination. In addition, it also allows multiple views of a design (architectural and functional). Clotho is bigger than just the iGEM team and hopefully will be developed heavily into the future.
Anyway, I am going to put my ramblings here for couple months....

The key architecture of Clotho is the:
Core
Hubs
Connections
Helpers
This will be explained more in a future update:)

This week several key logistic issues were resolved:
Key card access for all students was enabled for the DOP Center
Each student received physical keys for Stanley hall
A computer account, computer, port activation, and ID card were all obtained for Anne
In addition we have started a bug tracking spreadsheet for Clotho as well as a feature list spreadsheet. Anne joined the team this week.

European Experience
The European Experience
June 30,2016
For the first time since the end of the iGEM Regional Jamborees, two teams collaborated to organize the European Experience, a meeting where all the Europeans iGEM teams were invited in Paris to exchange, discuss, and celebrate. iGEM IONIS and iGEM Evry decided to organize such an event in order to tighten the relations existing between all European iGEMers.
We started organizing this event in late January, and reached out for iGEM Evry to help us organizing it given its importance. We also wanted to team up with another iGEM team to collaborate on a big scale common project. Our goal was to create an event that people would remember, and needed help in order to do so.  As time went by, the teams discussed and agreed on the type of event we wanted to do. There was a lot of discussion about what kind of event we wanted to do, but eventually we stated that we had mainly 3 mains goals in mind for the European Experience: train for the Giant Jamboree, learn more about Synthetic Biology, and exchange with other teams.
We then decided to organize 2 roundtables, focused around two main themes: “Challenges and Risks of Synthetic Biology” and “Synthetic Biology: a new economic world”. The aim of these roundtables was to make everyone learn more about Synthetic"

Secondly, all the engineered bacteria (like Top 10 and DH5 alpha) are leucine auxorophs , which means that they cannot live without leucine for long, so that using these bacteria is intrinsically safe. If we are going to use Nissle 1917 instead, we will make them leucine-auxotrophic too before letting them enter the patients’ gastrointestinal system.
Q: Who has your team worked with in solving uncertainties or gaps in ensuring your project’s safety? Are they difficult to contact?
A: We worked with instructors and advisors who gave us lots of suggestions and helped us a lot in ensuring our project’s safety, as well as filling gaps in the process of designing and planning. They were easy to contact through WeChat, text messages, phone calls, and, most of the time, face to face. There were also others that we"

Integrated Human Practices
Our human practices reflection is based on the interactions between the conception of our device and the society. How could our work be integrated in the prevention of STIs? The goal was to conduct a rigorous reflexion on the project. First we used the knowledge acquired during meetings and surveys we carried to build an ethical matrix. The help provided by our human sciences instructors was very valuable as they guided us through interesting ways of thinking.
Ethical matrix - Click to enlarge
Once the matrix was established, on the one hand, we confronted it with the results of the survey in the matrix synthesis. On the other hand, it was used as an instrument to have a human overview of the project to take a needed step back as everyone was focused on its parts. An ethical matrix was a useful framework to assist us in our deliberation about technical choices but also social choices.
The matrix synthesis was realized to have a humanist point of view integrated into our project. In this perspective, we used the approach of the ethic of care (Joan Tronto, Moral boundaries: a political argument for ethic of care, 1993) to interpret our results. We identified 4 statements: innovation, perception, risk, responsibility to improve our project according to two phases of the ethic of care.
CARING ABOUT
The innovation deals with human consequences of our technology. Early detection, short delivery time of results, low cost impact the use of the diagnosis. The early detection allows to improve patient's care, thus the treatment can begin very early. The short delivery time of results is compatible with mobile prevention campaign and emergency situations. Low cost is for better test accessibility and increase the user population. All those decisions were made to develop an attractive test that would answer the technical expectations of healthcare professional.
The perception of the test by the user was also analyzed to establish the preliminary basis of acceptability issues. The human relationship of the user during the test realization and the management of intimacy were our main reflection axis.
TAKING CARE OF
Integration of the risks was also necessary."

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on"

Metal Intake/Efflux
Introduction
The first step in our project is the uptake of the heavy metal cadmium (and cadmium only) into our B.subtilis cell. Therefore it would be logical to find a way in which we can increase the intake of cadmium without increasing the intake of other metals too.
It is known that a Bacillus subtilis cell takes up cadmium naturally through the manganese transport system. The manganese ion channel that we intend to either upregulate or control is the MntH ion channel. MntH is part of the Nramp family of proton-coupled metal ion transporters. MntH is regulated negatively by increasing manganese ion concentrations. This regulation ocurs via the promoter MntR. B.subtilis therefore has the ability to limit the manganese metal intake system when the intracellular concentration of Mn2+ starts to approach cytotoxic levels.
In B. Subtilis cation efflux is by an antiporter: the CadA efflux system. Cd, Co, Zn are pumped out by this ATPase dependant member of the CDF family.
We need to engineer our B.subtilis to be able to upregulate cadmium uptake and downregulate its efflux system in order to accumulate cadmium in the cell once the metal container decision has been made.

Michaela did her PhD on the structure and dynamics of the interchromosomal domain compartment in eukaryotic cells in the department for Cell Biology at the German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ in Heidelberg. Following her PhD she worked as a Postdoc in the lab of Prof. Dr. Harald Herrmann on nuclear intermediate filament proteins called lamins. She investigated the influence of disease-related mutations in A- and B-type lamins on nuclear morphology. In 2005 she joined the group of Prof. Roland Eils. The main focus of her work is now on DNA double strand break repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). She is investigating protein-protein interactions in living cells by using FRAP technology and kinetic modeling. The longterm goal of her project is to understand mechanisms of pathway choice between NHEJ and HR. She likes to support the students team with all her expertise in current molecular and cell biological as well as imaging techniques.

Yara comes from Portugal where she studied Biochemistry. During her Master thesis in Lisbon, she worked with Apicomplexa parasites (like Toxoplasma and Plamodium).Using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and other microscope techniques, she was able to see very interesting cytoskeleton features of the parasite Besnoitia besnoiti during cell invasion. While presenting her published work in Switzerland, she was invited to come to Heidelberg for 4months. She found the city and University atmosphere interesting, fun and challenging at the same time, so she decided to stay.
Today, she is at her 1st year of her PhD in Systems Biology applied to Programmed Cell death in cancer cells at Roland Eils group.  She is working experimentally on the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins and their relation with mitochondria dysfunction and clearance by autophagy. She is very enthusiastic with joining"

label plasmid files with pREC # and primer used
open recent orders
download then extract the zipfile; copy extracted files into dropbox
open .seq file in Ape: compare to pREC sequence map in the dropbox
Tools -> align two sequences (align the quintara sequence with the pREC map)
Mismatches towards the end are okay because there is a lot of noise towards the end of sequencing (you can see the progression in the .api quintara files)
Reading and sequence verifying the alignment data: wrong primer would give you a lot of red in the results where there were mismatches; good results would show matching in the backbone and part of the phiC31 domain (verifies correct plasmid backbone and insert ligated)

Split into Team A and B, Team B is in charge of Ben’s primers and the Cas9 splits.
We read the results of the sequencing from Monday about pRECs 197-208 and did not get good results - Divya hypothesizes that this is because there is something wrong with our Primers or on Quintara’s end. She said she was having trouble with her sequencing as well and that is why she thinks it is a sequencing problem and not a plasmid/ligation problem.

We are going to re-send pRECs 197-208 for sequencing

The prRECs 37-54 came in. We added the micromolar amount of autoclaved deionized water specified on the IDT prREC order sheets.
Then we labeled microcentrifuges for each prREC and made a working stock by adding 90 microliters deionized autoclaved water to the microcentrifuge tubes so that we could use only one tip. Then we added 10 micromolars of each respective prREC to each microcentrifuge tube so that we have a 10 micromolar working stock now.

Shaheer re-digested the backbones pS 1 to pS 4, and digested backbones from pS 1:4 stock. He gel purified the samples and these are what we will use in our ligation later today.

Lectures for Freshmen and High School Students Spreading a basic understanding of synthetic biology to the next generation is always what iGEM encourages us to do. So we held several mini lectures for freshmen and high school students this year. We introduced basic knowledge of synthetic biology and our project Alpha Ant. These lectures incited their interest in synthetic biology a lot and they also shared their creative ideas and interest of synthetic biology at the end of the lectures.
Experience Sharing Session All of our team members have gained great self-improvement during the whole project development. We had the desire to share knowledge and experiences we have got to others. So we held an experience sharing session with students majored in bioinformatics. We introduced our project to them and shared our stories about difficulties we met and how we got over it.
Several of the listeners who now conduct innovation and entrepreneurship project said they got many creative ideas about how to develop bioinformatics tools that benefit the biologic research. Moreover, they expressed their suggestions on our project, which also benefit our project a lot."

Moving iGEM Cas9 to another backbone
Belwina, Marijn and Thomas transformed biobrick parts and backbones from the registry to home-made chemically competent DH5alpha cells. Transformations were plated on LB agar plates with antibiotics corresponding to the resistance in the backbone of each plasmid.
Transformed parts:
The plasmids were isolated from liquid cultures inoculated from colonies of transformation plates. Also, glycerol stocks were made.  The length of the dCas9 part (5080 bp) was verified using PCR with the VF2 and VR primer"

We decided to do a literature search of barriers to accessing synthetic biology and eventually create a list of policy recommendations. We also set a timeline for the production of our iGEM manual. Our goal for this is to compile a collection of resources that will help the formation of new iGEM teams, therefore increasing public involvement and engagement in synthetic biology.
Week 10: July 4 - July 7
This week, we had a meeting with Dhanyasri from McMaster University and we discussed possible opportunities for both dry lab and wet lab collaborations between our teams. The notes from this meeting are listed below:
The McMaster Project: a fast detector for pathogenic bacteria; antigen which uses DNAzymes to target specific protein from the bacteria. The McMaster team is using E. coli as proof of concept before moving onto a more pathogenic bacterium (Clostridium difficile).
Software improvement: if one of us generates a software, we can ask their team to test it. McMaster has a large dry lab team.
Characterization: reproducibility of parts and experimental data (protein assays, etc.) could be shown if both teams test each other's parts.
Containment: they are making a detector for E. coli as a proof of concept first so they can send it to us as one possible method to ensure the containment of E. coli on the colony on Mars. As soon as a leak occurs, the detector will detect it within 5 to 10 minutes. This allows for appropriate action to be taken in the event of a containment catastrophe.
McMaster iGEM was planning on starting a general Synthetic Biology Journal comprised of review articles and primary research happening across Canada. One possible avenue for a collaboration with them would be to write a submission in regards to Synthetic Biology projects/discoveries around the university.
The McMaster team also had some tips to contribute to our manual. Their main difficulty: getting funding and finding a PI while maintaining the project as student-led. Dhanyasri explained that most primary PIs the team spoke to wanted their project to have more relations to their research.
We also fundraised by selling tickets for a Stampede Kickoff at Knoxville’s Calgary. The kickoff was on July 6th, 2017, and we raised almost $400 CAD through this fundraising venture.

Multiplexing and Barcoding
Professor Hagan Bayley from Oxford University, one of the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, pointed at the enrichment of our sample. This prompted us to focus on an extensive sample preparation. On top of this, prof. Bayley said that multiplexing and accompanying barcoding would be a big advantage, which we then set out to implement, improving upon an existing iGEM barcoding tool .
“ADOPE’s ingenious approach to foreign gene detection pushes the frontiers of forensic analysis. ”
Prescreen
Olivier de Hon, principal scientist at the Dutch Doping Authority, gave us highly valuable insights into the requirements that the doping authorities set for a detection method. A conversation with him resulted in our focus on the nanoparticle based prescreening method.
“The initial costs are not very important in doping detection development. What does matter is that we should be able to efficiently upscale the detection.”
Minimizing out of Competition Testing
As became apparent from the interviews with Moniek Nijhuis and Cameron Brodie , out of competition testing can be highly privacy invasive in the sense that athletes always need to keep track of where they go. Therefore, we found it important to assess how to reduce testing time and optimally schedule possible testing points to have least impact on the athletes every-day life. To determine the optimal detection point for gene doping, we developed a model of the human body response to EPO gene doping, incorporating the blood cell development in the bone marrow based a suggestion by the Dutch National blood bank Sanquin.
Furthermore, Prof. Paul Dimeo from Stirling University prompted us to focus on athlete behavior, to think with them and thereby be a step ahead. We focussed on different administration methods for gene doping (intravenous and intramuscular) and on the effects of microdosing EPO gene doping. In this way we determined that our method could best be included in out of competition testing. See our model .
Safety-by-Design
For our team safety does not only come first. We prefer to say “safety always”. That is why we actively incorporated safety throughout our project, from the topic choice, focussing on responsible use of synthetic biology, to the product development, consisting of a cell free device. The RIVM, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, advised us on this. We concluded that from an environmental perspective unregulated gene doping use throughout society might pose another threat and thereby a reason for detection, at least in sports, and further awareness throughout society.

Developing our Technology
We are pioneering a live-cell Field-Ready Electrochemical Detection system for toxins present in our environment. Initially, we are focusing on detecting general toxins in oil sands environments, however the immense flexibility our system provides significant opportunities to expand into sensors for almost any compound of interest. With a quick and robust output, our technology offers many advantages over existing biosensor technologies.
Overview
In response to the need for rapid and more on-site technologies to monitor toxins in the oil and gas sector, FREDsense is pioneering a novel biosensor technology. Our first generation product is designed to detect a variety of oil and gas related contaminants in water samples. The system will be more rapid and more portable than current analytical technologies.
Our Product
Our first generation product is a biosensor for general toxicity in a water sample. It senses a variety of toxic chemicals that the bacteria responds to. These include examples such as naphthenic acids (highly corrosive), sulphur-containing compounds (such as those that cause acid rain) and nitrogen-containing compounds. Our sensor reports the overall toxicity and whether or not it reaches a critical threshold. Our major goal is to make it easier and faster to inform people and companies as to the toxicity of their water.
Future Generation Products
Future generation products will include measurement sensors for specific toxic compounds such as n"

WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The local EHS division is active on the Washington University campus. The entire team completed an EHS training course to encourage lab safety. Our project was approved by the biology department which is held accountable directly to the EHS representative. In addition, we worked directly with the EHS in order to facilitate our YLC project. After extensive communication with our team, they gave us their approval for our project.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Currently all team members are required to complete EHS training as part of the Washington University requirements to work in a lab. Every team in the iGEM competition should complete basic lab safety training as a part of the requirements to compete. This would encourage safer practices which will set good habits for the future of bioengineering. In order to make parts safer, better characterization upon submission should be stressed by iGEM. That way, future iGEM teams will know how to properly deal with submitted parts and prevent any potential risks that may be associated with a dearth of precautions taken while dealing with harmful parts.

Constructs
We propose to produce biological pigments that can be used in ink at a smaller environmental impact than current sources. We have identified pigments that can be produced in Escherichia coli that correspond to the four main colors in ink cartridges: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. They are melanin, indigoidine, anthocyanin, and zeaxanthin, respectively. We have decided to produce these pigments because there has been success in producing these pigments in the past (Misawa et al., 1990, Cabrera-Valladares et al., 2006, Lagunas-Muñoz et al., 2006,Yan et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015). Using synthetic biology techniques, genes corresponding to pigment biosynthetic pathways from a variety of organisms will be engineered for expression in E. coli. Pigment production will be followed by purification to separate the pigments from the bacteria, which will then allow the produced pigments to be incorporated into ink.
Standard Genetic Construct for Pigment Production
Each of the four pigment production constructs is designed in the same way. Each construct consists of a T7 promoter, the E. coli ribosome binding site (RBS) B0034 (with the exception of the zeaxanthin construct, which uses Pantoea ananatis native RBSs), the coding sequences for pigment biosynthetic genes, and the double terminator B0015.
Use of a T7 promoter allows us to utilize the induction system of the E. coli strain BL21(DE3). In this strain, T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) is expressed by the lacUV5 promoter, which can be induced by the addition of IPTG to the culture. T7 RNAP will then transcribe the pigment biosynthesis constructs(Figure 1.).
Figure 1. The T7 RNA Polymerase expression system in E. coli BL21(DE3)
Additionally, using this system allows us to control exactly when the cultures will start to produce the pigment biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore the"

Synthetic Biology : Only a Game ?
Inspired by our laboratory project we analyze the relationship between synthetic biology and games, two concepts that are connected on many levels. We describe and characterize different aspects and also include our own project into our analysis. On one hand, synthetic biology can be used to play common games in a new way, possibly for educational purposes. More recently, synthetic biologists started to use games as a research tool as well, an innovative approach to make use of crowdsourcing and distributed computing. We want to present examples for these different aspects, find correlations and discuss possible consequences for the Synthetic Biology community. Despite the fact that most of these games have their origin in basic research; such experiments have the potential to be used for raising awareness in a new and original way. We see our Colisweeper game as an educational tool that could be presented for example in the context of a laboratory course. It can introduce people with only little knowledge in biology to different important topics in Synthetic Biology. Bringing science closer to people from non-scientific backgrounds may be one of the most important activities, raising understanding, and possibly acceptance for synthetic biology in public in this case.

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," Anja and Romie from the Tech Museum are visiting us for two days, and we’re spending most of those two days brainstorming ideas for the project. We had a Scientific Ethics training in the morning as part of the Summer Research program, but after that we got to work. Romie and Anja gave a brief overview of the other museum exhibits and what they would expect of the exhibit we develop. In the afternoon, we spent a lot of time brainstorming ideas for the project. We focused on the “storylines” and the “environment” part. The name BacPack was born, and we decided that the general story behind the exhibit would be that the visitors are scientists engineering bacteria to help explorers on different missions. We decided on three extreme environments/new frontiers: Mars (everyone’s favorite), the Deep Sea, and the Antarctic. We also started looking into BioBricks we could use for the digital exhibit; we each picked a topic to research for homework tonight.
6/16/2015: Day 12
In the morning we presented the results of the research we did last night, and made a list of all the BioBricks that could be helpful. We then spent time researching and talking about the conditions and resources available in each environment, and made a list of their “haves” and “needs”. In the afternoon, we created a simplified paper prototype of what we envisioned the exhibit to look like. We went through several iterations of brainstorming and changing the design, until we settle on a design that would split a single MultiTaction screen into two parts, and would allow each user to have their personal “workbench” space as well as a testing environment. Tomorrow, we are going to develop a more detailed prototype and test it with children on Thursday.
6/17/2015: Day 13
Most, if not all, of today was spent making a paper prototype and refining our design from yesterday. We spent some time deciding on the layout of the workspace, as well as the representation of the bacteria, and after that it was pretty much just cutting things out and gluing them together. I look forward to testing it tomorrow!
6/18/2015: Day 14
We finished our paper prototype in the morning, and Orit’s children came to visit us in the afternoon. They’re aged 6 and 9, so they’re the exact age of our target audience. They seemed to enjoy playing around with the prototype and understood the concept behind the project. We asked them to assess the difficulty level, and they said that it’s not “too easy"

Lethbridge,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," my second year being involved in iGEM and i love every aspect of it but my favourite part would have to be working in the lab. I initially joined iGEM to because of my interest in synthetic biology and to gain more experience. Other than iGEM i enjoy travelling, reading, taking photos and spending time with my friends and family.
Ross Oliver
Hello I'm Ross and I am a grade 11 student at Winston Churchill High School. I was interested in re-joining iGEM because of the opportunities and knowledge that it has provide me. Prior to joining iGEM I had no lab experience, and had very limited knowledge about synthetic biology. In my free time I enjoy learning new things,cooking and traveling.
Ronja Kothe
Hello! My name is Ronja. I am 18 years old and in my final year at Winston Churchill High School. In the  fall I will be attending the University of Alberta in the Immunology & Infection program. This is my third  year in iGEM and I have really enjoyed my experience both in the lab and outside of it. In addition to  iGEM, I enjoy playing the clarinet and I’m also a proud Girl Guide. One of my favourite foods are granola  bars, partly because they’re great for camping, which, as a Girl Guide, I also love to do.
Mason Mierzewski
Hi, my name is Mason Mierzewski, and I am a 16 year old student that will be going into grade twelve at Catholic Central High School ensuing the summer. This is my first year participating in iGem, and I have found it to be a very enlightening experience. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports casually or competitively as well as just hanging out with my friends. I am also a fervent fan of music, as I listen to it daily and use it to help me with many tasks. So far, my iGem experience has been congenial and I am very excited to see our project come to its completion.

Degradation of our fusion protein is still significant. Results seem to suggest that the fusion protein is being cleaved at the linker, resulting in both the dxCas9 and the fusion protein being present in our sample. The heparin chromatography was relatively successful at separating the two populations. The dxCas9 has a lower affinity to the heparin resin as a result it elutes at lower concentrations of salt. As the concentration of salt increases less dxCas9 and more fusion elutes (gel1, lane 9-15"

With accuracy also comes the ability to provide more quantified readouts, assuming the system is capable of the linear response required for such readings. We also want to be able to tune the linear response range based on the end users' desired implementation, in order to further improve usefulness. The processing system must therefore have the following attributes:
The ability to compensate for culture variability between assays
The ability to make calculations over a wide range of concentrations with similar, high levels of precision across this range.
Outputs
In order for a project that fits our goals to be commercially successful, it is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible output exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the processed input. Outputs fitting this description are commonplace in nearly all other scientific fields where the ability to collect and process data has not only eased interpretation of experiments but also allowed a much faster development of understanding, and ultimately technology, in those fields. In biology however, due to the complexity and inherent variability of the systems under scrutiny, it has been difficult to design such outputs. Additionally, the outputs which exist are either crude, or expensive to produce or interpret. We therefore desire an output with the following characteristics:
Provides reproducible, quantitative data under many environmental conditions with small error margins.
Displays data to a user in an intuitive manner that is easy to interpret.
Be flexible enough to support use in multiple environments
Does not require specific environmental domains to produce an undistorted post-processing signal.
Easy to interface with data processing tools
Capable of supporting multiple readouts from different assays.
Cheap
Sporage & Distribution
Design considerations must be in place such that our biosensing platform can be distributed and stored easily and cheaply, whether it be for laboratory testing purposes or field applications in places lacking appropriate facilities (for example, areas which cannot keep cultures frozen, or even provide electrical power for a sensor). This relates particularly well to our human practices where we learnt that a major problem to tackle in developing countries is a lack of the conventional biolab infrastructure which most, current technologies rely on.
The design criteria for this aspect of the product are thus as follows:
Deliverable worldwide
Can be stored long term without appreciable loss of quality
Both of the above without requirement for high powered or high tech infrastructure
Investigation and solution
Set out below are the developments the team has made over the summer, in tackling our aim and objectives.

While the BioBricks J06702, B0012, C0071, R0062 and R0071 were sequence verified, the BioBrick C0062 did not match the sequence, the DNA sequencing for clone 2 failed. Furthermore the sequence alignment of E0240 revealed additional 25 bp after the EcoRI restriction site. The DNA sequence of E0430 was confirmed except for a point mutation (T to A between Not/I and XbaI restriction site) as well as the BioBrick J23112 which contained a point mutation in the prefix sequence (T to A).

Today we received the NEB iGEM Support Kit. This will keep the labwork rolling ;-)
Yesterday’s colony PCR(E0420 and C0061+B0015) was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel.The amplified fragment for E0420 matched the expected fragment size of 1192 bp. The PCR for C0061+B0015 failed. A faint PCR product of 6-7kb could be detected for clone 2 indicating (again) an additional oligonucleotide sequence 5’ of the BioBrick. This additional DNA sequence may have up to 6kb. We isolated the plasmid DNA from all clones of E0420 and C0061 + B0015 with a miniprep kit following the manufacturer’s instructions to send them to GATC.
In order to clone the inducible promoters Plux (R0062), Prhl (R0071) and Plas (K091117) 5’ of the RBS (B0032), we digested them with EcoRI and SpeI. At the same time the lactonase (C0060) and lactonase + TT were digested with XbaI and PstI to clone them 3’ of a RBS. The autoinducer synthases + TT (C0078+B0015, C0070+B0015, C0061+B0015) were digested with XbaI and PstI for cloning. Also we did a test restriction of C0061 since the DNA sequence indicated it contained an additional nucleotide sequence.
The expected fragments of the promoters are 82, 80 and 153 bp.  We were not able to detect the fragments on the agarose gel. The restriction digest of C0060, C0078+B0015 and C0070+B0015 was not complete"

1. Certification of the CbtA toxicity towards bacteria, which stagnates the growth of bacteria.
2. Demonstration of CbeA growth-promoting effects towards bacteria.
3. Certification bacterial normal growth on condition that CbtA-CbeA co-existence.
4. Verification of CbtA reversible toxicity blocked by CbeA.
Introduction
Geneguard system is the most important system in our project ( What is Genegraud system? ). For the verification of the system, we designed the characterization construct shown in Figure 1, and we named it as pET23a-TA.
Figure 1. Characterized construction of TA.
We used the lactose operon in pET28a so that the expression of CbeA (antitoxin) can be induced by IPTG. What is more, after referring to the structure of BBa_I0500 , we added AraC and pBAD, so that we could also induce the expression of CbtA (toxin) by L-arabinose. So the construct can be simplified into Figure 2. We can know from the structure that the addition of Laracinose and IPTG can enhance the expression of CbtA and CbeA, respectively.
Figure 2. Simplified characterized construction. Addition of L-arabinose and IPTG can enhance the expression of CbtA and CbeA, respectively.
Experimental Design
The plasmid pET28a-TA and the vector pET28a were transformed into BL21(DE3)-pLysS. After digestion and sequencing. Two groups of bacteria with the two plasmids transformed were named TA group and Vector group, respectively. Three experiments were designed to verify the function.
plate streaking and monoclone growth observation
According to others' work [1], we selected the appropriate concentrations for inducers and did the pre-experiments to confirm them. Medium with different types of inducers were made and we observed the growth of the bacteria in them.This experiment was carried out by BIT-China ( read more )

Until the beginning of the 50's there were no clear guide lines or standards for ethical behavior in conducting a research.                                 World-wide governments, including the federal regime in the USA, had a minor role in regulating and enforcing ethical                                  standards.
As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues. The federal government                                 As of today, much progress has been made in the regulation of bioethical issues. The federal government in the USA and the                                 European governments enforce all aspects regarding the research process, implementing rules and regulations. In order to                                  enforce these regulations, government instructed the establishment of the Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRB is an                                 institute that exist in every academic establishment or research institute and function to implement regulations regarding                                  research ethics.
Judaism Bioethical principals
Learning about bioethical issues, we continued to explore the history of bioethics. We met with Prof. Shimon Glick from the                                  Faculty of Health Sciences (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er-Sheva, Israel), an expert in the field of Jewish                                 medical ethics. In the meeting Prof. Glick thought us about Jewish views of bioethics. We discussed ethical issues                                  concerning new technology, including synthetic biology.
In his paper, ""Synthetic Biology: A Jewish View”, Prof. Glick describes the Jewish approach towards scientific progress as                                 well rounded and aware to the problems it presents: ""Judaism traditionally looks favorably on man as a co-creator with God                                 and encourages research for the benefit of humankind. Thus, the Jewish tradition would haves a positive attitude towards                                 the current goals of synthetic biology. But, in the Jewish tradition man is also charged with stewardship over nature and                                  is admonished to preserve and nurture, not just to exploit and destroy"".
The Book of Genesis indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis emphasizes that the                                  role of people is to maintain and take care of the world. The Talmud which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, teaches                                  a basic ethical principle in Jewish law, the 'Bal Tashchit' (""do not destroy"") commend. The commend orders men not to waste                                 or destroy our earth, the commend is invoked only for destruction that is deemed unnecessary. Many hold the view that                                  pollution is an insult to the creation of the world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care for God's creation.

Membrane
The membrane filter is a key element of our prosthesis system, allowing the confinement of the genetically modified bacteria and the conduction of neuron impulses . We tested two types of membranes: Sterlitech Polycarbonate Gold-Coated Membrane Filters (pores diameter of 0.4 micrometers) and Sterlitech Alumina Oxide Membrane Filters (pores diameter of 0.2 micrometers).
Sterlitech Alumina Oxide Membrane Filters were coated with different types of biocompatible conductive polymers: PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate), PEDOT:Cl and PEDOT:Ts .
To characterize the potential of the different types of membranes to be integrated into our prosthesis system, we designed a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) well chip for that exact purpose , a modified culture well . The bottom of the well is a membrane, and a platinum wire touching the membrane electrically connects the inside of the well with the exterior.
Figure 22: PEDOT:PSS
Confinement
The first requirement for the membrane is that it needs to meet is the ability to retain bacteria of the size of E. coli (1-2 micrometers). Theoretically, confinement should be garanteed because the membrane's pore size is smaller than E. coli. Three experiments were conducted on membrane microchannel chips to prove that the gold-coated membranes can retain bacteria .
First experiment
The optical density of an E. coli liquid culture was measured. Liquid culture was poured in a microchannel chip on one side, and optical density of the liquid that flowed to the other side of the microchannnels was measured.
Results
OD (600 nm) of liquid culture: 0.44
OD (600 nm) of liquid after flowing through the chip: 0.41.

Mentoring from KUAS
We had a team meet-up with the collegiate team KUAS_Korea at Korea University for mentorship and exchanging ideas. Firstly, each team briefly presented their project to the other team. KUAS_Korea’s project was about demonstrating the game theory in a biological context, using two different synthetically modified bacterial strains. After the presentation, members from each team provided advice, critiques, and recommendations for the other team so that both teams could improve their projects. Although the content was from different tracks, we were able to get practical feedback on our presentation. Some of the advice included that our project needs not focus on the commercialization of our product, which is a heart failure immunosensor, as we are a high school team. It was suggested that manifesting our passion and efforts toward achieving our experimental procedure are sufficient enough. After participating in iGEM for more than ten years, KUAS_KOREA gave our team practical advice on Giant Jamboree requirements and informed us on many previous mistakes they have witnessed over years of Giant Jamboree participation. In addition, KUAS_Korea generously gave advice on wiki development, project presentation, human practices, judging criteria, and many other aspects. Finally, we were given the opportunity to visit the lab at Korea University. This meaningful discussion and collaboration helped our team not only to improve upon specific aspects of our project but also to perform better for the Giant Jamboree.

Prediction Model
The last step is to predict the behaviour of the system. For a global prediction, all species and processes that are related to the system should be covered. Therefore, we also consider the dynamic of mRNA and fluorescent proteins in the prediction model. Nevertheless, another problem is brought about because this setting is contradictory to our model as the dynamic of mRNA is ignored before. In fact"
