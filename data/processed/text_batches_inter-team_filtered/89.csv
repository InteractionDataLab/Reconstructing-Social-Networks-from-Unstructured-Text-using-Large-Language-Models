The Pulsilator
A synthetic pulse generator in yeast for sustainable expression of recombinant proteins
Large-scale production of recombinant proteins typically involves growing genetically modified microorganisms in bioreactors in which metabolic stress and selective pressure tend to diminish culture productivity over time. To alleviate the detrimental effects of continual high-rate synthesis, we have designed a yeast strain capable of producing bursts of gene expression in a controlled and inducible manner. These ""pulses"" are generated by the action of an inducer molecule that triggers the synthesis of a protein of interest and simultaneously induces a repressor protein to terminate expression as well as an enzyme to degrade the inducer signal, thereby returning the system to its initial state. By co-culturing populations of inducer-synthesizing cells and pulse-generating receiver cells, we hope to achieve self-sustaining oscillatory gene expression dynamics that could render long term culture-based recombinant protein synthesis more sustainable. This would open the door for the production of considerably toxic proteins for numerous applications including anti-cancer therapeutics and antiseptics.
Project Overview
The Problem
When large quantities of protein are required for industrial, pharmaceutical and research purposes, these are often produced by expression in a genetically modified organism. Once these transgenic organisms are built, they are grown to sufficient titer before extracting the protein of interest. In the case of microorganisms, this is performed in large bioreactors, where cells are grown to high densities to maximize productivity. When the protein of interest is excessively large, or strongly overexpressed, a heavy metabolic burden is imposed on the host, causing cell growth to slow and resulting in loss of productivity [ 1 ]. Additionally, selective pressure against highly productive cells tends to exacerbate this problem over time. Soon the bioreactor will become inefficient, and will have to be “restarted”, a long and costly process. The goal of this year’s uOttawa iGEM team consists of generating a yeast strain capable of long term protein expression.

Public Engagement
Overview
Our public education includes two sections: inner and outer school propaganda. As for on campus part, we design and take a strict but excellent education system by using the resource inside school, and are willing to pass on our system to next generations of IGEMer as a tradition.
As for out of campus part, we establish the collaboration with sewage plant for exchanging the instructive information through biology, plant and policy. It is the only the first step for our team, we strongly believe that the usefulness of our project would attract more plant even business company to cooperate with us.
a. On campus part
We conducted lectures about our IGEM project and synthetic biology techniques to students on Tuesday and Thursday weekly. At the start of our education program, during the club exhibition, we briefly introduced our project's purpose, effectiveness and future potential contribution to environment to identify and attract the students who is interested in protecting environment. After that, for the students who as well as have further interests in learning the method of designing something to protect our habitat, we held a series of lectures to explain the specific mechanism, and prove practicability of our project. Furthermore, we taught them about the knowledge of techniques and thinking method we used in designing and finishing the project. In general, our inner-school education program comprehensively passed on our experience as IGEMer and the synthetic biology knowledge as well as triggered their passion of learning synthetic biology and being an IGEMer to think about pollution problems and solutions to retard it.
For the whole process of education, we put a high value on the effectiveness of lecture. Therefore, we required students who is willing to cooperate our work to register their WeChat account, and privately asked randomly 75% of students each time to talk about their experience of it to adjust and improve the content of our lecture for satisfying most of audiences.
b. Out of campus part
Because of the belief in the usefulness of our project and the resolution of protecting habitat, after we visited work leaders of a sewage treatment plant, they established a long-term collaboration to help us conduct the design of our program by providing first-hand information of sewage plant. They intend to know more information of this type of modified biology treatment, and are willing to offer some latest policy to us for having more widely perspective of this project.

Cardiff_Wales,2017,Team:Cardiff Wales#Public outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," the Saturday morning. The main aim of this session was to debate the fundamental issues surrounding synthetic biology. This was an extremely interesting session as it made us question and discuss the ethical issues associated with synthetic biology. The topics for the debates included:
Is using synthetic biology to make therapeutics such as insulin necessary if the current method is already so well established?
> Should humans have the right to create synthetic life on other planets?
> Should there be a limit to what we should be allowed to genetically engineer?
> Should GM organs be an available treatment?
> Should we merge biology and AI? Should there be a boundary between the artificial and the natural world?
> Should all scientific findings/discoveries be made public?
After lunch, we headed off to the Warwick Business School in the Shard for the presentations. After a quick photo shoot looking over the view of the Thames and London, we presented our project and heard presentations from the other teams, where we further learnt about their projects.
This afternoon was one of the highlights of the trip, with an amazing experience and view at the Shard, as well as learning more about the what the other teams were working on, as there was such a range of projects and ideas.

Competent cells preparation: all the E. coli strains were made competent following a slightly modified version of the protocol described in [Sambrook J et al., 1989]. Briefly, cells were grown to and OD600 of ~0.4-0.6, harvested (4000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in (30 ml for each 50 ml of initial culture) pre-chilled Mg-Ca buffer (80 mM MgCl2, 20 mM CaCl2), centrifuged as before and the supernatant discarded. Cells were resuspended in (2 ml for each 50 ml of initial culture) pre-chilled Ca buffer (100 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol), aliquoted in 0.5 ml tubes and freezed immediately at -80°C. Test the transformation efficiency as:
efficiency [CFU/ug of DNA]= # CFU * 1000 ng of DNA / amount of transformed DNA [ng]
Pir strains validation: in order to test the capability of BW25141 (pir+) and BW23474 (pir-116) to propagate this conditional replication origin, they were made competent, as well as three control strains: MC1061, MG1655 and DH5alpha. Then, a vial of 100 ul of competent cells was transformed with 2-4 ng of:
no DNA (negative control);
a pSB*** series vector (positive control);

Their diabetic population is quite large and is expected to grow significantly as better diagnostic tools are implemented, as estimated 2/3rds of their diabetic population are currently undiagnosed in Africa alone. The South East Asian, and Pacific rim regions also need to be closely monitored.
Mike Nichols
So, maybe Tanzania or somewhere similar would work? You should strongly consider forming a start-up, and withhold Winsulin from the open source sphere to pursue this. Global impacts require profit margins and intellectual protection.
Team DISCO
These are all such great insights. We really need to consider our options.
Our Final Entrepreneurship Plan
Ultimately, we stuck with our guns and are following the Open Source Route. Although, these discussions really made us question as to whether the Open Source option really was our best option, especially noting the clinical trial costs and manufacturing barriers to enter the market. Following this discussion, we decided to explore the viability of open-source insulin, comparing them to the standard business model - including the costs / barriers of entry that were involved. The summary of our research can be found on our Entrepreneurship Page . Our decision came down to the open source method to continue with the international collaborations we have developed throughout the year. Further research is also required to determine just how applicable our Winsulin is as a therapeutic agent, so keeping the research open to the international community means theres more opportunity for this research to occur. Since our project began as an open source collaboration with Open Insulin , we decided to continue sharing the work we have done on both human insulin and Winsulin.

A short history of team Wageningen UR 2012
During the final weeks of 2011, our supervisors gathered a small group of enthusiastic students, willing to sacrifice their summer holiday to work on iGEM. In the first weeks of January, this small group quickly expanded to about 10 persons who were involved in the brainstorm.
A Belgium Beer Café was deemed most suitable for this purpose. The ideas that came to our minds were everything in between brilliant and alcohol induced nonsense.

Phage Library
This summer, we developed a cesium chloride gradient protocol for isolating larger and smaller phage. Utilizing this gradient, we were able to isolate mutant T4 bacteriophages that have distinctively smaller capsids and less variability in capsid size when compared to the wild type. Similarly, we were also able to isolate mutant T7 bacteriophages that have smaller and larger than average capsid sizes.
Cholera
To tackle the disease Cholera, we identified a protein, Amylase, that disrupt Cholera's biofilm formation. In addition, we demonstrated that E. coli is capable of sensing Cholera and hypothesize that it does so through its SdiA protein. In fact, Cholera can induce Lambda from lysogenic E. coli.

Extending on the feedback received by Andreas Laustsen on the need for the diagnostic device to be low-cost, we assessed for how we could create revenue. We identified the challenge to reaching the end users of rural sub saharan africa to be impacted by challenged infrastructure and distribution channels.
We further learned, from Guidelines for the management of snake bites, David A. Warrell: that prices of all types of medication rise due to the challenged infrastructure and the high demand for these medications. This leads certain suppliers to increase the prices for the products.
From communication and a meeting with Mette Louise Larsen from the Danish NGO, InnoAid, we were told about revenue streams that could be achieved given the nature of our project.
We communicated with Bernadette Abela-Ridder, the team leader for Neglected Zoonotic diseases at Department of the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases at The World Health Organization, who encouraged our incentive:
“Your research is interesting and valuable and may be able to support the WHO Roadmap which we will be developing in the next months.
We will be developing a research agenda that support the roadmap and these type of tools will be considered” 8. October 2017
We believe getting endorsement from respectable organization such as the World Health organization increases our chances of being a viable solution on the market in the future.
In order to assess for viability of our prototype on the market, we made a preliminary Canvas business plan to identify resources and challenges.
Business canvas

Our customer base,channels in which we distribute our product and how we imagine making an income evaluating our cost and revenue structures.
We believe a sequential approach of breaking through on the market is necessary. We have a challenge before us with certification, which we would have to achieve through multiple rounds of experiments, and test for robustness and specificity of our device.
We would like to develop the prototype further. We identify the University environment to be the most sensible solution, partly due to the high cost of research and development, and due to managing expenses on labor and facilities.
Strategically, we have two markets we have taken into consideration
- Australia
- Expand range to fit a bigger market, with the end-user having similar diagnostic needs but more means to pay for a diagnostic device and its use

虽然贤者之石从未被找到，追寻它的炼金术师们在实验室中尝试研究了许多种物质和它们之间的相互反应，积累起一套可靠的理论知识。这些知识至今仍在化学，冶金学和药理学中被广泛地运用。 在科技发达的21世纪，人们对于贤者之石的信仰已经淡去了。然而今天，我们依然有新的追求：寻找不仅能让人类更健康长寿，同时可以解决现代化造成的生态危机的方法。与过去不同的是，我们不应再简单的迷信可能存在于自然界某处的神奇物质，而应该以此为激励，创造新方法积极面对挑战。
让我们带你了解一类有可能革新合成生物学的新分子：非核糖体多肽合成酶。我们会教会你如何释放这种新分子的巨大潜力来合成具有各种功能"

Kyoto,2011,Team:Kyoto#Capture_-_-_TEXT.html," fischeri in 2010 Cambridge Team's WIKI(--> link ). The peak wavelength is about 500 nm and we can see that the large part of light emitted by BBa_K325909 is in the range of wavelength suitable to lure drosophilas.
3. Experiment 1 --- Drosophila's phototaxis in different colors
We made an experiment about drosophila's phototaxis to the lights of different colors(ultraviolet, blue, green, red, and infrared) to show that our assay with a Y-maze is reliable.
In the Y-maze, There are two diodes at the two ends of the both sides; one is lighting and the other is not lighting. In an assay, we gathered 5 flies with a pooter and put them into the bottom end of the Y maze. After 3 minutes, we counted the number of the flies in each side. ( read the materials and methods in detail )
Fig.4 : The method of the experiment with Y-maze
The results of these surveys can be summarized as follows (Vertical axis of these graphs indicates the average number of flies. error bars correspond to the standard deviation.) :
Fig.5 : This experiment were performed at UV light.
Fig.6 : This experiment were performed at blue light.
Fig.7 : This experiment were performed at green light.
Fig.8 : This experiment were performed at red light.
Fig.9 : This experiment were performed at infra-red light.
In all of these results, the number of flies in light sides is larger than those in the opposite sides. After we run the t test and chi-squared test of those data at a significance level of 5%,  it was revealed that the flies gathered significantly at the LED end under UV light, blue light and green light. On the other hand, when red light was used, the difference between the 2 ends was negligible. This is consistent with the results reported by [2] that drosophilas have a strong positive phototaxis to the light of wavelength shorter than 500nm. It means that our assay of drosophila's phototaxis with Y-maze is a certain assay.
Experiment 2 --- Assay of drosophila's phototaxis to the light emitted by E.coli
We confirmed that our assay with Y-maze is reliable by experiment 1, and we intended to assay the phototaxis to the light emitted by E.coli. But unfortunately, we couldn't make strong and stable light; some"

I'm Li Siting, major in Automation. With the love for both programming and biology, I developed the online E.coli War game in JavaScript. Then I came up with the idea of analogizing our game about bacteria’s competition to the typical history events. I drafted the descriptions and designed pictures for our game and discovery on wiki. As I am good at writing, I wrote our visiting plan for a company, presentation advertisement and designed an exhibition board for science museum. With the crazy love for softball, I want to say playing softball helps me to be very energetic and proactive. Photography is also my hobby.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#VeronicaNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," I am impressed by how much everyone has accomplished in such a short time. After lunch, we continued to work out bugs for the rest of the day. We received a report about the MIT studies; they gave us a pretty lengthy list of things to fix before Monday's BU user study. Kara and I worked over the weekend to finish it all.
July 30: User studies at BU
Today, we conducted user studies again. Consuelo, Kara and I prepped our system, loaded the surface into the car, and headed to Boston to test with the BU iGEM team. We wheeled Uppy to the meeting room and set up our camera and audio recorder. Similar to the last user studies we did, I took notes on the dialogue, actions and timestamps. First, we observed Traci and Sonya test our scenarios - Traci is a PI and the leader of BU's iGEM team, and Sonya is one of her graduate students. They had many suggestions for how to improve our system. Next, we tested with Shawn and Monique, the two members of BU's iGEM wet lab team. They didn't seem quite as picky, but offered a lot of helpful insight. By the time we finished, it was already 4 pm, so we headed back to the lab to update the rest of our team. We had a meeting when we got back and discussed all the things we still need to work on - much of the primer designer's logic was flawed, and we also had some UI issues.
July 31: Working on the poster and abstract
The MoClo Planner/SynBio Poster
We had our work cut out for us, so we started the morning trying to fix some of the smaller issues. We fixed the interface of the second primer designer page so that it shows the complete sequence in a huge box, rather than having to scroll (like in the previous version). We also rechecked the sequence to make sure that the correct primer sequence was shown. In addition, we labeled everything, added the ""GC"" content of the sequence, and changed the manual tab to be the default tab of every page. For lunch, Kara and Kathy cooked pasta and Consuelo brought pie and ice cream. It was a great treat considering how much work we had to do. Overall, we finished more than half of the MoClo Planner to-do list, although many of the leftover tasks were the more difficult ones. In the afternoon, we spent awhile putting our poster and abstracts together.
Aug. 1: Correcting MoClo Issues
Discussing the poster speeches"
Peking,2010,Team:Peking#Parts#Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html,"R controlling PmerT tracscription indicates that the apo-merR and Hg-bound merR have a competition. We speculate that the threshold of MerR response can be also manipulated by controlling the concentration of MerR in cytosol. As with the bacteria in natural environment, the concentration of MerR is stabilized at a certain level. In our design, merR was isolated from the operon and assembled with constitutive promoters of certain strength to maintain its expression intensity at certain level, then the sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. (Fig.3).
Fig.3. The construction of bioreporter. This biosensor construct was made by fusing PmerT and a reporting system, gfp, along with a plasmid structure that constitutive promoters prefixed before merR coding sequence.
We observed that cells with different MerR intensity exhibited correspondingly different sensitivity to mercury, indicating that the stronger the expression level of MerR is, a higher threshold is represented(Fig.4).
Fig.4. The expression intensity of MerR significantly determines the threshold of sensitivity to mercury (II). Five representative lines are selected and it can be seen that the thresholds have varied apparently. The letter in the bracket after the promoter name denotes the backbone (pSB3K3 or pSB1A2) where Pc-RBS-merR was cloned. The deeper the colour, the stronger the expression level of MerR is, leading to a higher threshold.

Cloning
Part I746907 (T7 promoter, GFP) in pSB1A2 was electroporated into DH5alpha, and plated onto a LB-Agar Amp plate. This part can be used as a reporter plasmid for our AND-Gate in e. coli CP919.
AND-Gate: Picking of colonies
Transformation and ligation efficiency of control was several thousand clones. Vector controls were lawn due to usage of CAM-plasmid contaminated electorcompetent DH5 alpha. All contaminated DH5alpha from 01-07-11 have been discarded.
3 clones of each plate have been picked and inoculated in 5 ml LB/cam o/n.
Other Work
sequencing of clones
Sequence of Blue light promotor with downstream RBS+lacZ is correct.

Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," knock outs in our project, this process was much easier for us.
We used primer sequences flanked by overhangs, designing them in such a manner that they would bind the sequences outside of the PEX7 gene. The overhangs are homologue to the previously isolated selective marker gene KanMX (G418 resistance) + loxP sides. When transforming the dPEX5 yeast strain using this cassette (both homologue regions and the KanMX gene), the PEX7 cell is removed from chromosome IV and replaced for the selective marker. The cell is then plated on plates containing G418 resistance. Once fully-grown colonies were observable, the genetic information was isolated and a verification PCR, using new plasmids, was performed.
The PEX7 knock out transformation cells (dPEX5 S. cerevisiae) were spread on a plate containing the antibiotic G148 (geneticin). As observed in Image #1, several colonies showed an observable culture growth. After this, 3 different colonies were picked and their genome isolated. Image #2 shows the verification PCR performed on the isolated genomes from the dPEX7, dPEX5 mutated S. cerevisiae using primers designed to bind to the sides of the knock out cassette. Having this in mind, we used a ladder that fitted the length of our amplified sequence. This knockout showed to be crucial, achieving a completely empty ghost for our friends from iGEM Köln / Düsseldorf. Getting rid of PEX5 and PEX7 genes would get rid of the own cellular peroxisomal protein import system. This important step would then allow our partners to integrate their own protein translocation system and therefore control the synthetic pathway that happens in the intercellular compartments. Through our experience and knowledge, we helped them overcome this obstacle which, as they explained, wouldn't have been possible without the knockout. The successfully mutated cells were prepared and delivered to our fellow iGEM Düsseldorf / Köln partners.
This love wasn’t one way! The iGEM Köln /Düsseldorf Team designed and produced 4 different plasmids containing the channel ATCLCc, a chloride channel from Arabidopsis Thaliana. Three plasmids containing this gene were coupled with different promoters (Gal1, Sac6 and RPL18B). The fourth plasmid contained URA 3’ and 5’ homologies designed for genome integration. We transformed this plasmids into our different mutants to further improve our salt uptake. Since we did not work with plasmids or golden gate assembly it was not possible"
Oxford,2018,Team:Oxford#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," would be beneficial to conduct one-to-one patient interviews to gain a greater understanding of the specific impact of the disease on patients’ quality of life. Taking on advice from clinicians, as well as the apparent range of symptoms associated with different autoimmune diseases, we chose to focus our product on the treatment of IBD. As a widely accepted method of “gaining insight into people’s feelings, understanding and perceptions”, one-to-one interviews played an important role in understanding the issues that our product must rectify to have the most significant benefit to patients’ quality of life.
We have gone into more depth on the conduction and results of patient interviews in our product design section. The results clearly show current treatments are not sufficient. The main points we took away from the interviews are that patients seek treatments that reduce flare-ups, have fewer long term side effects and less of an impact on social life. This greatly aided in the development of our device.
Autoimmune Disease Survey
We sent out a survey for patients with autoimmune diseases in order get a better idea of what patients would like from a treatment. We received 48 responses from members of the public suffering from autoimmune diseases from a range of age groups. The responses gave us a greater understanding of the current treatments, the problems with them and what patients would like from a treatment. We were astounded by the positivity towards GE and for our project. There is a great deal of belief from the public in the potential of GE in medicine.
They survey told us the public wanted a treatment that treats “a condition at its source rather than masking symptoms.” that was also “less invasive and less dangerous”. They also showed support of a device that was able to provide personalised doses according to the patient. This led to the initial design of our treatment.
Developing  our design
Having received feedback from patients we learnt what was sought after in a novel treatment. We then reached out to specialists to comment on the initial design of our device in order to maximise the efficacy of our treatment based on current knowledge on the immune system and IBD.
Professor Simon Travis We got in contact with Professor Travis, Professor of Clinical Gastroenterology, who has been the President of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and an elected Member of the International Organisation of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. As well as gaining an insight into the current problems with treatments and what a doctor would like out of a new treatment, Professor Travis was pivotal in the development of our product from a general treatment of autoimmune diseases to focusing on IBD. A more specific focus while developing the treatment allowed us to produce a device"

Wheat stem rust fungus has resulted in an enormous amount of crop devastation, with more drastic effects in recent years. Since wheat is the most prevalent food crop in the world and rust fungi can cause near complete loss of yield, they take a disastrous toll on the human population and lead to global losses of billions of dollars yearly. An outbreak of new, virulent (disease-causing) race of stem rust would take a great toll on wheat crops world-wide since the crops would not be resistant and would be susceptible to the disease. It would eliminate a key food source across multiple countries and destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of farmers. The outbreaks of highly virulent races, such as TTKSK, TKTTF, and their relatives, have caused particularly great losses, and are poised to cause more as the disease continues to spread to new areas. The impact this disease has on human food security necessitated particular attention to the human practices aspect of our project.
We categorized our human practices work with two main objectives:
First, we reached out to individuals and groups who have been impacted by wheat rust fungus to best understand the needs of those who could benefit most from our work.
Second, since the goal of our project is to use novel agricultural technology to allow for an effective use of fungicides, we contacted various businesses and organizations that specialize in innovative agricultural methods. We specifically investigated how they manage agricultural pests and why they use such new technologies and methods.

(Fig. D)(At first we think of measuring this characteristic by comparing yECitrine fluorescence /mStrawberry fluorescence. However, considering that the fluorescence of mStrawberry is too low, we cannot expect an accurate result due to the high error rate. ) We assume that both MINI terminators and CYC1 terminators can effectively stop the transcription, so the mRNA of mStrawberry generated behind these terminators can hardly be detected, neither does the fluorescence of mStrawberry.
What’s more, the Fluorescence/Abs600 of “MM”is also nearly 3-fold compared with “MC”, proving that the strength of MINI promoter is higher than CYC1 promoter.
In addition, when we compared “MM” with “CC” which is the commonly used promoter-terminator pair, we found that the difference is nearly 6-fold. (Fig. D)
From our results, we confirmed that the MINI promoter and MINI terminator do be superior to CYC1 promoter and CYC1 terminator, not only in length but also in strength. (Fig. E)

Robustness in different host
In order to verify that the MINI-GRE is able to work with the same rule in a variety of yeast strains and expend the application range of these MINI regulatory devices, we invited other teams to repeat the same experiments in different yeast strains and experimental environment, which can also be an important part of our collaboration.
The time point of the data collection is early stationary phase of yeast growth. The yeast strains we used with Nanjing-China were Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100. The yeast strain used in Tianjin was synX, the yeast strain with chemical synthetic chromosome.
From the result of other colleges, we can know that our MINI-GRE can also work in other yeast strains. (Fig. F)

Ribosense Results
Fluoride Riboswitch
Having obtained our DNA, the first test was a rather crude β-Galactosidase assay using cells cultured from the plates Yale sent us, the results of which are shown below, the protocol for which is found here .
A β-galactosidase assay of the fluoride riboswitch, the numbers represent fluoride concentration in mM
These results were very positive as it hinted at a good correlation between fluoride concentration and reporter output.
The next step was a more quantitave assay using a 96 well plate reader. This was in line with the assays done in the original paper by Breaker et al. In the paper they carried out a Miller assay, and whilst we have included the full and correct protocol on our protocols page , including the appropriate calculations, we lacked the filters and so were only able to record the A450nm."

Gas Group-Design
We sought to convert ammonia into dinitrogen gas which can be directly released into air. This is our “Gas Group”. Our inspiration came from ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation bacteria (Anammox) which converts nitrite and ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) in nature. However, Anammox is sensitive to oxygen, which makes it impossible to apply it in aquaculture. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel aerobic pathway combining enzymes from ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Anammox. In this novel pathway, the ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) from AOB converts ammonium (NH4+) into hydroxylamine(NH2OH), then the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) uses NH2OH and NH4+ as substrates to synthesize hydrazine (N2H4), and finally an oxidase oxidizes N2H4 into N2 (Figure D1). In this case, soluble nitrogen is turned into insoluble dinitrogen gas and fish no longer had to worry about ammonia threat. (For more details about anammox metabolism, see Notebook .)
To facilitate this NH4+ - NH2OH - N2H4 - N2 pathway, we have to express ammonia monooxygenase (AmoA) and the alpha subunit of hydrazine synthase (HZSα) from AOB in E. coli, and select an enzyme which is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of hydrazine into dinitrogen gas by oxygen with high efficiency and specificity.
Gas Group-Results
From Hydrazine to dinitrogen gas
We first tackled the final step of our pathway, since the substrate hydrazine is highly toxic to bacteria and the rate of this reaction directly determines the efficiency of our system. Though no successful expression of the original hydrazine dehydrase (HDH, for more information, see Notebook ) from Anammox has been reported yet, that it is a multiheme protein is clear. Therefore, we decided to try heme-containing proteins and other metal-containing proteins available in our laboratory. We tested N2H4 oxidation activity of 6 metal-containing proteins, including Degrado, 3His, Pf ferritin, DPS, CueO, and Urease (for detailed protein information, see Notebook ). Pur"

In this experiment, wells 1,2 and 3 contain HEK293 cells co-transfected with pGL3+pTIMP1 and Renilla plasmids. According to the literature, we expect to see very low levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase4.
Wells 4, 5, and 6 contain HEK293 cells co-transfected with pGL3+pF4/80 and Renilla plasmids. We did not have background information regarding the expression of pF4/80 in HEK293 cells but we know this gene is specific for macrophage cells, therefore we did not anticipate for pF4/80 expression in these cells.
Wells 7, 8, and 9 contain HEK293 cells co-transfected with pGL3+pSTEAP4 and Renilla plasmids. According to the literature, we didn’t expect to see any levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase 1.
Wells 10, 11, and 12 contain HEK293 cells co-transfected with Enhancer E7 and Renilla plasmids4. Enhancer E7 is an active enhancer in HEK293 that was cloned into a pGL4.23 that contains Luc. These wells act as a positive control for HEK293 cells as the enhancers are specific for HEK293 cells, Therefore, we expect a suffiient values of firefly luciferase luminescence.
Wells 13, 14, and 15 contain HEK293 cells co-transfected with pGL3 without a promoter (empty vector) and Renilla. These wells act as a negative control for this experiment. We expect to see negligible levels of luminescence from the firefly luciferase, as this pGL3 plasmid does not contain a promoter. The luminometer values of these wells serve as the reference for the background\noise of the experiment and will be used for calculating the relative activity for the tested promoters. 
Wells 16, 17, and 18 contain HEK293 cells which did not undergo transfection. These wells act as a luminescence baseline for each transfected cells and to validate that our experiment is not contaminated with plasmids. We expect to see low levels of luminescence both for Renilla and firefly luciferase in these wells.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Model#IntegrationQS_-_-_TEXT.html," Our goal was to engineer a construct where QS could be induced, for example by Cpx or by addition of L-Arabinose. We started off with a QS system that always produces fluorescence. The goal was to reduce the sensitivity to AHL. Through the mathematical model we discovered that aiiA can be used to tune the sensitivity of the QS system. Inspired by our model, the BioBrick BBa_K2387070 that allows for inducible repression of aiiA production was engineered. By combining our BioBrick with the existing QS reporter BioBrick BBa_K1913005 , we managed to induce fluorescence by addition of L-Arabinose. Our module was therefore able to detect L-Arabinose and turn on QS. Thus, GFP was produced when required.
Our BioBrick allows the engineering of whole-cell biosensors that incorporate QS as a means of signal amplification or to synchronize the reporter system across an entire population. For this BioBrick to work with a detection module, that module has to trigger TetR production upon detection. In doing so, QS will be triggered, resulting in a fluorescent signal.

Project Design
The initial idea of doing a project on catnip came from our advisor *Xuan Wang who mentioned to us the fact that catnip can be used as a green pesticide. Alexis Zeng did further research and saw the possibility of using a co-culture system for manufacturing. Lucinda Lin searched for strategies to optimize the microbial production, our primary PI *Dr. Haoqian Zhang recommended the use of TALE stabilized promoters.

Summary
Previous iGEM Projects (Slides USCF & Cambridge , Rice , Modelling ):
UCSF 2006 - Produced orthogonal CheW/CheW* to allow chemoattractant to be selected. Bacteria strain UU1250 (Parkinson Lab) was used with the CheW knocked out. The reason for picking CheW was this it is a fairly small protein which would hopefully degrade quickly (could also be tagged) allowing switching to occur quickly. Parts for each receptor are available, but the success of the project is not known.
Cambridge 2006 - Was a large project where bi-directional cell signalling was implemented to produce ordered patterns in RFPs and GFPs. They used performed motility test and found that MC1000 and MG1655 (Suggested by Nigel) performed well. They contributed parts for quorum sensing that have been shown to work successfully.
Rice 2006 - Used chemotaxis toward B.subilis pheromones to collate around a colony and when enough bacteria present produce a lethal substance. Used the RP8611 E.coli strain which has null MCP receptors.
Harvard 2007 - These appear to have considered the idea of coating particles with proteins that stick to membrane proteins on the bacteria. Once enough bacteria are present (quorum sensing) a light signal is produced. Also, because beads are magnetised the bacteria can then be moved around. Unfortunately, the full project could not be evaluated so further work needs to be performed.

What we can do in our project should follow the rules they permit, and they manage all instruments and chemicals, especially for dangerous and toxic ones, in all labs. The ESC is to be informed on the basis of our project and on what we are doing and plan to do. Therefore, the ESC has permitted our project at first.
    In addition, we do our wetlab activities in Common Instrument Rooms where are in charge of Biomedical Engineering Lab of Dr. Chih-Sheng Lin and Applied Microbiology & Biochemistry Lab of Dr. Ching-Ping Tseng. They would check whether the rules are followed or not everyday, and every time someone starts to work in these rooms, he or she should take down his or her student numbers in a log. Besides, when someone uses a common instrument, he or she should record the purpose for the instrument.
    Briefly, under these requirements, the progress for our project would not raise any possible safety issues.

Safety Issues for Researcher, Public and  Environment
    As above we mentioned, we did our work under the control, so in fact, we did not get hurt during working. Our work also is harmless to the public and the environment. Since after we had finished our progress for a day or a step, we always dealt with the contaminated trash carefully. This is the most important in our work.
    We only worked with non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strains. All work was conducted in a biosafety level S1 laboratory. Rules of best microbiological practices were applied.Almost Biobricks we used are from MIT, and only somethings new we made and modified from previous Biobricks in 2009 iGEM works ourselves. Actually, these new and old Biobricks are very safe.

We create four Basic Biobricks regarding to T7-dCas9. NT7-dCas9 BBa_K2371000 CT7-dCas9 BBa_K2371001 NT7 BBa_K2371002 CT7 BBa_K2371003
Description:
The first two Biobricks are the two split T7 polymerase sequence we adopted. We provide them for other team to leverage them through other methods. We choose the split site suggested by the team of Tiyun Han, Quan Chen and Haiyan Liu. [7] The following two Biobricks are the sequence of T7 polymerase connected to dCas9 protein. The linker between split T7 polymerase and dCas9 is GGGGSGGGGS adopted by Peking University. A 6 X His-tag is added on C terminus of dCas9 in order to purify it.
We create seven composite Biobricks regarding to sgRNA. We created a Biobrick for each of sgRNA and insert T7 promotor and T7 terminator before and after the sequence respectively in order to utilize them to transcribe sgRNA in vitro. The sequences are synthesize through Oligo DNA bridging designed by DNAworks. The detail of synthesis method is in the                 experiment.

Figure 1. a) Genetic circuit of three modules. b) Schematic illustration of our total circuit.
Module one - OmpA
Porin outer-membrane protein A, OmpA, is a kind of highly expressed transmembrane porin protein of E. coli and is therefore abundant in OMVs. [1] We inserted SpyTag to the C-termini and N-termini of a truncated form of OmpA respectively to compare the efficiency of SpyTag/SpyCatcher linkage (Figure 2).
Figure 2. a) Genetic circuit of SpyTag-OmpA part and OmpA-SpyTag part. b) Schematic illustration of module one.
Furthermore, to characterize whether our OmpA-SpyTag can localize in OMVs, we also attached GFP to both OmpA parts (Figure 3).
Figure 3. a) Genetic circuit of SpyTag-OmpA-GFP part and OmpA-SpyTag-GFP part. b) Schematic illustration of these two parts.
Module two – L7Ae
Archaeal ribosomal protein protein L7Ae owns the ability to bind with RNA with C/Dbox RNA structure. [2-4] Through the isopeptide bonds formed between SpyTag and SpyCatcher, L7Ae can be anchored with OmpA, and then secreted into OMVs. To transport our L7Ae into the periplasmic space, we inserted TorA leader sequence to the circuit (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Genetic circuit of SpyCatcher-L7Ae.
To localize our L7Ae inside OMVs, we also conjugated mRFP1 to the L7Ae-SpyCatcher. Under the induction of the IPTG, our bacteria coudld express our L7Ae parts (Figure 5).

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Data#Vectors_-_-_TEXT.html,"icol selection, this vector integrates, this vector integrates into the sacA locus of B. subtilis by double homologous recombination.
Correct integration is verified by colony PCR. One primer is located outside the integration site and its respective partner is located on the inegrated part of the vector, facing outwards. gDNA from W168 as a negative control should not give a PCR product.
A pre-version of this vector with one forbidden PstI site was used for most promoter evaluations (All graphs that you can find in the Data section of the promoters derive from this pre-version). To prove that our final version also works, we did another experiment where we compared the luminescence of PlepA in the pre- and final version of pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. Here you can see the results of this experiment:
Luminescence measurements of the promoter PlepA in the pre-version of the vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE in comparison to the final vector.
In this experiment, the finished vector showed about half of the activity throughout the measurement, hence while the absolute luminescence values are lower, the overall dynamics are unaffected.
pSBBs4S-PXyl
CAUTION: DOES NOT WORK! CANNOT BE TRANSFORMED INTO B. SUBTILIS!
pSBBs4S-PXyl is an integrative expression vector. Upstream of the multiple cloning site, there is a xylose-inducible promoter, Pxyl, followed by a terminator downstream. In the absence of xylose,  Pxyl is inhibited by the repressor XylR, which is expressed in B. subtilis and not part of this vector. For selection, a spectinomycin resistance cassette is located in between the recombination sites. This vector integrates into the thrC locus, which can be checked by the threonine test.
However, we could not manage to transform this vector into B. subtilis, although we tried three times. Moreover, the team from Groningen also tested this vector, but again was not able to transform it into B. subtilis, either.
There are two possible reasons for the failure: First, a defective resistance cassette or second, the presence of a forbidden restriction site preventing correct linearization prior to transformation.

Instructor
In this year’s iGEM competition, we instructed and assisted the high school team SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to help them design their own experiment and helped them to complete their Interlab measurement.
We are glad to be there instructor and friends, although they are just high school students, the intelligence they presented and the diligence they held are the things that we college students should learn to.
Lacking in experimental instruments and experiences, they faced with lots of problems on their way to iGEM. We’d like to share our iGEM Lab. More importantly, after we showed them around in our lab, they decided to build up there own BioLab, not only for this years iGEM competition and years to come for their own use, but for the local community.
In the early days of the experiment, we introduced them to microbial skills, taught them about the extraction and transformation of plasmids, standardized aseptic manipulation, the extraction and purification of DNA, and how to operate various instruments and so on.Last but not least, we required them to perform laboratory safety obligations. It is during our doing summer experiments that they observed and then learnt these skills that is mentioned above all. After a week or so, we started a formal Interlab on August 8.
We measured OD600 Reference point and fluorescein fluorescence standard curve according to the protocol, including preparing the fluorescein stock solution, the serial dilutions of fluorescein, and operating microplate reader. At the next day, we prepared the medium and sterilized it, as well as the centrifugal tube, pipettes, and the conical bottle. Prior to performing the measurement on the cells, we suggested that they should performed the calibration measurements. This would ensure that they understand the measurement process. When the cell measurement were performed for the first time, we extracted eight plasmids and transformed them. But the next day, device 1 and device 4 were transformed successfully. So we made a second transformation, and successfully obtained the target colonies growing on the chloramphenicol plates. After all the devices have been transformed, we picked 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculated it. The next day, cell growth, sampling"

3.2 Fusion Protein Expression and Purification
Design: We developed a new production process for the fusion protein BBa_K2643002. We followed existing dxCas9 expression protocols ( Huai et al. 2017 ), but developed a new downstream process for the fusion. We evaluated three different types of chromatography:
Nickel affinity chromatography: The fusion protein has a HIS-tag (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
Heparin chromatography: The fusion protein is a DNA-binding protein (used to purify both Tn5 and dxCas9 individually).
MonoQ chromatography: It’s an anion exchange resin, utilizing the charge of the fusion protein as a purification property.
Results and interpretation: Of the three chromatography methods, both heparin and monoQ were successful. As a result we developed a production process which includes heparin chromatography as a capture step, followed by monoQ as a final polishing step.
We used heparin chromatography to capture the fusion from the crude lysate. The fusion protein has a high affinity to the heparin resin, resulting in good initial separation of the fusion protein from contaminating and degrading species. The results suggested that the fusion protein was cleaved at the linker, resulting in a dxCas9 contamination (figure 14, lane 2 to 10) . The dxCas9 contaminant has a lower affinity to the heparin resin and eluted at lower concentrations of salt (figure 14, lane 2-10), whereas the fusion has a higher affinity to the heparin resin and eluted at high concentration of salt (figure 14, lane 11-13). Only the last three elution fractions were pooled (figure 14, lane 11-13), and further purified.

Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched, there may be more than one region. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the minimal task is to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. Matching alternatives of two different chains in the template should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to C2 and"

2)Being sensitive to common antibiotics helps to clear the bacteria from organisms with antibiotics to interrupt the treatment.
3)As anaerobic bacteria, Salmonella can survive in both hypoxia and necrotic areas of tumors to accumulate selectively in tumor microenvironment.
4)With a distinct genetic background, the bacteria can be easily genetic engineered and attenuated.
5)The experiments can be conveniently operated with oral administration.
6)Salmonella administrated orally can reach the solid tumors.  With distant injection, the bacteria can target different tumors, and even track transferred tumor cells.
8)The bacteria can express effect genes, therefore express various therapeutic proteins, taking part in the combination therapy of enzyme prodrugs.
8)With low expenses, the bacteria can be applied in long-term treatments.
To date, there are a number of avirulent salmonella which have been typically impaired biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, purines or amino acids in the tumor therapy.  They are used either to directly kill cancer cells or to deliver the expressed therapeutic proteins to tumor in the mouse models.  For example, strain A1 and its derivative A1-R which has defects in leucine-arginine target a metastases model. Defects in guanosine5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate synthesizing an attenuated salmonella which is an effective vector against CT-26 tumors and metastasis.  A defect in the aroA gene gives rise to SL7207 which has been used by several groups.  VNP20009 which has defects in msbB and purI exhibited antitumor effects and has been used in the clinical trials.  (Modification at the purI genes increases dependence on adenine and disruption in the msbB gene alters lipid A and greatly diminishes the potential to induce TNF-α and cause septic shock.)
As for the mechanism to guide the bacteria accumulation in tumor, we think various nutritional environments in a tumor may compensate the metabolic defects in these bacteria, thereby allowing effective growth in a tumor.
4 Promoter
In animal models, attenuated Salmonella prefer to colonize solid tumors.  The concentration of bacteria in solid tumors is 1000 times of that of normal tissues, causing cancer tissues to shrink, even cure cancer.  In fact, people used bacteria therapy to cure cancer from a long time ago (over 150 years).  However, due to uncontrollable toxic effects to normal tissues, this method has been disregarded"
Aachen,2017,Team:Aachen#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," of their maximum          performance and cause increasing water costs due to low productivity [1]. When plants struggle with their productivity production costs for water can rise up to more than $3.50/m3 [1].          A water distributor in Aachen, as a comparison, produces its drinking water from surface water with production costs of $0.8/m3.
2. Desalination
Reverse osmosis guarantees complete purification of water from solvents, making it best suited for seawater desalination. However, water, free from every solvent is not needed          for ecological applications. Therefore, important ions and solvents are resolved in the right concentrations after treatment, making reverse osmosis unspecific and the          application inefficient. Organisms on the other hand express highly specific transporters, making our Salt Vaults specific for differing ions. In conclusion, resolving          of solvents needed for households or agriculture is not needed, making the process significantly more straight-lined.
3. Effluents
Reverse osmosis plants consist of multiple treatment steps that all produce different effluents. The biggest part of these effluents is the concentrate from the reverse            osmosis lines [2]. Its volume is huge and varies between 40 and 60% of the feed flow rate [2]. Resulting from the principle of reverse osmosis, the concentrate has a            highly increased salt load (up to 9g/l of chloride [3]) making its discharge, at least in the inland, complicated and expensive.           As reverse osmosis is commonly used in salt water desalination plants at the coast it is obvious to discharge the salt concentrate back into the marine environment without treating            it, which was the common method for many years [3]. This practice has been clearly linked to a list of detrimental effects on some of the ecosystems around the outlets of the salt            concentrate [4], like massive losses of coral, plankton and fish in regions of the red sea [5] or reductions in the abundance of plankton, sessile invertebrates and echinoderms [6].            Because of these negative effects the concentrates are a potentially serious threat to marine ecosystem making environmentally friendly alternatives necessary [3,2].
At the moment          it is established to dilute these concentrates with other waste water to lower the salt concentration [2,4]. But there are also problems with chemical burden from agents to enhance          flocculation, prevent foaming or to avoid membrane deterioration [7].
When reverse osmotic plants are located inland there is no possibility to pump the concentrate into seawater, making it even more complicated to"

Grenoble-Alpes,2017,Team:Grenoble-Alpes#LabBook_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM 2015 team who designed an amazing DNA detector for Human Papillomavirus, Grenoble 2017 team created a similar biological system to detect cholera’s pathogen and even inserted it inside an innovative portable and cheap kit. The specific target sequence is 39bp long and was found in RstA gene of bacteriophage CTX. The probe has been then designed according to the target sequence, and inserted into an appropriate plasmid backbone that was carrying a fluorescent reporter. This insertion was more complicated than expected: the main conclusions are (i) an insertion of sequence inside a plasmid vector through a unique restriction site requires at least three dephosphorylation steps to avoid self-ligation, (ii) the best ratio insert:vector in that case appeared to be a molar ratio 1:1 (see figure 13) and (iii) an insertion between two different restriction sites [p1] is much easier than one in a unique site. The detector was activated and tested then with the target, with successful results. The few false positives observed are suspected being due to a bad activation of the detector probe prior the contact with the target. Still, there is a notable difference of colonies number when the target is present or not. Evaluation of sensitivity and specificity was also attempted. Sensitivity (proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such) was tested through the counting of transformed bacteria. A notable difference between absence or presence of the target was observed as soon as 6ng of target were in contact with 100ng of detector. However, a sequencing of all colonies would have been more accurate, to insure that the counting was not taking into account false positives. Specificity (proportion of negatives identified as such) brought more issues: test consisted in the evaluation of the detector’s ability to recognize only the original target and not the false sequences more or less homologous. Unfortunately, results were too heterogeneous to draw any conclusions. Importantly, a statistical job would be done for each step of the detector construction. Indeed, it is important to highlight that most of the experiments have been done only once or twice because of the short time slot of the project. So, the detector was successfully built in this one-shot way, nevertheless the process has to be standardized as well as the characterization that has to be completed. Ideally, comparison with a gold standard would be done.
iGEM Grenoble team 2017 built a new biobrick (BBa_K2299000) for which the proof of concept for its ability to detect cholera’s pathogen DNA is working.

Prionic Switch
Components
The switch is formed by two different parts: the activator and the reporter. The activator part is a construction of two fragments: the NM domains of the protein Sup35, which confers to the protein the prionic activity, and the GR526 portion, which contains the DNA-binding and transcription-activation domains. The ligand-binding domain of the protein GR was eliminated, decoupling the response of the protein to the presence of glucocorticoids, and thus generating a constitutive transcription activation factor. The normal activity of this protein results in the activation of the genes preceded by the GRE (Glucocorticoid Response Element). When exposed to heat shock or other stress conditions, the NM domains start the prionic activity, eventually inhibiting the activation of transcription.
This part was amplified by using the primers indicated by Li and Lindquist (2000), together with the sequence recommended to use for the ligation protocol with the plasmid pSB1C3. Those primers are:
Forward actagtagcggccgctgcagATGTCGGATTCAAAC
Reverse tctagaagcggccgcgaattcTCCTGCAGTGGCTTG
(again, capital letters represent the region that pairs with the coding sequence of NMGR526).
The second part consists of the GRE followed by the reporter gene. In our experiments, we used LacZ for this purpose. The amplification of this part could not be made because of some problems found when trying to find the sequence of the GRE.
Sequence
The sequence of NMGR526 can be reconstructed from the separated parts that compose it. The NM domain sequence can be found in the SUP35/YDR172W first fragments. The GR526 sequence comes from the nucleot"

Cloning of Subtilisin E Gene from Bacillus subtilis into an E. coli - S. cerevisiae Shuttle Vector
In the beginning we received the PHY300PKL plasmid with the subtilisin E gene. We chose an uracil deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strand and a shuttle vector carrying the URA gene. The vector has the secretion tag MF alpha to make harvesting of produced protein more convenient. After cloning the subtilisin E gene into the vector in Escherichia coli we want to transform it in S. cerevisiae and make a test expression. A scheme of the cloning can be seen below:

Cloning of Codon Optimized Subtilisin E in pTEF-MF
As the test expression of the Subtilisin E gene from bacillus subtilis was not successful we used a codon optimized variant of the gene we had on the PHY300PKL plasmid. As a host we chose the S. cerevisiae strand CENPK2-1D again as it has the deficiencies we need for selection. As a vector backbone we tried the pTEF-MF vector again.

Restriction enzyme digests of the midi-prep DNA
It was decided that four samples would be prepared from our midi-prep stock of the BBa_J33206 BioBrick in plasmid pSB1A2 DNA. The four samples include sample DNA on it's own (uncut plasmid), sample DNA + EcoRI, plasmid + PstI and finally plasmid + EcoRI + PstI (should yield the plasmid backbone and BioBrick insert).
The protocol we used was one suggested by FastDigest, the company from which our restriction enzymes came from.
The contents of the digest samples are as follows:

The benefit of using FastDigest enzymes is that they only take 5 minutes to digest the DNA samples! To be certain that the DNA samples are cut correctly, the time given under incubation for the enzymes to digest the DNA was 10 minutes. After this time, the digests and the undigested sample were run on the gel
DNA gel electrophoresis of digests
The digest samples were treated in the way the DNA gel electrophoresis protocol suggested - 9ul of digest DNA was taken from each of the four tubes and to each, 1ul of loading buffer (dye) was added. 10ul of the samples were then added to the wells (located in between the HindIII DNA ladder filled wells) in the following order:
Lane 1 = blank
Lane 2 = 8ul of HindIII DNA ladder
Lane 3 = 10ul of pSB1A2 alone
Lane 4 = 10ul of pSB1A2 + EcoRI
Lane 5 = 10ul of pSB1A2 + PstI

OVERVIEW
Our associative learning circuit requires a sensor that can detect simultaneously occuring signals, in this case nitric     oxide and AHL (Figure 1). Such a sensor with these specific inputs has not been described in the literature before. Thus     we generated a collection of AND gates responsive to NO and AHL in order to find a design that best fits the requirements     of our system.
We also wanted to demonstrate the flexibility of our system and created one more AND gate responsive to lactate and NO.     The lactate portion of the AND gate was based on the work done by ETH Zurich 2015 team.
Figure 1: The learning circuit requires simultaneous detection of nitric oxide and AHL. We designed a collection      of AND gates for this purpose, using a combination of the NorV promoter and esaboxes.
Components of the AHL-based AND gate
NorV promoter (PnorV) is the native promoter controlling the nitric oxide reduction operon (norRVW) in E. Coli. [1]. It's transcriptional regulator,     NorR, can bind nitric oxide and activate gene expression. We used this promoter in combination with basal NorR production     in E.coli as the Nitric Oxide (NO) sensor of our AND gate. The PnorV promoter can also be found among the biobricks     we submitted to the registry Part:BBa_K2116002.
EsaR (Part:BBa_K2116001) is a transcriptional regulator     of the Pantoea stewartii quorum sensing system [2]. In the abscence of 3OC6HSL it can bind DNA and inhibit transcription. An esabox is a 18bp sequence where EsaR can bind. Unlike other quorum sensing regulators EsaR acts as a transcriptional     repressor and not an activator. We took advantage of this property, and placed esaboxes either;
i) as roadblocks after transcription start site of PnorV, preventing the polymerase from advancing or;
ii) within"

ZJU-China,2016,Team:ZJU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"    The effect using red light system to inhibit PopmC is not obvious enough. During the experiment, we integrated the two plasmids mentioned in the original reference into a whole. We suspect that the incoordination happened in the system is due to different copy numbers. In the future, we plan to change the copy numbers and try to find the best effect. Besides, we consider to replace cph8 and RBS before PcyA/ho1.     Also, we want to adopt the blue light control system used by Uppsala_Sweden2011, and compare its influences with red light and green light systems.     In order to describe the light control system more in details, we plan to use multi-mode reading machine to take pictures regularly. Thus we could analyze after how much time being irradiated can bacteria produce the initial response, and draw the response curve according to fluorescence intensity.Currently we use LED lights to irradiate bacteria. The luminance of red LED light is 1200MCD, and 5000MCD for green LED light. In the future, we plan to increase the light intensity, to explore the correlation between light intensity and bacteria’s response time.
(2)Oscillation
    In practice, in order to merge several chambers into a whole encryption unit, we have to realize synchronization among chambers instead of within a single one. And this needs strict requirements about the initial bacteria quantity in each chamber and other related factors. So, it has high possibility that desynchronization occurs.     For realizing synchronization as a whole, besides quorum sensing substances, we hope to apply a new micromolecule which could penetrate the PDMS surface, and coordinate bacteria’s gene expression process. After research and discussion, we find that hydrogen peroxide molecule is a good choice. Through redox signalling by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the native redox sensing machineries of E. Coli, we can apply H2O2 to our oscillation system (Fig.11). Using AHL to activate the production of H2O2 in chambers, letting H2O2 to coordinate gene expression in the whole unit, we then realize a perfect synchronization in the whole unit. (Fig.12, Fig.13)

Highlights from our Hardware Journal
Our design evolved greatly over the course of the months we spent working on it. Initially we planned to simply have the culture growing in a test tube, but our wetlab team was working with yeast at that point, which grows to ODs far greater than anything that can be measured without dilution. Our teammates suggested that dilution would be extremely useful in expanding the utility of ABODE beyond E.Coli .
for each bullet, have a nice sounding quote from the hardware journal
We also realised that it was necessary to make our device compatible with conical flasks, because those are what biologists use when they need to make large amounts of culture for any purpose apart from measing its rate of growth.
Our initial design had a special 3d printed test tube holder, but tests in the IISc undergraduate lab showed that even very similar looking 'standard' test tubes have differing bore sizes. We then switched to a much simpler and cheaper holder made of laser-cut acrylic that allows many test tubes to be fit in it, with a bit of insulating tape.
We initally planned to use an elegant seven-sided connector \\insert picture to link our pipes, but then we realised that the 3d printing plastic it was made of was not compatible with the ethanol we use to sterilize our system. We replaced it with medical-grade biocompatible 3-way stopcocks.
The Doomed Multiplexer \\put pics
we struggled for a long time, inventing ever more complicated ways of closing off 5 pipes while opening the last - using just one programmable motor. What stymied us was surprising - humans are strong. Pinching a pipe closed is no easy task for a cheap little motor. Eventually we switched to a system of one servo per pipe connection, which took up much more space but offered finer grained control and a lower chance of catastrophic plumbing failure.
Our initial user interface was rather hard to use, so we came up with a web-based system, since we didnt want to force users to download an application.
Something that worried us a lot was that our readings just didn't match the spectrophotometer readings. We talked to a professor who worked in optical systems and microfluidics, and he pointed out that the coefficient of absorbance in Beer-Lamberts law is different for every optical system, and so there was no need to worry if the readings were proportional.

GluColi, engineering a biological circuit
For our first participation in the iGEM competition, we aimed at producing a new biological material. Finding a new way to produce a biological and biodegradable glue became our objective. Once we found a way to produce this, it was interesting to think about how we could have this glue produced where it is needed.
We designed a biological circuit composed of three main parts:
Bacteria produciong glue are attracted to the target point to be repaired.
Glue production at the leaking point, the crack or the fracture.
Preventing GluColi proliferation.
Schema of the biological system
Escherichia coli has a natural system of chemotaxis ( Appendix ).
Thanks to its flagella, it can swim towards a local chemical gradient. In order to guide GluColi to its target, we thought that the leaking should use aspartate as we know it is a good chemoattractant for E. coli. As it is a natural system found in E. coli we did not intend to add bricks for chemotaxis.
After that, a certain bacterial density is needed to produce enough glue. We engineered a glue production system controlled by quorum sensing, ( Appendix ). As long as there are not enough bacteria at the target point, glue will not be produced. The quorum sensing mechanism senses the population density and coordinates gene expression. Glue production will be triggered only at high GluColi density.
The suggested circuit relies on a cascade of promoter repression/expression that will result in a positive feedback. Phage and quorum sensing promoter are used.
IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) would permit the transcription of the downstream genes comprising cI434 which codes for a repressor issued from bacteriophage 434.
When  there is no leaking, thus no IPTG, the quorum sensing is OFF because of the promoter placed in front of the genes involved in it. This promoter is a hybrid promoter proposed by last yearís KULeuven team and works as follows : it is repressed by c2 P22,"

Basic Parts
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!
