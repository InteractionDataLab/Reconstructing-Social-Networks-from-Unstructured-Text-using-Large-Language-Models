Eric Holmes
Beware of Eric Holmes, the fearless leader of CUGEM who grew up in the hood.  His disturbing character is immediately evident by his love for dead fish, as his latest kill is proudly displayed on his phone case.  He relentlessly pursues these innocent creatures in the hope of wiping them off the face of the earth.  Some call it fishing.  Watch out for his killer jokes; you may shoot yourself after hearing them ten times. These also usually involve fish.  In addition, he seems to enjoy trekking for days through miles of monotonous forest in order to …end up where he started.  He occasionally drags innocent freshmen along for the ride.  Despite all this, no one can dispute that Eric is a brilliant bioengineer, and so his curious hobbies have gone unquestioned.
Arun Chakravorty
Arun Chakravorty was found on the sandy shores of California, fully grown, in fetal position, borne from the sea foam of the great pacific. No one is sure how Arun came to be, but they have attributed his bubbly personality to the sea foam from whence he came, and his rich color to the sun, which he laid in for many days before he was discovered, giving him a tan that makes pale white girls cringe with jealousy. Arun, after rising from the gold sand on which he was found, then travelled the world, learning invaluable skills like cloning, a Capella, and FIFA. He needed strikers for his exclusively Argentinian FIFA team, so he travelled to Argentina and persuaded two men named Palacio and Milito to train and become world class soccer players. He then realized he could combine his three skills of cloning, singing, and FIFA, and become one of the most unique people to walk the face of the earth. He travelled to Ithaca, New York, and joined Cornell iGEM. Now, Arun spends his days cloning while simultaneously playing"

1. Aim
1. Large qualitative screening of IAA-producing colonies at the same time to see if our constructs are still functional in our E.coli/yeasts.
2. Helps us to pick the right colonies for colony-PCR and GC-MS measurements.
2. Safty
1. Reagent: 2 % 0.5M FeCl3 in 35 % perchloric acid
1. Perchloric acid is highly corrosive and dangerous!! Always uses protective gear and work under a fume hood!
2. Reagent will always be mixed together on the spot, FeCl3 stock solution is finished, acid will be taken from the chemicals sheld from the AG plant physiology (has been negotiated).
3. What happens?
1. Reagent reacts to IAA (and other indolic compounds) to make several colored products.
2. IAA will be seen as bright red (other compounds brown or yellowish).
4. Assay conditions
1. Plates were inoculated in a grid pattern and overlaid with an 82 mm-diameter disk of Nitrocellulose membranes.
2. Plates are overlaid with Nitrocellulose immediately after inoculation with toothpicks. After normal incubation (i.e. overnight) time, the membrane was removed and soaked in reagent (or reagent-saturated [2.5 mL] filter paper, here “Whatman grade 2” had best results), in glass chamber ( danger symbol and written information).
3. After 30 - 60 minutes, coloring reaction is finished and fading began.
4. Best results with colony sizes between 0.5 to 2 mm.
5. Addition of Tryptophan greatly enhances color reaction but does not interfere with distinguishing IAA positive and negative colonies (yellow background and strong red to pink positives).
6. Other indolic compounds (i.e."

Conclusion
In conclusion, we are the first iGEM team to try to autonomously employ the S.T.I.R. protocol.  We made modifications to it through an iterative process.  We believe that the state of the current protocol and reflexive analysis should be employed by all future iGEM teams.  We hope that our journey through S.T.I.R will be able to inspire others to consider new approaches for integrated human practices. By doing so we believe that they will uncover new ways to reflect on the different dimensions of their project, which will help them making more coherent decisions when facing challenging problems through the whole duration of their project.

Evolution
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

If the costs of recurrence, as estimated by Cancer Research UK were taken into account - £16000 for stage 1 and £17000 as the average cost of other stages [19] - the cost per QALY would still only be £8300, and at 39% sensitivity would be £19900 per QALY.
Our modeling therefore proves that our sensor would be cost effective in reducing mortality rates from NSCLC. The same principle on which this model is based could be applied to any cancer to screen those with sufficiently high risk using miRNA biomarkers.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR"

Attempt 5
It was clear now that we needed to get some data that we could use, within a useful range of nitrate concentrations applicable to the conditions faced by agriColi whilst on the soil. To this end we decided to start attempting parallel assays in triplicate, across a much more focused range of concentrations.
Cultures of XL1-Blue cells plus the BBa_K216009 biobrick were grown in the at 0mM, 0.4mM, 0.8mM, 1.2mM, 1.6mM and 2.0mM [KNO3]. Three separate groups were assayed, and all cultures were grown in the presence of IPTG, Ampicillin and Tetracyclin.

As you can clearly see the results shown are somewhat erratic and no clear correlation is observed. This is due to a slip during the procedure where the cells were not properly vortexed to cause sufficient cell lysis and subsequent release of the β-galactosidase into the cell lysate. Attempt 6 would be the final β-galactosidase assay attempt.
Attempt 6 (Final)
The final attempt was set up in exactly the same way as the fifth attempt: Cultures of XL1-Blue cells plus the BBa_K216009 biobrick were grown in the at 0mM, 0.4mM, 0.8mM, 1.2mM, 1.6mM and 2.0mM [KNO3].

There is currently a lot of stigma around and distrust of genetically modified foods. As a result, we wanted to focus on creating a genetically modified organism that would serve as a probiotic treatment for banana plants.
Our initial steps will involve making plasmid designs for E. coli (as E. coli will the the initial chassis used for proof of concept). Our E. coli must be able to sense F. oxysporum. Upon presence, the bacteria should produce the antifungal TLP and there should be a mechanism for the TLP to be able to interact with the fungus. In addition, the E. coli must also be able to survive in the conditions that result from the presence of the fungus. In summary, the basic components of our circuit are a F. oxysporum sensing system, a fungal killing mechanism, and a chassis survival mechanism.
We wanted to find a way to uniquely sense F. oxysporum, such that a response is only triggered in its presence. We found that F. oxysporum produces fusaric acid, a small weakly acidic (pKa 1.1) mycotoxin and phytotoxin that is able to diffuse across the cellular membrane. Fusaric acid contributes to the virulence of the fungus. It causes super polarization, suppressed H+ pumping, and K+ leakage in plant cells. It also reduces oxygen absorption by mitochondria and causes malic acid oxidation. Downstream effects include the creation of reactive oxygen species and changes in membrane polarity and permeability .  Fusaric acid is also toxic to several bacterial species, including E. coli, posing a possible issue for testing that we addressed later on.
Different bacterial species have shown unique sensitivities to fusaric acid. Some organisms that are resistant to the compound are able to produce efflux pumps in its presence. These include Pseudomonas putida and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which both incorporate an efflux system that is repressed when there is an absence of fusaric acid. Our initial plans were to design a plasmid with TLP regulated by a promoter that was repressed by these fusaric acid-sensitive repressors. However, the operators have not yet been identified, making it difficult to adjust the system to E. coli.
Fusaric acid has also been shown to suppress the production of an antimicrobial compound, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens.  In this system, fusaric acid is able"

Proof of concept
To prove our concept that See our final results here!
(1) We can make the bacteria sense the plasmid numbers.
(2) The in-promoter will respond differently to different signal which can reflect the plasmids losing on different levels. This way, our system can  control the plasmids numbers above a threshold.
We designed two parts. One of them is to prove that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration. The other one is to prove the inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene by affecting its in-promoter.
Plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration
Because of the difficulty of controlling the number of plasmids, we can only choose some typical copy numbers of plasmids in our system.
The number of the copy numbers are shown in the table below:
We also constructed the gene circuits containing constitutive promoters with different strengths to express the inhibitor. By this we regulate the threshold of plasmids number to meet different needs.
There are four promoters with different strengths and two kinds of RBS we have choose:
Meanwhile, the RFP used to replace the inhibitor protein can directly represent the concentration of the inhibitor in the cell. We separately constructed there circuits on different vectors which have different copy numbers.
At first, we use the modeling to explain the relationship of the concentration of the inhibitor and plasmids number like the curve below under a certain condition
And then after passing a period of time, we will measure the RFP intensity to get the data which can describe the relationship between the inhibitor concentration and the plasmid copy numbers.
This way, we verified that plasmid numbers will influence the inhibitor concentration under on the plasmid vector.
The inhibitor concentration can regulate the expression of the killer gene
In order to know the relationship of the inhibitor and in-promoter, we use the arabinose induced promoter PBAD to express the inhibitor. So we can add arabinose with different concentrations to induce the promoter providing an environment with different concentrations of intracellular inhibitor. Kill gene is replaced by RFP to stand the in-promoter’s status.
We built three devices containing different kinds of inhibitors. The gene circuits are shown in Fig.4.
Meanwhile, we designed three corresponding in-promoter circuits in Fig.5.

Binding distances

Small tweaks to make the simulation more realistic, this included incorporating a spherical binding site at the end of each path. If these overlap, the toehold and trigger will bind.
Another major part of this week was getting to grips with our toehold creating software, NUPACK. This took us a significant amount of time. First we attempted to install the source code, which was quickly abandoned in favour of using the online tools. Our next task was to learn NUPACK’s input, a series of paired and unpaired bases. This allowed us to make the secondary structure we needed and hence generate the optimal sequence.  Once the modelling team had familiarised themselves with the software, they passed their knowledge on to lab team, who picked it up very swiftly and quickly began making toeholds.
As we progressed with our research we asked Dr Nic Harmer advice on what the molecules would do at the edge of the tube. He told us that we could get low affinity binding tubes to negate our worries about modelling this aspect as it would almost entirely negate the sticking.
Week 07/07 - 13/07
We finally achieved a full working script with basic confinement, delay, joining and splitting! This was after extensive work on confinement of the system to a cylinder of volume equal to an eppendorf tube - as recommended by the lab team. If a point was deemed to fall outside of the boundary it was placed back to the edge of the cylinder, a basic assumption that will hopefully be improved with trajectories added later as a separate function.
On Friday we had a meeting with Jonathan Fieldsend to showcase our model and get advice on its improvement. He suggested:
Improvement of our model through vectorisation (an optimisation technique), generating time steps in real time, and more accurate confinement into a compound cylinder cone shape.
Statistical modelling on numerical data and getting the model ready to handle data from the lab team in order to shape our project.
Thinking about the variation of parameters and how best to implement this in order to best describe the real world system.
Week 14/07 - 20/07
We started to try and implement the alterations suggested by Jonathan which started with putting pen to paper in order to outline the basic structure of the new code.
In order to translate this to our code we first worked on breaking the code into smaller chunks based on the action they performed i.e. plotting or coordinate generation. These chunks were then turned into individual functions. This took up a considerable portion of our time and has changed numerous times along the way"

For the Education engagement, we have chosen to go to meet children for sensibilizing them to the beauty                         of Sciences. Hence, on a day of September we went to an Elementary school of Bordeaux to tell a class                         of eight years old children about DNA. It took place in an whole afternoon.
In the first period we did a little intervention at the board about what is biology and what is considered as « life ». They                         had trouble to consider microorganisms and plants as living organisms so the aim was to guide them                         and popularize the words so they could understand the concepts better. We also told them about organs,                         cells, DNA how they are linked and what makes them unique.
In a second time, we organized a little workshop to make doing a little experience with a DNA extraction of banana according                         to the following protocol:
First, the banana was mashed (half of banana is enough) so we mechanically broke the cells
Then we put one spoon of salt and three of detergent (washing-up liquid), so it dissolves the                                 lipids and plasmic membrane
In a third time, we put five spoons of water to make the DNA cells dissolved themselves
Finally, we just filtered the mix, kept the filtrate and added a bit of methylated spirits. The                                 two liquids would not mix and the DNA compacted itself and to become clearly visible.
The experiment worked well and the children were glad to do something and to see a result.
To conclude the session we chose to tell them about the DNA code. To do that we organized a color game                         where each color was corresponding to one amino acid base: red for A, blue for C, green for T, and                         yellow for G. They had to identify their eyes and hair color and to translate that into the DNA language                         Through all the afternoon we noticed that the children were very receptive to our intervention as                         they had a lot of questions.
They wanted to know everything about about science and they were curious about us and what we know. It                         was a really interesting experience for them and for us. The teachers were also very happy about                         the afternoon and they invited us to come"

Overview on Caulobacter Crescentus
Caulobacter crescentus is a kind of bacteria with many necessity for our project: C.crescentus has a special life cycle, including swarmed period when C.crescentus possesses flagellum in one pole and stalked period when they cut up flagellum and develop an extremely strong polar adhesive envelope structure known as the holdfast which is composed of protein and polysaccharide. According to the research, when a holdfast clings to a surface, the force on it reaches 68 N/mm2 high, which is regarded as the strongest biological glue known to exist in nature and is three times stronger as commercial 'super glue'. With the knowledge we have already known, if we are able to regulate the biosynthesis of flagellum and holdfast simultaneously with flourescent proteins controlled by light input, C.crescentus will stop swimming, develop holdfast to stay firmly and evenly on the plate while expressing flourescent proteins corresponding to light color simulation.
Fig.1 Measurement of the size of holdfast of C.crescentus by AFM.(PNAS 2006,103-15)
In order to realize the blueprint of our design, we have these works to do as following:
Figure out the exact proteins regulating the biosynthesis of flagellum and holdfast or keeping bacteria staying in a relatively narrow place and then construct a circuit which contains controlling proteins triggered or inhibited by light signal.
Discover some methods to transfer accomplished light sensing-imaging systems working in E. coli into C.crescentus.
Confirm the exact nutrition conditions for an even C.crescentus biofilm genesis with modeling work and lab tests.
Here, we are attempting to introduce the whole view of this amazing bacteria for you to better understande our project and its specialty.

The team then analyzed the results of the clean-up using the Nanodrop. When the Nanodrop confirmed the presence of DNA, the team created a Master Mix and ran PCR on the CsgA DNA. Upon the completion of the PCR, the products were purified using a purification protocol.

Methods
The research on ethical issues in synthetic biology has been done in parallel with the project on the bacterial relay race, and consists out of two main parts:
Literature research
Survey
The ethical research was initially based on the work of the TUDelft iGEM team 2008 . The main reason to focus on reductionism and the notions of life was due to its interesting complexity, the lack of literature on this subject linked to synthetic biology, and the talk of Dr. Caplan from the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. The possibility of doing a survey amongst a large group of people involved in synthetic biology seemed a great opportunity to raise the awareness of these complex ethical issues and to gain insight on how the synthetic biology community responds to them.
Literature research
Our approach was to outline the main ethical concerns that appear in scientific literature on synthetic biology. The next step was to investigate these issues and make an overview of the responsibilities of researchers in the field. After categorizing the issues, a choice had to be made on which subject to focus on. Since there are a lot of different issues with distinct implications and consequences, we decided to target the ethical issues concerning life (see background information ). With both deep philospophical meanings of life but also the science-driven changes of our perception of life, this would be a complex subject to tackle.
Survey
The aim of this project was not so much to find solutions to the ethical problems involved in notions of life, but rather to raise awareness on this particular subject, as well as gaining insight in the perception of the iGEM community, a large stakeholder in synthetic biology. For that reason we decided to conduct a survey amongst iGEM participants, supervisors and advisors.
Sample
Soon after the decision was made, a short e-mail was send to all the primary supervisors of the in iGEM participating teams to see if they would be interested in participating in the survey and whether they (or a different team member) would be willing to distribute the survey amongst the team"

* DNA denaturation can be performed at 98℃ because of the high thermal stability of the Q5 polymerase
** A PCR takes 20-30 seconds to extend a sequence by 1kb, and since our longest sequence is ~2kb the extension time was determined to be 60s per cycle.
Gel Electrophoresis of PCR-Amplified gBlocks
An agarose gel was prepared according to the agarose prepartion protocol.
DNA preparation:
The contents of the PCR tubes need to be stained with a loading dye to help visualize its migration.
To each 25µl of content in each PCR tube, 10µl of blue loading dye was added.
Day 2
Gel Electrophoresis of PCR-Amplified gBlocks (continued from 22/06)
Lane 1: 10µl of 2-Log Ladder
Lanes 2-15: 20µl of DNA and loading dye mixture prepared on 22/06
A potential difference of 120V was applied across the electrodes (the higher the voltage, the faster the gel will run but the poor the separation will be; DNA separation is typically done in the 120-140V range) for 80 minutes. As long as DNA has passed ⅔ of the column or purple dye have passed purple area of the gel, the gel is ready to get into the EtBr.
The gel was then stained and the bands were visualized.
Results
PCR Results
The 7 bands corresponding to expected DNA sizes were excised using a razor blade for cleaning and extraction. The other sequences, along with J which only showed a very weak band, will be re-PCRed under modified conditions at a later date.
The excised gel chunks were transferred to centrifugation tubes.
Extraction of DNA (PCR product) from Agarose Gel
The extraction was performed using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit made by Omega Biotek, according to the Spin Protocol.
The excised agarose chunks needed to be dissolved in a minimum of 1mL of XP2 Binding Buffer per gram of gel. The heaviest chunk of gel weighed 0.16g and as such 160µl of buffer was added to each tube.
* As the tubes were spun with their lids open, they were placed such that lids pointed away from the direction of spinning.

In this spirit, we hosted an inspiring public lecture by Kevin Esvelt, went to TEDx Heidelberg and engaged with the people via our game “evolutionary wheel-of-fortune” and our “Synthetic Biology Wishing Box”. Finally, we created an animated video, explaining evolution and our project in a broadly comprehensible way.
Public Engagement
Responsibility
Developing and improving powerful and high impact techniques in the field of directed evolution requires responsible scientists. To encounter ethical concerns and ensure that our project is not endangering the environment or humanity we thoroughly confronted ourselves and experts with critical questions according our iGEM project.
Responsible Science
Human Practices - Gold Medal Criteria

13/08/2015
Since the colony PCR of Wednesday(12/08) hadn’t worked, we retried to see if results could be obtained today. The PCR parameters were changed to the following:
14/08/2015
We made cryo stocks of the following overnight cultures:
pSB4K5_CsgBC_L/M/H_EFG (Top 10 cells)
pSB1C3_CsgEFG  (Top 10 cells)
pSB1C3_CsgA_His/””  (ΔCsgA)
We repeated the colony PCR of 13/08 for CsgC_L/M/H_EFG to see if clear bands were present. The results were inconclusive since the difference between the in- and correct inserts is too small to see. We decided to send the plasmids for sequencing.
CsgA_I13504  and Spycatcher_His were successfully inserted.
For the CR assay we used cells transformed (11/08), which had been grown overnight, and then placed in the fridge (4°C). The strains were pSB4K5_CsgA , I3504 (- control), and CsgA_IPTG (+ control)  in CsgA deficient strains (ΔCsgA).
The bacteria were streaked out on the plates made (11/08). The pSB4K5_CsgA was plated on the plates with different concentrations of rhamnose (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1%) in total 5 plates. The – control was plated on a plate with no rhamnose. The + control was plated on plate with IPTG. The plates were left in the stove at 30°C for 60 hours.
17/08/2015
The plates were checked after growth. All the pSB4K5_CsgA colonies on the CR plates were red. The + control was red as well. The positive control colonies plated on the 0% rhamnose were white. The negative control was reddish with the negative strain.
The bands of CsgBC_high of 13/08 were too high. The Colony PCR pSB4K5_CsgBCEFG was repeated on 16 colonies of the plate 12/08. The colonies were also dipped in 50µL LB with KAN. After running the samples on a agarose gel, when viewed above a UV-l"
RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Project Description_-_-_TEXT.html," sufficient training and efficient surveillance will be a time bomb for which we do know that monstrous harmful bioproducts will be made someday in the future, and indeed, it will be a significant threat to the current biosafety basis. Recall our memory to iGEM2009, Peking surveyed DIY bio, almost ten years later, we conducted a similar DIY bio-survey. We tried to order materials for molecular experiments, using the delivery address to our home, and the result was quite shocking that we can buy almost everything for the molecular experiment, from the internet. Then, we went through relevant laws and regulations throughout the world, in which we found no laws related to credit certification and the address certification about the people who book the biology reagent. Most of the laws are about the quality certification and how they would serve the user after they bought this. We interviewed the Director of a center for disease control and prevention. He said that in his experiment with the disease caused by the bacteria leak, vast impacts such as environmental pollution had been observed. and our country has been making great effort towards elimenating such leakage accidents and incidents. He said it is not easy to solve the problem with hard work, rather it needs the cooperation between all the countries. He made an example of 731 army during the second world war two, in which the outbreak of pathogens caused significant physical and social harm. We are still on our way to win the battle, and the effort still needs to be put in.
Community and Future
Also, we hosted two major meeting in Beijing. In a biosafety forum in October, we invited a team leader who runs his high school lab, lab teachers from a university lab, and a former team member from Peking iGEM2009, who participated in their DIY bio investigation ten years ago.
We concluded that the development of DIY bio should be taken seriously, and the permanent way to solve its safety and security concerns is through implanting biosafety awareness into our academic culture. Also, as iGEMers, we should strive to be the considerate and responsible leaders in our community, to ensure the biosafety issue has been taken properly. Another meeting was with biology Olympians all over China, in which we discussed the future of biology community during the meeting, especially with more and more high school iGEM teams coming up in China contrasted with the lack of relevant instruction and education to the students. We came up with the idea of setting up a collaboration between schools to share and overcome difficulties hand in hand. This kind of meeting will be continued after iGEM2018, since the community usually"

We continued to work on the presentation for the Center for Science and the Schools. We made preparations to attempt our first homologous recombination to insert the dCas9 system into the genome.
The great miniprep adventure of summer 2014! All five GFPs re-cloned, and all of the five variant GFPs had colonies on their respective plates. The decision was made to pick six (6) colonies from each plate and prepare them for plasmid harvest.  These thirty (30) samples were picked, minipreped, and streaked so that they could be saved for future analysis if needed. All of the samples had acceptable concentrations after plasmid harvest, so each sample was digested with Xma1 and Sac1 to see if the correct bands would appear when run on a gel. The samples that showed the bands in the correct part of the ladder were selected to be sent for sequencing in the upcoming week.
Week 10
Monday, July 21 - Sunday, July 27
- Notebook Entries
Before Ashlee and Emily left on vacations, they plasmid prepped eight plasmids containing dCas9.  These and three CBA colonies were sent for sequencing.  The team had a meeting with Dr. Richard to discuss some upcoming dates and to get feedback on the progress of our projects.
More results of cloning sent for sequencing. Unfortunately it appears that the R2 sequencing primer is bad (probably too much secondary structure, as it was erroneously designed to anneal within the terminator) and if so, this is the source of a lot of our headaches. Developed a presentation for SCIENCE U, an interactive presentation to give to high schoolers at a science camp  at PSU.
Week 11
Monday, July 28 - Sunday, August 3
- Notebook Entries
After returning from vacation, Ashlee and Emily checked the sequencing results.  Only one colony from the ligation (termed ""L6"") had dCas9 inserted in the plasmid.  No other colonies were found to have the proper sequencing.  L6 is now the most important plasmid we have!  More digestions and transformations were done to keep the flow of the project moving well.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Experiments#Protocols_-_-_TEXT.html," A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 µL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow.
Optional: Use this step only when DNA fragment is <500 bp or >10 kb long.
If the DNA fragment is <500 bp, add 1:2 volume of 100 % isopropanol to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.
If the DNA fragment is >10 kb, add 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.
Binding of DNA
Transfer up to 800 µL of the solubilized gel solution (from step 3/4) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge 1 min at 11,000 x g. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube. Note: If the total volume exceeds 800 µL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After each application, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard the flow through after each spin. Repeat until the entire volume has been applied to the column membrane. Do not exceed 1 g of total agarose gel slice per column.
Add 100 µL of Binding Buffer to the GeneJet purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Washing
Add 700 µL of Wash Buffer to the GeneJet purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube. (We altered the protocol to to wash steps a 350 µL optional)
Centrifuge the empty GeneJet purification column for an additional 1 min to completely remove residual wash buffer
Elution
Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the center of the purification column membrane. Centrifuge for 1 minute. Note: for low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 µL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 µL are not recommended. If DNA fragment is >10 kb, preheat Elution Buffer to 65 °C before applying to column. If the elution volume is 10 µL and"

The university biology summer camp
The ideas of younger biological researchers are also one of our considerations.We held a lecture to the students attending our biology summer camp BIOS together with another team from our university Fudan. We felt a lot of passion and energy during the communication. Here are the pictures showing students listening to the speaker carefully.
A primary school in Anhui province, China
Ideas from future  potential researchers should also be valued.During the summer holiday, One of our team members went to teach several biology classes in a primary school in Huoqiu, Anhui province. The lessons involve creative ideas he got in his iGEM experience.Children are quick acceptors of the idea of synthetic biology. Most of them are thrilled at the pictures of giving different functions to the tiny bacteria in a way that highly resembles playing with brick toys. The picture here documented the moment the student looking curiously at the result of the experiment.
As a active participant of  iGEM conferences
our team is an active participant of iGEM conferences. We get inspiration, friendship and precious memory from these conferences.
2017 5.19-5.21 BUDS
At the the initiate of our team, we attend the conference named BUDS held by Nanjing university, where we talked about the problems we may face when building up an iGEM team. These talks proved to be very useful in the following long course of the competition.
2017 7.30-8.3 the 5th Asia-pacific iGEM conference
Not long after we have started the main part of our experiment, we attend the 5th Asian-pacific iGEM conference held by NCTU, where we talked about our struggling with the experiment result with all the other teams. It is during the presentation on this conference that we have the idea to look into the problem of how to make a good presentation.
2017 8.19 FABO Open Night
Among all the conferences, this one is the most unique one. Instead of sitting inside a conference room, we talked about our project outside in an open square. The audience includes both iGEMers and local residents, making it full of surprise and fun.
2017 8.27-8.31 CCiC
The CCiC held by FAFU gave us an opportunity to show our project in an mature and completed way. We brought our brick toy to the conference, had it tested and got the feedbacks. We met the team from Peking university, who also focuses on recombin"

We also drafted a detailed description of experiments that can be performed with e-SAM© system as well as suggestions for customers. The one-to-one match between e-SAM© system and the biology parts are shown below.
Based on this year’s igem project, self-screening for advantageous mutants, we designed the first electronic model for synthetic biology.
Figure 1. basic design of SAM model
In our parts, target genes interposed in MCS can co-express the following growth factor via the TGATG linkage. This logical circuit is devised to represent the control relationship between genes.
Figure 2. a circuit diagram for e-SAM© system
Then, we opened a DIY class for high school students and successfully mocked up the first type of e-SAM model.
Figure 3. e-SAM© physical model
With the help of e-SAM system, we can demonstrate gene-expression with modifying the switches.
Visit and feedback from high school teachers
In September, the team welcomed students from several high schools nearby and freshers in BNU, who had interests in biology and the willing to introduce our model to their friends. A few days later we received encouraging students’ responses from SanFan and other departments of BNU, who gave a high appraisal to our engineering model and told us to provide them with a more detailed proposal as soon as we would have it ready.
As a result, in October, several high school teachers from SanFan came to BNU to meet with our team to discuss the possible integration of our e-SAM system in their high school's biology curriculum. We provided them a live demonstration of how the e-SAM system works and we discussed the impact it would have on the high school courses of normal students heatedly. The teachers responded to us that one of the most disturbing questions about science curriculum was the lack of facilities. Many essential science instruments such as centrifuge can be too dangerous and too expensive for high school provide. They e-SAM system can make great contribution at teaching-cost reduction, worthy to spread across high school education.

BC Property Testing
Overview
After the experiments above, we processed the bacterial cellulose film formed by the co-culture of the modified E. coli and G.xylinus, we would like to know whether this culture method of mixed bacteria will change the microstructure of BC? Therefore, we observed the morphological characteristics of the bacterial cellulose produced by the co-culture of the bacteria by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and atomic force. The results are as below: :
1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
We first used a scanning electron microscope to observe the formation of bacterial cellulose samples under different electric field strength. The results are shown in the figure
The microstructure, fiber detail and fiber width of the bacterial cellulose samples can be analyzed by scanning electron microscopy after freeze-drying. We found no significant difference between them.
2.Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can help us understand the chemical structure of cellulose. Bacterial cellulose has an absorption peak for a particular wavelength of infrared, so that the composition of its chemical group can be analyzed.
Respectively, we analyzed BC film under the two conditions after the natural drying by the infrared spectrum scan, the results shown in Figure. The absorption peak at about 1060 cm-1 reflects the vibration of the C-O-C group, which is the characteristic absorption peak of the cellulose. The absorption peak at 1428 cm-1 is caused by the bending vibration of the C-H bond, and the depth is related to the crystallinity of the cellulose. Although the infrared spectrum is a simple method, it can only give a relative value, it can show whether is a crystalline phase or non-crystalline phase at one time. It can be seen that the BC film produced under these two conditions are not much different in the composition of the structure.

A good rule for rocket experimenters to follow is this: always assume that it will explode. The vehicle explodes, literally explodes, off the pad. The simulator shakes you a little bit, but the actual liftoff shakes your entire body and soul.
Even deeper

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," first observation we can make is that two main conformations of the tags came out of the simulations : it could either fold along the side of Csga image accolée ending with its extremity toward the N-terminus side of the protein or, on the contrary, remain ""floating"" away from the protein like a flag image flottante. For His2-tag, we were worried that when the first motif folded against CsgA the second motif might end up blocking the side of the protein supposedly involved in the CsgA polymerisation according to litterature. However, in none of the simulation did it happen, the second motif always ended up folding in another direction.
However aside from this there was no way to discriminate which conformation was more likely than the other. To validate one model or the other, we could only rely on two hypotheses:
since its end get near the polymerisation site, the folded conformation may hinder a little the curli formation, hence a comparison of curli production between tagged and wildtype-producing E.coli may give a hint to the right conformation;
according to litterature publi modmol, a His-tag chelates nickel by folding around it so that two Histidines may form a bond with one nickel. If the tag is folded against CsgA, not only would it have less ""reach"" than a floating one, but also it would be less able to fold over nickel ions. Hence, if the folded state is the prefered one, nickel chelation shouldn't be too high.
The results of the wetlab however, showed no particular decrease in curli formation between tagged and wildtype-producing E.colilien vers les résultats biofilms, and added to this, the nickel chelation seemed greater with the tags than without it, although the difference was hard to catch since CsgA wildtype is already able to chelate nickel lien vers nichelation.
Inbetween beta-sheets
The simulations with a tag on a loop between two beta strands showed a tendency to slighltly modify the structure of the beta sheets around the tagimage sybyl, but we cannot say whether it would be enough to influence any of the curli properties. What can be said however is that it doesn't seem to have any other conformation than a floating loop between the original amino acids of the protein on which it's been hooked. We can also question the usefulness of such a construct for our project since it has neither the reach nor the rotation freedom of the floating C-terminus tag. It might be interesting for futures teams that would want to"

Abstract
Plug 'n' Play with DNA: a novel assembly system
The DTU-Denmark 2 team is designing a novel standardized assembly system, called ""Plug 'n' Play with DNA"", where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. Our goal is to create a new assembly standard of biological parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, which can be directly mixed with a vector. This will make synthetic biology faster and assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergillus nidulans ready to plug 'n' play. The simple and easy use of this new assembly system has been demonstrated by developing a reporter system for mammalian cell lines as well as for A. nidulans. This novel assembly system represents an improvement of the conventional Standard Assembly of BioBricks, which has its limits when creating eukaryotic biobricks.

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," IM administration, an initial dose of 96 billion vectors is used followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.
The downside of this method is the requirement for constant microdosing. Repeated injections would cause noticeable damage to the veins. The athlete would then be required to disguise the injection sites or perform the IV microdosing in parts of the body normally covered. For this reason athletes would likely favor IM injection to IV injection as IM is less invasive.
Figure 24. Concentration of EPO gene doping DNA in the blood during IM microdosing with an initial dose is 96 billion vectors followed by smaller doses of 27 billion vectors every 20 days.
Though the microdoses are smaller, the copies of DNA stay above our detection limit (40,000 to 50,000 fragments per mL) due to IM injections occuring every 20 days. While the athlete would bypass detection through the biological passport, they would be detected by our gene doping detection method.

To determine the quantity of EPO gene plasmids to be injected, the effect of the steady state concentration of EPO on the steady state red blood cell count is determined. This is achieved by removing the feedback loop that causes the red blood cell count to have an effect on EPO production. EPO concentration can then be set at a desired level and the PDEs used to model the system can be reduced to solvable interconnected ODEs. The resulting equations are shown below, where \(EPO_{SS}\) is the set steady state EPO concentration in the blood.

End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono, and Schering-Plough.
In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and 2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with many unsolved questions, possibly amendable via chemical biology.

SHSU_China,2018,Team:SHSU China#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," existing knowledge or opinion on the topic of artificial blood and helps us better educate and engage. We released an online survey which received over 500 responses from people of diverse background. (Refer to Human Practice page for details.)
From these responses, we analyzed the statistics and made the following conclusions:
1.Most people have never heard of artificial blood, so it is our responsibility to introduce it to the general public.
2.The majority of people support the development of artificial blood, which means that our project is supported by most people.
3.People think artificial blood should not only have the same functions that natural blood has, but also should be able to help people fight diseases.
4.Most people believe that artificial blood can be used for medical purposes, and about one third of people believe that it can be used to improve athletic performance.
5.Most people believe that artificial blood can be used for medical purposes, and about one third of people believe that it can be used to improve athletic performance.
6.People are most concerned about the safety of natural blood; they also think the limited supply of natural blood is a problem. If we develop artificial blood, we would aim to solve these problems.
7.Currently, the majority of people more readily accept natural blood than artificial blood, or have no preference between the two. We aim to help people relieve their mental barriers, so that more of them can accept artificial blood.
8.People who prefer natural blood are mainly concerned about the quality and safety of artificial blood. We can address these problems in our presentations to tackle their concerns.
Interviews with Experts.
Interviewing the experts enabled us to see how the professionals view our research and the topic of artificial blood, but most importantly, the interviews helped us gain a deeper understanding of our project and better educate the public. (Refer to Human Practice page for details.)
We interviewed six professionals involved in fields related to artificial blood, from cardiologist and head of hematology department to investor of various biomedical companies. The six experts shared and expressed several common ideas:
1.Hospitals are running out of blood.
2.Hospitals need artificial blood for transfusions in surgeries.
3.It is very difficult to create artificial blood cells.
4.It is important that oxygen carriers do not generate immunoreactions.
5.If the only function of artificial red blood cells is to carry oxygen, then the target consumers can only be people with specific blood diseases and athletes.

This kind of effective leadership ensures  lab resources are efficiently allocated towards a common direction. Principled guidance is also  instrumental in maintaining a productive working atmosphere. In order to cultivate such an  environment, effective managers promote a culture of accountability and encourage supportive,  colloquial interactions between staff members.
Workspace and Equipment
Due to the US manufacturing decline over the past several decades obtaining a physical  laboratory workspace is not terribly difficult or expensive. Most synthetic biology DIY labs rent raw,  warehouse, or industrial space. This is commonplace because most reagent providers will not ship to  home addresses due to federal regulations imposed on their operations. Obtaining workspace divorced  from residential areas is also a good idea because DIY synthetic biology takes up a significant amount  of space. Bacteria must have counter space to grow in a petri dish, plants time to germinate and grow in  a greenhouse, and lab bench space is needed to mix reagents and perform extracting and inserting  procedures.  In addition to the requisite space, synthetic biology also requires substantial analytical  equipment. The immense expense associated with instruments like a PCR thermocycler (DNA amplifier), autoclave sterilizer, electrophoretic separator, optical devices, and microscopes were some of the greatest initial barriers to DIY synthetic biology projects. Over the last decade, prices of these machines have fallen dramatically while existing machines have become more rapidly outdated.These effects mean outfitting a lab is much cheaper and less time consuming than in previous years.
Today, obtaining basis biology lab equipment costs a few thousand dollars on eBay and can be  assembled in a short time.1 Additionally, online shopping gives DIY synthetic biologists access to a global marketplace of enzyme and chemical reagent suppliers. Alternatively, Corey Tobin's group, LA Biohackers, equipped itself through more conventional methods. The group collected donations to purchase old equipment at auction from local universities.  These acquisitions were bolstered by successful dumpster diving ventures which produced two thermal  cyclers from behind the University of California, Los Angeles, and DNA sequencer cast aside by the  University of California, Santa Cruz. Furthermore, people readily build their own equipment using  specification and fabrication instructions posted online. BioCurious a DIY Biology Lab based in  Sunnyvale, CA, for example, engineering a bio-printer from scratch.2 The group transformed an old  inkjet printer and motors scavenged from CD drives into a printer capable of extruding bacteria into any desirable configuration.

We considered laws currently in place in Australia surrounding the application of our biosensor. This is crucial when developing a product, as it must comply to regulations before it can be implemented. It was found that our biosensor doesn’t fit directly into a box, and so there is room to use our device to drive legislation change surrounding synthetic biology technology.
Environment & sustainability
One of the obvious concerns when we first settled on the sticker design was waste. Consumers eat fruit and throw stickers in the bin, or stick them somewhere they shouldn’t be. By mass-producing even more packaging in this way, we are perpetuating the issue of landfill and pollution.
In conjunction with discussions we had with OzHarvest volunteers, it was agreed that the way to overcome this problem was to ensure our stickers are biodegradable.
Social Justice
Our interaction with OzHarvest, a non-for-profit organisation, was extremely influential in the design selection of our product, as they emphasised the importance of biodegradability. Engagement in this way also provided more depth in our outreach efforts, because we were engaging with an audience already educated in the issue of food wastage.
Theory of Knowledge
This aspect of our human practices was somewhat unplanned. It came about following a discussion about our amilCP mutants, and how they should be classified. These mutants have identical sequences as the wild type, with the exception of a single nucleotide. However, they are all vastly different colours.
Is it appropriate to refer to them as amilCP variants, when amilCP is by definition blue? Or does a single mutation make them their own entity? If so, is it incorrect to class these mutants as “improvements” of the wild type?
Survey
We conducted a survey on fresh produce consumption habits to gain an insight into the context of our project firsthand. We engaged with over 260 people from over 16 countries – at least one from every continent (except Antarctica"

At this temperature the pCP20 can be replicated. The pCP20 plasmid contains Amp and Cm resistance markers, a thermoinducible Flp recombinase expression system and a heat-sensitive replication origin. The permissive temperatures for the pCP20 propagation are the same as <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo>.
Inoculate a single colony in 5 ml of LB without antibiotic and incubate the culture at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight. At this temperature the pCP20 helper cannot be replicated and the Flp recombinase is expressed by the remaining copies of the helper. The bacteria should loose the R6K origin and the Cm resistance upon FRT sites recombination, mediated by Flp.
Streak the culture on a LB plate and incubate it at 43°C overnight to ensure the loss of the helper plasmid. The bacteria that form colonies should be without the pCP20 helper plasmid.
Validate the loss of the helper plasmid by inoculating colonies in Amp (at 100 ug/ml) media and validate the loss of the Cm resistance from the genome by inoculating colonies in Cm (at 12.5 ug/ml) media. Validate the correct length of the integrated part without Cm resistance and R6K origin by performing colony PCR with primers P1/P4 (which amplify the entire Phi80 locus) and VF2/VR (which amplify the integrated part). Validate the phenotype (when possible).
Colony PCR: a single colony or 1 ul of culture was added to the Invitrogen Platinum Taq reaction mix and was heated at 94°C for 10 min. Then it was assayed with this cycle (X 35): 94°C 30 sec, 60°C (for VF2/VR) or 63°C (for the other primers) 30 sec, 72°C according to the amplicon expected length (1Kb/min).

BioLector
Preparation
Make a plate design specifying which strains will be in each of the wells in your BioLector plate. It’s highly recommended to run all strains in duplicates. The following controls should be included: strain used for transformation, strains expressing the GFP and/or RFP that will be measured in the other wells.
Make overnight cultures of the strains you want to run in the BioLector.
Materials
Growth media (LB)
Overnight cultures
Adhesive Gas Permeable Seal
Adhesive Seal for Evaporation Reduction for 48-well plates
Procedure
Measure OD of the overnight cultures.
Dilute the overnight cultures down to an OD of 0.05.
Add 1.5 mL of diluted culture to each of the 48 wells.
Apply the Adhesive Gas Permeable Seal to the plate and make sure it is stuck on tightly. The seal must be put on precisely, as putting it on crookedly will result in some of the wells not being fully covered.
Apply the Adhesive Seal for Evaporation Reduction on top of the Gas Permeable Seal.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Entrepreneurship
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an award for entrepreneurship.
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award , you must fill out this page.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!"

Whoa whoa whoa. Deciding which part of the pUC18 plasmid is a little tricky. If you've followed this email so far, the first thing to do is to get started on the biobrick-plasmid primers (since we've given those sequences to you). If anyone is physically at Genspace in the next few days, maybe they can design the pUC18-specificprimers with the help of an advisor. If you feel comfortable to give it a shot, by all means, please do.
The primers we need then:
3 primers that flank the 5' end of the gene trio:
- one that uses biobrick sequence
- one that uses biobrick sequence and incorporates the T7 promoter
- one that uses pUC18 sequence
2 primers that flank the 3' end of the gene trio:
- one that uses biobrick sequence
- one that uses pUC18 sequence
4 primers that bridge the 2 gaps between the three genes.
Thus, 9 total primers.
Now, the order of the genes probably doesn't matter much. To facilitate comparison, let's all use the order in which the genes are situated on the following sequence (I will share in a minute). Our cloning team's plan is for EACH MEMBER to take a stab at designing these primers. At the very least, design the forward primers if the whole ""reverse complement"" thing is confusing (which it is). The more members we have designing theprimers, the more likely our consensus sequence will be accurate. Also, the advisors shouldn't be generating all the DNA sequences - this is your opportunity to take the reins with cutting-edge molecular cloning!
Our goal is to have these sequences ordered by Monday. Please take an hour this weekend to sit down with the different sequences and design some primers. Send out the sequences to the group, and maybe add a small bit of rationale about why you chose the sequences you did (or we can discuss this at Genspace).
And, viola! Now we all can design these primer sequences! The sooner the better, so we can get them synthesized and sent out to us. I know I tend to send out long, wordy emails, so I apologize for the extreme length. There's a lot of information here; I hope you can understand and use it. If you don't understand, and have a question, by all means! Email me! I'm happy to clarify as best I can"

Reporter System
Overview
Designing a real-time, high throughput and efficient reporter system to analyse RNA base editing in cells.
A significant roadblock in optimising base editing technologies and also their widespread use in different cell types is the lack of an efficient and real-time reporter system to analyse and quantify such editing assays. One potential way of overcoming this is to use a fluorescence protein as a reporter molecule for such assays. Fluorescence molecules are powerful as they can be easily tracked and visualised using fluorescence microscopy or via flow cytometry.
Compared to nucleic acid sequencing, this proposed reporter molecule can provide a real-time read for any editing assay. Therefore, we designed and constructed a real-time fluorescence reporter system for quantification of base editing efficiency in live cells.  Moreover, we aim to incorporate a second reporter in the system that is under the control of the same promoter in order to normalize the effect of differential transfection and expression efficiencies.
1. Design of the dual fluorescence EGFP-T2A-mCherry reporter for quick visualisation of RNA base editing.
Inspired by the work of Martin et al. (2018), as well as WPI Worcester 2016 iGEM project , we designed an EGFP-T2A-mCherry dual fluorescence reporter plasmid system. This plasmid consists of two fluorescence markers, an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and a mCherry gene (Figure 1). Here, mCherry is expressed constitutively and used as a marker for transfection efficiency and the overall fusion protein expression level. The EGFP gene is modified such that the start codon of EG"

Upstream neighbouring gene function: The PCP degradation transcriptional activation protein is responsible for the transcription regulation of the pcpA, pcpB and pcpE genes. These genes are essential for the pentachlorophenol (PCP) degradation. The organochloride PCP is used as a pesticide or disinfectant and only few bacteria can biodegradate it.
Downstream neighbouring gene function: The Monoterpene episolactone hydrolase is responsible for the degradation of monocyclic monoterpenes such as menthol and carvone. It catalyses the ring opening of lactones during the degradation of monocyclic monoterpenes.

Strains
There are different E. coli strains for a variety of applications. In every lab diverse strains are stored in freezers for methods like cloning, protein expression and protein interaction. And all of them are being used. For our project Vibrigens, we decided to establish the world’s fastest three lab strains suited for specific needs based on our V. natriegens wildtype strain. Here we describe how we designed our three strains VibriClone, VibriExpress and VibriInteract based on the genotype of  commonly used E. coli strains.
VibriClone
To create a cloning strain that fulfills all the wishes of the scientific society, we have to think of a good strategy. A cloning strain is a kind of a tool in the laboratory day. We asked ourselves which features we needed urgently. The currently used chassis for cloning  is E. coli. We started to look in the genotype, to see what modifications are important. Then we think about which one we would like to take over. Our choice was to knock out the exonucleases so that it would be possible to transform DNA without degrading. In addition, we would like to insert a point mutation in recA, that the homologous recombination between plasmids and into the genome. Moreover, we also want to make it possible to store in the fridge. Therefore we insert the katG gene encodes an enzyme with an catalase and peroxidase activity into the genome. Furthermore, we also wanted to make the blue-and-white selection possible for our VibriClone, we can achieve that by inserting the lactose Operon in the genome.

Other iGEM teams have also asked if they could contribute protocols to the system. It is possible that the system could be developed into an iGEM protocol language programme, but we may be constrained by time and resources.
Members of the team went to Young Synthetic Biologist 2.0 Conference held at the Wellcome Trust by UCL’s SynBioSoc and the UCL 2014 iGEM team. We met loads of other teams from the UK (and Denmark), we presented our work so far, exhibited a poster and attended workshops that gave us valuable insight into human practices, public outreach and ideas about characterising BioBricks. We intend to use the feedback given from other teams to improve and develop our project further, and we thank the hosts for their amazing meet-up.
NEXT STEP
We intend to finish our work in labs as soon as possible since the academic year starts again in Sheffield at the end of September. We are going to assay our keratinase BioBrick with feathers and measure.

PROJECT UPDATE
Our goal is to understand how a group of cells uses sense and secrete communication to make a community decision. Therefore, we have been implementing the circuit we designed into yeast cells. Now that we have transformed many of the yeast strains necessary for our project, we are currently analyzing how each strain responds to an external stimulus, both individually and as a general population. Some issues have arisen, such as discovering that some yeast strains did not have the reporter gene RFP, which means that we will have to re-transform those strains. We will also proceed to the next step with the successful strains, which is to co-culture different yeast strains and observe whether their responses to the external stimulus differ from the responses when alone.
We have also been working on iGEM requirements. Our characterized parts have just been shipped to MIT, and you can expect to see our website up sometime soon!

INTRODUCTION
Why we choose termites?
Termites are widely recognized as the 5th pest around the world,     based on its astonishing number and incredible damage towards wood.    Given that a termite weighed 1 gram,    then everyone should own 500 thousand termites!     Owing to their wood-eating habits,     termites are terminators of crops,     trees, buildings, river dams；    and more often, spoil people’s life.
Our new system of termite terminator
IGEM ZJU-CHINA 2015 has created TERMITE TERMINATOR,     a genetically modified  toxins expression system with a     delivery carrier CNC (cellulose nanocrystals),     capable of trapping termites based on their trophallaxis.
Results and Application
We have successfully overexpressed avermectins in streptomyces avermitilis and achieved toxins manufacture in E.coli to kill termites.    To trap effectively, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC),     and generated the nanofibrous microspheres self‐assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers.     Additionally, a device has been designed. With the help of modeling,     preliminary experience of the device has been made to prove its effect.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#BiosensorDesignMotivation_-_-_TEXT.html," limited shelf life and their application outside the laboratory is complicated and requires special equipment. Another disadvantage of using living cells as a biosensor is that the diffusion of the analyte across the cell membrane is a limiting step, which results in a slower response time of the biosensor ( Strosnider 2003 , Yagi 2007 ).
Nevertheless, there is a great need for handy and cheap detection tools for toxic substances, which became clear to us when we talked to experts and did a survey in Bielefeld. In our eyes, biosensors are very promising candidates for solving severe problems all over the world. Therefore, we decided to develop biosensors that overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and are easily applicable in everyday life.
After intensive research, we decided that such a biosensor needs to be cell-free. This has a number of advantages, especially in terms of biosafety and the legal situation. To make the biosensor easily usable for everyone, we aimed at developing a simple test strip. Paper has emerged as a cheap and reliable material for biosensors. By freeze-drying biological materials on paper, their shelf life can be extended significantly ( Jokerst et al. 2012 , Pardee et al. 2014 ). For this reason, it is the ideal material for our biosensor.
Another challenge in the field of biosensors is multiplexing ( Chen and Rosen 2014 ). Often, it is not sufficient to test for one toxic substance to decide whether drinking water is safe or not, because most of the time several pollutants are present. Consequently, we wanted to build a modular biosensor that is easily extensible.
The basis of our biosensors is the interaction between repressor or activator protein and DNA. The principles are described in the following sections.
The repressor protein is a transcription factor that regulates the gene expression. It inhibits transcription upon binding the operator site, a DNA sequence for transcription regulation. The complex formation can only be broken if the target substances (referred to as “analyte”) is available. They can bind the repressor, which changes its conformation. The repressor protein is released and the transcription can start as the RNA polymerase is not hindered anymore.
The activator protein works on the opposite principle. It is also a transcription regulator and does not inhibit the transcription, but enables it. So by binding the analyte, the activator binds the operator site. This time, the RNA polymerase can start to transcribe the genes as the affinity of the RNA polymerase to the promoter is enhanced.
In short: We decided to design a cell-free, paper-based test"

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Home_-_-_TEXT.html," is prevented. In order to enhance the specificities towards inducers, improvements were made based on the Brown’s Tristable Switch model in 2006. This year, three well-characterized repressible promoters are used: phlFp, tetp, and lacp. The whole construct is divided into three parts, and each contains one functional system with two protein coding sequences (CDS), creating an interconnected Tristable Switch. Moreover, mathematical modelling is applied to predict and verify the consistency of the experimental results. At present, it is by far possible and practical to apply the switch in biosensing which could be achieved by developing a combinatorial circuit of promoters and CDS. With its advantageous characteristics, it is foreseeable that the switch could be applied in a wider spectrum of fields in the near future, for example, biocomputational system and diseases diagnostic.
Overview
The Tristable Switch is built upon three repressible promoters, each driving the expression of the repressors regulating the other two promoters. A interconnected feedback system is formed to achieve the stable states of the system. State changing is realised by the addition of a specific inducer which negates the effect of one of the three repressors present. Below is a GIF animation demonstrating the the mechanism of the switch:

But when I arrived at the last chapter, I stayed at the endless darkness and the music is heartbreaking. I got to know I would lose it soon then I was impressed about the student’s words. “I am not the friend of justice, and I don’t want to be the hero for human. I just work for someone who I believe in. That is how science developed.” Thanks for this game and I got new opinion about scientists and scientific work. After that I played it again and read this background knowledge carefully. I love this game, although there are some shortcomings of it.
——Rose, 12 years old.
Simple game with some bugs, but it is okay, not too serious to affect the enthusiasm of playing the game. The background knowledge and the whole story are good. The game maker can consider adding some questions about the knowledge of biology to make player reader the genetic line more carefully. The looking of roles, background pictures and music are matched well.

AND gate
An AND gate can be constrcuted by positioning two switches right next to each other. For the output transmitter to be created, both input transmitter have to be present.
Combining two switches in series creates a logic AND gate.
OR gate
An OR gate is created by utilizing two independent switches sharing the same output transmitter. If each one of both switches is activated, an output transmitter is generated. Therefore, one input transmitter is enough to produce an output transmitter.
Combining two switches in parallel creates a logic OR gate.
NOT gate
A NOT gate is supposed to function as an inverter. In contrast to the gates described above, a not gate requires only one sitch. However, to meet the design rule for transmitter molecules, this switch shows some differences compared to the switches used for AND and OR gates.
Since the transcriptional terminator may not form if no transmitter is present. Consequently, the switch needs an internal trigger site, capable of preventing terminator formation. To allow the binding of an input transmitter molecule, the switch contains a recognition site upstream of a second target site. The additional target site is mandatory since all transmitter molecules have to carry a trigger. In the case of the NOT switch this trigger site may not bind the actual target site within the transcriptional terminator. In other words, a second target site further upstream is required to catch the trigger site of the transmitter molecule. At the same time, the identity site of the transmitter may not bind right upstream of the terminator. This is accomplished by placing an other identity site right upstream of the terminator rather than an recognition site (compare switches used for AND or OR gate). Due to these two difference, the input transmitter is forced to bind further upstream to the recognition site, displacing the internal trigger site of the switch. This will allow the RNA polymerase to read through an create the output transmitter.
Structure and switching process of a NOT gate.

Network construction
Designing complex biological networks based on either traditional protein engineering or our new bioLOGICS is still a complex task. As described above our bioLOGICS design allows the creation and precise connection of logic gates. To illustrate how a bioLOGICS network is put together we developed a software allowing the fast construction of a custom-made network.

These two proteins, also derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, bind together upon irradiation by red light (660 nm) and separate upon irradiation with far-red light (780 nm). We used this property to activate a split version of a TEV-protease whose split halves were each fused to one of the two optogenetic proteins.
The TEV-protease was obtained from the Biobrick BBa_K1319004. This variant contains the anti self-cleavage mutation S219V. Using overhang-PCR we created a split version of the Biobrick protease based on work done by Wehr et al, 2016 and the iGEM team Munich 2013 . The split was made between amino acid 118 and 119.
Our construct for attaching proteins N-and C-terminally is highly variable: it consists only of a TEV-cleavage site, the PTS2 sequence and a short linker and was designed as a 3b-part for the yeast-toolbox . This means that we can attach any protein to its N- or C-terminus we desire.  We planned on attaching different fluorescent proteins to each sides of the 3b-part in a Lv1-ligation. For our experiment we planned on using the pairs mTurquoise-mVenus and GFP-mRuby.
Lv1 -plasmid containing the sequence coding for the GFP-PTS2-Ruby fusion protein
The two other constructs were planned as follows: Phytochrome B was fused to the C-terminal TEV-half, PIF6 was fused to the N-terminal TEV-half. The PhyB-TEV2 part and the TEV1-PIF6 part were supposed to be inserted into a shared plasmid via a LV2 Golden Gate ligation. Finally, the Lv2-plasmid and the remaining Lv1 construct were to be co transformed into S. Cerevisiae. Our experiment consisted of illuminating one sample with red light (660nm) while keeping another sample in the dark. Fluorescence microscopy would then be used to check whether the import was successful [3]. If cleavage and subsequent protein import was successful, fluorescence of one protein would be localized to the compartment while that of the other would be observed throughout the cell.

This conversation led us to contact several research institutions, including the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to deliberate solutions to the financial barriers within AMR research.
Dr. Dominik Mertz
— Medical Director Infection Control; Hamilton Health Sciences
The Human Practices team spoke with Dr. Dominik Mertz on August 2nd, 2017. Dr. Mertz is an associate professor at McMaster University in the Department of Medicine and Infectious Disease. Additionally, he is the Medical Director of Infection Control for Hamilton Health Sciences. We chose to interview Dr. Mertz because we were interested in hearing about the role of antimicrobial resistance and infection control in healthcare from an expert in the field. Foremost, we learned that the time it takes to diagnose C. difficile is a significant issue:
”When you have a patient in front of you who is not doing well, who needs antibiotics, the faster you know what [the infection] is, the better.”
- Dr. Dominik Mertz, Hamilton Health Sciences
The turnaround of approximately 3-5 days between sending the sample to the lab and getting a result is a crucial period in patient treatment. In the time they are not receiving C. difficile-specific antibiotics, they are often taking broad-spectrum medications that can work to exaggerate the problem. Thus, a novel, faster technique of diagnosing C. difficile is clearly needed.
Dr. Nick Daneman
— Clinician-Scientist; Sunnybrook Research Institute
Dr. Nick Daneman specialized in AMR stewardship and C. difficile. With AMR bacterial strains of C. difficile being under investigation in our Wet Lab, Dr. Daneman could give us key insights on the burden on and scope of these pressing issues in healthcare systems and how we could tackle this. During our interview, Dr. Daneman revealed to us that in the case of C difficile,
“The majority of cases develop after admission [into a healthcare facility] or... an elderly person in a long-term care situation, or a recently discharged person who then develops symptoms in the community. The two [factors in the development of C. difficile as a disease] are: one needs to get the bug, which means oral ingestion of contaminants within the environment, and the second [factor] is antibiotics, because people have diverse, protective intestinal flora [that protect against sickness]... but antibiotics dilutes the normal bacteria and C. difficile has more of a niche to replicate and cause disease.”

The resistances must be properly chosen to select the desired amplification gain. Excessive amplification will not only amplify the signal but also amplify the noise, which is no desired in the measurement.
Finally, the output voltage is sent to Arduino, and it will translate that in a digital signal.
The original idea was taken from [1].
Light Mediated Translator (LMT)
As a final step, we are working in the design of a humanoid chassis that will friendly mediate the communication between humans and microorganisms. We thought in a C3PO-like bust because it is a universal translator -over 6000 languages- and is a well-known sci-fi character.
In the image on the right, you can see some of the elements of the fluorimeter as well as the C3PO mask (on the left) and the mannequin (in the background) we will use to construct the humanoid interface.
This chassis will host our home-made fluorimeter (still under construction). When finished, it will allow an easy -and funny- communication with our culture!

According to Spirin and Swartz, other sequence elements have minor effects, if any at all ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ). With an optimized DNA-sequence, the signal output observed can be increased drastically ( Lentini et al., 2013 ). Therefore, optimization of DNA should be carried out before the optimization of the other, more expensive compounds in the cell-free reaction.
Apart from the later translated region, the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), is of major importance for an efficient reaction.

These are the features of this sequence:
AATAATTTTGTTTTAACTTTAA
To increase the efficiency of translation initiation, the T7 g10 leader sequence can be employed. This sequence contains the socalled epsilon motif TTAACTTTA ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ), and was originally described by Olins et al. 1988 . It enhances the binding of the mRNA to the 16 S rRNA ( Olins et al. 1988 ; Olins, Rangwala 1989 ; Takahashi et al. 2013 ), and Olins et al. showed that this sequence can massively improve heterologous gene expression in E. coli ( Olins et al. 1988 ).
poly-A-spacer
With kinetic studies, Takahashi et al. showed that a spacer between the epsilon motive and the RBS improves the translation rate in vitro. This works when the spacer does not interact with the 30S subunit of the ribosome, which is the case for example for an all-adenine spacer ( Takahashi et al. 2013 ). They further determined a 10-A-spacer as suitable when using E. coli S30 extracts instead of the PURE system.
GAAGGAG
The effect of the ribosome binding site (RBS) on in vitro translation has been investigated extensively ( Karig et al. 2012 ; Lentini et al. 2013 ; Takahashi et al. 2013 ). Most important for an efficient reaction is a defined distance (4-9 bases) of the RBS to the following start codon ( Karig et al. 2012 ; Lentini et al. 2013 ). The strength of the RBS has a minor effect as long as it is not too weak"
Wellesley_Desyne,2013,Team:Wellesley Desyne#Notebook#CassieNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html," things working in zMol. Orit decided that we should try to submit a poster presentation for UIST, which is a really prestigious conference in Scotland. We tried really hard to get as many features in as possible, but the haptic feedback wasn't working like we thought they should. We'd created a search function, double bonding was getting better and our program didn't crash nearly as much but it wasn't good enough without the haptics. We were a bit disappointed at not getting to submit the paper, but it's okay. With the help from Barton, or ""the zSpace Guy"", we tried to get both of the zSpaces we have compatible with each other and with the latest versions of the zSpace packages. We thought it went well and we had a new version of zMol up and running but we still have loads of problems with it. The haptics still don't work and zSpace's support is... non-existent. It's a bit frustrating that no matter how much work we put in, a lot of the problems fall with zSpace and we can't get any support to make it better. Hopefully zSpace will develop some support or get it together soon.
Here's what the periodic table ultimately looks like.
And here's the final version of zMol (for now)!
July 7
Last week was the 4th of July! My brother and neighbor came to visit me so they occupied my week. We started working on our newest project, zTree. The idea behind zTree is to allow tree structured data to be represented in a 3D interactive way. We struggled a lot this week just to get the zSpace packages working in Unity.. and failed. After spending so much time on just that, Orit finally told us to give up on the zSpace aspects of the project for now, and just focus on functionality. We got cards to spawn in a carousel shape and the carousel spins around to allow users to select different cards.
July 14th
Story of my life:
Mostly we worked on basic functionality for the zTree project. We get the most entertaining errors when trying to make things not collide. We've been developing with functionality in mind. Getting the zSpace to work with the program hasn't been going well, so we're working in 2D for a while. The mouse can click on cards, which spawns a new carousel. As a placeholder, I've been using numbers to represent the cards and whichever number is clicked on corresponds to the number of cards spawned on the next carousel. The carousels spin so you can"

As observed in the analysis of the cultivations with expression of SgsE | mCitrine fusion proteins, these proteins form inclusion bodies in E. coli. Inclusion bodies have the advantage that they are relatively easy to clean-up and are resistant to proteases. The first purification step is to isolate and solubilize the inclusion bodies. This step is followed by two filtrations (300 kDa UF and 100 kDa DF/UF) to further concentrate and purify the S-layer proteins. After the filtrations, the remaining protein solution is dialyzed against ddH2O for 18 h at 4 °C in the dark. The dialysis leads to a precipitation of the water-insoluble proteins. After centrifugation of the dialysate, the water-soluble S-layer monomers remain in the supernatant and can be used for recrystallization experiments.
The fluorescence of the collected fractions of this purification strategy is shown in the following figure 4:
Figure 4: Fluorescence of collected fractions during purification of <partinfo>K525305</partinfo> fusion protein.
A huge amount of protein is lost during the purification, especially after the centrifugation steps. The fluorescence in the urea containing fractions is lowered due to denaturation of the fluorescent protein. Some fluorescence could be regenerated by the recrystallization in HBSS. This purification strategy is very simple and can be carried out by nearly everyone in any lab, being the first step to enable do it yourself nanobiotechnology.
Purification of SgsE | mCitrine with His-tag
By fusing the SgsE | mCitrine with a C-terminal His-6-tag the S-layer protein could be simply purified by using a denaturating His-tag affinity chromatography. This purification strategy has the advantage that no time-consuming and complex inclusion body purification and filtration is necessary to decrease the amount of native E. coli proteins. Additional to the simplification a higher purity of the S-layer protein could be reached.
This purification was performed using the SgsE fusion protein containing a N-terminal mCitrine,for identification and a C-terminal His-6-tag. The SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5) and the fluorescence (Fig. 6) in the collected fractions showed that the majority of fusion protein was eluated with a imidazole concentration of approx. 50 mM"

Mobility parameter in this model is crucial. As its value becomes higher, droplet size in micro-channel         increases. This can be explained by the parameters’ mathematical function - raising values causes the increase         in interface relaxation time, meaning the diffusion gets stronger as well 1. So we have compared         the numerical and experimental results of liposome synthesis (Fig. 5) and approximated our characteristic         mobility tuning parameter to be M0 = 2E-12 m3>/s. The diameter of the droplet with this         value was 12.1µm, which is a close match to the real size.
Fig. 5 A comparison between a modeled baseline experiment and actual view of the junction. Both of     them produce vesicles of around 12 µm, though slight variations occur in real setting due to unsteady flow caused     by micro-pumps. Results of both systems concur well enough to assume that our model setup is reliable and close to     reality.

Parametric sweeps and example of liposome radius calculation
In order to investigate how our system depends on certain parameters, we have performed parametric sweeps on         every one of these parameters separately. By doing so, COMSOL Multiphysics resolved our model with every         parametric value specified automatically and stored the results under a single node.         To find out the size of the liposomes, the first fully formed droplet was taken and 2D cut line data set was         created going through the middle of the sphere in y-axis direction (Fig. 6). Next, the variation of phase         variable C (which stands for our IA phase) was extracted from the data set and results were depicted in graphs.         The exact point of phase edge for all studies performed has been assumed as ϕc = 0.5.
Fig. 6 An example of data sets analysed (yellow line in Fig.). One fully formed sphere for every     parametric sweep step was measured by extracting ϕc values from similar linear data sets.
Liposome size dependence on viscosity ratio λ
First of all, the impact of IA and OA phase viscosity ratio ( λ = µIA/µOA) was         investigated. Studies suggest, that increasing λ also increases the generated droplet size 7."

""no design but two suggestions :
One suggestion in the biosafety of the researcher is to include in the iGEM parts kit the bacterial less endotoxicchassi (developed by Berkeley UC 2007), to avoid serious septic problems in the case of an accident that leads to an intense contact with the bacteria (eye or bloodstream contact, inhalation or ingestion).
Another suggestion for population and environment safety is to (somehow) include in all biobricks an operating unit that detects if the bacteria is not in a culture media (detects some molecule produced through the metabolism of a specific media constituent) and express lysozyme to kill it if it's released in the environment (idea inspired by Team UNICAMP-Brazil 2009).""

Its scope is further considered through background research and the shared experiences of the group’s members.
Alternatives to the opportunity are proposed.
Next, a decision is made and acted upon.
Finally, the group goes back and reconsiders that outcome.
We built upon this framework to determine our own specific questions to ask ourselves at each stage in the S.T.I.R. protocol. Here are some of the key questions we asked ourselves:
What is the decision you are trying to make?
What are the societal, economic, environmental, and ethical impacts of the solution?
Alternatives to the opportunity are proposed.
What other solutions are there?
Who are the stakeholders that will care how you intend to solve the problem?
We employed the protocol as an entire team.  This was logistically challenging, but resulted some of the most impactful uses of the protocol.  As the project progressed, we realised we could not all recognize opportunities to use it.  Therefore, we designated humanist on our team to identify opportunities or decisions to employ it. We recorded our discussions to show their impact on the course of our project.
Here is a template for our initial S.T.I.R. protocol:

How did you modify it?
S.T.I.R. is intended to be employed in ‘real time’. But after trying to employ the protocol, we discovered our group was having difficulty defining what constituted a decision or opportunity. At first we had a lot of trouble implementing the S.T.I.R. protocol and we could not clearly see the benefits of conducting such a process. It required the team to meet regularly as a whole group, which was in itself a challenging task considering that ecolibrium is a team of twelve students. Upon encouragement, we decided to try applying the S.T.I.R. protocol to decisions we had already made. We eventually came to realised that we had unconsciously been considering many aspects of the S.T.I"

In Fig. 3 the SDS-PAGE of the E. coli KRX lysates with <partinfo>BBa_K729006</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo> and without any BioBrick (negative control) are shown after they have been treated the same way. No clear distinction between the samples is possible. By comparing the bands at 53.4 kDa (which matches the molecular weight of ECOL) just a small difference between the intensities of the bands can be considered. The E. coli KRX containing <partinfo>BBa_K863005</partinfo> has a slightly stronger band.
Laccase activity tests
Laccase activity tests were performed by using 198 µL of the sample (supernatant of the lysed cells containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and <partinfo>K863005</partinfo>) and 2 µL ABTS (20 mM ABTS stock). Since laccases are capable of oxidizing ABTS the activity of laccases can be detected by measuring the absorption of oxidized ABTS at 420 nm. As a positive control the E. coli KRX strain containing <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> which already has been characterized by the team was applied as well. Using this approach there was no detectable activity over a period of 40 minutes (see Fig. 4). To gain activity the samples were incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 for at least 2 hours. After incubation time another setting was started using 198 µL of the samples containing <partinfo>K729006</partinfo> and <partinfo>K863005</partinfo> and applied 0.1 mM ABTS. The measurements lasted for 5 hours but the results did not show a decrease in oxidized ABTS again (see Fig. 5). A possible reason can be contaminants in the samples, e.g. salts or low molecular agents, that could have affected the activity of the tested laccases. The samples were rebuffered in deionized H2O using HiTrap Desalting Columns and then again incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl2 for 2 hours. This time the measurement setup differed because no buffer remained in the samples. The new measurements were performed with 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), 158 µL sample and 0.01 mM"

Our iGEM project is the result of seven months of team effort. Every member of our team has different qualities, which lead to division of the tasks. After finishing different subjects everything was discussed plenary, so everybody's point of view was integrated. We decided to do as much as possible with the team and minimally rely help from non-members of the team. The research that we conducted was based on previous findings of the Molecular Microbial Physiology Lab. In the table below the different subject are displayed with the members who were responsible for this and at the bottom of the page are some people we want to thank.
