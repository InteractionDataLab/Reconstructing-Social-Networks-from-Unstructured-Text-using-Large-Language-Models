Selection
Bacterial Two-Hybrid System
Motivation and Overview
It is utmost importance to our project to separate bacteria  with high affinity binding proteins from bacteria with low or moderate affinity binding proteins.  Therefore, we need an efficient selection system. One approach  is based on the concept of the very common yeast two-hybrid system, but optimized for bacterial selection directly in E. coli ( Badran et al. 2016 ).
An overview of the system in action is given in Figure(1).
Figure 1: Illustration of the bacterial two-hybrid system. At first two fusion proteins were expressed. The first protein contains a DNA binding domain (cI(434)) with the target protein (1). The second fusion protein contains the activation domain (RpoZ) with our created binding protein (2). At first the DNA binding domain binds at the specific binding site upstream of the reporter (3). If the binding protein can interact with our target (4) the RNA Polymerase I can be recruited and binds to the promoter (5). The result is the expression of the reporter gene, in example the beta-lactamase(6). No binding between the target and the binding protein (7"

EscapeTheLab!
Therefore, in our search for an innovative, pedagogical and fun way of learning, we decided to create a laboratory-themed Escape Game: EscapeTheLab!
To make sure our game was an collaborative and open, we organised a game jam, where over 20 people participated in the inception of the enigmas contained in Escape the Lab!. We organised tOur whole team got together with the help of friends and members of the Enigma Club from the Center for Research andInterdisciplinary (CRI) for a two-day game jam. We spent both days brainstorming and testing enigmas and different concepts, and finally at the end of the event, we were proud to introduce our EscapeTheLab! to 3 teams of players. Since its creation, we have presented our game 10 times inside of the Center for Research and Interdisciplinary as well as at the Cité des Sciences et de l’industrie to a total of 68 players including 2 iGEM teams: UPMC and Pasteur. In total, we had over 15 hours of game and feedback time with the players.
At the GameJam, where the story of EscapeTheLab! began
We were lucky to have been able to host a delegation from Amnesty International, and made them play our Escape Game. Barbara Weber, the Director of Human Rights Education at Amnesty International, and her team came to discuss different ways to teach Human Rights through games, with a particular interest in Escape Games. It was fascinating to talk about how they manage to use games and fun tools to talk about real issues. We were really inspired by their work, and this motivated us to teach synthetic biology in a similar way.
The delegation from Amnesty International playing our Escape Game
Each play-test was an opportunity for us to improve our game to get a better experience for the players and reach a maximum number of people. One of our goals was also to perfect  the game to then be able to present a selection of our best enigmas to iGEMers from all over the globe during the Jamboree. Thus, after each session, we organised a feedback time with the players, insisting on the enigmas and the biological concept behind them. In non-quantitative data, we first asked:
what their overall impression was
how they would improve the game
what they liked/what they didn’t like
what they understood and didn’t.
Finally we asked them to answer a short anonymous questionnaire to have concrete and quantitative data to analyse. By having an anonymous questionnaire,"

Characterization of miniTn7BB-Gm function
In order to characterize the function of the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon, we performed a set of experiments aimed to (i) determine whether miniTn7BB-Gm can transpose efficientely in an enterobacterial host (E. coli DH5α) and a non-enterobacterial host (P. putida KT2440), (ii) measure the transposition frequency when miniTn7BB-Gm was delivered by electroporation, chemical transformation and mating, (iii) determine whether insertion occurs site-specifically at the chromosomal attTn7 site, and (iv) determine whether flipase expression in trans can excise the drug resistance marker in the chromosomal copy of miniTn7BB-Gm.
Transposition of miniTn7BB-Gm in P. putida
In order to demonstrate miniTn7BB-Gm transposition into the P. putida KT2440 chromosome, pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm was transferred to this host by two different means: (i) co-electroporation with the helper plasmid pTNS2 [pTNS2 is not replicative in P. putida, but transiently produces the Tn7 transposition machinery ( Choi et al., 2005 )], and (ii) tetraparental mating, using DH5α/pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm as the donor, DH5α/pRK2013 as helper to provide the Tra functions, DH5α/pTNS2 to provide the Tn7 transposase and P. putida KT2440 as the recipient.

Parameters used to evaluate the energy of a potential hairpin where n is the length of the hairpin loop.
Being the main algorithm, the algorithm introduced above was used by us to write a program named hairpinscore. Users may use the program to predict various potential structures and efficiencies of a Rho-indepent terminator by simply inputting the sequence of the terminator.
The program wrote in C# was divided into several parts.
When a sequence was input, firstly, all the potential T tail sequences will be found.
Secondly, for each potential T tail sequence, all the potential stem-loop sequences will be found.
Thirdly, for all the potential stem-loop sequences of all the potential T tail sequences, the hairpin scores will be calculated and sorted in ascending order.
Forthly, for the first several probable cut positions, the structures will be determined. The structure is be expressed in an array of ""0"" and ""1"", where ""0"" means the corresponding base isn't paired with any other bases and ""1"" means the corresponding base is paired with another base.
Fifthly, the d score was calculated by the following method:
d score = tail score * 18.16 - hairpin score * 96.59 / LH - 116.87, where LH stands for the length of the stem-loop sequence. The method of calculating d score was adjusted from the method put forward by Yves d'Aubenton Carafa et al. [2].
Lastly, by analyzing the experiment data, we've got the relationship between termination efficiency and d score. Thus, once the d score is determined, the efficiency will be calculated easily.
In the future, the program may have more useful functions, for example, giving alternative sequences with efficiencies closed to a given number.

Introductory Lab Sessions (30th June - 27th July)
To train up the members of our team who hadn't experienced lab work before, and to sharpen the skills of the team members who had, our advisers planned a period of introductory lab sessions. These experiments were based around growing cell cultures and making E.coli cells competent whilst making us aware of important lab principles such as handling of equipment, aseptic technique, lab etiquette, etc. Please see calendar below:

Illinois,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," pathway between the compounds.
Results
Depending on whether the user specified 1 or 3 pathways, IMPtools will generate and display the top pathway(s).  The way it displays the compounds and reactions is through the use of the KEGG ID names that were assigned to them.  One could even look these up on the KEGG database for more information using these codes if they wanted to. Now suppose you see a compound that you do not want to be involved in the pathway.  Simply click on the ""x"" button below the compound to tell IMPtools to ignore that compound, and to re-calculate a new pathway. One can also alter the weights that were assigned to the original query and then re-generate a new pathway by clicking update.
Once you find a path that you like, you are taken to another page in which you will be given the available enzyme and gene data.  With this gene data, ideally you could transfect these genes into a host organism that you would grow colonies of, and your new colonies would essentially be able to convert compound A to compound Z.  Once you have finished looking at the genes and enzyme data, there will also be a stoichiometric matrix that you could look at.  This stoichiometric matrix gives info on what are the costs and products for this pathway.
To finish up, one can download two different files to keep record and organize their results generated by IMPtools.  The first file is a CSV file that one can open up in Microsoft Excel.  This document will include compound, reaction, enzyme, and gene data as well as the stoichiometric matrix.  Although, this feature is not exactly perfect yet and is still in development.  The second file is a text document cantaining XGMML code which can be imported into Cytoscape, a network graphing program.  Using Cytoscape, one can view a diagram of the artificial pathway that they created using IMPtools (example below).
Compounds are represented by circles, and reactions are represented by squares.  The pink circles are the main compounds that are involved in the artificial pathway.  The beige circles are the side-products and side-reactants involved in the pathway that are needed for each reaction in addition to the main compounds.  The black arrows represent the main pathway, whereas the blue and red arrow represent the production and consumption of side products and reactants respectively.
Lastly, out program will be able to take the gene data that you generated with IMPtools and export it as Biobrick(s) (adding necessary primers, etc). These one would then submit"

One of Mark’s favorite pastimes is existing, a hobby he picked up a few years ago and decided that he likes it enough to keep doing it for at least a little bit longer.
HAILEY EDMONDSON
VICE PRESIDENT
Hailey Edmondson is a junior in Plant Genetics, Breeding, and Biotechnology, making her the token non-engineer on this year’s team. In her first year on the iGEM Team, she is enjoying a well-rounded summer internship experience, which has been instrumental in “making both friends and mistakes,” in the words of fellow intern Mark Aronson. Originally from San Diego, a city which everybody should visit at least once in order to get a personalized tour from Hailey, she enjoys the outdoors, spending time with friends and family, and baking a variety of sweet treats, which she may just share with you if you ask nicely. Her career goals include being a scent developer for the luxury candle company Yankee Candle, but she will likely settle for a career in scientific research in plant biology and biotechnology.
JAMES WELCH
CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER
James is a junior in Cell, Developmental, and Molecular Biology with minors in Spanish and Biotechnology. His interests are in consumer uses of synthetic biology and reincarnating the dead using black magic. Blood stone rituals as well as starring into the endless and empty void some call the sky are part of his daily routine. James loves books, food, and criticizing movies. His current plans for the future involve not thinking about it too much as that could change the outcome.
CASEY MARTIN
DIRECTOR OF EVENTS
Casey is a junior in Agricultural Engineering with a focus on Environmental and Natural Resources Engineering (ie, she wants to be an environmental engineer while earning one of the longest-titled majors). Currently hailing from Colorado (yes she knows what was recently made legal; no, you do not need to ask her about it or give a “knowing” look; yes, the mountains are very pretty you should visit), she has also lived in California (California girls come in beach tanned but also glow-in-the-dark pale with beautiful porcelain skin), Texas (stop making fun of it, it’s really not that bad y’all), and Georgia."

Similarly, some form of protection for computer algorithms might allow models relevant to the iGEM competition (and to synthetic biology more broadly) to be shared in a similar way to BioBricks. Engineer Leroy Lim, responsible for some of the modeling aspect of the project commented that it would have been highly useful to have models from previous years available at the beginning of the project. 'People would be far more likely to share their code and collaborate on this if we thought we'd get credit for our work...with companies it's even worse, there's no option but to keep your code to yourself because there's nothing else stopping competitors from taking everything you've developed and taking away your business'.

This is also helped by the fact that our manufacturing and distribution processes will be identical for second and third generation products, allowing us again to save time and money. This means that although we will incur significant costs during the development of our first generation product, we will hopefully be able to quickly recoup those once our products begin to hit the market in rapid succession.

Goettingen,2012,Team:Goettingen#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," I am currently studying in the second semester of the MSc ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am really looking forward to iGEM because it will be ""our"" project and we will be able to work and plan on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball. Also, I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

Hello everybody! I am Patrick and also student of the Masters program ""Microbiology and Biochemistry"" at the Georg-August University in Göttingen. I earned my Bachelor of science at the Leibniz University in Hannover. I was member of the Schierwater-workgroup in the Institute of ecology and evolution of the Stiftung Tierärtzliche Hochschule Hannover for over 2 years. My workfield was taxis-behaviour and potential early-evolution neuro-systems on Trichoplax adhaerens. I gathered many experiences in the workfield of genetics and experimental biology. Within my Master I want to complement this experiences with detailed biochemical knowledge. In the beginning of this year fellow students told me that they want to participate at the iGEM competition. The interesting Project catched me so I joined the team immediately. I think this Project is also a good first experience of scientific projectmanagement and financing.

An electrophoresis gel was made to verify the length of the fragments. After the confirmation of the bands, they were purified by using the EZ-10 Spin column DNA gel extraction kit. The concentration of the isolated parts was measured with the nanodrop.
For the ligations, the calculations were made using the ligation calculator of the UT_Dallas 2011 iGEM team ( https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT_Dallas/ligation ). The ligations were incubated at 4°C for 16-24 hours. After the incubation, the ligation product was transformed following the electrotransformation protocol.
Again after transformation, a single colony from each of the selection plates was selected and inoculated in 20mL LB broth with appropriate antibiotic. The samples were incubated overnight at 37°C with 250rpm. Later, they were centrifuged at 4,000rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 1mL of LB media. Of each sample, 425uL were used for a glycerol stock, which was stored a -80°C. The remaining 575uL were used to make minipreps. The DNA concentration and purity were measured with the nanodrop.

Escherichia coli
The constructs for E. coli were designed to make it overproduce arginine by removing the product inhibition by arginine on argA and knocking out the repressor argR. This overproduction is assumed to make the cell secrete arginine without needing to add any additional transporters.
1. Overexpression of point mutated argA + GFP insertion
To remove the feed-back inhibition of arginine, Tyrosine-19 in argA was mutated to Cysteine [7] through mutagenic PCR using a megaprimer method [8]. After generation of mutated argA fragment, the gene was assembled with Gibson assembly with the reporter gene GFP (for quantification of the ratio of E. coli to cyanobacteria in the co-culture), chloramphenicol resistance gene and upstream homology regions of argA to exchange the native promoter with the strong constitutive promoter J23119. The downstream homology region is included in the mutated argA fragments. The final construct is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9. Construct for overexpressing mutated argA and inserting GFP into the genome of E. coli.
The primers used to assemble the fragments are shown in Table 9. The chloramphenicol resistance gene is amplified from the plasmid pKD3. The GFP gene is amplified from the BioBrick BBa K584001 . ArgA is amplified from genomic DNA"

Part:BBa_K346000: Part Design
T3 RNA polymerase has a dramatically high transcription rating; therefore a strong RBS is not necessary as a medium RBS (BBa_B0032) will be enough to reach the maximum of transcription activation at T3 promoters.
What’s more, we observed that maximum transcription rating might result in protein misfolding sometimes and the apparent transcription activation fold will decrease instead. Therefore we strongly recommend a low expression intensity of T3 polymerase in the case of genetic circuit design, or the combination of T3 polymerase with a low-strength T3 promoter, such as promoter phi 1.3 or 4.3. You can find more info about the T3 promoter intensity in the following Figure

In vivo TF characterization
To be able to determine the in vivo activity and specificity of novel transcription factor variants we generated a suite of reporter plasmid systems . We successfully characterized a number of our reporter systems for functionality. We created a number of reporter plasmids to measure TetR activity, which lead to improved characterization data for the Partsregistry.
Microfluidics
We noticed that only a small number of iGEM teams have also made use of microfluidics in the past. Because we think that microfluidics are a useful tool for the iGEM community, we decided to promote the technique by creating the tamagotchip live online microfluidics game: from any web browser, you can control the setup located in our lab in Lausanne, as detailed here . In addition, we wrote a guide on the wiki to help future teams get started with these techniques.
In summary, over the summer we:
developed and characterized a new in vivo selection system based on “survival of the weakest”;
created and characterized a set of T7 promoter variants that express with different strengths;
created several TetR variants ;
created several reporter systems for the in vivo characterization of TetR;
determined the binding energy landscape of TetR and a number of TetR mutants using MITOMI;
performed experiments with and accordingly updated the BBaK112808 lysis device ;
developed and documented a cheap and easy to build microfluidic control setup for the iGEM community.

Brown,2009,Team:Brown#Project Histamine Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"C promoter.
Re-engineering Chemoreceptor #2: Tar Receptor
In parallel, we modified the receptor Tar, which normally binds aspartate in the periplasmic space of E. coli, to bind histamine.
Dr. Loren Looger at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm campus used his protein design software Chameleon to calculate mutations that would transform Tar’s aspartate binding pocket to a histamine binding pocket. His algorithm gave us the top 16 receptor designs and we are currently in the process of creating this library of mutants. We have designed primers for each of these designs and are introducing these mutations by both the “Round-the-Horn Site-Directed Mutagenesis” protocol on OpenWetWare and Strategene’s Quikchange Mutagenesis II Kit.
In normal E. coli cells, aspartate binds to the Tar receptor. The Tar-EnvZ chimera protein (created by Utsumi et. al in ""Activation of bacterial porin gene expression by a chimeric signal transducer in response to aspartate"" 1989) allowed the Taz protein to be linked to the EnvZ cascade in the same manner as Trg-EnvZ. Just as in that system, ligand binding to its receptor leads to an intracellular signaling cascade promoting gene transcription.
Initiating an Appropriate Response: Linking Histamine Sensation to Intracellular Transcription
The creation of a novel histamine receptor to detect elevated histamine is only the first step to providing an appropriate cell response to allergens. Once a functional histamine sensor is inserted into the cell membrane, its activation must be linked to an intracellular cascade responsible for triggering gene transcription . The successful mutation of the binding pockets on both RBP and Tar was therefore followed by the complete construction of each receptor as it would function in the cell membrane. For both RBP and Tar, this meant replicating the work done by Masayori Inouye et. al to create the chimeric proteins Trg-EnvZ (Trz) and Tar-EnvZ (Taz) (respectively). Chimeric proteins were created by fusing the intracellular domains of Tar and Trg (Trg is the membrane receptor associated with ligand-bound RBP) to the kinase domain of EnvZ. Activation of the functional receptor domains by histamine binding is thus able to initiate an intracellular cascade that phosphorylates the transcription factor ompR thereby activating gene transcription under the ompC promoter. By replacing the gene normally present under this promoter with our gene of interest, we successfully manipulated"

And then, I digested it with EcoRI and PstI 1 hour and ligated them with pSB1C3 vector 2 hour. After transformation of each hybrid promoters into DH5α cell, I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain. Finally, I got plasmid of each hybrid promoter (BBa_K1913025:42.7 ng/ μL, BBa_K1913022:44.3 ng/ μL, BBa_K1913024 :44 ng/ μL, BBa_K1913023:37.5 ng/ μL). Secondly, I digested hybrid promoter 1 and 2 (BBa_K1913025, BBa_K1913022) with EcoRI and SpeI as well as mRFP+P0440 with XbaI and PstI and ligated hybrid promoter 1,2 with mRFP+P0440 in pSB1K3. After transformation of these two constructions, I picked up colony from the plates and checked inserted parts by PCR and cultured the correct strain(Fig.6). Then, after plasmid purification, (P1+mRFP+P0440:245.1 ng/ μL, P1+mRFP+P0440:56.1 ng/ μL) I sent them to sequencing and results are correct. In addition, at the same time, I tried to use PCR amplify riboswitch part BBa_K1913008 and BBa_K1913009 by using specific primers, but it all failed. Meanwhile, I tried different annealing temperatures setting, for example, from 66℃ to 72℃, 15s for extension.

DNA assembly
The sequence we designed codes for two different proteins: proNGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and TEV protease (from Tobacco Etch Virus). These two proteins are fused in C-terminal with a signal peptide for Escherichia coli Type I Secretion System which consists in the last 60 amino-acids of HaemolysinA (HlyA). Each coding sequence is separated from the signal peptide by the cleavage sequence for TEV, in order to get the protein without its signal peptide (Figure 1).
Figure 1: proNGF and TEV production cassette
This DNA construct was ordered in two parts, named Seq1 (1096 bp) and Seq2 (1153 bp) in commercial plasmids pEX-A258 from gene synthesis. Seq1 and Seq2 were amplified in competent E. coli DH5-α.   After bacteria culture and plasmid DNA extraction, we digested commercial vectors with restriction enzymes (NheI and BamHI for Seq1, MscI and HindIII for Seq2). We extracted the inserts from the gel and performed a ligation by using specific overlaps into linearized pET43.1a for proNGF expression and into pSB1C3 for iGEM sample submission.
We proved that our vector pet43.1a contained Seq1 and Seq2 (Figure 2) and that pSB1C3 contained Seq1 and Seq2 (Figure 3) after digestion and DNA electrophoresis. Plasmid DNA of pSB1C3 construction was purified and sent for sequencing (Figure 4).

Plasmid consisting of ComR (BBa_K2341000), the p1655 promoter (containing the ComR box, BBa_K2341001), GusA and an erythromycin resistance.
GusA encodes the beta-glucuronidase gene from E. coli. This is a popular reporter gene that uses glucuronides as substrates, the most common of which are X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide) and para-nitrophenyl glucuronide.
Here, it is under the control of the ComRS pathway and uses the ComS peptide from S. thermophilius (LPYFAGGL).

In fact, both coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs, including some miRNAs, have been found in human saliva. Although mRNAs are highly degraded in saliva, miRNAs are stably and abundantly present in saliva. Recently, there are many reports on cancer-related miRNA expression in saliva. Featured miRNA expression are reported to be found in oral squamous cell carcinoma, parotid gland tumors and esophageal cancer, indicating potential salivary miRNA to be biomarkers for detecting these diseases. According to the test done by Zijun Xie group, there are three type of miRNAs significantly upregulated in the whole saliva from the esophageal cancer patient group in contract to normal control group – miR-10b, miR-144, and miR-451 (p value 0.001, 0.012 and 0.002, respectively; AUC 0.762, 0.706 and 0.756, respectively). And four miRNAs are significantly upregulated in saliva supernatants from the esophageal cancer patient group – miR-10b, miR-144, miR-21 and miR-451. Among them, miR-21 is the most frequently reported one for its high performance in specific expression level related to esophageal cancer (according to one of the reports, p < 0.05, AUC = 0.8820, sensitivity = 90.20% and specificity 70.69%; different tests may report different results).
Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.

Once we had isolated our protein we were able to do functional assays with the esterase enzyme. By using a cellulose-binding dye that selectively binds to cellulose and not cellulose acetate, we were able to test whether or not the esterase enzyme was effective in de-acetylating commercial grade cellulose acetate. We soaked the cellulose acetate in the esterase protein at its optimal temperature of 30ºC and tested with the stain at multiple points. The results of our assay (shown below) demonstrate that over time the protein was working to degrade the cellulose acetate, as the blue stain intensity increased over time. In the future, we can better characterize our esterase protein by doing assays with more replicates, longer time periods, and varying amounts of protein.
Figure 8. Pieces of cellulose acetate were soaked in esterase enzyme for varying amounts of time before their level of degradation was tested using the blue cellulose-binding dye.
We are currently working on functional assays of the cellulase gene, and have submitted it as a BioBrick (BBa_K1499501) .

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," devices and systems and the     functional combinations that can build new constructs are presented     for the iGEMs parts registry database. Three graphs are composed of     iGEM devices and one graph is based on Biobricks. Each graph comprises     a set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges. In the set of nodes each     node represents a device, while in the set of edges each edge represents     the input-output combination of the nodes. These graphs are directed     graphs as the edges are created according to input-output combination.     All compatibilities between a regulator and a promoter of an edge is     created, where the source of this edge is the device with the corresponding     regulator and target of the edge is the device with the promoter in     concern.
Fig. 1: A node representing a device
Fig. 2: Arrow representing an edge between two nodes
The atomic structures used in our graphical model have been represented     in Figures 1 and 2. A node is represented with a solid circle where     the label, the part/device ID according to iGEM standards, of the device     is marked on the foreground. The blue arrows between nodes connect the     related devices, representing the input-output connectivity. End style     of the arrow helps us to determine the direction of the node, like in     Figure 2 where the node labeled BBa_S03520 is the source and BBa_JO9250     is the target.
Directivity
All the four constructed graphs build for BioGuide are directed graphs.     So that, for every edge there must be a single source and a target.     There is no single edge which is bidirectional. In mathematical form     this can be represented as:
If an edge e has node v as source and node w as target then the edge     can be expressed as
For a directed graph the combination (v, w) is totally different     from (w, v). Therefore,
The direction of the edges has been represented with the arrows,     as explained in Figure 2.
Connectivity
The nodes forming their own sub-graphs disconnected from the rest     of the nodes have been recognized, which showed us the presence of incompatibility     between few regulators and promoters of the devices. We have observed     this disconnection in all four of our graphs. The basis of the disconnection     has been shown in Figure 3, where the two sub-graphs without any edge     that connects them to the main graph has been presented on the right     hand side of the diagram. These features classify our graphs as disconnected     graphs [1].

September 27, 2017
INTRODUCTION
The iGEM competition brings into contact many student groups that worked on a research project for one year. Because this competition started over 10 years ago it would be interesting to investigate the changes in research ideas or lab equipment that have taken place since then. Fortunately, one of the requirements for the competition is to upload to the web a description of the project (also called the wiki). The links to each wiki are neatly organized on the official iGEM page they are a word frequency analysis feasible. Also useful visualization of the results of the analysis would allow more people to get an idea of the evolution of iGEM projects. This idea was concieved by the MIT team and was proposed as a collaboration in the official iGEM page (Colaboration number #26). We, at the Groningen team decided to collaborate with the MIT team by doing this analysis.
METHODS
Web Scraping
To conduct a word frequencty analysis, the text of each iGEM team web description must be easily accessible and organized on a table. To achive this, the iGEM team of MIT web scraped the text of each team using the official archive of wikis available in the iGEM web page (<
>). They structured this data into a CSV file where the team name, supervisor name, project title, year of the project and wiki text were columns of the data table.
Data Cleaning
The original csv file could not be read from file due to some conficts in the interpretation of quoted text. The problem is that some regions of text are interpreted as part of the csv structure and commas in this region are interpreted as field separators. This problematic text belonged to the descriptions of the wiki that were the object of this analysis. We removed all lines of text that did not have 6 comma separated fields and then all that did not have an url on the team url field (Team_Info_Page). This may have removed a lot of information from some teams wikis.
Word frequency analysis
To find out how the iGEM projects have evolved over the years we first conducted a word frequency analysis per year (2008-2015) using VOSvisualizer (<

Biotic Blue is an innovative solution with high added value that contributes to decoupling pharmaceutical consumption, an indicator of economic growth, from environmental deterioration.
By having lower energy needs than the competitive solutions, Biotic Blue contributes to more efficient energy usage.
Biotic Blue is an environmentally sound technology derived from a developed country and can be transferred and diffused to developing countries in order to counter the emerging problem of aquatic pharmaceutical pollution.

This is limited however in cases where the only amino acids in the sequence are alanine, threonine, cysteine, and glycine, since the single letter code for each amino acid is also found in the single letter nucleotide representations. For these cases, the program will be unable to distinguish between an amino acid or nucloetide sequence--this however can be corrected by putting a ""*"" at the end of an amino acid sequence.

Nithin's Notes
PCR to add the iGEM suffix to our PcQuad was done. We used igem prefix 1 and igem suffix 2 to run the reaction. The template DNA was obtained through the dna extraction that was done yesterday. This product was diluted to give us a 20ul tube of 1ng/ul. I loaded 500 ng of template for a 50 ul reacton.  After running the gel, we werent able to see the band that we wanted. But, we did see the same nonspecific band that had haunted us earlier shining ever so brightly.
I did change the annealing time from 25 seconds to 30 seconds for this reaction.

Lane 2-5: 25ul of the same reaction with same conditions.
Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The PCR product from yesterday will be used as a template for the amplification reaction today.  If the amplification is successful, RE digestion, and possibly ligation, will also be done today.
Procedures:
Amplification:
Nithin ran the amplification, and made the agarose gels.
Observations:  The gel appeared to have no band at the desired product size, and only a very strong non-specific band.   The non-specific band was the same band that appeared in the previous PCR with the iGEM prefix and suffix #1 primers.  It was noted that the annealing time was set to 30sec, instead of the extension time.
Rerun of the amplification: From the PCR product of the initial amplification, 10uL of 1ng/uL stock was made using 0.635uL of 15.75ng/uL DNA.  The extension time was made to 30sec, and the annealing time was returned to 20sec.

A grow-box was made with red and blue LEDs such that the A. thaliana could grow properly under regulated lab conditions. The following solutions were made in the lab: 1L 5M NaCl, 500mL 20% SDS, 500mL 3M NaOAc pH 5.3, 500mL 25mM MgCl2, and 500mL 7.5M NH4OAc.

Another ligation and transformation of the Kozak sequence was attempted. We tried making an agarose gel, but it did not solidify in time, so the gel was postponed until June 19. The 1% agarose gel was to run the carrot genomic DNA. The two carrot gDNA samples were nanodropped: sample one (1) has a density of 68.4 ng/µL, and sample two (2) has a density of 91.4 ng/µL.
  June 19
Got $300 contribution from the Skule Alumni Fund. Went on an outing to Queen St. W. to get an amber bottle, electrical wiring, and a scalpel. Made a 1% agarose gel, which broke (again!) and made 400mL of 24:1 chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, as well as 1L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
  June 20
Made 1L each of Super Optical Both with Catabolite repression (SOC) and Terrific Broth. Made a 1% agarose gel, which broke...again. Made yet another gel, using 1.2g agarose, 120mL 1x TBE buffer, and a voltage of 60V. This procedure worked, and the carrot DNA samples were run, and DNA presence in the samples was confirmed. The gels were accidentally thrown out after imaging. A gDNA prep of the A. niger was also done, with some modifications from the original protocol. Some A. thaliana were planted in pots from the MS-K plates they were cultured on. They were excised by scalpel and transferred to pots filled with potting soil to an approximate 4"" height. The plants were watered with milli-Q.

BGU_Israel,2018,Team:BGU Israel#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," cells. The results show cells that got no treatment before transfection and cells were treated with trypsin before the transfection. The TIMP1 promoter showed 27.5-fold increased activity without trypsin and 17.07- fold increased activity with trypsin, as compared to the control (empty vector). The STEAP4 promoter showed 8.14-fold increased activity without trypsin and 9.67- fold increased activity with trypsin, as compared to the control. Enhancers 7 that serves as a negative control for Luciferase activity in C8D30 showed 4.74-fold increased activity without trypsin and 1.29- fold increased activity with trypsin, as compared to the control. Enhancers 9 that serves as a negative control for Luciferase activity in C8D30 showed decreased activity, as compared to the control. Relative luciferase expression results are presented after normalization to Renilla activity and represent the means ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.
Discussion:
As expected, the pTIMP1 and pSTEAP4 values are very high when compared to the negative controls of empty vector, which suggest that our two promoter are active in our reactive astrocyte C8D30 cell line. We also found that the promoter are active both with and without trypsin, which support our conclusion.  Additionally, the values obtained from the E7 and E9 enhancers are very low, as expected, since these enhancers are specific for HEK293 cells and not reactive astrocytes.
As we preformed this experiment on reactive astrocytes, we would be interested to test these promoters on normal resting astrocytes and after they become reactive. Therefore, our next step would be to perform this experiment on primary astrocyte cells. This way we could compare the promoter expression in resting v. reactive astrocytes and strengthen the assessment that STEAP4 and TIMP1 are specific to reactive astrocytes over resting astrocytes. We plan to preformed this experiment on mouse primary astrocytes but the plasmids that we generated are without the AAV9 elements that required for infection such plasmids into primary astrocytes, therefore, we could not do this experiment.
Conclusion:
According to the literature and this experiment, STEAP4 and TIMP1 promoters are indeed expressed strongly in our reactive astrocytes. Therefore, while working with the cell line we can rely on these promoters to express our constructs specifically in reactive astrocytes. However, further experiments with a resting astrocyte sample must be performed"

Figure 5: Mass spectrum of the Petrobrick/xylE co-culture retention peak at 10.5 min as shown in Figure 4.  While the identity of this compound is currently unknown, there are changes occuring to some of the catechol breakdown products.
Figure 6: Gas chromatograph of catechol degradation assay using Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456 a species of bacteria that converts fatty acids into alkenes.  This identified a similar peak change in the PetroBrick with a retention time of 10.5 min as shown in Figure 4.  This provides additional support that the PetroBrick and this organism can further degrade catechol into breakdown products.
Figure 7: Mass spectrum of Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456/xylE co-culture retention peak at 10.5 min as shown in Figure 6.  This peak is similar to the peak from the Petrobrick/xylE co-culture, suggesting the breakdown product for both of these cultures is modified catechol from xylE.  The identification of this compound is ongoing.
Based on our GC-MS results, we were able to show the appearance of a new peak when cells expressing xylE and the PetroBrick were co-cultured.  Although we don't know the exact identity of this peak, it is distinct form our control.  It resembles standards that contain a toluene substituent suggesting that this compound maybe similar in structure.  This structure is also made possible by the fact that the catechol degradation product is capable of forming polymers and potentially ring type structures.  It may very well be that these ring structures are being further processed by the Petrobrick into useful products, which we hope to identify through GC-MS/MS in the future.  Interestingly, a similar peak appeared when cells expressing our xylE construct were co-cultured with Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456 cells.  This suggests that although we don't know the exact identity of this new peak, it is likely that it may be in fact a further breakdown product of catechol.  This is a very promising result, as it suggests that in addition to converting naphthenic acids into hydrocarbons, we may also be able to break down catechol, one of the other major toxic components in tailings ponds.

Jianyi HUANG
If ONLY I’m a MATH MAJOR!!!
Jianyi is a junior majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics.
This is the second year that she has been on UCAS iGEM team and also the second year that UCAS has joined iGEM community. She likes playing with DNA fragments and create something interesting out of basic elements.Unfortunately, she always regrets she hadn’t become a math major, especially when tons of data drove her mad. The good thing is that she would be happy with everything as long as she could stay in lab.
As a second-year iGEMer, she organized group meetings and trainings of new team members in the first stage. Responsible for our DEGRADATION MODULE, she devoted most of her time in lab.
She is also fluent in English and wrote the PROJECT part of our wiki. She plays the guitar and doesn’t talk much.
Jingnan YE
Easily pissed off when just getting up
Jingnan is a junior double majoring in biology and material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
She sincerely appreciates her excellent teammates and awesome instructors working and learning with her during this enjoyable year, from which she discovered more about what she hates and will never try in her future research.
She spent most of her time in the lab and on her way to the lab, while successfully spared some time to arrange a couple of HP activities and do some paperwork.
Outside the lab she is also a music lover, a pop dancer and an amateur bodybuilder. She believes exposing herself to music and art can help her keep good mood when the experiment fails again, and regular exercise can keep her working in the lab for more than 15 hours without feeling exhausted.

Crazy fan of Arya Stark
Jiang who wants to study alchemy is a sophomore majoring in chemistry at UCAS.
Though sufferring the frustrating failures which shouldn’t have been experienced at his age, he learned a lot and knew better about synthetic biology. Through all this one-year journey, he confirmed his ideal again to attempt establishing the biological world based on axiom system.

The binding of a dCas9-gRNA to a promoter creates an activated transistor which is otherwise in a basal state. dCas9-gRNA population varies accordingly to dCas9 and gRNA populations:             \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] = R_\text{dCas9} [\text{dCas9}][\text{gRNA}] - D_\text{dCas9}[\text{dCas9-gRNA}] - \gamma[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]             \]
Our simple transistor (used to simulate activation) can be found in two states: activated or basal. The switch between basal and activated states is obtained by the binding/unbinding of the dCas9/gRNA complex and is represented by an Hill's function, which gives the probability of a dCas9/gRNA complex being attached to the promotor [1]. In order to assess the functionality of our transistor and the targeting of the dCas9/gRNA complex, we used a measurable output: green fluorescent protein (GFP):             \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] = \alpha_{GFP,max}\frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]} + \alpha_\text{GFP,b} \left( 1 - \frac{[\text{dCas9-gRNA}]}{K_\text{DNA} + [\text{dCas9-gRNA}]} \right)  - (\gamma_{mRNA}+\gamma) [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}],             \]              \[               \frac{d}{dt}[\text{GFP}] = \beta_\text{GFP} [\text{mRNA}_\text{GFP}] - (\gamma_{GFP}+\gamma)[\text{GFP}].             \]
The output of a transistor needs not necessarily to be the mRNA encoding for a  (fluorescent) protein. It can be a new gRNA, in order ti propagate the output signal to other transistors; in this way we can chain different transistors in order to create a complex logic circuit.
Equations for activation

Lethbridge,2018,Team:Lethbridge HS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," sands tailings ponds, we propose a solution using multiple cisterns. It would not be feasible to implement our system directly into the tailings ponds, due to the addition of synthetic organisms into nature, and the difficulty of metal extraction at the end. The concentration of heavy metals will decrease as the effluent travels through the cisterns until a certain amount has been removed. From there, the water can be released back into the tailings or moved to a different area to be processed further.
Positive Impacts of Our System
Our system’s self-renewability and efficiency has the potential to improve the removal process of metals in comparison to currently existing systems. Our method would provide a solution to the problems faced in places such as the Athabasca oil sands and the Berkeley Pit, where heavy metal removal is valuable, in addition to extracting toxins out from the oil sands.
Figure 2. Overview of containment model. ELP stands for Elastin-like Polymer. The temperature is increased in order for the aggregation of all construct components, therefore removing metal ions.

The E37A triple mutant, however, has contradictory results: the MITOMI data indicate that this mutant has a change in specificity, with a consensus sequence being different from the wild-type Ptet. However, it still recognizes Ptet well, meaning that there is still crosstalk with the endogenous promoter.
We were able to change the specificity of some of our mutants; however this change was not big enough to have a fully orthogonal mutant that would not recognize the wild-type consensus sequence.
DIY Microfluidics
For less than €800, we built a microfluidics setup for 12 valves that anybody can control from their web browser.
In parallel to the work on the transcription factor pipeline, we built a computer-controlled microfluidic injection setup from off-the shelf components, to demonstrate that microfluidics can be used for CHF 1000 (about €800). To help future teams from other universities get started with microfluidics, we wrote on our wiki instructions to replicate the setup.
In addition to this, we programmed a web interface for the machine: from any web browser, users can view a live video feed from the microscope that images the chip, and control the valves by clicking buttons on the web page. Concurrent use is managed by a queue system. The web site was mostly used at the Jamboree in Amsterdam to illustrate the principle of microfluidics to other iGEMers, then it stayed live for most of October, allowing anybody to try the setup. The demonstration chip had channels in the shape of the iGEM logo, and was filled with a red and a blue dye to highlight flow and mixing.

Interlab Study
Introduction
This being our university’s second participation in the iGEM competition, we’ve now decided to take part in the fourth international InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology.
This is optional and voluntary, not directly related to our main project (BactaSun) but nonetheless a significant component of the iGEM Bronze Medal criteria.
One major challenge in the field of engineering biology is to standardize measurements in order to compare and share data from different labs across the world using different protocols, reagents, devices, device settings …
The Interlab study is a project run by  iGEM’s measurement committee to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement procedure for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) which is one of the most used marker in synthetic biology.
Fluorescence data are usually difficult to compare since they are reported in different units or are processed differently according to various research groups. The project’s objective is therefore to improve current measurement tools by converting data into absolute units.

Methods
First of all the device needs calibrating before measuring fluorescence. The goal is to determine the optimal settings for the plate reader to detect the optical density at 600nm (OD600 reference point). In order to do so we established a correction factor using LUDOX.
Then we proceed to establish a fluorescein fluorescence standard curve using 4 replicates of fluorescein dilution series. This will allow us to convert cell based readings to an equivalent fluores"

My name is Pei Mu, from Shandong University. I am a positive, cheerful person and also an optimist. I was seldom seen sitting quietly reading a book. If that’s true, then it must be because I’m bored or tired. But most of the time, I’m full of energy and willing to talk to people. Besides, I love singing songs, especially the Beatles. E.g. Nowhere Man, Hey Jude. Etc. As a computer related student, I used to do my work with computer. Honestly, I like the feeling of typing or searching the internet. And of course, I like playing computer games. Anyone who also have the interest of the Beatles or computer game, welcome to communicate with me.

We also have had some certain courses teached by different teachers about biosafety ever before since we all major in bioengineering.
Q6. Who is responsible for the safety of biology labs at your institution? What are the guidelines for laboratory biosafety? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
Zhanyou Wang who is the vice president of our college (College of Life Science and Health, Northeastern Universtiy). Here are some guidelines of laboratory safety regulations:
Every students should consciously abide by the  laboratory disciplines and safeguard the order of the laboratory.
Must carefully prepare before experiments, familiar with the purpose of this experiment, principle, operation steps, Understand the significance of each operation steps and understand the use of instruments, otherwise you can't start the experiment.
Experim ental mesa should be clean and tidy, and instruments, medicines should be placed neatly. Common reagents should be covered tightly in place immediately after used up. Don't make the reagents, and drug sprinkled on experimental mesa. You are not be allowed to leave the laboratory untill you clean the mesa and ensure all the instruments are turned off.
Waste liquid will be poured into the water tank with water at the same time. Must use strong acid, strong alkali solution diluted by water. Waste paper and other solid waste can be throwed into a cylinder which can be dealt after experiment. Don't throw Into the sink or throw everywhere.
To achieve sterilization, open uv lamp for 30 to 60 minutes in sterile room space for 30 to 60 minutes.

ABSTRACT
PROGRESS
XMU's 2012 iGEM team has constructed a fluorescent digital display device with synthetic logic gates, which is able to respond to signals by displaying and switching numbers. We put GFP equipped with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a perfect device…

Week 15: August 8-14
Secretion
We repeated the transformation of the pDR111+signal peptide+mCherry plasmid into B.subtilis PY79.
We discovered that there was a mistake in one of our primers, so the signal peptide had an additional AAA (lysine). Therefore, we ordered a new primer.
With this problematic signal peptide, we tried our secretion protocol (see protocol here ). Apparently, there was a confusion with the samples, so we had no results.
Active team members this week: Ruth, Liron and Talk
Expression
Transformation of 3α-HSD between BBa_K1321338 and BBa_J06702 (containing mCherry)/ BBa_K1357008 (containing tsPurple) to E. coli BL21 - only those containing the gene for tsPurple showed purple colonies, indicating that in those, we have over-expression of our enzyme.
First activity experiment with E. coli BL21 containing 3α-HSD and one with no 3α-HSD as a negative control.  We concluded that the experiment was too short.
Another activity experiment with E. coli BL21 as before and DH5α with and without 3α-HSD.  The results had too much noise.
Active team members this week: Adi and Ruth
Cofactor
We performed an experiment over the course of 25 hours, checking the extracellular fluorescence (indicating NADPH levels) in E. coli BL21 with and without the zwf gene, as well as E. coli MG1655 with and without the gene knockouts, and with and without the zwf gene.      Our results showed expected extracellular NADPH levels between 12 and 20 hours, with the E. coli MG1655 with a knockout of the pgi and UdhA genes, but without the zwf gene, showing the highest extracellular NADPH levels.  We assume that this is either because of inadequate expression of the gene under the rhlR promoter and operon, or because the metabolic imbalance was too great and cause alternative pathways to help the cell balance its NADPH levels.

Rinse the pyrex bottle with water before the remnants solidify and become hard to remove.
Allow the plates to cool for at least 20 minutes until the agar has solidified. Flip the plates to prevent condensation forming on the agar. The plates can then be stacked and stored in plastic bags (ideally re-use the plastic bags that the plates come in.)
The LB agar plates should be stored in a 4oC freezer, should be good for 1-2 months
LB Leaving the lab
Prior to leaving the lab, you should:
Clean dirty glassware, or at least set aside the glassware to be cleaned by a designated individual.
Wipe down your workspace.
Ensure that all materials have been returned to their places, and that the plates have been properly stored in the fridge.

Protocol for SOC medium
Written by Katariina Jaenes
SOC Introduction
SOC is a variant of the rich media SOB (super optimal broth) with catabolite repression. This means that glucose is supplemented in the media, allowing for optimal metabolic conditions for the bacteria. SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high in nutrients, it is more easily contaminated than LB or King's B media.
SOC Safety Precautions

So we come to the third question. In fact, this situation won’t happen no matter whether our product is prescription medicines for assistant purpose. That is because the sugar nowadays we use is mostly Corn syrup. The growth of corn is all mechanized and at area of large scale of land, which is as they are like apples and oranges when it comes to sucrose farmers exploitation. That’s why most news about farmer exploitation focuses on cocoa beans or coffee beans instead of sucrose.  
There are always two sides to one coin. Everything has its own defect no matter how perfect it is. Facing the fault, what we should do is manage to solve it in preference to leaving it to the unsure factors in the future. Thank The Mingdao Voice for helping us passionately. It is this bilateral communication between science and humanities and social science that makes our project more specific and more mature to be closer to come true.

Denitrification
The purified PCR products for CarAc and AntB were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI+SpeI, EcoRI+PstI, and XbaI+PstI. However, only PSB1C3 plasmids that had been digested  with EcoRI+SpeI and EcoRI+PstI were available to attempt ligation. Gel results were inconclusive on the restriction digest product as the plasmid size appeared much larger than expected. However, transformation was still attempted on the ligation products for both genes (both using EcoRI+SpeI ligation into PSB1C3 plasmid). The transformation products were plated onto chloro plates to select for colonies that had the chloro resistance gene on the PSB1C3 plasmid. Also this week another round of PCR was performed for the Car and Ant genes, however all, but CarAc showed bands in the negative control lane, possibly indicating contamination or the formation of primer dimers. The CarAc bands were fairly weak and a PCR purification resulted in very low DNA concentration, insufficient to move onto restriction digest. Next week's plan hinges heavily on the result of the transformation from this Friday.
Desulfurisation
This week, we focused on amplifying dsz genes from our Rhodococcus strain for construction into biobricks. We also wanted to purify the PSB1C3-hpaC and pUC18-hpaC plasmids to replenish our current stocks. For the dsz aspect, we were able to successfully grow extra plates of Rhodococcus strain which was used to inoculate PCR tubes. The PCR did not go well, with significant streaking and false positives with similar banding pattern to previous gels run in the previous week. A final gel verification of a random sample of a tube of PCR products from dszA,B,C respectively and two negative control treatments involving master mix only and the lysed cells only illustrated the lack of discrepancy between the supposed successful amplification and the lysed cells (with lysate buffer) alone. Because of this we decided to take a different approach involving plasmid isolation carried out before PCR, rather than applying the PCR reagents directly to a lysed culture sample.
PSB1C3-hpaC verification through sequencing was successful, confirming the construction of our first biobrick. Subsequently, O/N cultures of the plasmid containing cultures were prepared and stored in glycerol at -80C. Furthermore, verification of catalase gene"

This year we chose to tackle two projects: Biofilms and Bees
At the beginning of the year, our team had many great project ideas. Over the course of a few weeks, we managed to narrow our options down to two projects—saving the bees, and eliminating biofilms. However, we could not decide between them. Both had their merits- saving the bees had a veritable cornucopia of human practices, but difficult, risky lab prospects. Biofilms had almost no human practices opportunities, but an amazing line to follow in lab. This was when one member of our team suggested that we co-develop these projects so that the strengths of one would make up for the weaknesses of the other. At that point, we decided to develop our projects together, and see where they lead us."

Arabidopsis - standar chassis in iGEM
Description
In biotechnology plants are mainly used for premeditation, for the obtainment of industrial products and to generate energy. For these reasons plant manipulation is a focus area in biological engineering. Unfortunately there is not a wide variety of  projects in iGEM using plants as a chassis and one of the main reasons is the lack  of information in the registry of these organisms.
Compared with other organisms used as models, the proportion of A. thaliana proteins have related counterparts in Eukaryota genomes, these varies by a factor of 2 to 3, depending on the functional category. Only 8-23% of A. thaliana proteins involved in transcription have related genes in other Eukaryota genomes, reflecting the independent evolution of many plant transcription factors.
In contrast, 48-60% of genes involved in protein synthesis have counterpart in other  eukaryota genomes, reflecting highly conserved gene functions. The relatively high proportion of matches between A. thaliana and bacterial proteins in the categories “metabolism” and “energy” reflects, both, the acquisition of bacterial genes from the ancestor of the plasmid and high conservation of sequences across all species.
Arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism that was previously described as chassis. In iGEM 2010, Harvard team used this plant to test their designed vectors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens; in 2012 the Kyoto team work with A. thaliana as model for the induction of flower formation by putting E. coli in the leaves.

BioHackspace Model: Collaboration
Introduction
Code
Introduction
The collaboration is dedicated to provide London BioHackspace iGEM Team an easy approach to simulate the 3D shape of their bacterial cellulose (BC) sculpture (JuicyPrint). The model can receive pattern for each layer of BC designed by users through spreadsheets and process the imported data to simulate a resulted 3D shape.
Below is a demonstration of the graphical user interface (GUI) for the model, which can review the pattern for each layer on the left and display the corresponding 3D structure created on the right. The GUI allows its user to manipulate the plot by zooming, moving, rotating and locating points on the structure. On the down right corner, the model can also calculate the total number of cell units induced by light, which will allow their wetlab to prepare the cell media more efficiently.

Waterloo,2017,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," formated showing each application’s general concept, how the application is used, the benefits and restrictions respectively.
Vaccine Preparation
General Concept
This foundational advance also has the opportunity to be introduced in vaccine preparation. Using prion aggregates or prion-like aggregated proteins, we could make a more effective vaccine to dissolve at a slower rate once introduced into the body. This works much to the same therapeutic effect as the lipid molecule squalane or other liposome encapsulated nanoparticles (Fox, 2009). The aggregated proteins are developed and used in vitro via biotechnology scale up methodologies.
Application
This can allow for a slow release of the vaccine being degraded at a slower and steady rate. Due to the variability of disease causing agents used in different vaccines, different prion-like proteins could be designed to adapt to each individual vaccine for optimal sustained degradation.
Benefits
Such a therapeutic could then be licensed off to larger biopharmaceutical firms with enough capital to sustain and develop a large enough commercial market to make a global difference in the innovative studies of vaccine preparation. But why is this therapeutic important? Sustained degradation of vaccines furthermore leads to fewer vaccine administration dosages. This means less cost for pharmaceutical firms to develop, and also gives a lower cost to the patient as well consuming fewer dosages.
Restrictions
Vaccine preparation and administration is already quite established within the biopharmaceutical market with minimal doses already given for many vaccines. Such innovation will be only given in niche vaccine drug deliveries based on the the restrictive properties of each pathogen coated with its respective prion-like proteins.

Increased Efficiency of Antimicrobial Peptides
General Concept
With the recent rise of antibiotic superbugs, alternative approaches to eliminate harmful bacteria are necessary. In 2015, researchers from Leuven, Belgium conducted a study to investigate the use of protein aggregates as a measure to kill bacteria. They proposed that the introduction of engineered antimicrobial peptides coding aggregate-prone sequences would induce bactericidal. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are known peptides that disrupt bacterial cell membrane and induce cell lysis. The aggregation of AMP is expected to not only amplify its efficiency but also corrupt proteolysis in bacteria, completely rendering their vital processes. Additionally, AMP has a multi-target mode of action, which makes it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance against them. More importantly, AMP only binds to bacterial transporter protein not found in mammalian cells, which makes them"

Only when these three significant influence factors are in the optimal region, the amount of butanol synthesis can be maximized.
Fig. 2    Response surface and contour plots for butanol production
2.4  Model verification
In order to verify the effectiveness of the optimization results, we conduct experiments again under the optimal conditions. We use  Gompertz model to fit the experimental data. The verification results are shown in Fig. 3. Butanol reached a maximum of 0.406g/L after 26h, which was 52.35% higher than the butanol yield of control group. This shows that our model is effective in improving the butanol fermentation system.
Fig. 3    Comparison of butanol production between the optimal conditions and the non-optimal condictions. The non-optimal fermentation conditions are as follows: temperature is 37 ℃, initial OD is 11, initial pH is 7. The optimal fermentation conditions are as follows: temperature is 33.7 ℃, initial OD is 13, initial pH is 8.
 
3. Biochemical reaction model
We first consider each reaction as an independent system. We assume that the seven-step chain reaction in the fermentation process is consistent with the Michaelis-Menten equation. The basic model of biochemical reaction can be obtained according to the Michaelis-Menten equation and the law of conservation of mass [6]. The basic model was modified due to the competitive effects of different substrates on the same enzyme and the inhibition of the product. Using MATLAB 2014a to solve the above model, and the curve of the output of each product with time was obtained.
3.1 Basic theory
3.1.1  Michaelis-Menten equation
In biochemistry, the Michaelis-Menten equation is one of the most famous enzyme kinetic models. This model gives the relationship between the enzymatic reaction rate v and the substrate concentration [S] and enzyme concentration [E]. For the following enzymatic reactions:
Where，\({k_f}\)(forward rate)，\({k_r}\)(reverse rate)，\({k_{cat}}\)(catalytic rate) denote the rate constants; the double arrows between S(substrate) and ES(enzyme-substrate complex) represent the fact that enzyme-substrate binding is a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation"

A G. lucidum polysaccharide GLB7 also decreases the production of oxygen free radicals and exerts anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor effects. One major mechanism of anti-tumor action includes polysaccharide-mediated potentiation of immune function, mostly due to beta-D glucans, which bind to leucocyte surfaces and serum-specific proteins and increase production of cytokines, interleukins, interferons, nitric oxides, and antibodies [5-13]. Other mechanisms include suppressing the growth of leukemia cells and inducing differentiation into mature erythrocytic cells [14], inhibition of DNA polymerase, and post-translational modification of oncoproteins [15-17].
Ganoderma lucidum’s anti-diabetic effects include hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities and inhibition of increased blood glucose without raising blood insulin levels [18]. This effect is supported by clinical tests in patients with confirmed Type II diabetes mellitus who experienced lowered blood glucose concentrations after treatment with Ganopoly (polysaccharide fractions extracted from G. lucidum) [19]. Other effects of the fungi vary from anti-allergic to estrogenic and hepatoprotective; a thorough review of Ganoderma lucidum's possible pharmacological effects is available [2].
The various biocompounds synthesized from this strain of fungi poses many possibilities for pharmacological development. However, there are also many challenges present in this endeavor. Pharmaceutical exploitation is still very limited due to the limited quantity of Ganoderma lucidum found in nature. Polysaccharides, ganoderic acids, and other metabolites have mostly been extracted from solid state cultivated fruit bodies, but methods of extraction from liquid cultivated mycelium still need to be thoroughly investigated [2].

The Procedure
Inoculation of 10 ml LB medium supplemented in a 100 ml shake flask with a single colony of B. subtilis. The overnight culture has to be incubated with agitation (220 rpm) at 37°C.
Collect the cells from 1.5 to 2 ml of the overnight culture in Eppendorf tubes by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in 200 ml lysis buffer.
Incubate the mixture for 30 - 60 min at 30°C in the lysis buffer to destroy the cell wall.
Spin down the cells for 5 min at 4,000 g and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the pellet in 400 µl DNA Lysis Buffer T and add 20 µl Proteinase K and 15 µl RNase A. Vortex for 10 seconds.
Incubate the sample for 30 min at 70°C on a shaker. Without thermo-shaker, vortex 3 times for 10 seconds in the incubation time.
Add 200 µl of the DNA Binding Buffer and mix gently. Add the whole sample to the column (with all the precipitants). After centrifugation for 1 min at 8,000 – 10,000 rpm, discard the flow through. Put the remaining solution into the column and repeat the centrifugation step.
Wash the DNA on the column with 650 ml with the DNA Wash Buffer complemented with EtOH. Each time, centrifuge for 1 min at 8,000 – 10,000 rpm and discard the flow trough.
Place the empty DNA column into the collection tube and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 8,000 – 10,000 rpm. This step is essential! Do not reduce the time!
Place the column into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf reaction tube. To elute the DNA, add 50 ml of buffer Elution Buffer (or sterile HPLC-H2O) that has been pre-warmed to 70°C and incubate the"

Intestinal Disease
The intestines, are crucial parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Their dysfunction often leads to problems in digestion and absorption, and can result in serious chronic diseases if not being treated properly. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of inflammatory conditions that affect the colon and small intestine.
IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affect the bowel linings. Crohn's disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition that results in inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. Signs and symptoms in IBD often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. It can be caused by many factors, including genetic factors, environmental factors, microbes and autoimmune conditions. It has a high incidence in developed countries, about 3.2 per 1,000 people in Europe and North America. It is less common in Asia and Africa, but rises rapidly along with economic growth.
Inflammatory bowel diseases are refractory diseases. It is often hard to diagnose at the earlier stage and it deteriorates with time and becomes chronic, therefore it reduces the quality of life and raises significant economic burden to the family. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease. Current management of Crohn's disease includes surgery, medications and fecal microbiota transplant. These treatments have limited effects on IBD.
Surgery
Ulcerative colitis can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy, although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms. This procedure is necessary in the event of: exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation, or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma.
Surgery cannot cure Crohn's disease but may be needed to treat complications such as abscesses, strictures or fistulae. Cro"

Overview
Flashbacter. Overview
To store information in computers, we use flip-flops, an electronic device that switches between two different states, called 0 and 1. The core of our project is the development of molecular systems that reproduce an electronic flip-flop, allowing the construction of living memory devices closer to the robustness of informatics.
This project’s idea comes from last year’s experience in the contest. Various iGEM teams have based their work on the construction of flip-flop biological systems, in previous editions of the competition. However, positive results have been more difficult to achieve than expected. UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular running.
In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick standard sequences and their inclusion in the Parts’ Registry.

Conclusion:
There is no significant difference in the pattern of normalized fluorescence values between using O.D. and particle count, as illustrated in Figure 4 and 5. The normalized fluorescence values of the devices are consistent with their respective promoter strengths, with device 1 (BBa_J23101) as the highest fluorescence value (i.e. 1791 a.u.) and device 3 (BBa_J23117) as the lowest fluorescence value (i.e. 162 a.u.). However, cell quantification by colony-forming units failed to reproduce the modeled cell concentration by silica beads. This may conclude that the two methods, CFU cell count and silica beads, may not be able to produce a consistent value of cell concentration.

Notes from the Writers
Hopefully we have revealed a simple trend: The scope of IP protections, both copyrights and patents, have grown in both the duration of the protection period, and the breadth of actual content that can be protected.. Now I pose a question to you the reader: why has the scope of these protections grown? What fueled this evolution of IP protections? If there is a trend or common theme that explains how and why IP protections have evolved over time, this theme would give us insight to how IP protections might change in response to new advances in synthetic biology. Please, join the conversation! Share your ideas! The best way to learn is to discuss. Follow the link to the iGEM forums, where you can join the conversation by commenting or starting a new thread.
Our two cents? We believe that IP protections have grown in scope in response to changes in technology, industry, and commerce. Remember that first form of IP protection from Renaissance era Venice? These protections emerged as a natural response to the growth and boom of new ideas: the governing body in Venice recognized the potential of unique ideas to bring revenue to the city, and in turn decided to protect individuals who develop new ideas. This in turn would stimulate more inventors to come to Venice, thus new inventions and ideas would emerge, and greater market competition would also be generated. All of this is good for growth, development and economy. Indeed, copyright protection in the United States grew in scope as a response to many, many different forces. To take one example, President Roosevelt heavily urged the implementation of the Copyright Act of 1909, saying,
“Our copyright laws urgently need revision. They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression; they omit provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.” [10]
In a time when new technologies, industries, and arts were emerging in America, Roosevelt echoed the frustrations of many individuals who felt the scope of the original 1790 Copyright Act to be inadequate. Musicians (in a time when music was booming in America), greatly benefited from this new copyright act, which allowed exclusive rights to artists to perform for-profit performances. Other new technologies, such as lithography or photoengraving, were also protected under this new act, further emphasizing how"

Pittsburgh,2016,Team:Pittsburgh#Project Overview_-_-_TEXT.html," is a byproduct of glassmaking, electronics factories, drug production, and the extraction of metals from ore ( EPA ). Like its periodic table neighbors, thallium is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans--in fact, it is more potent than lead. The EPA’s MCL for for thallium is only 2 ppb. Thallium is also known as the “poisoner’s poison” because it takes several days to kill, is odorless, and is tasteless. Thallium owes much of its toxicity to its size, which is similar to that of potassium, so thallium can easily enter cells via potassium pathways ( RSC ). In low doses, thallium causes hair loss and problems with the kidney, liver, and intestines, which can lead to vomiting and diarrhea ( ATSDR , EPA ).
Although thallium poisoning from drinking water does not pose a huge problem in most areas of the world, thallium’s high toxicity merits a powerful detection system. Current monitoring methods require extensive preparation and lab equipment, and they are not accessible to the general population ( NEMI ). Thus, we aim to develop an inexpensive, simple system that people can use to check for thallium in their drinking water.

In Vitro Protein Synthesis
We worked with our genetic circuit in vitro for two reasons. First, the paper-based sensor developed by the Collins group necessitates that the circuit works in cell-free extract. Second, and more important, protein synthesis in vitro bypasses the fickle cell. With a cell-free extract, we can add as many plasmids as we need to complete our detection circuit. Some of our constructs are also toxic to cells. Cell-free systems provide much more flexibility for the development of our sensor. We synthesized proteins in"
