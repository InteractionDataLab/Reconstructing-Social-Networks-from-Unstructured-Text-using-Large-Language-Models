Today we ran the minipreps for sac and ara transformed cells however- perhaps due to poor miniprep procedure- the sac test digest yeilded poor results, however the ara transformants miniprep gave a ~200bp band along with the backbone in 8/12 lanes:
Midi prep cultures were set up using cultures corresponding to lanes 1 and 3 for ara.
To test whether the poor sac result was due to the miniprep more miniprep cultures were set up to do tomorrow.
Today also we did fragment preps for Goksels sspb the ara fragment, and a cwlJ fragment for Hanny:
Metal Sensor Team
Introduction
In yesterday's lab session the Metal Sensing team carried out mini-preps on the 12 colonies of potential cotC-GFP-smtA E. coli transformants and analysed them. Despite them showing incorrectly sized bands when digested and ran on gel, the team proceded to carry out preparations to midi-prep colony 8 on the basis of consistency of the band patterns and the theory that the digests may not have worked properly. The midi-prep will be done today.
The team also prepared to ligate the cadA promoter to the BBa_J33206 BioBrick (which contains the arsR gene and arsR binding site and has the promoter cut out) but only got as far as digesting the two fragments. The cadmium-sensor has been put on hold as of the General Meeting on 16/09"

In blood plasma, haptoglobin binds free haemoglobin released from red blood cells, inhibiting its oxidative activity. The haptoglobin-haemoglobin complex can then be removed by the reticuloendothelial system which is a part of the immune system. Haemoglobin is still found free in the blood plasma at a concentration of up to 0.1g/l and engineered haptoglobin therefore has the potential to bind to, and potentially allow detection of, any free haemoglobin found in the environment.
The aim was to design a cell-free system using highly pure haptoglobin. This requires overexpression of the synthetic gene and purification, via an engineered affinity tag, of the recombinant protein and attachment to a carboxylate-modified fluorescent microspheres. So in theory, when our FluID is applied to a blood sample the haptoglobin will bind haemoglobin and allow for easy visual detection of the fluorescence given off.
Results
Firstly, Human haptoglobin, haemoglobin A and haemoglobin B were optimized for expression in E. coli and modified to ensure they were compatible with BioBrick specifications and standards. These genes were then synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) and we initially cloned them into pSB1C3 to give the following BioBricks; BBa_K1590000 , BBa_K1590001 , and BBa_K1590002 . The synthetic genes were then sub-cloned into the pQE80-L overexpression vector that adds an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag onto the protein which allows for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).
To characterise the interactions between haptoglobin and haemoglobin we wanted to use both in vivo and in vitro techniques. To do this, the idea was to carry out crosslinking experiments with the purified synthetic genes as well as a bacterial two hybrid screen with haptoglobin, haemoglobin alpha and/ or haemoglobin beta. Crosslinking is the process of chemically joining two or more molecules by a covalent bond. This attachment between groups on two different proteins results in intermolecular crosslinks that allow a protein-protein interaction to be stabilised, captured, and analysed using a western immunoblot.
The bacterial two hybrid screen, based off of the original yeast two hybrid system uses a reconstituted transcription factor and enzymatic activities to detect physical interactions between proteins. You can read more about the theory behind the bacterial two hybrid system, linked below.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics conclusions_-_-_TEXT.html," interest or due to insufficient data or unfamiliarity. The concerns that typically appear in literature include bio-safety, bio-security and intellectual property rights. Topics concerning attitude towards life, reductionism, transparency and public involvement that are relatively hard to address but nonetheless important, do not obtain the attention they deserve. Therefore we have propose different frameworks of the major ethical issues involved in synthetic biology, which can function as a potential reference for regulation and policy making. The different road maps illustrate a rough division of the main ethical issues in synthetic biology, differences between physical and non-physical harms in emerging technologies , ethical considerations from a synthetic biology practitioner's point of view and the connection between evolution, life, reductionism and the bottom-up approach in synthetic biology research.
The undervalued but key ethical issues in synthetic biology are mainly concerning reductionism and the bottom-up approach of creating living systems. Issues concerning safety, security and handling of intellectual property rights should mostly be related to politics not ethics. Although these topics need good regulation, ethics does not play a major part there. Instead there should be more focus on questions concerning life, specifically the reductionist (top-down) approach towards understanding life, and the bottom-up approach towards creating life. The reductionist approach in general, is a method to understand complex systems by understanding its subsystems, in synthetic biology specifically the molecular level is targeted to see how biological systems work. In the bottom-up approach systems are pieced together to give rise to bigger systems, as can be done in biology with genetic engineering principles. What happens if the reductionism approach will eventually show us what life is all about? What happens when humans can create living systems? We cannot foresee if research in synthetic biology will be able to reach those goals but since the scientific community is getting closer en closer to the foundation of living systems, these questions become much more important.
We have evaluated these omitted topics and reflected on them quantitatively by carrying out and analyzing a survey amongst 60 supervisors (and advisors) and 168 students, participating in the 2009 International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. The aim was to raise awareness on these particular subjects. Moreover, the collection of many opinions from this particular scientific community contributes to understanding synthetic biology, to see how ethical issues are perceived and to recognize which concerns should be addressed in regulating synthetic biology.
Conclusions from the survey
The first few questions were introductory to the main ethical issue: whether the reductionist approach in biology has any effect on our current perception of life and if so, how. The questions meddle with traditional and established viewpoints.
It seems that the possible negative effects of the pursuit of"

Figure 1.2.4 pBluescript II KS(+)
2. After checking the sequence of pBluescript II KS(+), we chose TTCGATATCAAGCT as the recognition sequence for test and designed TAL1.
Two kinds of connectee with TAL1 are shown below:
Figure 1.2.5 ssDsbA-mRFP-Lgt-TAL1-His Tag
Figure 1.2.6 TAL1-His Tag
3. Considering our multiple-enzyme system might be applied in the following experiment, we chose pRSFDuet–1(NOVAGEN) as the expression vector.
Figure 1.2.7 Expression
4. Similar to the cross-linked ChIP, we used formaldehyde to cross-link connectee and connector
5. After that we did immunoprecipitation to obtain the protein-plasmid complex and digestd protein.
6. Finally, we used PCR to check whether there was any existing plasmid DNA.
Two Convenient Parts:
In order to integrate TAL-Protein DiRepeats (BBa_K747000 to BBa_K747095) properly into our system, we also designed two corresponding parts; one is ssDsbA-mRFP-Lgt-TAL USB-His Tag (BBa_K1453000), the other is Lgt-TAL USB-His Tag (BBa_K1453006).
Figure 1.2.8 ssDsbA-mRFP-Lgt-TAL USB-His Tag
Figure 1.2.9 TAL USB-His Tag
The TAL USB of these parts all consist of T1 sequence, T14 sequence and two sites for type II restriction enzyme BsmBI. When digested with BsmBI, these parts produce two sticky-ends. One can complement with the first TAL-Protein DiRepeat (BBa_K747000 to BBa_K747015) at 5’of the sequence, while the other can complement with the sixth TAL-Protein DiRepeat (BBa_K747080 to BBa_K747095) at 3’.
With the rest of TAL-Protein DiRepeats (BBa_K747016 to BBa_K747079), users can synthesize a specific TAL protein to recognize their own connector and design their own polymerization. (Golden Gate Cloning)

Timeseries Labeller
A common task in the processing of visual, two-dimensional data, such as pictures of our 2D Biosensor is the assembly of time series.
To efficiently process the pictures taken by our WatsOn device, we programmed this software to automatically recognize timestamps from filenames.
Using the Timeseries Labeller
After files have been loaded into the software, the user can define a label that will appear on all pictures. The automatically recognized timestamps can be manually edited and the unit. The desired size of each frame can be adjusted before the images are processed.
After the files have been processed, they can easily be used to assemble a movie, or animated GIF with readily available tools.
Here, we provide both the executable and the sources as a single ZIP-file:

Introduction
Toehold improvement
Conclusions
Introducton
During the development of CAT-Seq system we have had the idea and opportunity to adjust the system to not only record the activity information about Catalytic Biomolecules, but also assess regulatory parts and their interactions.
One type of regulatory parts we have decided to assess were the Toehold Switches.
The Toehold Switch systems are composed of two RNA strands referred to as the Switch and Trigger. The Switch RNA contains the coding sequence of the gene being regulated. The Switch RNA forms a hairpin structure that includes the RBS site. While the hairpin structure is formed, the translation is inhibited. The Trigger RNA is a molecule that can selectively bind to the Switch RNA region and expose the gene RBS site for ribosomes. Once that happens, the protein translation can be initiated.
Toehold switch improvement
While designing the toehold sequence pairs we have noticed that there already is a highly similar toehold sequence in the form of a basic part ( BBa_K2486176 ). That said, even though we believe this part consists of a well working toehold switch, it is combined with Green Fluorescent Protein. Therefore, it is impossible to use this toehold switch with any other coding part a scientist or an engineer would like to control.
That is why we have re-designed this part to make it accessible for everyone to use it as a real basic part for translational control. First of all, the downstream GFP gene sequence was removed from BBa_K2486176 to liberate the Toehold riboregulator sequence from a particular gene and make it autonomous to any part.

Tsinghua-D,2012,Team:Tsinghua-D#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html,", thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  High temperature (42℃)  disrupts the bend and initiates the process of translation (3).
Figure 2.  a. Formation of stem III in  the rpoH transcript at low  temperatures (30 °C) induces a bend in the ribosome-binding site (RBS)-associated  downstream box (DB) region, thereby interfering with ribosome binding.  b. A  rise in temperature to 42 °C opens stem III and stem I of the rpoH mRNA, liberates the AUG start codon  and DB region, facilitates ribosome binding.
Inspired by such a mechanism, our  group designed a series of RNATs whose SD sequence will have trap-release  structural change according to the environmental temperature.  The following is the schematic diagram of the  RNATs we designed (Figure 3):
Figure 3.  Schematic diagram of the RNATs we designed.  The red box indicates the SD sequence.
 
The design of RNATs based on physical principles
To give RNAT sequences that meet  the given parameters, the central problem is to predict RNATs’ secondary  structure at a given temperature.  Two  methods are adapted according to the computer algorithm’s requirement. 
One principle adapted in  predicting RNA secondary structure is free energy minimization (4).  A secondary structure with the least free  energy is regarded to be the optimal solution (5).
Another principle adapted here is the  partition function method (6).   Rather than give one definite structure as the free energy minimization method,  the partition function gives the probability of each secondary structure’s appearance.  In the following equation, Q stands for the partition  function and P (structure) stands for the probability of one specific structure’s  appearance.
The design of RNATs adapting computer algorithms
The software RNAThermo for designing an RNA  thermometer is presented.  RNAThermo is  based on the Vienna RNA Package, which is a program for RNA Secondary Structure  Prediction and Comparison (7).
Before introducing RNAThermo, this is the  basic RNAT design problem: given regulation temperature, the structure of the  RNAT (both unmelted structure S1 and melted structure S2) and the SD sequence  position of the RNAT, find an RNAT whose SD sequence will be released from the  hairpin structure above the desired temperature.
A three-stage algorithm is designed to solve the  problem (workflow is present in Figure 4):  A set of sequences that fold"

Repression studies
Colonies were cultivated in the dark in the TECAN plate reader during 24 hours and GFP fluorescence intensity was measured during that time. It turned out that the fusion strategy 1 (full UVR8 directly fused to dTetR) represses most in the dark state.
Plans
In a next step we plan to measure also the derepression of the UVR8 dTetR fusion by screening its UV response with the plate reader and carry out single cell analysis by FACS and finally join UVR8 and pABA systems/RecA and show increased E.coli UV-B tolerance (sun cream properties).

Mycelium Glue
Figure 1: Lap Shear Adhesive Strength. Different bioadhesive candidates where applied to mycelium samples that were pressed together and allowed to set. Using the Instron 5565, the force necessary to separate the mycelium samples was then measured and converted to kPa accounting for the area of overlap between the mycelium samples.
As shown in Figure 1, all of our purified bioadhesive proteins successfully bound to baked mycelium substrate and produced non-negligible adhesive strengths. The CsgA-CBD and CBD4x fusion proteins were the most successful, with both reaching strengths of 28.2 kPa which is comparable to the tested strength of Elmer’s glue on mycelium at 32.1 kPa. Non-fusion CsgA was slightly weaker at 27.1 kPa on, and fp151 gave the poorest adhesive strength on mycelium at 16.8 kPa.
On a cardboard substrate (Figure 2) there are several notable differences from the mycelium substrate testing. Elmer’s Glue was again the strongest and more than doubled its bonding strength from the mycelium substrate test, to 78.1 kPa. CBD4x was surprisingly stronger than on mycelium, improving to 46.5 kPa. The fp151 protein also more than doubled in strength, reaching 40.6 kPa in the cardboard testing. Csga-CBD was weaker in the cardboard testing, at 22.7 kPa. The sample of csgA bound to cardboard was unfortunately dropped and was not salvageable for lap-shear testing.
Figure 2: Relative Mycelium Adhesive Strength. After testing the adhesive strength of each bioadhesive candidate on mycelium, we tested each candidate again on cardboard. We then took the ratio of adhesive strength on mycelium to adhesive strength on cardboard to determine the relative efficiency of the two substrates.
By taking the ratio of adhesive strength on mycelium to the adhesive strength on cardboard, we can find the relative efficiency of the adhesives on the two substrates. Every adhesive except for csgA-CBD bonded stronger on cardboard substrate than the mycelium substrate. This could be due to cardboard having a more uniform surface and thus allowing better molecular bonding and glue function. This makes it very notable that csgA-CBD was a stronger adhesive on mycelium, and provides evidence that by adding the chitin binding domain to csgA we were able to successfully make the protein"

Mealworms
Mealworms have been treated similar to mites. To feed them the phage library, a 1 cm² piece of boiled carrot has been injected with a phage solution. Per round and tested library, 5 mealworms were kept with flour, oat flakes and the piece of carrot in a large petri dish. They were kept at RT overnight in darkness.  To obtain the phages for the next round, the mealworms have been dissected and the guts of 5 mealworms have been homogenized with 1,5 mL of SM buffer. The resulting solution was spun down in a micro-centrifuge for 15 min at max speed. After that, the supernatant was filtered with a 0,2 µm filter. The resulting phage containing solution was then used for determination of the phage titre and for the next round of phage display.
In vitro Phage Display
For the in vitro phage binding display, the protocol of Giordano et al 3 . has been adapted.
1) 20 µL of vesicles were incubated at ice for 3 h with 5 µL of phages, resulting in a start titre of 10^8 PFU.
2) The vesicles were added into an aquaeous phase of LB with 1 % BSA inside of an organic phase consisting of (1:9) cyclohexane:dibutylphthalate inside of a 15 ml tube.
3) The tubes were spun down at 4000xg for 1h at 4°C.
4) The tubes were incubated in dry ice for 30 min.

Results
Transformation of A. niger requires the generation of protoplasts, which is a delicate process, and somewhat more cumbersome than the making of competent E. coli cells. After transformation the protoplasts take 3-4 days to grow. Interestingly, we observed growth on all the plates, including the negative controls, in which untransformed protoplasts were left to grow on plates containing high doses of geneticin.
On the left two plates with 60µg/mL geneticin and on the rigth two plates with 220µg/mL geneticin are shown. The control plates are also included on the right side of the two pictures.
Discussion
In literature study it was mentioned that geneticin has an inhibitory concentration between 60 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL for Trichoderma atroviride. For this reason we selected the concentrations mentioned above. We conclude that our A. niger strain, which is closely related to the standard ( and fully sequenced CBS strain ), is not sensitive to geneticin. Though it is possible that the geneticin resistance gene works properly in other Eukaryotes, we conclude that it is unsuited as a selection marker for Aspergillus niger.

BIOFILM ENGINEERING
What are biofilms?
Biofilms are communities of microbes where the cells are in an aggregate on a surface, bound together by extra-membrane material made of a mixture of specialized carbohydrates and extra-membrane proteins. The special environment in the biofilm allows cells to survive harsher environments.
What is the “biofilm response”?
Bacteria cells can exist in multiple physiological states, which are caused by environmental factors. Common ones include heat shock, nutrient (carbohydrate or amino acid) starvation, metal micronutrient starvation, etc.
Gene expression in each of these physiological states is mediated by the changing the sigma factor involved in transcript synthesis. Each sigma factor has its own consensus sequence; the sigma factor on the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to promoter regions. When a sigma factor is active, its effect is to shift which fractions of the genome are preferably expressed, because of the different promoter recognition consensus sequences. The sigma factor that is involved in the stationary phase (I.E. no motility, no reproduction) of E. coli strains is the σS factor. It directs the expression of genes necessary to induce biofilm and aggregation behavior are a subset of those genes whose promoters are recognized by the σSfactor.
Modulating and Measuring the Biofilm Response
The focus of our project is to characterize the physical and chemical manifestations of the biofilm response in cells where key genes in the biofilm response (for both structural and regulatory aspects) have been either overexpressed or deleted. The numerous assays that need to be done drove us to develop a standardized battery of assays, so that the cell can be studied as an entire system, as opposed to the methods used in past literature that only measured the effects of genetic engineering on just one manifestation.
Defect in the Biobrick Paradigm
The Biobrick paradigm is that gene parts are necessarily additive, due to the mechanics of the Biobrick Assembly method. Consequently, apart from by using “additive” exotic methods such as RNAi to disrupt gene expression to achieve functional gene silencing, gene deletions from a genome (negative “additive” modifications) simply cannot be submitted to the Gene Parts Registry.

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2015,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#CFPS_-_-_TEXT.html,". Aliquots were diluted in 990 µL of water, then 20 µL of these samples were plated on LB. For details see notebook .
After the subsequent centrifugation steps according to the protocol , we took aliquots in the same manner. Viable cell numbers on the plates were even lower, touching one-digit levels.
Cell disruption efficiency summarized
During our project, we continued to investigate how many cells survived the process of sonication. Our goal was to create highly active but completely cell-free extract. In our fully optimized extract, a 100 µL aliquot of flash-freezed crude cell extract contained only 8 colony forming units (CFU). Although 8 colony forming units in crude cell extract are still too many in purposes of biosafety issues, we conclude that our sonication is extremely efficient in decreasing viable cell numbers. Strikingly, our final biosensor device based on freeze-dried extract did not contain any living E. coli at all, like you can see here. We can therefore proudly say that our methods are excellently suited to construct a complete cell-free environment coming from liquid cultures. Keep on reading to learn about how our extract performed in producing reporter proteins!
Our reporter construct
Most CFPS approaches are based on T7 polymerase and its corresponding promoter (see background page ). We therefore used T7 transcription machinery in our cell-free expression experiments, which turned out to be a good idea: In tests with endogenous σ70-polymerase and non-T7 promoters we observed very low protein production (for details, see heavy metal result page).
An ideal reporter protein for in vitro protein synthesis is superfolder GFP, abbreviated sfGFP ( Lentini et al. 2013 ). In our first experiments with self-made E. coli cell extract, we used sfGFP under control of the T7 promoter ( PT7-sfGFP ) from the parts registry.
Experimental setup
To perform in vitro expression of sfGFP from a DNA template, first we had to set up the reaction. To do so, we combined the three necessary components which are: Our previously described cell extract, the DNA template and eventually the reaction buffer with energy source, amino acids and cofactor mixture . Final reaction volume was 20 µL, and reactions were performed in a 364 black microwell plate at 37 °C. In these inital experiments, we used a FLUOstar microplate reader to measure fluorescence at 515 nm, exciting at 480 nm. Unfortunately the device had seen better days and could not heat nor shake, therefore reactions had to be interrupted"

       Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) gave us the opportunity to achieve our project by supporting us from the beginning. Their help came from different entities: from the LIBST (Louvain Institute of Biomolecular Science and technology, to the SST (Secteur des Sciences et Technologies), the SSS (Secteur des Sciences de la Santé) the School of Biology,  and finally, Jean Christophe Renauld, research Pro Rector of the UCLouvain."
Glasgow,2016,Team:Glasgow#beta-carotene_-_-_TEXT.html," into the various forms of vitamin A [3] .
Current treatment – high dose supplementation
Many developing countries have implemented high-dose supplementation of preformed vitamin A, administered every six months to attempt to overcome deficiencies. This is a dose large enough to be considered toxic, resulting in bone swelling, nausea/vomiting, poor appetite as well as many other symptoms. Acute toxicity is considered to occur when adults and children consume over 100 times and over 20 times the required daily allowance of Vitamin A, respectively [4] . Although the benefits of high-dose supplementation in combating vitamin A deficiency has been documented, few studies have confirmed the safety of such large doses in humans, instead focusing on how well the deficiency has been improved e.g. in curing night blindness [4] .
In Africa, two trials of one dose each of 300,000 and 400,000 IU (international units) were conducted using an animal model.  It was shown that, although a single large dose of preformed vitamin A increased maternal liver stores dose dependently, the theoretical contribution to the nursing infant and an actual increase in piglet liver vitamin A was not observed with increasing dosage [4] . These supplementation doses have not been studied enough to properly understand the short- and long-term effects for both the mother and the nursing infant.
Golden Rice
One of the most widely known projects to help deal with malnutrition is the Golden Rice project. Golden rice was developed to combat vitamin A deficiencies in developing countries [5] . The golden rice project goal was based around producing GM rice which contains highly elevated levels of pro-vitamin A, as normal rice lacks pro-vitamin A in the endosperm, the edible part of the plant.
The first version of Golden Rice was made by introducing a daffodil gene encoding phytoene synthase (psy) and carotene desaturase from the bacteria Pantoea ananatis. Unfortunately, a maximum level of only 1.6 μg/g of carotenoids was synthesised, and so it failed to produce pro-vitamin A in quantities large enough to have any significant effect [6] . It hypothesised that the daffodil gene was the limiting step in β-carotene accumulation and so a further iteration, dubbed Golden Rice 2.0, using the phytoene synthase gene from maize instead. This change substantially increased the carotene accumulation in a model plant system, with reports showing a maximum level of 37 μg/g of carotenoids of which 25 μg/g was β-carotene. However, the actual"

We continued to have issues with washing our biofilm during the biofilm assay without losing significant portions of the biofilm. We tried several different methods and found that the most consistent way to treat the biofilm during the assay is to pellet and resuspend the biofilm with each wash, allowing us to wash our sample without losing the biofilm itself.

Constraints Repository
Aim:
Develop a system that will be a repository of constraints that specify the way biological components can be assembled, and the parameters that describe their interactions.
Components of a biological circuit can only be combined in ways which make biological sense. Much of this information is available in publications and public databases, but these are distributed worldwide and do not necessarily have compatible formats. The information therefore needs to be stored and described somewhere which is accessible to the rest of the projects, in a single, coherent form.
The objectives of the Constraints Repository (CR) were to:
To mine literature and public databases to determine all of the relevant constraints and associated parameters for the interactions between a defined set of biological components.
To develop a database to capture the information gathered on constraints between two or more biological components. The database includes models based on the kinetic parameters between the biological components. The database must define the type of interactions involved.
To demonstrate that the database is capable of validating or rejecting an interaction between two biological components in a given context. This function contributes to the construction of genetic circuits.
To develop an agreed interface to other system components. This project was part of the international genetically engineered machines competition (iGEM). There were three other computational projects responsible for different aspects of the software development. To facilitate communication between the projects, a standardized interface was produced.
To explore the use of integrating data sources for populating data. The construction of this repository required the application of varied data sources. To effectively analyze the constraints, these sources were adapted into a consistent format to permit the integration and analysis of data in the repository.
Outcomes
A prototype datasheet has been designed for one of the well characterized BioBrick devices from the MIT registry of Standard Biological Parts. This feat has been the closest attempt to creating the said required tool.
Since the tool constructed in this project aims to describe the interactions between the components listed in the “BugBuster” and not MIT parts registry, only the interactions between these parts are considered. Although the parts themselves are not existing BioBrick parts, the Newcastle Team intend to make the necessary modifications to add the “BugBuster” parts to the MIT parts registry as novel BioBricks parts and devices.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

Figure 6: TALE capture assay was done with TALE B  ( BBa_K1189001 )and TALE A B-lac fusion ( BBa_K1189031 ) and DNA ( BBa_K1189006 ) with both target sequences. If capture is successful, the B-lac is present in the well giving a colour change from pink to yellow when subjected to benzylpenicillin substrate solution within 20 minutes. The only wells that change colour are the first four wells which contain TALE B, specific DNA, and TALE A β-lactamase fusion and our positive control wells which are the controls for our fusion TALE A β-lactamase protein and our positive recombinant β-lactamase. All our other controls including our test using a non-specific sequence of DNA remained pink . This preliminary characterization data demonstrates that the TALEs are able to bind to DNA with specificity. Additionally it also shows that our system of capturing DNA with two detector TALEs and then subsequent reporting of the DNA’s presence works.
This assay shows that we can capture our target DNA with two detector TALEs with specificity. Additionally, we can report whether that DNA has been captured and is present in the sample, which is an essential concept for our sensor system.
Full System Kinetic Model
With a preliminary understanding of how our system works we proceeded to quantitatively model our entire system . To do this we used the kinetic constants found in our experiments from the TALE and prussian blue ferritin characterization to build a deterministic model in Scilab. We modelled the binding of an immobilized TALE to target DNA in solution and then the subsequent binding of one of our ferriTALEs. We then used the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of our prussian blue ferritin to calculate how quickly it converts TMB into the coloured product that we can see.
When we assembled our reactions into differential equations, we generated 6 equations to cover the change in our 6 variables over time. When this equation was run with the amount of DNA present in a super shedding cow the output chemical, X, changes over time as shown below.

It allows both the importing of devices from repositories as well as the submission of newly created parts to these same repositories. In terms of manipulating the design, BioJADE provides four aspects. These are Schematic, DNA, Functional, and Icon.  As shown, Schematic presents a traditional schematic editor view for the design of logic circuits. The DNA aspect illustrates the actual DNA nucleotide sequence of the design. Functional Network presents a closer view of the layout of the DNA. It is similar to the DNA aspect but allows the user to edit the sequence.   The Icon aspect allows the designer to create icons for parts to be used in the schematic aspect. Input, output, and undefined terminals are specified either as a static number or as dynamic (added at runtime).  Finally, BioJADE offers a simulation mode where the design can be simulated. It interacts with simulators like Stochastirator [3]  or Tabasco [4].
BioStudio
BioStudio is the work of researchers at Johns Hopkins University (Joel Bader, Jef Boeke, and Sarah Richardson).
This is taken from BioStudio press release material at Computational Challenges in Synthetic Biology 2006 Awards
We propose BioStudio as a collaborative integrated design environment (IDE) providing editing and revision control for synthetic genomes. Windows SharePoint Services and SQL Server will provide back-end support. The server middle-layer will extend existing open-source visualization-only software (GBrowse) with editing functions, including a BioBricks palette, and will communicate with the back-end using .NET and FrontPage Remote Procedure Calls. Genome sequence and annotations will be stored in XML with an adapter to the Generic Feature Format (GFF) standard. Synthetic biology teams will connect with a web browser client. Development and testing will proceed in conjunction with an in-house project to engineer a synthetic yeast cell that encodes a combinatorial satisfiability experiment to identify a minimal genome. Our physical-level editor is complementary to logical-level design tools such as BioJADE. It provides a multiscale visualization metaphor that enables non-computer-scientist teams to collaborate on documents that are too large for ""Track changes"" and too critical or interdependent to be consigned to a Wiki. Software will be released under a BSD license.
In addition to BioStudio there is an interactive web site called Gene Design .

USTC-Software,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," A-targeted promoter with gene sequence of B in advance to achieve that the concentration of A will be commensurate with that of B, thus designing pathways between arbitrary input and output substances.
Externalization: Since we aim at providing synthetic biologists a user-friendly and helpful tool to design gene circuit, concrete biology entities should not be omitted. Abstract inputs and outputs will be substituted by specified substances chosen scrupulously in case cross talk or other mutual reactions undermine the functionality of designed gates. Although the choice of appropriate promoters, RBS, transcription factors can be intractable, a library of prototype substance for inputs and outputs together with experiment-based sequence design will enable us to build more complex gene circuits. Unrealizable complexity is far from the pursuit of synthetic biologists, based on wet-lab experiments, reasonable rules will be introduced into our software to preclude those gates heavily taxing engineering bacteria.
Library Enrichment: More effective and functional logic elements and sequences, even some Boolean gates with memory are expected to be added into our library. The trend of synthetic biologists designing more biobricks with logic functions and submitting them to Standard Biobrick Registry requires more sophisticated and elaborated parameters to measure the usability of designed gene circuits and biobricks. A user administration system or community may be helpful to setting standards for biobrick measurement and evaluation.
Accuracy: Improving the accuracy and predictability of our simulation is another critical work undergoing. Although stochastic simulation can shed great insight on the performance of designed gene circuits, more work can be done in the future. To analyze designed circuits more comprehensively and thoroughly, several different simulation methods will accompany stochastic simulation in our software.
Platform: Our software is developed to help biologists to construct functional gene circuits in lab. The complex nature of a biological system calls for collaboration between different tools. Although many software teams before have developed many computer-aided design tools, a platform for different tools to work together has not been well developed. In order to best design functional gene circuit, our software hopes to provide a platform where function-related tools can be integrated to work together.
Validation
General thesis
A convincing validation of BioBLESS includes two aspects. One is whether our simulation results correspond to the inputted truth table and the other one is whether the simulation results of designed gene circuits satisfy the experimental results which have been realized in lab. Furthermore, there are two factors that matter a lot in analysis part of BioBLESS, ACCURACY and APPLICABILITY. Accuracy describes how well our algorithms can simulate the realistic experimental results and applicability determines whether designed gene circuits from truth table can be applied in real experiments"

Igem Xuzhou communication meeting
  Northeastern    University  
rPeking University
    On July 14, 2018, we came to Peking University for a collaboration and exchanged ideas with Peking University's IGEM team.
    After the self-introduction, we introduced each other's projects and proposed suggestions on the project. The project of Peking University's IGEM team is to design a protein scaffold to increase the enzymatic reaction rate and yield, and hope to be applied to industrial production. In the exchange, we raised our confusion and exchanged experimental design.
    Later, we introduced our own projects, and Peking University students also made opinions for the improvement of our projects. In addition to considering whether urate oxidase can be expressed and correctly modified in E. coli nissle, we should also consider whether UOX can pass through the intestinal wall cells from the intestinal tract into the blood, rather than being ""absorbed"" by the intestinal wall cells. In addition, due to the existence of certain immunological rejection of human uric acid oxidase, the immune response of UOX in the blood is also a problem that I must think about and solve.
    During the collaboration and exchange with Peking University's IGEM team, we saw each other's bright spots and re-examined our projects from a new perspective. In such exchanges and thoughts, we believe that we will find problems in our thinking, improve our projects, and make progress together to showcase the charm of Chinese students on the international stage of IGEM.

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#Project#Overview#UVA_-_-_TEXT.html," strain. TOP10, DH5α, DS941 and MG1655 strains were our possibilities. UV light causes mutations, so the strain must be able to repair it's DNA. E. coli has a group of Rec proteins which are involved in DNA repair during recombination, and have been modified in laboratory strains to allow for better plasmid transformation and growth.
We predicted that the recA- mutants (TOP10 and DH5α) would be adversely affected by UVA exposure as it is central to the DNA repair mechanism that UVA damage would require, whereas DS941 is a recF mutant, which is a less crucial mechanism so cells may be less adversely affected by UVA exposure. MG1655 (wild-type for recombination) was used a control strain.
Method
1ml 10x serial dilutions were made up to 10-6 from a 5ml overnight of each strain. 10µl spots of each dilution were then spotted onto LB agar plates.  These plates were then exposed to 50µM/m2/sec of UVA at room temperature in illumination cabinets. Time points were then taken by removing plates from the illumination cabinet.
After illumination, plates were incubated at 37°C, under the assumption that every single viable cell will form a colony. The length of incubation is irrelevant, provided that every cell is given enough time to form a visible colony. This also forms the basis of our counting system, where a colony is assumed to have come from a single cell. We also make the assumption that cell division at the temperature and time we were running the experiment was negligible/nonexistent.
After incubation, the colonies on each spot/dilution were counted. The number of colonies from the lowest visible dilution (some dilutions formed a lawn of growth) were then multiplied by the dilution factor to approximate how many cells would be in 10µl of undiluted culture.
Results
As shown in Figure 7, TOP10 and DH5α cell counts drop dramatically after 20 minutes. DS941 and MG1655 show some variation, but do not appear to be as adversely affected as the recA- mutants. Therefore DS941 was chosen as our chasis.

Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
    All our work is supervised by PhD students, PhDs and professors of our university who are very experienced in lab work and are currently working in genetics / molecular biology. We document our work in our lab notebook to enable replicability and prevent unnecessary errors. In the case of an error, we are able to locate its source and correct it next time. Our project does not pose any dangers to researchers or the public: We are following widely used lab protocols in a appropriate lab facility (biosafety level 1 laboratory). The organisms used in our project, namely Escherichia coli (TOP10 strain) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are well-known and considered safe. Although, by building a biosensor we are tackling an environmental problem, our system is not intended to be used in the field but in a lab only. Users of our system are supposed to take samples from close waters, such as rivers and lakes, and add our modified yeast strain. We are working at a biosafety level 1 laboratory, which implies several methods for guaranteeing safety to researchers and environment are constantly enforced but research is limited to well known and nonhazardous species.
 
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
    We have designed 3 different types of BioBricks. Membrane bound receptors for sensing hormones, a small inverter system to regulate our reporter gene, and the reporter gene itself. None of these are found toxic or dangerous by any means. The receptors we use are synthesized after genome-sequences of Danio rerio and Xenopus laevis, both are commonly used model organisms in biology. The rest of the genes and promoters are extracted from the S. cerevisiae genome via PCR. All of the parts we use are expressed in wildtype organisms and are not known to"

About protocol
As it is of common knowledge, iGEM is carried out within the framework of a protocol common to all teams. Whereas most of the teams are registered on this page, we have uploaded not only the English protocol but also the Japanese one, e.g., our mother tongue version. This is the common protocol with some improvements after we translated it into Japanese. Publishing the Japanese protocol in will be of help to other new Japanese teams in the future. Furthermore, this will be linked to an improvement of iGEM’s name identification in Japan and will enhance the public recognition of synthetic biology. It will also promote Science and Communication among people within not only the scientific but with the non-scientific communities as well. We believe that these improvements will constitute a contribution to the illustration of the public in general.

1) The membrane permeability (k1).[2][3][4]
2) Intracellular slow degradation rate (k2).[5]
3) Intracellular fast degradation rate (k3) dependent upon a finite capacity (g), e.g. NADPH                         levels in naive cells.[6]
We reviewed the above literature and combined the results of the wet experiment, as shown in Fig.3,                     to determine the parameters required for the model simulation, listed in the table below.

Experimental result
To verify the feasibility of the model and to confirm this dynamic process, we did some experiments                     using our system's output, roGFP2-Orp1. The results show that the fluorescence ratio value                     I405/I488, an oxidant condition indicator, decreased by time when S. cerevisiae exposed to                     different concentrations of H2O2. This ratio's decreasing stands for the                     increasing of                     intercellular H2O2 concentration. It also stopped at a stable concentration at last, which's                     correspond to our model's result.

Summary
In this model, we successfully simulated the kinetics of extracellular and intracellular H2O2 changes over time. Furthermore, the dynamic process of fluorescence ratio value by time was                     detected by using roGFP2-Orp1 green fluorescent protein in wet experiment, and the feasibility of                     the model was further verified.

Concentrations before PCR amplification are shown. Negative control contained                           the treated plasma without any target sequence.
After having encountered some difficulties with the amplification, it turned out that the reduction of the concentration of primers in the reaction (250 nM instead of 500 nM) do increase the specificity, as it has been already demonstrated                       in other Cas-based systems ( Gootenberg et al., 2018 ).
Indeed, we did not have any amplification in our negative control, which shows that no background DNA present in the plasma has been amplified. The correct sized amplicon was obtained once again, with 10 pM template being amplified                       more than the 10 fM, which is coherent with our hypothesis.
The Cas12a detection assay was performed afterwards separately using the PCR reactions as DNA substrates (activators). Results are shown in the Figure 5.
Figure 5. Results of the Cas12a detection assay (average fluorescence; n=4 replicates after 250 minutes; bars represent the standard error here). The assay was performed using as template the amplified region 2 of BRAF mutated                           fragment (that contains the BRAF V600E mutation) for respectively 10 pM and 10 fM before PCR amplification. Binding specificity was tested with two different crRNAs (one complementary, i.e. crRNA T, and one with mismatch). Please                           refer to Figure 1 in order to have an overview of the crRNAs/DNA fragments used for this experiment.
Again, the specificity of the RNA guiding DNA binding was demonstrated at different sensitivity levels.
The activation was excellent when our activator (10 pM before amplification) was targeted with the complementary crRNA guide sequence, with more than 4-folds difference in fluorescent signal when targeted with the point mutated one.                       10 fM activator yielded a lower fluorescent signal when targeted with a complementary crRNA (and nearly no signal at all when a single point mismatch was present), which is in agreement with the hypothesis that a higher concentration                       of targeted DNA present in the reaction will significantly increase the Cas12a collateral endonuclease activity, resulting in an overall increase in fluorescence. This is indeed confirmed by the gel (Figure 2) that shows more efficient                       amplification for the 10 pM fragment.

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html,"asmid DNA extraction. After explaining the concept of it, we divided them into six groups, and chose a leader from our team members for every group. Most of the students had never used pipette before, which made them tense but eager to try. After all, what we students usually use are always droppers, beakers…and so on. 
Highlight :
Based on the reference from the WHO, the amount of calorie we consume from refined sugar should not exceed 10% of daily sugar intake.
Refined sugar added in items that can be called “heath food” should not exceed 25 grams, which is half of daily sugar intake for adults. Also, items with more than 50/3 grams of refined sugar should be labeled.
If a product is only to be positioned to a kind of common food, it won’t be required to pass any examination procedures. But, if it is to be a health food warranted by the government, it is necessary that you pass the inspections on food additions and ingredients.
The list of food additions that could be used is now available on the internet. Manufactures are required to hand in their examination result themselves.
The reason why GMO products do not prevail in Taiwan is not related to the regulations. Governing ministries will only require GMO products to be labeled because some people is still suspicious about the safety problems. 
If after 5 years, a new regulation is enacted, and the standard is adjusted, we will examine the product with the new standard again.
Before commercializing, a product could go through either human clinical trial or animal study. 
There is something needed if a product are to be commercialized:
(a.)    The effect of the product must be testified
(b.)    Descriptive data about:
- The bacterial strain used
- How it was grown and preserved 
- How its DNA strand in reconstructed 
- Whether any toxic or allergic reaction is found
Conclusion
As students being unfamiliar with the procedure of law, we understood the inspection standard of laws about health food and GM food after interviewing the section manager, Mr. Chou, which gave us a new angle of sight to reexamine the position of our product.

Introduction 
The Food Industry Research and Development Institute (FIRDI)is a non-profit research institution in Taiwan. Established in 1965, the main work includes product development, biological resources preservation (gene bank for instance), biological inspection (such as paternity tests).In addition, it also has a section to store umbilical cord blood.
Motivation 
During our last time’s meet-up with NCTU,"
Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#schoolclassatlab_-_-_TEXT.html, to interpret scientific data and test for CRY1Ab was used to teach analysis of their own results and draw conclusions from it. We discussed possible errors and what information they obtained from the corn samples. The pupils were excited to learn new methods as such experiments are usually not carried out in school. The experiments led to a lot of questions concerning the theoretical background and resulted in a vivid discussion.
USTC,2016,Team:USTC-Software#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," Some participants told us that solving them manually was often a harsh job and there might probably be miscalculations in the result, which was a huge cost of time. We paid attention to this demand. Therefore we asked our programmers to design the module ""Simulation"" and module ""BLAST"" which was exactly made for those who want to delegate this time-consuming work to machines.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, in September we packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful, so was the Module:Simulation.
While, this time several students told us that the solution function of the simulation may be unstable after a certain period of time, he wondered if we can find out the critical point which divided the stable state and the unstable one. We are convinced that it should be concerned. Thus we worked it out soon. At the second time biology students used our software, more of them approved it. Some users became optimistic on our project and expected for the issuance of a formal version.

Subsequently, they mentioned that, in their city, the foulbrood that represents a problem is the European, which occurs when bees have limited accessibility to pollen due to the few flowering throughout the year. Previously we had read about this disease; however, it was from this meeting that we investigated more about it and after validating the theoretical efficacy of our antimicrobial peptides of interest against this disease, we decided to address it as part of the pathogens to combat with our product.
Finally, they congratulated us for our research and stressed the importance of feedback between researcher and producer since this way we can collaborate in a more effective way, guaranteeing a bidirectional communication. They invited us to continue attending their meetings and MSc Alejandro Romo, a researcher at the Center for Food Research and Development (For its acronym in Spanish: CIAD), offered us to experiment with his bees in his laboratory in Cuauhtémoc.
After this meeting, our project changed to production of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli for the inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius

In addition to the education of the public about synthetic biology, we feel that it is very necessary to investigate the protection and management of lakes in Wuhan in general, and so we cooperated with the HBUT Dandelion Volunteer Service Team. We conducted questionnaire surveys among ordinary citizens, interviewed government departments, and visited private lake protection organizations to understand the current status of lake protection and management in Wuhan. We designed a set of questionnaires, and then we generated a report summary of these results, in the hope that we can gain inspiration from the research results, confirm the effectiveness of our project, and provide a theoretical basis and significance for our envisioned machine. Finally, we will strengthen our project and practice our experimental results, which will contribute to the lake protection work in Wuhan.

INSPIRATIONS
During the interviews with the Wuhan Lake Management Bureau, the Aihu Baihu Volunteers Association, and the Research Lake Park Management Office, HBUT-China introduced them to the design ideas of our team's project, the theoretical basis of the biology, and the experiment expectations. A staff member of the Wuhan Lake Protection First Line working in the Wuhan Lake Administration has expressed interest in our project and was very supportive of our work. He appreciated us, and his evaluation of our work was very encouraging.
He said: ""You are a very good team, make full use of your spare time, based on the knowledge you have learned and even explore deeper knowledge. In order to design topics that benefit the city, the country and the world, let the world change through research. Better. There are many heavy metals that cause water pollution. Your project is to measure the nickel ion concentration. I hope that you can make a test project more specific and more systematic. At the same time, measuring only heavy metal concentration is not enough, you can try to solve the pollution problem. In any case, I am very happy to see that the team of college students like you are actively designing to help solve the environmental pollution problem. I hope that you will continue to work hard and make the project better and better.""
He expressed his hope that our final experimental results will meet our expectations.
Our publicity can help people improve their environmental awareness. We also hope that our project will be improved and applied to help relevant departments deal with and reduce water pollution.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," diet that is rich in lycopene, which given the price and availability of these fruits, especially watermelon, could in the long term be a more economical solution.
DESIGN
We combined the lycopene BioBrick already existing in the registry with the NarK promoter in order to control the expression of lycopene. The BioBrick falls into two parts:
Sensing The promoter senses oxidative stress and in response turns on transcription of the downstream genes.
Responding The gene for the antioxidant, lycopene is turned on as a response to oxidative stress.
Lycopene-NarK initial design:
 
 
Simplified diagram of our lycopene BioBrick. Further design steps:
1. Removal of illegal restriction sites within the gene through silent mutations.
2. In order to minimise the time to receive DNA from IDT, design steps were taken in order to put these into gBlock format. This required splitting up of the rather large gene construct into 4 parts of around 500 bp as well as consideration for the collating of the parts into one by Infusion.
The final outcome was a composite BioBrick, BBa_K1954001 , which we submitted to the registry.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We wanted to find validated protocols for the expression and detection of lycopene. Firstly we wanted to induce oxidative stress. After several options were considered, from nitrogen gas to hydrogen peroxide we went with a protocol involving nitrate, nitrite and NO. Secondly we wanted to measure lycopene. We adapted the protocol used by Cambridge 2009 iGEM as they had success and produced data, suggesting we would also be able to follow this.
The detection of Lycopene is simple since it has a distinctive red colour enabling it to be determined by spectrophotometry. The protocols can be read here .

mNARK lycopene enables ecoli growth under Hypoxia conditions
Hypoxia is a condition in which cells are deprived of oxygen due to low concentration of oxygen in the extracellular milieu. In humans, low oxygen levels in the blood affect tissues. Oxygen is essential for diverse cellular functions, such as catabolic and anabolic processes, and low intracellular concentrations have a negative impact on cell functions and survival.
Oxygen deficit can have a severe impact on cellular function, as seen in cell stress. The inability of cells to effectively manage cellular stress over time has been linked to cellular ageing and age-related diseases (Haigis and Y"

To easily extend the NRPSDesigner database this domain recognition pipeline was integrated into a user-friendly interface. The user can add an additional description for each domain, possibly change the specificity of the adenylation domains if it has not been predicted correctly and also define his own domain boundaries, with the help of an integrated multiple sequence alignment against the domains of the same type already present in the database.
Guidance for Cloning of NRPS Constructs with Gibthon
Going further than offering in-silico predicted sequences of NRPS domains producing a particular NRP would be the implementation of a cloning procedure based on Gibson assembly for the NRPSDesigner. This should make NRPS more accessible to the synthetic biology community. One of the most popular tools for computer-aided primer design is Gibthon. Created as a web app by Bill Collins of the Cambridge iGEM Team of 2010 Gibthon suggests primers for the assembly of predefined DNA fragments (entered by the user or imported from the Parts Registry) using Gibson cloning. Since Gibthon was such a successful iGEM software project and also written in Django, we decided to use it as our tool of choice for automated primer design.
Gibthon was integrated into the core NRPSDesigner GUI using a modular interface. Particular care was taken to keep Gibthon and the rest of the NRPSDesigner clearly separated, to enable the use of other primer design software such as J5 [16] in the future. The strategy applied for the integration is the following: For each of the domains returned by the in-silico prediction, the DNA sequence is extracted from the NRPSDesigner database. The resulting sequences are returned in a plasmid structure, while ensuring that a minimal number of Gibson fragments has to be assembled. These sequences, together with metadata, such as references and descriptions, are appropriately converted to the Gibthon database format and then copied into the Gibthon gene fragment table. In return the user has access to the standard Gibthon interface to get an overview over the suggested primers. Similar to Gibthon the NRPSDesigner is tightly linked with the registry of"

Abstract
In this section of our project we will present and assess the viability of our model utilizing computational methods to unravel the genetic networks involved in our experimental design. The medium we utilized to perform out computational assessment is the technical computing language of Matlab. In the past few years Matlab’s ‘Simbiology’ package utilizing has been growing among scientists seeking to generate mathematical models for cell biology. Therefore, our approach took the initiative to utilize the package to characterize the interactions of our bio bricks with other cellular components.
In order to model our gene network we employed the power of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). In each paradigm of reactivity between reactants and products the ODE’s were optimized to characterize the functional connectivity between our bio bricks. Here we present in detail the network diagrams, the output of our functions, and the methodology utilized to generate abstract plots of the outputs of our networks.
The two networks we are presenting involve the function generated within a single E. Coli bacterium, upon transfection of the plasmids described in our bio brick section. The first network is that of Proteorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump, allowing for generation of ATP and proton output that would lead to an increased efficiency of the Microbial Fuel Cell. The second network involves the functionality of NADH oxidase, in inducing an anaerobic environment, and through its biochemical reactivity increase electricity generation by the Microbial Fuel Cell system.

Farmers
Katie Brandt, Michigan State University Student Organic Farm
Because the use of GMOs in the food supply is a hot topic of debate, we felt it was important to understand why people may be opposed to growing and consuming GMOs. If we hope that crops will be grown with our GM bacteria one day, we need to identify the reasons why people might feel uncomfortable using it. This way we can figure out if there's anything we can do now to make them more comfortable using our product in the future. Therefore, we chose to meet with a representative from the Michigan State University Student Organic Farm, a large farm on campus. The use of genetic engineering is prohibited in organic products, so the farmers at the MSU Student Organic Farm purposely avoid growing GM crops. In order to understand barriers to our project, we needed to understand the other side of the argument. Team members Jessica and Jordan conducted a 20 minute phone interview with the farm's Farmer Field School Program Manager, Katie Brandt. Katie Brandt has a MS in Biology.
Jessica and Jordan: What are your thoughts on GMOs?
Katie: I am neither for nor against. I know growers who feel that, economically, they must use GMOs to maintain acreage. I know a grower who inherited over 1000 acres for GM soybeans, but wanted to change to organic. However, a lot of growers have a hard time moving to organic. My biggest problem is seed sovereignty and other issues from huge corporations that have developed GMOs. I dislike that most of the modifications being made are often about herbicide tolerance and inclusion of pesticides that may cause pest resistance due to low dose constant available rate to the pests. BT corn is also common now, and used on the MSU Student Organic Farm. I worry that using BT corn might make pest resistance occur on organic farms, and it may be very difficult to get rid of pests in the future. I’ll admit however, that I still know very little about GMOs, and most of my education on them came from classes in graduate school"

Helping to create the project we now have, I have explored the possibility of lab oriented research that has helped shape my future aspirations. Upon applying to be in the iGEM team, I wanted to challenge myself and experience something that very few other schools could offer me – the opportunity to carry out university level experiments in a school lab. I am currently studying biology, physics, maths and further maths at A level and intend to continue a research career in the field of neuroscience.

The colony formed by E. coli without arabinose induction forms a small halo towards the aspartate end, while the colony formed by E. coli induced by arabinose almost formed no halo, and the shape is elongated along the gradient, showing some of the bacteria have changed their chemotaxis from aspartate to serine. Photos at later time points will demonstrate the chemotaxis better.

Q: We designed a box for this project and made a sample model. Could you give some advice based on it?
A: In my opinion, your box has such problems: First of all, the design of the box is not conducive to the movement of the squats. I think we can imitate the technique of seamless docking when constructing a road, so that we can climb into it without knowing it. Secondly, I suggest that you can change the overall structure of the box and make a shaft at the center of the lid for the knob to switch on the bottom of the chassis. Because cockroach has a habit of drilling the gap, the lid can be twisted into a small gap to allow the crucible to be drilled, so that the product can be used conveniently.
Q: What do you think of the future of our products?
A: The original infectivity of the genus Metarhizium is relatively slow, and the transformation process can be shortened by your transformation of Metarhizium. The cockroach is infected with Metarhizium in the box and does not die immediately. Instead, it can bring Metarhizium back to the nest. Other cockroaches come into contact with it and are infected with Metarhizium. the cockroach activity after being infected with Metarhizium is reduced, and cockroaches die in the nest. The cockroach also has the habit of eating the companion's corpse, in the process of foraging, It can also infect Metarhizium aeruginosa into new mites. In this way, the nest can be annihilated under the premise of ensuring environmental protection and safety, which has a great impact on its population density.
Q: After we reformed Metarhizium, what kind of changes will happen in terms of production conditions?
A: It must be, after transferring the gene, it has a certain influence on the growth and sporulation of Metarhizium. And you need to test and determine new production conditions, such as changes in the composition of the medium and the temperature of the culture."

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#modeling#whole_-_-_TEXT.html," both integrases are present, the terminator is flipped twice thus eventually turning the system OFF. This is summarized in the figure above.Then, they flip the terminators again thus turning the system OFF.
At first the systems are ON either due to flipping by ΦC31 or Bxb1. This results in the production of LasI which catalyses the production of LasAHL. The LasAHL further increases the production of ΦC31 which flips the already flipped terminators by Bxb1. The remaining Bxb1 flips the already flipped terminators by ΦC31. Thus, the system eventually turns OFF.Even though there is more Bxb1 flipped terminators than those flipped by ΦC31. The dynamics of Toni, ToffBxb1, ToffΦC31 and Tonf is summarised in the figure above.
Figure 4 Predicted XOR behaviour for the whole cell model without leakiness
The figure above, shows the predicted XOR gate performance by a single cell model with no basal leakiness for different concentrations of LasAHL and LuxAHL.
With Leakiness
Figure 5 The four cases for the whole cell with basal leakiness
From our experimental data, we observed some basal leakiness for PLux and PLas even after using riboregulators. From the model we see that, this small basal leakiness is amplified downstream. The basal leakiness results in production of integrases which further act on the XOR module and cause the switching of the terminator. Thus, there is GFP and LasI produced, and the LasI produced further catalyses the production of more LasAHL. Thus, we observe some GFP even without inputs.
However, if we measure the fluorescence at around 400 mins, the effect of leakiness becomes negligible: in the case with null inputs, the level of the output concentration, GFP, is negligible compared to the level of the GFP concentration produced when the cell receives only one type of AHL. At this point, our model behaves like an XOR gate. Therefore, one of the solutions we propose is to kill or freeze the cells in each row after 6.5 hours.
Initially from our model we observed that the feedback was rapid and hence, the amplification was much higher. However, from literature [9] we see that the XOR module is relatively slow. We were able to correct this by modelling transcription and translation steps. The delay introduced seems more realistic although we do not have our own experimental data to validate the same. Further, we use a dilution factor (DF) which represents the density of the cells in the"

What is ROSE?
Reporter Operator with Sensing Engine, in                                 brief-ROSE, is a systematically modified bacterial machine for                                 antibiotic concentration determination. Because antibiotic substances contamination                                 occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than                                 normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bacteria using simple genetic                                 circuit. Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit and                                 systematic permeability reconstruction.

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," QALY measure is big enough, the product may be adopted for public healthcare reimbursement.
Word list
Alleviation: Making suffering, deficiency, or a problem less severe. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY): A measure of disease burden, quantifying the health effect of a medical intervention or a prevention program that helps payers allocate healthcare resources.
In order to be able to target a relevant market early in the process, we established a solution that would be suitable for the alleviation of diseases with excessive mucus production and have a better outcome than the existing solutions. Currently, there is not a cure that fully targets this need, and therefore, there is a great necessity for a treatment to help the patients in having a normal life with the disease55.
As previously discussed, there are different disadvantages over the use of the current solutions. These include drugs that target only subpopulations of the disease, time-consuming drug administration, time-consuming breathing techniques exercises for the elimination of mucus, need for education and training or a need for very specialized trainers in the area, that are costly. On the other hand, the current solutions have different positive aspects as well. For example, their mode of action has been well researched and is well known, the doctors and other healthcare personnel is well trained to prescribe it and there is a big amount of information covering the use of combinations of these treatments in patients.
Our solution proposes a revolutionary change to the treatment of these diseases. The main advantages over the current solutions we can foresee are:
An increase in the quality of life of the patient, that would need less hours to move the mucus out of the lungs, allowing them to have a more active role in society.
A decrease in the economic burden these diseases put on the society. With the use of the product, the patients would be able to increase their productivity and have full-time jobs. The patients would not need to visit as many times the doctor’s office and their education in breathing techniques would be shorter and more effective, liberating pressures on the professionals working in the field.
A lack of need from new training for physicians, nurses and physical therapists. Since the product uses the same technology as the widely spread nebulizers, support and opinion of the healthcare personnel is expected to be positive.
Nevertheless, the developed product brings different concerns, for example, there is no practice that can certainly predict if the product will be well adopted by patients and healthcare personnel, as the know-how is a very important variable in this industry. The product raises new questions with regards to measuring safety and effectiveness by regulatory authorities and about how the reimbursement codes should be"

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," sequenced using primers specific to GFP.
Upon analyzing the sequencing data, we found that many of the colonies selected lacked mutations within the region of interest. In particular, all of the non-mutant/wild type GFP samples and all of the mutant GFP P1 samples (induced and uninduced) lacked any mutations whatsoever in the region of interest. The mutant GFP P2 induced and uninduced groups on the other hand possessed mutations at the PAM site. The PAM site that we had purposefully introduced in order to allow for sgRNA interaction with the chromophore region of the GFP gene was mutated in 1 out of 2 uninduced mutant GFP P2 samples and 7 out of 15 induced mutant GFP P2 samples. These findings are summarized in the images/charts below.
Reverse Point Mutation in GFP - A silent mutation was created with site-directed mutagenesis in a GFP protein to introduce a PAM sequence adjacent to the region we targeted. This sequence allows for successful Cas9 targeting and cleavage. After two rounds of random mutagenesis using cells from a mutator strain, a reverse mutation was observed that eliminated the PAM sequence.
PAM Site Mutation Frequency. This graph shows the percentage of sequenced samples that contained a mutation resulting in the loss of the PAM site within the GFP gene. No PAM site mutation losses were observed within the wild type/non-mutant GFP or within the mutant GFP P1 group. 1 out of 2 uninduced mutant GFP P2 samples contained a lost PAM site while 7 out of 15 induced mutant GFP P2 samples contained a lost PAM site.
From this data, we can extrapolate some interesting information. First, the Cas9/sgRNA mutagenesis method is not entirely effective in cleaving non-mutated plasmid DNA. This is demonstrated by the fact that most of the sequenced colonies were non-mutants in the region of interest. We expected that some non-mutant plasmids would escape cleavage by Cas9 simply by chance, so this finding did not come as a particular surprise.
Along with this, it can be seen that the Cas9/sgRNA system is selecting for some particular types of mutations. That is, in this case, mutations within the PAM sequence. It makes sense that Cas9 would select for mutants lacking a PAM site as it would be impossible for the Cas9/sgRNA complex to cleave this sequence. As such, plasmids losing the PAM site would escape cleavage and be propagated. Hence,"

MakerFluidics:
MakerFluidics is a microfluidic fabrication protocol that leverages open, low cost, and easily accessible tools to fabricate microfluidics. In this toolchain, microfluidics are created using a CNC mill to create channels in a thermoplastic, biocompatible stock. MakerFluidics uses open source software, including 3DuF, and now Neptune. Neptune is developed to be compatible with MakerFluidics; in Neptune SVG design schematics are generated, ready to fabricate with a CNC mill. This protocol was developed by our mentor Ryan Silva.
Fluigi Core:
Fluigi Core is a place and route tool that takes MINT files that the user inputs into Neptune, and it performs an optimization placing of channels, valves, and other components onto the microfluidic chip. In essence, Fluigi Core generates design schematics from the MINT standard microfluidic specification format you provide it. Neptune wraps Fluigi Core, it is the algorithmic library to our software. This program is currently in development by our mentor Radhakrishna Sanka.
NetSynth:
NetSynth is a logic minimization library for Verilog. The original purpose of NetSynth was to take a Verilog description of a circuit, and convert this into a netlist of wires and gates that realize the design description. Our iGEM team has joined the prior work of Prashant Vaidyanathan to refactor NetSynth into a tool that can also perform logic minimization on microfluidic designs. Prashant is responsible for originally repurposing NetSynth for microfluidic design, and our team has further contributed to this by integrating NetSynth outputs with the Mushroom Mapper tool we created.
Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project made with BioBricks. This contribution should be equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part
Our contribution to the iGEM community is not a single hardware device, nor a one-off software tool. Our contribution to the iGEM community, and the synthetic biology community as a whole, is much greater than that. This summer we built a completely integrated, seamless, end-to-end microfluidic design, fabrication, and control workflow. This workflow enables the rapid, modular, and parametric design of microfluidic chips, and our workflow integrates with low cost, open fabrication methods. This is something that has never been possible in microfluidics before.

High School Inspiration
Figure 1.Guidance in Ruijing High School
The TJU iGEM team presented the ""Exploring Synthetic Biology"" curriculum to high school biotechnology classes. The TJU iGEM team is working with various high schools around the Tianjin City to start iGEM teams. In addition, TJU iGEM is working with Bioscience high school to develop a project idea for the 2013 high school iGEM competition. A series of academic lecture and collaboration had been organized, aiming to popularize iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Finally, we invited high school students with interest in biology to our laboratory and teach them do some basic operations.
We cooperated with Ruijing Senior High, and showed some students who are interested in biology around labs in Tianjin University . We arranged lectures to introduce synthetic biology to them, and encourage more high school students to take part in High School Division of iGEM. We gave senior students insights into biofuels and other green fuels. We showed some simple experiments to them, such as operating pipettes and centrifugating, and allowed them to try out by themselves. We also delivered them comics about biology, such as Beautiful Scientific Stories, to lead these young students into the biologic world.
University Guidance
In this part we influenced universities related with biology in Tianjin. We shared our ideas with them by lectures, visits and interviews, and we successfully helped Nankai University start their first iGEM team.To help these universities without any iGEM teams have a deeper insight into iGEM and join us in the competition, we contacted with universities with bio-related lessons and experimental conditions, including Nankai university and so on. We helped more iGEM teams to grow with our joint efforts.
