The system is first regulated by a spaCBA promoter, which allows the expression of the nsrR repressor protein (of PyeaR promoter) and then the cassette regulates the expression of gp80 and gp130 with the PyeaR promoter, after it senses nitrosative stress. Reporter fluorescent proteins iLOV and M-Cherry will help corroborate expression of both systems. iLOV will be attached to the Pbad-nsrR system and M-Cherry to the PyeaR-gp80-gp130 system. Both glycoproteins (gp) have a His-Tag (6 histidines) attached to themselves for purification.

This is the same “Plan B” for E. coli but adapted to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, since it is a natural probiotic organism. Plan B consists of producing a soluble, mutated, gp80 attached to SP1.Nsp4. The production of the mutated alpha chain receptor for IL-6 (gp80) will act as an antagonist protein, due to mutations, it will associate with IL-6 forming the IL-6-alphaReceptorgp80 complex but it will not bind with human gp130, thus inhibiting the formation of IL-6-alphaReceptorgp80-gp130 complex which leads to inflammation pathways [1].

If there is no label on the lattices, it just means you don’t need to do anything.
Antibiotics, which can destroy the structure of the cell, you should go back to the start place to restart game.
Stream, go forward for 3 lattices.
Phage, which can attack you, speed half for three rounds.
Amoebae, it can phagocytose your cilia, destroy the structure of cell. Your speed becomes half and you must be repaired in the lab to continue gaming.
We feel more than happy when other students in our school learn and have fun with our game.
Tips：
1. The game is for 2-4 people to play.
2. The goal is to equip yourself with target gene and clear away pollutants.
3. If you meet intersections, you can decide the way you will go forward yourself.
4. When clearing up pollutants in your hometown, you should go counterclockwise.
5. The speed can’t be halved twice. If you get twice, you will die and return to the start.
6. You can equip yourself with target genes just by passing the lab.

Having constructed our square wave circuit via cloning and synthesis, and having obtained Murray et al’s 5n1 plasmid (from addgene), we then tested out our system in microfluidic chambers, and obtained time lapse images, placed under a fluorescence microscope.
Cells containing the square wave circuit were first grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 ug/ml of antibiotic (ampicillin). The next day, the culture was diluted 1:100 in LB containing the appropriate concentration of ampicillin, and loaded into the microfluidic chamber (refer to microfluidic section for design specifications of the chamber). Cells caught at one end of the T junction were imaged, and a single cell among them was isolated. Flow rate ensured that as the cell divided, the daughter cells flowed out along with the fresh media flowing past the straight part of the channel, without taking the cells in the perpendicular part of the channel along with it.
Cells were also diluted, and induced by adding a minimal concentration of anhydrotetracycline (aTc < 0.1 nM). This barely induced the system, and set the oscillations into motion. The cells were loaded into 96 well plates with 4 replicates for each part, and the time evolution of GFP was seen. The data showed a good correlation with a square wave of the same time period imposed on it (shown in red in the graph).

Modeling Part
Junying Su is responsible for final determination of mathematical model for our project. He devotes to modeling the function of our engineering E.coli accurately. In addition, he writes Parameters Measuring and Data Processing Schemes for four parts, including MntA Transport Model, PcadA Strength Model, csgA Polymerization Model and csgA-ECn Adsorption Model. He also assists the members of experiment group to finish measuring work.
Xiaobin Huang is responsible for studying the mechanism of MntA transport. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has also studied the mechanism of sodium potassium pump and calcium pump, which are also the members of the P-type family of adenosine
triphosphatases (ATPases). At the same time, he devotes to establishing the model of Ptet Strength. He has found out two available models in the previous iGEM work of Team EPF-Lausanne 2008 and Team UC Davis 2013 respectively. [1][2] Additionally, he works in data processing.
Chongyin Han is responsible for studying the mechanism of csgA polymerization. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has studied an available model in the work of Team INSA-Lyon 2014. [3] Whether this model is useful for us, we need further verification.
Nana Pang is responsible for studying the mechanism of PcadA and merR mutant, and devotes to establishing the model of PcadA Strength. In order to figure out the accurate concentration of cadmium ion at which PcadA takes obvious effect, she analyzes the combination process of cadmium ion and merR.

[7/15/2011]
Modified Run method to use pointed paths to start up Hal and ResourceManager.  However, I forgot that we agreed on just having those two parts start up automatically with PuppetShowDB.
Implemented a killProcess method that is called for Hal and ResourceManager; they're called when the user exits PuppetShowDB.
Fixed a wrapped-JAR issue that required the user to keep pointing to an arbitrary mysql-connector JAR file (most likely implemented when I auto-generated the HCL config and mapping files within Netbeans).
[7/16/2011]
Attempted to resolve issue with calling ResourceManager within PuppetShowDB; it was giving a forced-disconnect error that was not entirely clear.
Also attempted to figure out new scriptWindow and scripTab classes to resolve file-saving issues with the tabbedpane-view.
[7/18/2011]
PuppetShowDB GUI is now cleaned up and effectively looks like a generic-script editor for Puppeteer (python) scripts.
TabbedPane was removed, as well as several related features (new, close, running python, test-mode).
PuppetShowDB also starts up ResourceManager and Hal on startup via the stackconfig.properties file locations.
[7/19/2011]
PuppetShowDB had some minor bugs with the modification of saving/opening files that were just fixed.  Today starts the process of integrating ResourceManager seamlessly with PuppetShowDB.  For now we are using a wrapped-JAR file approach to see if we can get ResourceManager up and running properly.  We are currently experiencing difficulties with class/package specification issues.
[7/20/2011]
The past couple of days were spent trying to integrate ResourceManager, and every method (wrapping JARs, importing packages, creating packages, combining source files, etc.) has not worked.  The main issue was with a NoClassDefFound error when running a test-file (as specified by Chenkai); Chenkai is working on trying to figure out why his code is having this issue, etc.

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Crowdfunding_-_-_TEXT.html," plastic waste in oceans into an island that they named Plastic Republic. Backers of the project were rewarded for their support with ownership of a virtual piece of land on one of the islands.
This project demonstrates that a project based on synthetic biology can become very popular and successful. UCL’s project was featured in several magazines and helped to popularise iGEM and synthetic biology. It is important to point out that the project was well organised which helped to attract attention of the backers. Visit UCL’s iGEM wiki for more information on their crowdfunding idea and their Plastic Republic project.
Project Description 2: DIY projects (kickstarter)
OpenPCR and BioCurious - these two projects have a clear connection to the DIY biology community that we have researched as part of our human practices. Using Kickstarter, the authors managed to raise significant funds for development of their projects. OpenPCR is a cheap but fully functional thermocycler - its creators hope that lower price will mean more people having access to basic tools for molecular biology. BioCurious is a community labspace located in California and available for people interested in biology.
The two DIY projects from Kickstarter show that crowdfunding can be very successful when it comes to developing technologies and initiatives that affect whole communities. Such projects have an intrinsic potential for attracting attention and funding and make great use of crowdfunding platforms.
Project Description 3: Cheetah Conservation (Petridish)
Cheetah conservation research from Petridish is an interesting example of a project that offers a closer involvement of backers as well as interaction with the researcher. The goal of the project is to raise money for cheetah trap research that would help in the conservation effort for these big cats. The authors hope to increase the scale of their research using raised money. As a reward, backers can chat with the researchers and are offered photographs of cheetahs.
This shows that a direct interaction with the project may be attractive for the backers. This project also represents a significant group of ecology based projects that often get noticed due to their connection to wild animals. Projects that have a potential to form a strong emotional link between the backers and the research are therefore more likely to attract attention and funding.
Project Description 4: cancer yeast (Rockethub)
The last project, hosted by Rockethub, raises funds for cancer research. The authors use yeast to examine proteins that may be associated with cancer. Their crowdfunding project aims to raise money for antibodies used in the experiment.

IGEM Workshop Asia in TCU Formosa
Our team has three sub-groups with different projects going on. The final project will be determined latest by August. Here are our meeting minutes starting from July.
Team 1: Saycar Sataos
Date: Jul-22, 2010
Last meeting, we try to use E. coli to secrete β-carotene, but we found that some biotech company had published this idea already
So we decide to change our way:
Use bacteria to deal the sewage problem
Combine two igem biobrick, which are 2008 Chiba time manager and 2009UCSF Motile cellular robots.
Use the system that the bacteria which can secrete the biofilm combined with our original idea that secretβ-carotene.
use nano size silver ion to use at antibacterial
creat a bacteria which could make there own Magnetic field
Date: Jul-19, 2010
Team leader introduce subgroup project, the original idea came from Golden Rice production in Taiwan
Plan to produce mass volume of beta-carotine in E-Coli to solve the problem of malnutrition in under-develope countries
Current problem: B-carotine releasing mechanism
Advisor: Professor Woon Peng-Yeong, Institute of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University
Date: Jul-10, 2010
Our idea is using E.coli to synthesis β-carotene and secret it out of E.coli.
There are two main parts we have to do with this idea.
Synthesisβ-carotene in E.coli. There’s a biobrick, BBa_K274210, which used to synthesize β-carotene is publish by 2009 Cambirdge team.
The most difficult part of this idea is that we have to find the secretion mechanisms of E.coli, so this part divided into two major ways and we have to search for much more detail .
(1) Signal peptide: find a meet signal peptide for our idea. And find out where should it be cloned.
(2) E.coli: whether E.coli has the ability to exocytosis? Can it be used in secretion of β-carotene in E.coli?

We still haven't figured out what happend to the plasmids pSLD20 and pSLD22, so we restreaked both the ones from the glycerol stock and the ones in the fridge.
To Anja:
I  think it would be most efficient if you spend the morning doing dry lab stuff. Could you maybe prepare the meeting agenda? There are a few points on the sheet of paper on the wall in the student room. We will start the meeting with a presentation for the supervisors (Thomas is making that one), and after that (probably at 5 pm when everyone is present) we will have our normal weekly meeting. So if you could make the agenda for the normal meeting.
When that is done, you can just continue on the paragraph you are working on for the wiki.
Annemi and I will come at 1 pm, and hopefully we will do some ligations.
Just send me a message if you have any doubts:-)
Have fun!!
22-09-2010 - Patrick - Terminator group
Another long busy day with many items to take care of.
The digested items from yesterday were purified via pcr clean up, and ran on gel to determine concentration for ligations.
After this, all items needed for ligation constructions of pAT02, pAT06 and pAT07 were ready.
The following ligations were made:
L1: pAT02 - RLN + RBS-RFP + pSB1C3
L2: pAT06 - nutR + B0011 (X+P) + pSB1C3
L3: pAT06 - nutR + B0011 (E+X) ( <-- pSB1A3)
L4: pAT07 - nutR + B1003 (X+P) + pSB1C3
L5: pAT07 - nutR + B1003 (E+X) ( <-- pSB1A3)
L6: Negative ligation control - pSB1C3
L7: Negative ligation control - B0011 (E+X)
L8: Negative ligation control - B1003 (E+X)
Tomorrow (23/09/10) these need to be transformed and plated.

Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," that had accumulated mutations in the aroE gene rendering the encoded EPSP synthase insensitive to the herbicide. Since AroE from B. subtilis belongs to the class II EPSP synthases, which are less sensitive to glyphosate, the potential of enzyme to further evolve herbicidal insensitivity might be limited (Figure 29) (62-64).
Figure 29. The EPSP synthase fall into three different groups. While the E. coli EPSP synthase glyphosate sensitive (group I), the B. subtilis enzyme belongs to the group II of glyphosate-insensitive EPSP synthases. Not much is known about the glyphosate-dependent inhibition of the EPSP synthases that belong to group III. The phylogenetic three has been constructed using the Geneious software package ( Biomatters Ltd. ). Sequences of the EPSP synthases were derived from the UniProt database.
Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that the B. subtilis aroE gene is essential for growth even under conditions that do not require the enzymatic function of the EPSP synthase (65). As essential bacterial genes appear to be more conserved than nonessential genes, the aroE gene probably does not permit the accumulation of mutations, which can be beneficial (66). To confirm that the aroE gene is indeed essential, we transformed the B.%nbsp;subtilis with a PCR product consisting of DNA fragments flanking the target gene and the intervening spc spectinomycin gene (aroE::spc deletion cassette) and propagated the bacteria on SP rich medium plates (see Notebook). Several tiny colonies appeared on the transformation plates after 24 h of incubation. However, the potential transformants were not viable and supplementation of the agar plates with casamino acids also did not improve growth of the bacteria. Thus, under the tested conditions aroE seems to be essential in B. subtilis.  Next, we tested whether the chromosomal copy of the aroE gene becomes dispensable for the bacteria carrying an EPSP synthase gene on a plasmid. For this purpose, we transformed the B. subtilis wild type strain 168 with the plasmids pIGEM2 and pBP143 containing the aroE and aroA EPSP synthase genes from B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively. The wild type carrying the empty plasmid pBQ200 served as a control. Next, we transformed the three strains with the aroE::spc deletion cassette and with"

The authors' main focus was on the fluorescence.  We could conceivably use this type of protein to accomplish the biosensor; however, the authors state that not much is known about the natural bPBPs, so it might be difficult to find a starting point in terms of a specific bPBP.

Medal Criteria
Human practices include outreach to people from all walks of life, i.e the scientific crowd as well as those outside the scientific circle, and using the suggestions from these discussions to improve your project.
Student Outreach
In June 2017, we gave a presentation to a group of students from a school for handicapped students in Kolhapur city and gave them a brief introduction to biotechnology, synthetic biology and iGEM. We also explained simple concepts like transformation and cloning and showed them our Petri plates with RFP transformed colonies. We demonstrated how to use your phone camera and a drop of water to make a simple microscope, as well as how to use a Fold-Scope, which is an inexpensive and easy-to-handle substitute for a simple microscope.
We also gave a presentation to a group of students from prominent Junior colleges and high schools in Pune city about synthetic biology and iGEM. We also presented some of our work related to the Hijack module to them ( modeling as well as lab work). We showed them our iGEM lab and showed them different types of equipment that we use including the laminar hood, the PCR machine, incubator, gel electrophoresis station. They were fascinated to see all the machines which they had only heard of or read about in textbooks.
All India iGEM Meet-up
To reach a wider audience and facilitate easy exchange of ideas, we hosted an all-India iGEM meet-up in July 2017. 9/10 Indian IGEM teams attended this meet-up, while IGEM team Peshawar joined the conference via skype. Apart from team presentations, we also arranged guest lectures by Dr. Sanjeev Galande, Dr. Nishad Matange, Dr. Sandeep Krishna and Robert Ramirez Garcia, a former iGEMer from Team Avery, France. Our audience was a mixture of team members, students from our institute as well as faculty members.

Week 5 (June 26 - July 2)
Wetlab Summary
This week we focused mainly on two things. Number one is continuing to validate and clone parts. Number two is determining exactly how we plan to measure everything. The first one has made steady progress, (cloning of combination parts, quorum circuits, and functional validation of our pLac pBad circuit), while the second one still requires a great deal more thinking. Namely we have to investigate some claims from a paper, as well as figure out more robustly what we want to measure.
Outreach Summary
We published the video explaining our project to YouTube and Facebook. We now have two dates locked down for our bioengineering speaker series. Professor Schniepp is speaking on the 13th and Professor Kerscher is speaking on the 20th (4:00-5:00). Sejal and Alyssa continued working on the high school synthetic biology activities booklet.
Week 6 (July 3 - July 9)
Wetlab Summary
This week we were focused on trying to measure a functional induction curve with a ""steady state"" as well as confirming our pdts at the single cell level. We managed to accomplish the latter, though the effect size is not perfect, and there is still a lot of tuning to do. We've also been working on getting ready to use the scope to attain really robust time course measurements.
Outreach Summary
Made a lot of progress in planning and solidifying plans for education outreach. Alyssa has been in contact with Deanna Marroletti from Camp Launch and she will be visiting with her students on Wednesday, July 19th. We are planning on doing a DNA extraction activity, RFP streak, and gel electrophoresis. We finished the database up to 2008 prize-winning teams. We are now going to go to 2016 nominated teams.
Week 7 (July 10 - July 16)
Wetlab Summary
Induction time course for WM17_377 or K2333420 (pTet sfGFP + J23105 TetR) using 30 minute time points.  t1/2 to steady state is roughly 30 minutes, which is close to the expected doubling time of cells in our media.

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota_-_-_TEXT.html,"BBRBB::gfp K12 cells were grown in three test tubes each containing heavy metal tryptone medium as well as 3mM NaS2O3. A third set of test tubes were set up with the same contents except without cells as an additional negative control. After 24 hours of incubation, the exact amount of H2S present in each of three different sets of tubes was then measured using a hydrogen sulfide assay tested against a known standard curve of various Na2S concentrations. The compiled results showed that the sulfide concentration was considerably higher for the cultures containing pBBRBB:phsABC (380.1 μM ± 13.5) compared to the pBBRBB::gfp negative control (118.9μM ± 1.1). A second set of experiments was also conducted with pBBRBB:phsABC K12, pBBRBB::GFP K12, and an abiotic control grown in heavy metal tryptone medium, 3mM NaS2O3tubes, and 2.5mM Fe(II)Cl2. Since the phsABC gene is responsible reducing thiosulfate, NaS2O3 would be converted to H2S, which will further react with Fe(II)Cl2 to produce FeS, a black precipitate. After a 24 hour incubation period, the pBBRBB:phsABC K12 cells were the only ones seen to produce FeS, confirming the role of the phsABC gene in reducing thiosulfate. To affirm that this reaction is also successful under non-enclosed systems, the same sets of samples were also tested on 0.2% plates containing 3mM NaS2O3tubes and 2.5mM Fe(II)Cl2. The results after 24 hours of incubation were similar to the experiments conducted in test tubes. Following sulfide measurements, cadmium chloride was added (200 μM), and cells were allowed to incubate without shaking at 37C overnight. Cells were pelleted to look for a color change indicating precipitation of CdS. Cell pellets for K12 expressing phsABS were yellow/brown indicating precipitation of CdS while the vector control cells (pBBRBB::gfp) remained white.

Genspace,2015,Team:Genspace#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," the NY Hall of Science we were allowed to choose between several types of activities for the demo to the public on the Sunday. Although the physical objects were provided, we had to develop our own dialogue with the public around synthetic biology, using the physical part of the activity as a starting point.
The visitors to the Hall of Science come from all over the New York metropolitan area. We felt that it had the potential to be a really valuable exercise in engaging with people who had never heard of synthetic biology before and who might be distrustful of genetic engineering.  We presented a wide range of activities covering topics such as the use of synthetic yeast to generate vaccines, the types of lab techniques that synthetic biologists use, and 3D printing with synthetic biology-derived materials. Whitney, one of our team members, summed up what most of us took away from the event “We presented our demo on spreading cells on plates. Most of the audience were children who were interested mostly in playing with the model of the tools we would see in a scientific laboratory. My experience at the event was both good and bad. The good part was that we were able to engage the younger public about techniques in labs and encourage them to think of a future in the biological sciences. The bad part was that our topic did not specifically relate to synthetic biology, but it did give the audience a basic step in working with synbio. In addition, one way our topic we were presented could have been improved is by providing better plate models and examples of cells from different organisms for the audience to get a better feel of the technique of spreading plates. But in all, I believe that the public did have a positive view towards synbio and also asked many questions about the project our iGEM  team was working on.” So the conclusion was that although the engagement activities we developed need improvement, we were able to have a meaningful dialogue with the general public around our iGEM project using the activities as a focus.
Meeting with Enquête Gowanus
In order to understand the environmental issues surrounding the canal, our team met with members of the Enquête Gowanus project, an ongoing collaboration between Genspace, Nelson Byrd Wolz, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, and several academic laboratories at local universities to catalog the microbiome of the canal bottom sludge. Ian Quate and Matthew Seibert both from Nelson Byrd Wolz came to Genspace and spoke about the project's history, challenges and stakeholders in the community. We took the opportunity to ask about the proposed cleanup.

Plasmid Rubik
We place a plasmid ring which contains promoter, terminator, target gene and resistant gene on each side of the Rubik, different genes can produce different plasmid ring. It shows more fun and possibility in combination with gene. We hope Plasmid Rubik could help people learn about synthetic biology as edutainment.
Part:
Promoter: Starting switch for transcription work.
Terminator: Switch off for transcription work.
Target gene: The gene we want to express.
Resistance gene: The gene fragment, which is selection marker of the plasmid.
Tools: Environmental-friendly resin, 3D printer
Operation: There is only one goal: making a correct plasmid on every side, no matter what combination it is
Future version: We decided to bring lighting to the next version. When the player successfully builds a plasmid, the cube emits light. We wanted to go through this upgrade to make players more intuitive aware of their success. We have successfully achieved the luminescence of a single cube, I believe it will be completed soon. In addition, we will also make new parts, and add new combinations based on the existing 1,296 combinations to greatly improve its playability.

Addressing law issues
While we were doing adjustments to our design in the lab, our team of jurists also researched how our device could be integrated into society given the current political and economic landscape in France. The use of GMOs, for the environment, food industry or medicine, is highly regulated in France. It is limited to only the design animal models of diseases, and to produce large quantities of molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. The use of genetically modified bacteria inside the human body is off the table. We contacted the USA Food and Drug Administration. (Not finished: Review de Kelly et Emma)
All these feedback from scientific experts, association members representing patients, and physicians/surgeons, allowed us to develop our project NeuronArch to what it is today. Without them, our project would not have been the same, and we really want to thank them for that."
DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#SPL_-_-_TEXT.html,"). Since most teams will probably have to amplify their backbones during the course of a project, this method will only require a small amount of extra work.
Wanting to optimize gene expression and thereafter choosing a promoter that conforms to the strength that efficiently expresses your gene would be best perceivable if the SPL could be easily added and removed from BioBrick parts and/or devices. That is why the SPL will be inserted by PCR in-between the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI of the BioBrick prefix. This way it is possible to add a part downstream of the SPL by simply ligating a part into the backbone plasmid containing SPL or by using the 3A-assembly standard. Furthermore it is also possible to move the whole insert into another BioBrick plasmid backbone if needed.
Figure 2: The linear BioBrick plasmid backbone with SPL inserted between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the BioBrick prefix is illustrated.
The design of the SPL leads to the possibility of illegal restriction sites being present within the randomized spacer sequence. If a given promoter is to be used in further ligations it is vital that the promoter is sequenced first to ensure that it does not contain any recognition sites for EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI or PstI. The presence of these recognition sites could lead to the promoter being cut in a future restriction digest
Primer Design
A PCR MUST be used in order to add the SPL onto the BioBrick plasmid backbone. The following primers for amplification of BioBrick plasmid backbones were used as a starting point for the design of our SPL primers:
Primer Suffix-F: 5’-ACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAG-3’
Primer Prefix-R: 5’-TCTAGAAGCGGCCGCGAATTC-3’
The primers were taken from Parts Registry . The restriction enzyme recognition sites are marked with the following colors:
Blue – EcoRI
Green – XbaI
Red – SpeI
Orange – PstI
In order to amplify and add the SPL successfully, the following modifications were made to both of the annealing primers:
Primer SPL Suffix-F: 5’-GTTTCTTCACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAG-3’
For this primer, a tail with the recommended extra bases has been added. For more information click here .
Depending on which backbone needs to be amplified, one of the following SPL primers should be used:

Collaborations with other iGEM Teams
iGEM WPI Worcester – Biofilm assay protocol
Because we both worked on biofilms disruption, we exchanged with iGEM WPI Worcester on our methods. They develop antifreeze proteins that have anti-biofilm properties. On our side, we also integrated into our interface a strategy to disrupt biofilm formation. To test the effect of our proteins on biofilms, we both performed biofilm assay on microtiter plates and decided to exchange our protocols of biofilm culture and quantification in order to compare them.
iGEM Sorbonne U Paris – Interlab
We also collaborated with the french IGEM team Sorbonne U Paris. They graciously offered us some E. coli DH5-α for the Interlab study. We also helped them when they started their experiments for the Interlab by responding to some of their interrogations.
iGEM UNSW Australia – Law
We collaborated with iGEM UNSW Australia who was looking to produce a discussion about patenting for science at a global scale.  They contacted us to see our interpretation of EU law since they have a training in Australian law. Our legal team, composed of 2 Master students in Intellectual Property law skyped with their team to share on problematics surrounding patent law, such as reconciling new biological inventions with the law, the issues with diagnostic technology, the European legal system concerning patent law, the organization of courts in France, etc.

Today I got in my positive control both GFP glowing and non-GFP glowing K12 strain colonies which is not good. Hence I cultured them today so that I can miniprep and analyse tomorrow. I got good colonies for the final assemblies for locks and keys final assemblies. They also must be checked in gel tomorrow hence I cultured them too. Also we think its good time to assemble a LacI generator which has 2 assembly"

for DNA ≥500 bp
Optional: if the DNA fragment is ≥ 500 bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol (e.g., 100 µL of isopropanol should be added to 100 µL of PCR mixture combined with 100 µL of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly.
Note. If PCR mixture contains primer-dimers, purification without isopropanol is recommended. However, the yield of the target DNA fragment will be lower.
3
Transfer up to 800 µL of the solution from step 1 (or optional step 2) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Note. If the total volume exceeds 800 µL, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After the addition of 800 µL of solution, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard flow-through. Repeat until the entire solution has been added to the column membrane.
Close the bag with GeneJET Purification Columns tightly after each use!
4
Add a 700 µL of Wash Buffer (diluted with the ethanol as described on p.3) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 30-60 s.
Discard the flow-through and place the purification column back into the collection tube.
5
Centrifuge the empty GeneJET purification column for an additional 1 min to completely remove any residual wash buffer.
Note. This step is essential as the presence of residual ethanol in the DNA sample may inhibit subsequent reactions.
6
Transfer the GeneJET purification column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not included).
Add 50 µL of Elution Buffer to the center of the GeneJET purification column membrane and centrifuge for 1 min.
Note.
For low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 µL does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 µL are not recommended.
If DNA fragment is > 10 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 65 °C before applying to column.
If the elution volume is 10 µL and DNA amount is ≥5 µg, incubate column for 1 min at room temperature before centrifugation.

KU_Leuven,2013,Team:KU Leuven#Human Practices#HannahArendt_-_-_TEXT.html," understand it because the idea of a human being is part of our common sense.
Hence, at first sight, the notion of judgment as provided by Hannah Arendt's lectures on Kant's political philosophy seems to correspond with the people that argue for a popularization of the findings in synthetic biology. In fact, if one is able to spread the concepts and ideas that are used by scientists, the public might be able to give a well-informed judgment on what they deem to be desirable and praiseworthy developments within the field of synthetic biology. However, even though the idea of making the recent developments within the field of synthetic biology public and the attempt to popularize concepts and ideas that are used within the field seem to foster a closer link between the public and the scientist, the actual adaptation of these ideas and concepts by the public in order to judge developments in synthetic biology might be conflicting with the notions and ideas that make up our common sense.
After thought
This paper only considered the role of the public and did not consider the scientist as playing a part in the ethical evaluation of his/her project. Following Arendt's analysis of Kant, this would simply be unthinkable because the scientist would be occupied with fame and, moreover, would lack the distance to oversee the whole. Yet, one may argue that one can momentarily bypass these difficulties by saying that the scientist is able to reflect upon what he/she is doing by taking a step back from the work that he/she is doing. Yet, in order to provide an ethical evaluation of what one is doing, one is dependent on the common sense. Above, it was argued that the common sense of the public is in contradiction with the recent findings and synthetic biology. However, it is questionable whether this is all together different for the scientist. The scientist is also part of a community, in which he/she fulfills an ethical responsibility as well. The question is whether the scientist's ethical framework that is part of his/her common sense is modified by the scientific process in which he/she is involved. In fact, it is likely that the everyday ethical framework is separated from the work and thought that happens in the lab. Hence, instead of educating the public, it seems necessary to adapt the ethical framework that people (the scientist and the public) use to judge everyday situations to a world in which concepts such as humanity, life, nature, culture, etc. become less and less stable.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," could put on a labcoat and become a scientist themselves! We set up an experiment where people could isolate and visualize DNA from a kiwi. Luckily, a lot of visitors seemed to have talent for science and a lot of kiwi-DNA was successfully isolated. A lot of people were really surprised by the outcome, none of them had ever seen DNA before! It was very busy, so we are happy to have inspired so many children and parents about the world of synthetic biology and were happy to see so many happy faces!
INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF TECHNOLOGY
On 1 – 3 June, the whole campus of the TU Delft was dedicated to bridging the gap between technology, art and music during the International Festival of Technology. The programme consisted of some famous music artists, lectures by scientists and showcasing all art and technology projects of the university and its students. Of course, we as an iGEM team also took part in this amazing event. Since we were working with fluorescence, our project was incorporated in a night tour through the university. The tour went past all hidden treasures of the university, such as the anechoic chamber, and the iGEM lab which were specially illuminated for the occasion. Other students made use of lights and beamers, we used fluorescence, of course!
The tour was completely sold out so there were a lot of people to amaze and educate with our project! The public got to take a look in the world of fluorescence and learned some fun facts on DNA while we could promote our project. There was also an fluffy E. coli giveaway for the person who could most precisely estimate how often you can go to the moon and back with all DNA of one adult. A lot of people were not aware of the (laser)capacities of microorganisms, but the reaction of the crowd was very positive and enthusiastic, which is of course very good to hear! We are happy that we got to inspire and amaze so many people in just one night, and we hope that our Opticoli will continue to do so!
CAMPUS PARTY
The Campus Party is the greatest technological experience of the world which brings together young technologist and aspiring entrepreneurs in a festival of innovation, creativity, science, digital entertainment and entrepreneurship. It was held in Utrecht and this year we were invited as team.
During the day we enjoined multiple talks and workshops about among other things virtual reality and entrepreneurship. We have learned many interesting things we can use for our project and we had interesting conversations with many technologists about our project. In the evening we have presented our own project."

Figure 1.Two different constructed sensing modules.
Figure 2. Two different outputs of corresponding biosensors.
2. Cytotoxin sensor
Due to the accuracy and specific condition in the field of bio-medicine, the oscillatory biosensor needs to meet the requirement such as synchronization. For example, all cells expected to twinkle at the same time only when cytotoxin existed. In addition, the period or amplitude of the oscillation needs to indicate the concentration of the cytotoxin. Our circuit has the potential to accomplish this kind of job. By further exploration in the relationship between oscillatory parameters such as period and amplitude with other environmental factors such as concentration of antibiotic or cytotoxin, we may create a oscillatory biosensor which can sense different kinds of biological toxin.
Cancer cell killer
1.Cancer cell stalking
Nowadays cancer becomes one of the greatest enemy of our human being. Our main methods used to diagnosis of cancer are based on tissue and organ level, such as MRI, CT, PET, etc. These are mainly physical diagnostic methods.
With the development of science and technology, we create various methods into molecule level concentrated on molecular recognition and signal transduction of tumor marker, such as AFP(alpha fetoprotein), CEA (carcino-embryonic antigen), PSA(Prostate Specific Antigen) and so on. Level of these special molecules in human bodies has become the main basis of diagnosis of cancer. These are mainly chemical diagnostic methods.
So how about using synthetic biology to do something for diagnosis of cancer? Our project can be a potential biological method to assist diagnosis of cancer.
ROS is reactive oxygen species in cells, which has been proved to be associated with several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's diseases[2][3][4]. Concentration of ROS indicates the level of cell metabolism. Normally the stronger cell' metabolism is, the more ROS it will produce. In the recent decade scientist found that the occurrence of cancer is closely related to the level of ROS. But it is not a simple positive correlation as we expect[5].
Figure 4. ROS Level
From this picture we can get to know it clearly. As we know, we use oxide stress to describe the level of ROS in our cell. There is a threshold of oxide stress which is the critical value between normal cell and cancer cell. As a normal cell, its oxide stress is lower"
Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Platform_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM community to harness the FerriTALE to detect other DNA sequences, we added KasI restriction cut sites to the 3’ of detector Biobricks, allowing different TALEs to be introduced in the system ( BBa_K1189029 , BBa_K1189030 , BBa_K1189032 , and BBa_K1189033 ). This cut site enables traditional restriction enzyme cloning methods to combine FerriTALE proteins with different detector TALEs (Figure 2). Additionally, we improved two TALEs ( BBa_K1189022 , BBa_K1189023 ) previously submitted to iGEM to eliminate eukaryotic Kozak translation initiation sequences which prevent expression in prokaryotic systems. This modification serves as a template for how future teams should design TALEs so that they can use E. coli to manufacture custom FerriTALEs.
Figure 2. Using our built-in cut site the binding domain of our TALEs can be switched out with different binding domains making it easy to custom tailor TALEs to virtually any target DNA sequence.
Ferritin— A protein shelled nanoparticle
Ferritin is an iron sequestering protein shelled nanoparticle which could benefit other teams as a platform system in how the iron core can be converted to other compounds with different functions. We demonstrated this in our own system where we chemically modified the iron core to make ferritin a robust colourmetric reporter . Other intriguing applications include making ferritin’s iron core magnetically active as magnetoferritin (Jordan et al. 2013), using ferritin as a nanocage for other metals, or the incorporation of other reporters such as quantum dots (Naito et al. 2013) (Figure 3). The applications are diverse when one considers how these different cores can be combined with other proteins by expressing ferritin shell subunits as protein fusions. Check out how we combined detector TALEs with Prussian blue ferritin using coiled-coil linkers .
Figure 3. Chemically modifying the iron core of ferritin allows ferritin to be moulded to fit a wide magnitude of applications. Additionally the ferritin subunits can act as a nanocage to encapsulate completely new cores.
The ferritin scaffold and coiled-coil linkers
Apart from its core, the ferritin nanoparticle is useful for iGEM teams as a self-assembling and spherical protein scaffold. Each of the 24 subunits forming ferritin can be fused proteins of interest, such that when the nanoparticle as"

Physical Modelling
Motivation
One of the main ideas in the project is to control the flow induced by a bacterial coating inside a micro-tube. What we want to do in this part of the project is to study the mechanics of such a system, and how different parameters will affect it. One way to do this is to create a physical model that describes the most essential features of the system. Our work connected to the development of such a model is presented in the following. The basis for any model is an understanding of the physical system in question, therefore we will start with a short review of the hydrodynamic properties of flagella and the bacterial pumping system constructed by M. J. Kim and K. S. Breuer [ 1 ].
The real system
The ""real"" system that we want to model is a bacterial pump as described by M. J. Kim and K. S. Breuer  [ 1 ]. In principle, this is just a microscopic chamber with a flow channel 15µm deep, 200µm wide and 15mm long, covered on the inside by a layer of flagellated bacteria. The bacterial layer described by M. J. Kim and K. S. Breuer [ 1 ] is very dense and uniform, with a spacing between each bacterium of less that 1µm and 80% of the bacteria adhered to the surface as single bacteria. To get a better understanding of the origin of the  flow created from the bacterial coating, it is important to understand the structure of the bacterial flagellum.
The bacterial flagellum consists of 3 major parts, a rotary motor complex, a hook and a filament. The first part creates the rotary motion of the flagellum and the second part serves as a flexible coupling between the torque creating part and the filament. For our model the filament is the most interesting part. This is responsible for the conversion of the rotary motion into a linear thrust. The filament is a self-assembling polymeric structure composed of flagellin protein subunits"

Excising the cut pSB1A2 band
The next task was to clean up the promoter-less BBa_J33206 plasmid by removing the surrounding agarose gel. To do this the team used Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute Gel Extraction kit along with it's protocol (found in the Technical Bulletin )
There were no changes to the protocol. There are a couple of notes to make however:
The Spin Method was the protocol route taken.
The weight of the gel was 434ug so for step 3a, 1302ul of Gel Solubilization Solution was added (3 times the weight of the gel)
The amount of isopropanol added to the mixture in step 6a was therefore 434ul
Once the process was completed the DNA was transferred to the -20°C freezer for storage.

Argon Design System - Free Design System for Bootstrap 4
Hardware
The goal of our project, TERRA, is to automate and selectively dispense the output of a microfluidic device. In order to do so, we identified two main hardware components:
a system to move the output from location to location
a system to control when the output is dispensed
Our system required a method of moving either the output tube of the microfluidic chip or the vessel that the fluid will be dispensed to. When conducting research on translational systems, we found two common systems: an XY translational stage typically used in microscope systems and a system of timing belts and pulleys typically used in do-it-yourself 3D printers. The XY translational stages, however, cost upwards of $300 and need to be manually operated. We decided to combine the concept of an XY translational stage with the automated and accessibly-priced systems found in DIY printers.  One of the goals is to increase the accessibility of microfluidics to synthetic biologists, and this approach helped accomplish this.
Our team designed an inexpensive, DIY XY translational stage which utilized timing belts, pulleys, motors, and 3D printed parts. To control the motion of the stage, we used an Arduino Mega coupled with motor drivers, as it is a common microcontroller that utilizes a simple programming language and offers enough functionality in order to dictate the rotation of motors.
Click here to learn more about the XY translational stage:
XY-Stage
TERRA also required a system to control when the output of a microfluidic device was dispensed. Microfluidic chips can contain etched structures called valves, which can either allow or block fluid flow when actuated. The valves that we fabricate according to the Boston University CIDAR Lab protocol require manual vacuum pressure via a syringe to actuate. In order to automate the actuation of the valves, we decided to repurpose syringe pumps created by the 2016 iGEM BostonU Hardware team, Neptune . The syringe pumps were initially created to input fluid to microfluidic devices, but our team has utilized them to create a vacuum pressure for valves. These pumps were also controlled by the Arduino Mega.

Configurations and microbiology for biomining
Engineering options for biomining have evolved from relatively inexpensive, partly controlled, irrigated dump or heap reactors to sophisticated, highly controlled and expensive stirred-tank reactors. Another distinguished way of bioming is the in situ mining, used extensively in Canada in the 1970s to recover uranium from worked out deep mines, which may well be the next major development in the mining sector. Mineral heaps and stirred tanks provide very different environments and challenges for mineral-leaching microorganisms, and different ‘optimal’ populations might be expected to emerge with similar target minerals depending on the reactor used.
The extreme physico-chemical nature of bioleach liquors — low pH, elevated concentrations of (toxic) metals, metalloids and other solutes, and highly positive redox potential (EH values may exceed +900 mV) — means that they are highly toxic to the vast majority of life forms, including microorganisms. Microorganisms oxidize both sulfur and iron of sulfide minerals, such as pyrite. It is now well established that bioleaching and biooxidation in all biomining operations is mediated by consortia of acidophilic prokaryotes. These have been categorized as: firstly, ferric iron-generating autotrophs which produce the mineral oxidant; secondly, sulfuric acid-generating autotrophs, which maintain the low pH environment required; and finally, heterotrophic and mixotropic prokaryotes, which degrade organic compounds leaked from autotrophic iron-oxidizers and sulfur-oxidizers, there avoiding potential toxicity issues.
Engineered microbial consortia
The field of synthetic biology has developed a wide range of highly engineered clonal populations of bacteria to perform complex tasks.The construction and analysis of synthetic gene circuits has not only provided us with new tools for genetic engineering but has given deeper insight into naturally occurring gene circuits, their evolution, architectures, and properties as well. The industrial practice of biomining and bioremediation of heavy metal contaminations could potentially benefit from synthetic consortia as natural consortia have been shown to play crucial roles in these processes.
To our best knowledge, hybrid consortia consisting of genetically engineered and naturally occurring bioleaching bacteria have not been reported so far. In fact only two knockouts and two expression mutants have been reported in the scientific literature. One rus overexpressing A. ferrooxidans"
BNDS_CHINA,2018,Team:BNDS CHINA#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"4-HSL Induction as introduced in Experiment XIII. The time-averaged GFP production rate during the fourth hour of induction was modeled by Hill Equation (see model ). Therefore, GFP production rate of the device when C4-HSL concentration is
can be calculated by the derived function:
However, when we compared the GFP production rate of Sensor Device I at different concentrations of C4-HSL, we found its fluorescence in the environment of fish feces might be too low, since the difference between GFP production rate at 0 M and 9.90E-8 M of C4-HSL was only 12.4%, implying that the device cannot tell people whether the fish is infected with A. hydrophila effectively.
Fig 4. GFP production rate of sensor device I
III. Problems with Sensor Device I
To make the sensor workable in real environment, we intended to increase the difference between the device’s GFP production rates at 9.90E-8 M and 0 M of C4-HSL, but we didn’t know how to achieve it, since we thought the RBS we used (BBa_B0034) for GFP and RhlR expression was already the strongest and cannot be changed. Thus, we consulted Mr. Yihao Zhang from Peking University, and he pointed out our mistake: the strength of RBS can be influenced by the upstream and downstream DNA sequence, so we needed to use RBS calculator to determine the exact strength of the two RBSs in sensor device I. Following his advice, we examined our device on salislab.net, and found the RBS strength ratio of rhlR (LVA-tagged) and GFP was 1:5, indicating that the expression level of RhlR might be too low to repress and activate the expression of GFP in a desired level. Hence, we decided to improve the strength of RBS for rhlR (LVA-tagged).
IV. Characterization of Sensor Device II
By using RBS calculator, we derived a new RBS sequence for rhlR (LVA-tagged), which had 5 times of strength compared with the RBS used in sensor device I. We performed C4-HSL induction experiment again, and modelled the time-averaged GFP production rate with Hill Equation (see model ). We calculated the GFP production rate of device II at 9.90E-8 M of C4-HSL by the derived equation:
The figure below shows sensor device II’s GFP production rates at different concentrations of C4-HSL. However, the difference"

I am a master student with a broad (and deep) interest in biotechnological research, which is why I use most of my spare time in the lab. My main interests are in the fields of (medical) microbial biotechnology, biodiversity and bioinformatics, although I’m always curious about getting new angles or using an array of scientific disciplines if relevant in solving an interesting problem. Therefore I love to help out in ambitious projects were many aspects of biology are involved, and where I might be able to contribute with my relevant experience - which is why I appreciate my role in this iGEM project.

Reflection and experience
In recent years, the development of synthetic biology has been extremely rapid, and multitudes of             interesting and             practical applications have come into being. DNA synthesis techniques and applications using DNA as a             functional             material are also more frequently reported, such as information storage, DNA origami, DNA circuits, etc.             The             boundaries between life and machine are no longer as opposed as before, machines are getting more             intelligent, and             life is becoming more engineered. Our understanding of some traditional biological terms is also going             broader and             deeper, just like DNA, perceived as genetic material, can surprisingly be used to store information, serve             as a             target drug carrier or even as a practical circuit. How to present the latest progress of these sciences or             industries to the public and the primary and middle school students who are currently fast sensing the             world is a             problem that all scientists should lavish attention on, which is related to the understanding and             acceptance of             technology and the inheritance and expansion of science. It has seemed to be an old fashion to just impart             children             with the skill of painting a"

-  provide the program with a pdb file, which is a file that gives the spatial coordinates of every atom in the molecule.
However, curli are extremely stable and hard to characterize so there aren't a lot of publications that were able to fully characterize their shape, let alone define their spatial features with certainty. Thus we weren't able to find any such file in the banks we searched, be it the protein data bank, uniprot, and many others. We only managed to get a pdb file of the CsgA protein thanks to the generosity of Professor M. Chapman from the University of Michigan, who sent us his work and to whom we are really grateful.
To work on the protein, we mainly used two functions of Sybyl-X :
the minimize option, that searches for the minimal steric hindrance of the protein;
what we called a ""dynamic"", that is a simulation of the behavior of the protein under a set of conditions such as a magnetic force field (that can represent the effect of water for instance).
These tools were used once the His-tag and/or nickel ions were added, showing the behavior of the protein with these new elements around it.
However, keep in mind that when adding new atoms or amino acids, their position is totally arbitrary. They can be put wherever and however we want around the protein. It means that what is observed once is far from being enough to conclude, since it is very possible that the result would be different by placing the atoms slightly differently. Thus we had to run a lot of simulations, analyze and compare the results before we could conclude. And since both minimizations and dynamics take a lot of time, and we could only run one simulation at a time, the whole study spread over several weeks.
CsgA Engineering
The first step of the study was to determine the behavior of the CsgA protein once tagged with a poly-His peptide. Hence we ran several simulations as described above with both His1-tag and His2-tag, in C-terminus position but also inserted in a loop between two beta strands. With this, we could see if inserting the tag in the middle of the sequence had any kind of impact on the molecular structure causing a problem. Although the parts had already been conceived with the tags in C-terminus, it was interesting to be able to make the comparison for future considerations.

The first observation we can make is that two main conformations of the tags came"

Modeling Overview
In our project, we are dedicated to design a quorum-sensing oscillator which consists of two types of cells. Cells of the same type can fluctuate synchronously and certain designs were made to adjust the phase and the amplitude of oscillation. These are the things that our modeling part aims to simulate. We built and simplified our simulation system step by step and deepened into further characteristics of the system, which would provide firm evidence proving that our design does work.
PART 1 Accurate Model
In our first step, we wanted to describe the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. We came up a set of ODEs with 19 equations.

We prepared the dialysis bag experiment one again according to our protocol for kinetics measurements using our TPA detection assay- we will take sample from inside and outside the bag twice a day for 1 week and then we will expose it to UV light according to the TPA detection protocol to measure the kinetics index of cutinase CO on PET.
We used dialysis bag to check if e coli can live with P. putida- e coli inside the dialysis bag and putida outside of the dialysis bag in LB medium.- we will take samples inside the dialysis bag and outside the dialysis bag and sow it on  cam, kan, amp plate to see if they are still alive together (putida has a endogenic resistant to cam and amp, and we insert pACYC to e coli for cam resistant).

UCL,2018,Team:UCLouvain#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," best solution to the problem.
Some African countries such as Congo, Benin and Togo and many others are subject each year to the rainy season. During this period the river water ruiselle into the rains and there is no drinking water. The epidemics of                   salmonellosis and cholera then occur.
At the moment, in a crisis, the Ministry of Health acts on two levels. First, to warn the population about the rules of hygiene and to make prevention, but this is not easy for the most remote villages. The second level of                   action is the sale of aquatabs, chlorine tablets that filter the water. Unfortunately, it is not always easy for people to use it. Each tablet filters 30 liters of water and makes it drinkable for twenty-four hours. However,                   there are some areas where people have not been to school and have difficulty assimilating this.
The solution would be to directly treat the water at its source so that we can help illiterate people and remote populations who do not have television as a means of prevention.
This was the best link we could made between the lab and the real life!
This emotional journey prompted us once more to work the best way possible to find an affordable and effective solution to this problem! We are all very concerned and this journey gave us the final motivation to keep working!                   This also why our team won’t dissolve after iGEM, we are committed to the problem and we have still a long way to together!"

I am a junior majoring in life science with special interest in epigenetic and my name is Jin Fei. In the past 10 month I put most of my time on the IGEM and was response to the cell group. My main work consisted of cell direct conversion from MEF to neuron with two other team members. Talking about hobbies, some computer game and sports are good ways to relax. Most importantly killing cells in a variety ways is my biggest interest now.

The Thr-59 and Tyr-69 belongs to CDR H2, while Leu-113 and Tyr-134 belongs to CDR H3. Let’s see what happens after antibody design.
1.Thr-59 → Val
Figure 3. Energy before and after mutating Thr-59 to Val
Other terms of energy have minor influence
(Terms of Rosetta Energy Function can be found in principles )
As we all know, Thr has polar side chain, while Val has hydrophobic side chain. After mutating Thr-59 to Val, the solvation energy (Figure 3 fa_sol) has dropped dramatically, while the Van der Waals interaction energy (Figure 3 fa_atr & fa_rep, while calculating total energy, fa_rep should multiply by 0.55) has decreased a little. That means this mutation is in favor of the folding of protein, benefiting total energy.
2. Tyr-69 → Glu
This mutation results in notable changes in charge distribution. With negative electrification, Glu has accumulated negative charge. (Figure 4) Since the area surrounding residue 69 has positive electrical charge, the electrostatic energy has reduced. Calculating by the Rosetta energy function, the electrostatic energy is decreasing by 1.25 kcal/mol after the mutation.

3. Leu-113 → Trp & Tyr-134 → Phe
These two residues are on CDR H3. In fact, they are close to each other, although they seem separate in AHo Scheme residue numbering. More important, they are directly on the interface of VEGF and VEGF-scFv. The pentapeptide on the interface, Phe Phe Leu Pro Tyr, has been in placed of by Phe Phe Trp Pro Phe.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#blogtest_-_-_TEXT.html," dynamic behavior. More precisely, the read-out of the promoter activation is made by the relative fluorescence, which corresponds to the ratio of the absolute fluorescence over the Optical Density (OD). We consider that the concentration in GFP per cell is proportional to the relative fluorescence. As we try to avoid fitting the saturation events, we chose to normalize with respect to the highest value before a certain amount of time, which corresponds for each experiment to the apparition of the saturation.
As a first approach, we only try to fit the steady state value. As the signaling molecule is inducing the production of GFP, we chose to use an Hill function to fit the function [GFP] = f([AHL]) at steady state.
If Hill functions fit these two curves good, the parameters used are surprising. For our system, we suppose that AHL binds to the regulator protein LuxR. This complex called Rlux dimerizes before binding to the promoter to induce its expression. Thus, the dimerization event makes cooperativity emerge from AHL molecules. It is translated for a Hill function by n > 1. In this particular case, one could expect to find n=2 (as it is a dimerization event). Nevertheless, the n found are on the order of magnitude of 1 (0.89 for the non-riboregulated promoter plasmid and 1.22 for the ribo-regulated promoter plasmid). The data points were collected in triplicates and this allow us to have a look at the variability (namely standard deviation) around each value. Where the switch happens, the variability is higher (it is expected because the output GFP is more sensitive to variation of the input [AHL] around the switching point). Therefore, the inflexion points could need some improvment, by taking more points around this identified sensitive region. Moreover, this critical concentration of AHL was the one that was expected given the litterature and our system. We observe that it needs a higher [AHL] for the riboregulated system to be activated than for the non-riboregulated system.
We modeled leakiness as an offset in the Hill function : [GFP] = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is greater by one order of magnitude for the riboregulated system than for the non-riboregulated system. A drawback from the riboregulated system is that the amplitude of the signal corresponds to the amplitude of the noise in the non-riboreg"

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," experts for their opinion and a review to our mutagenesis system.
Prof Dr. Med. Ulrike Protzer , professor at the technical university in Munich, director of the institute of virology and currently working at the Helmholtz center Munich (German center for environmental health), said, that she could imagine an application in the virology. We could develop a diagnostic assay, since the production of our Evobodies in E. coli would be very low cost. Thus, we could provide a cheap diagnostic for third world countries like Africa.
Something equally said Prof. Dr. Ralf Bartenschlager , professor at the university of Heidelberg and member of the department of infectious diseases, who mentioned emerging viruses. Emerging viruses are viruses that occur suddenly. Most of them are unknown or difficult to find. They can spread in no time. Good examples  are the Zika virus, the MERS-Corona virus, the Ebola virus or newly evolved influenza viruses. As a basic researcher, he thinks that our method can perfectly complement modern –omics methods by providing an antibody.
Further topics that are mentioned by other experts can be seen in the following figure 3:
Figure 3: Overview of expert answers.
To be able to use the mutagenesis system as a detection system we wanted to provide our reporter gene with a fluorescent dye. Thus, we were able to detect a cell that produce a suitable Evobody. We could measure the strength of the fluorescence or the resistance level to conclude to the affinity of our target and Evobody.
Experts told us that we must consider the restricted protein folding in E. coli, and look out for disulfide bonds we decided to use Monobodies and Nanobodies in our library. Proteins with disulfide bonds mostly cannot be folded correctly in E. coli and therefore does not work with our bacterial two-hybrid system . Additionally, we planned to use our mutagenesis system as an antibody refinery like Prof. Dr. Bartenschlager advocated. Thus, we were producing antibody mimetics and provided their sequence to other researchers.
Correspondence with Manel Camps
Prof Dr. Manel Camps from the University of Santa Cruz is the leading expert concerning the use of the error prone polymerase I (EP-Pol I). He designed the two-plasmid system (Camps et. al 2003) and further characterized it over the years (Camps et. al 2003; Camps and Loeb 2005; Allen et. al, 2011; Troll et. al, 2011; Troll et. al"

We have thereby generated a standard curve that can correlate the observed fluorescence signal to the concentration of the DFHBI-1T Spinach2.1 complex.
Degradation of Spinach2.1
We measured the degradation rate of Spinach2.1 in vivo to be able to calculate promoter activity . Three cultures of a strain expressing Spinach2.1 from the strong promoter J23119 were grown to exponential phase, and transcription was stopped by adding rifampicin. Production of Spinach2.1 was thus halted, and we could measure the gradual decrease in Spinach2.1 concentration by measuring fluorescence with excess DFHBI-1T. The resulting degradation curves are shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Degradation curves for three replicates of a strain expressing Spinach2.1 from promoter J23119. Samples were taken each hour and measured with excess DFHBI-1T.
The mean of the three calculated degradation rates is 0.74 h-1 and the standard error of the mean is 0.08 h-1.
This degradation rate corresponds to an in vivo half-life of 56 minutes.
Fluorescence measurement
We selected 5 of the 9 constructed strains with different promoters. We selected 5 strains containing promoters with pronounced difference in strength to demonstrate our developed method for measuring promoter strength. The measured fluorescence signals were divided by the measured OD600. For each sample fluorescence was measured 5 times. An average value of these was used and illustrated in Figure 6 below.
Figure 6: The orange bars show fluorescence/OD for 5 different strains expressing Spinach2.1 from Anderson promoters. The grey bars show the expected fluorescence according to the relative promoter strengths reported in the registry , normalised to J23101.
The measured fluorescence/OD values are shown in Figure 6 together with the expected value, based on the relative promoter strengths reported in the registry. The expected values have been normalised to the measured fluorescence/OD value of J23101. The strength of the promoter BBa_J23119 is not yet characterised other than as a very strong consensus promoter. According to our data J23119 should have a relative activity of 238 percent, compared to J23100. All in all the measured fluorescence/OD values are in accordance with the relative characterisations done previously. This implies that measuring on an RNA level gives results comparable to using reporter proteins, at least for promoters of moderate strength. It could be theorised that using Spinach as a reporter"

“iGEM must position itself and not only define its role in the world of biotech - but also how it sees the role of synbio”.
iGEM’s approach to intellectual property will be intrinsically related to its overall position and self-definition in this exciting emerging field.
“It is time now to rationalize this 'big picture' and find a business model by treating the public, academia, biotech, pharma etc. as different units to optimize and synergize their outputs. And as with all business and communities, the major factor of success is to follow one ultimate vision - and that should remain increasing the quality of life”.
iGEM’s approach to intellectual property being critical for the future of the competition, its teams, and even the future of synthetic biology, our report analyses three alternative approaches to iGEM in dealing with this legal issue.
The benefits and disadvantages of each are summarised in the tables below.: maintaining the status quo; complete openness; confidentiality clauses; reach through licence agreements.

Structure of EP-Pol I
To produce more diversity in our library we use an in vivo mutagenesis system, which is based on an error prone DNA polymerase I (EP-Pol I) (Troll et. al 2011). Thus, the mutagenesis system generates mutations during replication. It is designed as a two plasmid system and is beneficial to our approach due to the selectivity towards a specific plasmid. Only the ColE1 plasmid encoding the target protein sequence is mutated.
Prof. Dr. Manel Camps from the University of Santa Cruz investigated a DNA polymerase I, called EP-Pol I, which lacks in correct synthesis and in proof-reading (Camps et. al 2003). In contrast to the normal DNA polymerase I the EP-Pol I has three point mutations, I709N, A759R and D424A (Camps et. al 2003)(figure 1). The I709N mutation is located in motif A. This is a conserved sequence in the palm domain of the polymerase active site. The mutations lead to an enlargement of the substrate-binding pocket, which is a possible explanation for the increased error rate (Camps et. al 2003). The D424A mutation in the exonuclease domain leads to deactivation of the proofreading activity of the EP-Pol I. The amino acid replacements A759R is located in the O-helix, which is a conserved sequence (motif B) that is located close to the polymerase active site on dNTP binding. This may stabilize the enzyme with similar conformations, which leads to missed integration of nucleotides (Camps et. al 2003).
Figure 1: Structures of the klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I with the three substitutions. The blue one is I709N, red is A759R and orange is D424A (Beese et. al 2011).
Mutation
According to Allen et al. 2011, the EP-Pol I produces evenly distributed mutations and generates base pair substitutions (transitions) and transversions. Another advantage of the EP-Pol I is that it only replicates and thus mutates plasmids that have a ColE1 ori and that the EP-Pol I processes Okazaki fragments (Allen et. al 2011). Therefore, no significant increase in the mutation rate of the chromosomal DNA was observed (Troll et. al 2014). During replication, the EP-Pol I is replaced by DNA"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html,", which is in our case fused to the peroxisomal import sequence PTS1, and a version of Pex11 that is fused to the fluorescent marker Venus. Both markers emit light in the green light spectrum, were as mRuby2 emits light in the red part of the spectrum, giving us a strong contrast and an easy way of differentiating between the two under the fluorescent microscope.
To physically create our constructs, we researched the DNA sequences of bacteriorhodopsin , Pex3 and PEX26 via UniProt and pre-designed our fusion constructs with the software tool „Geneious“. We ordered the synthesis of three separate parts ( Pex3 , PEX26 and Pex3 -BacR) from IDT. To ease out the process of assembling our plasmids, we used the „ Dueber Toolbox "", containing various parts such as promoters and terminators, to tailor the plasmids specific to your needs. Finally, to combine all the selected parts, we used the „Golden Gate” assembly method.
Secretion
For the peroxisome secretion in S. cerevisiae we designed fusion proteins of the v-SNARE Snc1 with different peroxisomal membrane anchors. We tested the constructs using a GUS Assay. The assays were performed using transformants of the strain BY4742.
Experimental Design
We will adapt the system of  Sagt and colleagues  to secrete the content of our modified compartments (Sagt et al, 2009) .
For the application of this system in S. cerevisiae we use a truncated version of the v-SNARE Snc1 to decorate our compartments (Figure 3.1) (Gerst et al, 1997) .
Figure 3.1 A diagram of the general domain structure of Snc1. V is a variable domain which is not important for the binding to the t-SNARE. TM is the transmembrane domain. H1 and H2 are the a-helical segments, forming the SNAREpin with the t-SNARE (Gerst et al, 1997)
To decorate the compartments with the SNARE we use a peroxisomal transmembrane protein . In our case we use the proteins Pex15 or Pex26, which were further investigated in another sub project, and fuse Snc1 to the N-terminus. We expressed these constructs of membrane anchor and Snc1 constitutively under control of the RPL18B promotor. In case of Pex15 we used a truncated version, lacking a"

Graphical User Interface - Modelling Comes to Life
Since our project focuses strongly on public engagement, we realised that we would need to have a clear, non-technical and, most importantly, interactive  method of explaining the science of the project  to potential users of The Lung Ranger/L.A.S.S.O. and wider public. The NetLogo simulations provided a really useful visual aid for explaining how the biological systems worked.  For instance, when we presented our project at the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust Conference our audience included clinicians, patients and parents. The feedback received afterwards highlighted that the science had been understood because of the NetLogo animation.
Conclusion
NetLogo provided a good qualitative comparison with the ODE and SSA models indicating that intracellular spatial effects were sufficiently captured on average by the more quantitative ODE/SSA approaches. Future work would include the development of our model into a 3D simulation so we could more fully study these intracellular spatial effects.  The most striking and useful aspect of this software was its ability to take the science, modelling and project as a whole into the hands of users.

Abstract

Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants"

Heeello!!! What’s up? Today we solved the molecular question from yesterday, of the vector that wasn’t releasing our bio brick! And the solution is: the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation fragment has 3.057 base pairs, and the vector pBSK has 2.861, that’s about 196 base pairs difference! The electrophoretic profile shows only one big band in 3.000 base pairs (comparing it to the marker). Hour hypothesis is that both are there, but we couldn’t separate it! The same hypothesis applies for BB_Essential + E0840! The vector PSB1C3 has 2.070 base pairs and the fragment around 2.136, that’s 66 base pairs difference! The profile shows just one big band at 2000 base pairs! Our construction worked, that’s for sure! To prove that they’re in the right size we developed the following strategy:
We’re going to digest the vectors (PBSK and PSB1C3) with our bio bricks to linearize (using EcoRI), and then digest to release the inserted gene (with EcoRI and PstI). The linear band should present double of band’s size cut to separate vector from fragment. That means, the fragment and BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation vector cut shows around 3.000 base pairs, the vector containing the linear fragment should show 6.000! Isn’t obvious?
To demonstrate our hypothesis, we used the following system for digestion:
The digestion took 1 hour and a half at 37°C.
Electrophoretic profile of enzymatic digestion:
1- BB_Essential + K346004 not digested.
2- BB_Essential + K346004 cut with EcoRI.
3- BB_Essential + K346004 digested with EcoRI and PstI.
4- BB_Essential + E0840 not digested.
5- BB_Essential + E0840 cut with Eco"

Studies on the Precautionary Principle
The problem with precaution and risk is that one never seems to have a certain knowledge about the outcome of an event. On everyday basis it does not seem to be a big issue: “maybe I will get wet if I leave the umbrella at home”. But when it comes to the decisions we have to make as a society then it is a different story: e.g. what will the consequences be if one was to allow more use of pesticides? When the consequences can not be known for certain then there is room for potentially big catastrophes - maybe all our water supply will be contaminated, which could lead to hormonal imbalances or something worse and unforeseen.
When considering the options, one should ask at least three questions: “What possible outcomes could the action have? How good (or bad) are these different outcomes? At what likelihood would these different outcomes occur?” The problem is that especially the last question possesses unknown factors. What we, as a society, seem to lack is a way of rationally deciding which action to take when factors are unknown. One also needs to be able to distinguish between which possible risks are important to take under consideration and which are not. It is not rational to take all possible risks under equal consideration - there seems to be some possible risks that are so unlikely that one should not take them too seriously, e.g. when transforming E. coli to synthesize spider silk, the impact on global warming should not be a problem to take into consideration.
In our field of synthetic biology we find the possible consequences in the lab and their probability are mathematically decided. But on that note there is a clear difference between the probability for the hypothesis or theory to be correct and the probability threshold we decide by when it comes to risk assessments.
Take for example a hypothesis stating that “the chemical substance X is dangerous and leads to cancer”. For this hypothesis to be accepted into the scientific corpus it needs to fulfill different - and more - requirements than it needs for the society to ban substance X on the base of precaution. Because if they knew it could potentially lead to cancer, they would be scared and why should they risk it? The epistemic values are simply different when it comes to scientific theories compared to the qualities which we value by when it comes to risks. Normally, when it comes to risk assessment it is more fatal to accept a technology or new substance which leads to undesired consequences than to accept a false hypothesis into a scientific theory.

Wellesley_HCI,2012,Team:Wellesley HCI#Notebook#NicoleNotebook_-_-_TEXT.html,". There were also a lot of ideas for the eLab Notebook, like being able to zoom in to a protocol and annotate it but when you zoom out again, all that has changed is that the protocol is now either highlight or changed its color to red. The user would then know that they had annotations and there would be no clutter.
Day 11: June 12, 2012
The Wellesley Lab went over to Boston University. We were able to meet the two undergraduates who are part of the BU team. Traci presented more about Synthetic Biology and went into more details about parts names, what they did, and we learned more about what they are currently doing for the competition. Afterwards, three from the Wellesley team presented our research topics and the ideas that resulted from our brainstorming the day before. We then proceeded to brainstorm even more, gaining valuable insight from the BU team.
Day 12: June 13, 2012 - Day 13: June 14, 2012
Veronica and I presenting our ideas about semantic search to the rest of the lab
Main brainstorming started today. In the morning, we set up a classroom such that each project had a different section. We stuck photos associated with our projects on the walls, and we wrote on post it notes and on the whiteboard of the ideas we currently had. When the BU team came over for the day, we went around to the different sections and had a huge group discussion for each project with the original subgroups leading the discussions. We talked about the possibilities of each project, any ideas pertaining to the project that popped out at other people, examples of similar projects done in the past, other things (e.g. platform applications) that can be incorporated into them (e.g. for the beast: DiamondSpin). We learned more about what the art project entailed and clarified the type of audience it would be aimed towards. Natalie Kuldell was able to stop by and gave us very useful input on what she thought of our current ideas for the eLab Notebook. Two things were made very clear: being able to search through the notebooks a scientist has accumulated throughout the years of their research would be a valuable tool; and, having the freedom to write whatever you want on the notebook is important, so we’ve started researching on styluses we could use.
Day 14: June 15, 2012

Experiment 12: Optimisation of blocking and first use of PDMS spotting templates
protocols used : Plasma activation , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking
2015.05.28
considerations
Try new washing and blocking step. Also use PDMS spotting mask for the first time.
Experiment/Protocol
Made 8 APTES/PDITC slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Use of 4 GOPTS slides from 26.5.2015 to test binding with reduced reaction agressivity of stored GOPTS-slides
Spotted 4 GOPTS and 4 APTES/PDITC slides as in Spotting+Blocking
one GOPTS and APTES/PDITC slide each was spotted using the PDMS spotting help
one GOPTS and APTES/PDITC slide each was incubated over night with GFP
Results
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces
Fluorescence intensity on PDITC highest at 500 µg/ml GFP
Fluorescence intensity on GOPTS highest at 1680 µg/ml GFP
Fluorescence intensity for overnight incubation slightly higher
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on GOPTS surfaces with shutterspeed of 1s and normalised shutterspeed of 4s
Intensity values should not differ but they do→ further investigate
Influence of PDMS spotting help on mean GFP fluorescence spot intensity on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces
PDMS spotting help useful on PDITC

Lethbridge_HS,2016,Team:Lethbridge HS#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," the venom should be significantly higher which in turn should accelerate our clotting. By having our proteins in the periplasmic space, we only need to puncture the outer membrane in order to lyse the cell. This function also allows us to release our construct without introducing E.coli inside the body.
As a side note, we decided to use E.Coli as our chassis because it is easier to use than other chassis such as yeast, and we have experience of working with it before. We have looked into using other chassis such as plant cells, but based on the convenience of E.Coli, we went with that.
Second Construct
The design of our first construct induced a rapid production of clotting proteins and in order to supplement it, we have designed a construct that would stabilize the clot and sterilize the wound. In order to stabilize the clot, we added Human Factor XIIIa (propeptide removed) which is the enzyme responsible for the polymerization of fibrin monomers, by keeping the promoters and binding sites the same strength we ensure that all of the fibrin-venom strands bind at the wound site and form a permanent plug that will not be easily re-opened. Having Factor XIIIa will accelerate the rate of polymerization which further ensures that the venom-fibrin strands will stay localized.
In addition, we have added an AntiMicrobial peptide to insure that all bacteria and infection that is potentially in the wound is sterilized. We have deployed the AMP LL-37 which punctures the outer membrane of bacterial cells causing their organelles to become exposed, ending in the cells dying. We have paired the AMP with a thrombin cleavage site that when introduced to the venom serine protease (Cerastotin) from our original construct, will cut the AMP that is bound to Factor XIIIa at the thrombin site, and at that moment become a functional protein that sterilizes the wound.
Application Method
In order to apply our product to the wound, we will contain our construct in a pre-filled syringe that can be applied to the wound which would be followed by a bandage for sealing it in place. Although our team discussed various other application methods such as spray, gel, or gauze, we eventually decided on the syringe and bandage because of advice and feedback we had received from interviews that were conducted. For instance, a bandage is more resistant to cold temperatures, easy to apply and was the most popular answer on the survey.
We decided to use a syringe because it is already in use by other blood coagulants, for example Pfizer"
