Peking
Jianzhao Yang from Peking came to Fudan University this July and had a friendly academic exchange with members of Fudan-CHINA. These two teams previously had little, but they became acquaintance after borrowing rainbow beats from one another. They scheduled an exchange on one project afterward in Shanghai. We introduces our programs to each other and took Yang to the lab and research platform where IGEM is at our school. Yang told us the method of connecting simultaneous multi-segments used by Peking University currently.

Tongji-Software
In September, we received an invitation from Tongji-Software and went to Tongji University who owns all kinds of delicate buildings. During this meetup, we realized cross-track communication. The model Tongji-Software used also included Probability Theory, sharing similarities with the Markov chain used in our main model. Inspired by them, we made some changes in terms of the probability parameters of the model, introducing some probability distribution conclusions in biochemical reactions, making the model more persuasive. After introducing the project to each other, we learned that Tongji-Software encountered some difficulties in the process of making a Wiki page. Our team member who is the computer master guided them on how to use templates, how to upload files, how to edit Web page code, and also reminded them of all the files and the external source code that needed to be uploaded to the iGEM server.

Comic: Funniest Failure Experience in your experiment
We decided to collect some interesting reasons for experiment failures and choose some of them to design a comic brochure, to add some amusement and at the same time remind everyone in the lab to be really careful and not to make mistakes during operation. Also we will distribute this brochure in our school and Giant Jamboree to get more researchers' attention in a humorous way. Luckily, we got response from iGEMers all over the world. Some of them are really miserable though bring us a lot of joy. We consider those stories lively but meaningful to all of us. Thus, thanks to our great talented drawer Hao"

I'm second year medical student. My lessons and medicine are pleasure for me.I find Synthetic Biology really challenging as it is limitless and involved in every major. I joined iGEM to learn more things about this developing branch of science. I take care of me and my team spending useful time in lab. Most of all I like making competent cell. Of course I have hobbies outside of this; swimming, watching movies and discovering new places are just some of them!

Hi! I’m second year medical student. I like my lessons without exceptions. I get excited by learning new things, especially in branches of science. I guess that’s why I take so much pleasure of iGEM studies (researches, experiments etc.). Furthermore, I think youths will achieve such incredible points in SynBio and in science as long as they are encouraged. I will try to be together with those young scientists which work with endless desire in every opportunity.

Hi I have just finished second year of medical school. I've been addicted to iGEM since my first steps to university but only this year I have had a chance to be the part of this incredible team. After accidentally burning our precious bacteria while spreading the plate, mates got used to teasing me by calling ‘Bakteri Külbastı Ustası’ which in english means ‘Bacteria Cutlet Chef’. I’ve gained so much experience with iGEM, especially it woke up the spirit of endless research and explore in me. Besides I’m fanatical about astronomy and everything classic; books, music, clothes and etc.

The format of this primer needs the BioBrick formatted prefix, the promoter and part of the RBS site. The prefix of the standard BioBrick was analyzed and the primer was found to be able to be inserted after the XbaI site and be able to insert the promoter just before the RBS site. The promoters were selected from the Anderson Constitutive Promoter Library in the iGEM parts registry.

Characterization of Function
Analysis
The flow cytometry data suggests successful insertion of both an RBS and a promoter via PCR with our specialized primers. The vertical lines transecting the histograms represent the “gate” or boundaries used to determine the presence of mCherry. When comparing the mean fluorescent molecules per cell, the high efficiency (HE) RBS and promoter combination is about 2,000 molecules per cell higher than the low efficiency (LE) RBS and promoter combination. This result was expected; however the degree to which the RBS or promoter individually played in the overall expression is yet to be determined. Insertion of the RBS and promoter crosses (e.g. RH2 with PL1 and RL1 with PH2) into pSB1C3_mCherry are underway. Theoretically, the flow cytometry data will yield plots that fit in between the current data.

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#ApproachA_-_-_TEXT.html," the mid to late exponential growth phase and resuspended in a specific tethering medium. To truncate the flagella, the bacteria were pushed through a very thin needle. This is a necessary step so the       bacteria bind to the antibody close to the membrane, which guarantees nice circular rotations.       The microfluidic chip was prepared by incubating it with the antibody specific for the flagellar protein FliC. The antibody attaches to the glass surface, due to intermolecular forces with the glass’ silica surface. The bacteria with the       sheared off flagella were then also incubated inside the channels overnight at 4°C to prevent cell division (see Microfluidic Chip ).
Imaging the apartate response
The procedure described in this section was the proof-of-concept experiment for the viability of “Approach A: Chemotaxis” as a biosensor. It showed the bacteria reacting to step changes in concentration of the natural Tar ligand aspartate. The       readout was acquired by imaging many bacteria with a 20x magnification phase contrast microscope. The low magnification allowed us to have enough resolution to resolve single spinning bacteria, while guaranteeing a high enough frame rate (25       frames per seconds) to also resolve the bacteria’s natural rotational frequency (2-9 Hz). As seen in (video of spinning bacteria) only about 5-10% were spinning, a value which agrees with literature [citation needed].       Several dilutions of aspartate ranging from 0.1 μM to 1 mM were prepared. These concentrations correspond to the natural sensing range of the Tar receptor.[citation needed] To expose the tethered cells to the different concentrations, the       medium in the reservoir of the microfluidic chip was exchanged manually with a pipette. With the optimal flow rate of 10 μL/min (see Microfluidic Chip ) the cells were induced       resulting in the described change in rotational bias. We measured many different concentration changes; we increased from zero to low and high concentration and we made multiple stepwise increases or decreases.
The video shows an overview of multiple bacteria spinning inside the microfluidic chip.
Originally this experiment was conducted by analyzing individual cells by eye.[3] We developed an image analysis algorithm (with the help of Corey Dominick from the University of Pittsburgh Link to attributions/integrated HP) to read out the       rotation of the bacteria. This is achieved by determining the position of the individual bacteria in each frame of the video, which yields the rotational angle for subsequent frames (more details Link Software/Motility analysis). From this       data the adaptation times for"

RBS*
BBa_B0034 is currently the strongest E. coli RBS present in the iGEM Registry, however, its activity drops by about 84% when it is used in Synechocystis (Heidorn et al., 2011). RBS* is an RBS that has been specifically designed to include the anti-Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence of Synechocystis and has an optimal spacing of 9bp between the central base of the core SD sequence and the first base of the start codon (Heidorn et al., 2011). RBS* has been shown to be 5 times stronger than BBa_B0034 in Synechocystis (Heidorn et al., 2011).
Coding Sequences
Fluorescent reporters
Fluorescence is widely used as a proxy for promoter activity by expressing fluorescent proteins. While this remains an indirect measurement, it provides an insight into expression levels and provides a certain advantage by allowing for continuous quantification without disrupting the assessed cells (Lissemore et al. 2000).
In the past, other fluorescent proteins, including Cerulean, GFPmut3B and EYFP, have been demonstrated to work in both E. coli and Synechocystis. The reported excitation wavelenghts used were 433, 505 and 515 nm, respectively, where the maximum emission wavelengths registered for Cerulean, GFPmut3B and EYFP were 477, 514 and 529 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). This suggests that other fluorescent protein that work between those ranges might be suitable reporter proteins in cyanobacteria, in spite of the strong background of photosynthetic pigments (Huang et al. 2010).
For this project, the selected reporters were a monomeric Red fluorescent protein (mRFP), from Discosoma striata (coral) with a reported excitation peak at 584 nm and an emission peak at 607 nm. As a second reporter iLOV was selected. iLOV, a modified LOV2 domain from a blue light receptor phototropin (Briggs et al. 2007) has a reported  excitation peak around 476nm, with a measurable emission range between 510 and 550 nm.

Who We Are
The Students, Faculty and Staff that made this project possible.
The School
University of North Carolina at Asheville.
As the only dedicated liberal arts institution in the University of North Carolina system, UNC Asheville kindles learning by offering students an intellectually rigorous education that builds critical thinking and workforce skills to last a lifetime. Small class size, award-winning faculty and a nationally acclaimed undergraduate research program foster innovation as well as recognition.
The cornerstone of a liberal arts education is the ability to explore the connections between many different subjects as well as the options available. So learning here expands well beyond the classroom walls. Focusing on undergraduate studies, we help students dig into learning, whether they participate in faculty-mentored research projects, undertake career-related internships, study abroad, or join service projects aimed at improving the quality of life at home and around the world. We encourage everyone to seek challenges, seize opportunities and become a doer as well as a thinker.
At UNC Asheville, we’ve created an environment for exploring the world as well as more than 30 different majors. About 3,900 undergraduate students and about 330 full- and part-time faculty bring the campus alive with a genuine hunger to understand and contribute to the human experience. Amid the culturally rich setting of Asheville, North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge Mountains, it’s all designed to spark a lifelong quest to know more — a fire that will grow brighter in the future.

K576007 contains GFP1 and IN1
K576009 contains GFP1, IN1 and lox1
K576011 contains the promoter (P), ribosomal binding sit (RBS), GFP1, IN1, lox site, IN2, GFP2 and transcriptional terminator (TT). This is the final construct (experimental design)
2.1.2 Controls' Construction Map
Controls are necessary to prove that the design of this experimental investigation is functional and more practically for comparison of fluorescence in the laboratory. In the positive control, GFP1 and GFP2 flank either RFC25 or RFC53, which will not disrupt translation regardless of the linker. Therefore, fluorescence is expected. The experimental run will ideally show fluorescence resulting from the self-excision of IN1 and IN2.
Figure 6 represents the positive control. For consistency, GFP1 and GFP2 are separated by RFC53 (RFC25 could have also be used), which should not disrupt expression of a functional GFP.
In the negative control (using the same constitutive promoter), GFP1 and GFP2, followed by a transcriptional terminator, flank RFC10 (Request For Comments) resulting in a stop-codon-containing scar. No fluorescence is expected for this component (background) because translation is interrupted. This is meant to control for the possibility of a non functional fusion protein. The expectation is that this fusion of GFP1 and GFP2 will not fluoresce, which is a consequence of some fusion protein techniques. Figure 7 shown below details the negative control design:
Figure 7 is an illustration of the negative control containing the interrupted GFP with an in-frame stop codon, ensuring that it is not expressed. Since this sequence contains no excision sites (Group I introns), we do not expect any modification to this area of the RNA.
The figure below shows the construction map for the controls.
K576005 contains the first component of GFP (GFP1)
K576006 contains the second component of GFP (GFP2)
K576013 contains the promoter (P), ribosomal binding site (RBS), GFP and transcriptional terminator (TT). This is the positive control.
K576005 contains the first component of GFP (GFP1))
J61046 contains the lox site
K576006 contains the second component of GFP (GFP2)

Downloaded DISOPRED, memsat-svm, pfilt and psipred, none of which worked as easily as I had hoped.
Week 10 (23d)
After experimenting with Blastpgp I found it is not worth the computational time to add. And since it is needed for disopred, I looked for a replacement and found IUPRED. It has 3 options, long short and glob, long and short give a number for each amino acid, between 0 and 1, with 1 being high disorder. In my test run these lists are correlated at 0.82. So I’ll probably only use long, and glob.
I found the Ecoli C321 delta chassis: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/215084 with Accession code: PRJNA215084
Playing around with svms and data, its fun! Protein statistics per positional amino acid is hard, maybe do sliding windows of a certain size, get average values?
Compared secondary structure from psipred with psiblasting my own cry prot database to an actual PDB structure, and they fit quite well!
In the FFpred_wrapper script I've been working on I had worked with pieces of 20 amino acids each, instead of being inspired by the real FFpred and creating a certain amount of equal sized chunks per protein.
 
Week 11 (30th)
Bugfixing FFpred, dealing with the format of the comma separated or csv file I'm making. Cross validated the SVMs

● Last, excessive accumulation of ROS will affect the survival of engineered strain.                             Feedback Module can ensure modest cell survival.
Screening Promoters
We screened out a lot of promoters for regulator                                 components (GAL1p), feedback                                 components (CTT1p, GLR1p                         , TRX2p, TRR1p, TSA1p, SOD2p, GSH1p, GSH2p, GAL1p                         and MSY1p), and output                                 components (FBA1p, TEF1p, TEF2p, ENO2p, PCK1p,                         PDC1p and PGI1p)                         to find the promoter with the most suitable expression for detection. Additionally, because of                         the plug-and-play characteristic, the selected promoters with different expression strength                         also provide the possibility and alternatives for future application under different                         conditions.
Design                     Modeling
Modeling is an important part of synthetic biology. A science can only be truly perfected when                         it successfully applies mathematics.
Considering that fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 can only characterize the relative level                         of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but can't give the absolute content of intracellular ROS                         quantitatively, we established the model based on Michealis equation and some assumptions,                         which can convert fluorescence intensity of roGFP2-orp1 into the intracellular H2O2 concentration. As a result, the output signal of roGFP2-orp1 has a more intuitive meaning and                         higher application value.

The podcast was promoted by various outreach organisations in Oxford, as well as on our own social media accounts. Our podcast can be listened to here:
Oxford Sparks is an online resource dedicated to advertising Oxford’s scientific research and encouraging young people to consider a career in STEM subjects. Their website contains a range of resources to support teachers to make science engaging for students, as well as showing an insight into the lives of researchers. We collaborated with Oxford Sparks to promote careers in synthetic biology to young people, including running a ‘iGEM Twitter Takeover’. During the Takeover, we tweeted photos of our work during the day, including the lab work, online research and outreach events. Through this, we hope to have promoted our research in an accessible way, as well as demonstrating the collaborative and diverse nature of scientific research.
In addition to the online educational resources aimed at school students, we engaged in work to promote our project and genetic engineering to adult audiences. The Oxford Scientist Blog is aimed at university students, staff and the general public to address current ideas in the science field as well as research that is being undertaken at the university. We wrote an article for the blog to explain our project and how genetically engineered probiotics may have applications in modern medicine. The blog article can be viewed: here
Additionally, we wrote an article that featured in Phenotype Journal - a science magazine produced by Oxford University Biochemical Society - to explain our project and our involvement in the UK iGEM Meet Up.
Long-term Education Plan
Based on our outreach work, it was clear that the general public has an insufficient understanding of genetic engineering and are therefore unable to make truly informed decisions about using genetically engineered medical products. Informed consent is a complex ethical concept that plays an important role in the research and clinical practice, describing the fact that a patient must be fully informed about the treatment and its associated benefits and risks before opting whether to take the medication. Since the information about both probiotics and genetic engineering is commonly misunderstood by the general public, the production and use of our treatment should be accompanied by a drive to educate the public about these issues.
We believe that assessing the problems associated with public acceptance of GM foods, where the introduction of GM foods into Europe “prompted major conflict”, is vital to the development of effective strategies to ensure public acceptance of genetically engineered probiotics. The European introduction of GM foods has been heavily criticised due to the failure of researchers, industry and public authorities to “address concerns prevailing among the general public”.

Clemson,2012,Team:Clemson_-_-_TEXT.html," genes necessary for this rhamnolipid production could potentially be isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli. In addition, several strains of P. aeruginosa were readily available, making it an obvious choice. The rhamnolipid genes of several strains were compared and found to be highly conservative. This has lead to the creation of primers for the PCR that would isolate and amplify these genes making them available for cloning into the swarming microbes of the PCB degrading system. For the actual PCB/ biphenyl degradation, we plan to clone genes from Spingobium yanoikuyae using PCR, which will then be activated after our microbial community has sensed biphenyl in the environment. So far, we are in the process of designing primers for the array of genes required for biphenyl degradation.

Cooper_Union,2014,Team:Cooper Union#Notebook#Biohack_-_-_TEXT.html," gel and gel purify the band that contained our desired piece. This time, again we saw a lot of bands, but I threw out the gel accidentally. So, instead of sending PCR products to genewiz for sequencing, we're going to send the whole plasmid once we midi prep it from the colonies. (See ""Gel 6/30/14"")  I purified the gel fragments that had the input and output backbones that had been cut with KpnI and XhoI, following ""PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Protocol"". I then nanodropped the four purified products (each one was split into two tubes, because there was too much volume to fit into one spin column). The results were very low or negative again. We are trying to figure out why this happened, but aren't sure yet. We ran the four products on a gel, and all showed that there was indeed DNA in the products, so we don't know why the nanodrop isn't giving good values. (See ""Gel 6/30/14"") Professor Medvedik found that the L3 buffer used to dissolve the gel fragments causes issues with the nanodrop, so they have to be washed in a certain way. When we do this, I will type up that protocol.  I autoclaved 3 bottles of LB agar and poured two of them as 50ug/mL chlor plates and the other one as chlor/amp (50ug/mL and 100ug/mL) plates.   I inoculated 50mL each of UV+pACYC184, GFP+pBR322, HSP+pACYC184 colony 1, and HSP+pACYC184 colony 3, so I could do midi preps on all of them tomorrow.
7/1/14:  Working with the input and output backbones that had negative concentrations on the nanodrop yesterday, we added 5uL of 3.0M potassium ethoxide and 100uL of ethanol. This was frozen overnight. In the morning, we spun it in the centrifuge at max speed for 15 minutes. Then the liquid was removed and more ethanol was added. It was again centrifuged at max speed for 10 minutes, and then the liquid was removed again. It was resuspended in 20uL of water. On the nanodrop, the input backbone had a concentration of -0.8ng/uL and the output backbone had a concentration of 3.2ng/uL.  Of the four inoculations set up last night, only the"

We bought EpCAM with His-tag. It's widely known that His-tag could chelate with nickel ions, so we incubated EpCAM protein with nickel beads to bind them together. Adding the antibody and then incubating, we measured them with flow cytometry. At the same time, we started two other control group experiments, with the result shown below.

Figure 1. The result of detecting the binding of EpCAM with fluorescent antibody, with flow cytometry.
a) Black line: pure nickel beads;
b) Blue line: nickel beads + fluorescent antibody (measure the non-specific adsorption between beads and antibody);
c) Red line: nickel beads-EpCAM complex + fluorescent antibody.
From the graph and data above, we could find out that the non-specific adsorption between nickel beads and fluorescent antibody does exist, but in the presence of EpCAM, the fluorescence intensity increased seven times compared with the original one, so we could prove that our bio-active EpCAM protein successfully combined with fluorescent antibody.
Combination between SYL3C and EpCAM (Fluorescence Polarization)
Although EpCAM and aptamer SYL3C are directly quoted in the literature [1], we believed that we still needed to verify this step and that we could ensure the validity of our material.
We struggled with this step for a long period, and we suspected that our failure was caused by impure materials. We used 30 KDa ultrafiltration tube--through which unbound fluorescent aptamer could pass, but the aptamer combined with protein could not. We also used flow cytometry to directly detect whether there were binding fluorescent aptamer on EpCAM, without satisfying results in the end.
Fortunately, we successfully validated this step with the fluorescence polarization method after replacing materials, with the proposal from Prof. Zhi Zhu. We incubated two groups, namely pure fluorescent aptamer as well as fluorescent aptamer with EpCAM without light"

We received new PCR primers for the dCas9 system and PCR Rescued them. We sent new Plasmid 1 colonies #1, #6, and #9 for sequencing and digested them with ClaI and SalI-HF for 10 hours (5 hour digestion with ClaI, 65 degrees C heat inactivation of ClaI, 5 hour digestion with SalI-HF). Ashlee ran the PCR products on a gel and 3/4 were successful. She digested dCas9 PCR with ClaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. She digested the backbones with phosphotase so they would not self-ligate, and ligated in the dCas9 system (16 hour ligation). Ashlee also used the new backbones to CBAR the old dCas9 PCR product, just to test whether our old dCas9 system was correct.

⇒ 100µL of the DH5α overnight culture were innoculated in a second 100mL of LB and left to grow for several hours. When the mixture was barely cloudy, the solution was pelleted. Pellets were very small, so a total of only ~5-10mL of competent cells was produced total. THIS SHOULD BE DONE EVERY WEEK PEOPLE!
⇒ BL21 was innoculated in ~100µL LB in preparation for competent cell production.
⇒ AgeI, NgoMIV, SacI were ordered. NgoMIV is currently on back-order and will arrive later. AgeI and NgoMIV are necessary for the RFC25 protein fusion standard, if we ever want to use it; SacI is useful for cutting the OmpA part.
⇒ To assess the compatibility of Gli-I with the RFC25 standard, a digest was run with EcoRI and AgeI. AgeI is very expensive and should only be used sparingly. The digest showed one distinct, linear band, indicating the lack of an AgeI site. This does not bode well for fusion constructions with Gli-I, although it may be compatible with the RFC23 standard, which uses standard Biobrick enzymes.

Process
Figure 1: A process consists of multiple stages. This is the overall process the team went through.
20th-22nd March was the weekend where our process began. The preparation phase was initiated by a trip to Langeland, an idyllic place in the South Funen Archipelago. This was our supervisors idea, the ultimate opportunity to meet each other and brainstorm on projects. The trip was a success and we returned to SDU with a great idea in our minds; PAST (peptide aptamer screening using two-hybrid system) is the future.
Next, the idea phase, with several group meetings, discussions on how to execute our project and the  possible aspects that should be included. We designed a model for our system and started building our BioBricks, first on paper and then in the lab. To see which protocols, primers and such that we have used, please go to our Complete Journal .
Collaborations is one of the key stones in iGEM and of course we did a lot of it. Just to mention some of it, we went to Lithuania and exchanged some good advice"
Hong_Kong_HKU,2016,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#IIT_-_-_TEXT.html," mathematical analysis on the tristable system model, and revealed a surprising behaviour of the switch – Oscillation occurs under certain conditions.
The analysis commences with a Boolean model and proved the existence of oscillation performed by the tristable system. A more elaborated model based on ODE was formulated to further characterise the oscillatory behaviour of the system. This further confines the conditions at which oscillation occurs, as well as identifying the parameters controlling the magnitude of the oscillation.
Their findings on these additional behaviours of the switch further our understanding on the system; and hence, allowing us to fine tune if no further functions are added to the circuit design.

Human Practices
IIT Madras iGEM team creates a game, Codonut, to teach the players about the codon optimization phenomena which boosts the protein expression during protein synthesis by means of the ribosomal machinery in the cells so that the translational efficiency of the gene of interest can be elevated. Our team tried the game and found that it is really educational and informative. To help them optimize the game, we gave some comments and solutions towards several problems, like technical issues and tactics for attracting more players.
This game is highly recommended for diving into the molecular world in biology. If you are interested, please go to:

Tool Overview
SynFlo is an interactive installation that focuses on making the ideas behind synthetic biology accessible and understandable by referencing a specific synthetic biology experiment called E. chromi . This award-winning experiment conducted by the University of Cambridge, involves the creation of E. coli that will serve as color-changing biosensors. The E. chromi protocol involves three basic tasks: drawing color-changing DNA from a parts library, encoding the DNA in bacterial plasmids, and then inserting the plasmids into E. coli.
Implementation
To simulate the E. chromi experiment protocol, the installation employs a tabletop computer, tangible objects that represent environmental toxins, and triplets of Sifteo Cubes .  Sifteo Cubes are a commercially available, clickable 1.5 inch block micro computers that can interact with each other and communicate with a computer via proprietary 2.4GHz radio protocol. The current prototype of SynFlo supports up to six Sifteo Cubes. The interaction and animation is programmed using the Sifteo SDK written in C#.
Concept
Each triplet of Sifteo cubes consists of a BioBrick cube, a plasmid cube, and an E. coli cube.  To represent the real-world application of E. chromi as biosensors, the user can deploy the E. coli onto a tabletop computer. Once there, the user can add three different types of contaminants to the Surface. The E. coli will move around, and if they travel over a toxin that they are encoded to sense for, they will change color.
Modify E. coli
Pressing on the BioBrick cube scrolls through a library of three colors and toxin shapes. Users add the BioBrick to a plasmid and mix by vortexing: the BioBrick cube is placed on top of the plasmid, then the two are shaken together while the color drips into the plasmid. Then, just as a biologist would pipette, mix, and eject"

Discuss biosafety standards and compare those of Community Labs to those of Universities
The ""Technik Garage"" joins the Medlife network
To fulfill the first objective, we invited Dr. Jansen from the life sciences network MedLife. This Network connects around 35 biotechnological and medical companies, 12 research groups and 17 other companies like consultants, patent lawyers and software providers. It is designed to perceive the needs of their members and find solutions within or outside of the network. As a result of our discussion, Dr. Jansen agreed to add the Technik Garage to the Medlife network, which everybody appreciated as a win-win situation.
Subsequently, we discussed how synthetic biology can be used in Community Labs. Since the members of the Technik Garage regularly teach in different schools, as well as in their own lab, they were really interested in possible synbio school projects.  As a consequence of sharing experiences in teaching biology, we revised the school project of the iGEM Team Aachen 2014 as well as a suitable protocol of a practical course for bachelor students. Using the provided material, they are able to reach hundreds of students and teachers within the next years and thereby spreading the spirit of synthetic biology.
If you ask the public about Community Labs, biosafety is one of the most prominent concerns. To evaluate biosafety aspects of Community Labs, we invited the iGEM Team of Paris Saclay to join our discussion via Skype. Together, we discussed different approaches to guarantee a high safety level of Communitly Labs. During this dialog, we focussed on the applicability of the two containment strategies of iGEM Paris Saclay, especially concerning the use in Community Labs.

The mathematical model was developed using basic rate formulas of activation and repression as shown in the system of equations above. We then expanded them to include the different parameters required for our model.
These additions are as follows
IPTG concentration to calculate the amount of Y (LacI) repressing Z (sfGFP).
ATC concentration to calculate the amount of X (rtTA) available to bind Y promoter and Z promoter.
Transfer rates of proteins between the cytosol and the nuclei to calculate transfer rates by size of each protein.

Cambridge,2009,Team:Cambridge#Notebook#Week3_-_-_TEXT.html," the iGEM competition last year (using the 0.8% agarose Bioline E-GELs). All hyperladders were confirmed to be working. It was decided to order more Hyperladder I as this gives the most useful spread of bands for the DNA we will be working with. This was also a test of the E-GEL system confirming the gels worked well.
Picture above shows the gel test run for the ladders. From left: hyperladder I, four samples of hyperladder IV found in the freezer. There were no meaningful results from the PCR run, so we went back to check over the proceedure for errors.
Transformations
We transformed Duncan's orange plasmid into Top10, Roche, and parent strain competent cells.  Plated onto chloramphenicol and tetracycline plates, as we're not 100% sure of the antibiotic resistance properties of the plasmid.
Preparing culture
Single cultures of the melA transformed cells and TOP10 cells (for a control) were incubated at 37 degrees in 20 mL of agar overnight. The aim is to try to characterise the melanin pigment using the OD and flourescence plate-reader.
Thursday
Dry Work
Primers
Redesigned Primer A for the melA plasmid to include the native ribosome binding site:
Green is the suffix, purple is the ribosome binding site and the cyan is the start of the gene.
Also characterised the vio operon in terms of the seperate genes:
vio A = 1256bp (two unwanted restriction sites)
vio B = 2996bp (six unwanted restriction sites)
vio C = 1289bp (two unwanted restriction sites)
vio D = 1121bp (one unwanted restriction sites)
Road maps
Made road maps for melanin, violacein, pseudomonas, detailing the constructions and biobricks we plan to make all the way to making logic circuits.
Notes from 2:30 lab meeting
Need to further integrate amplification and pigments into a ""big idea""
what is the rate limiting step in pigment formation - number of enzymes or substrate?
Avenues to consider
Strains of bacteria that detect concentrations of something and respond by turning a different colour - we could base that on the band pass project and use a system that produces 2 pigments with one pathway, for example violacein or pseudomonas
for example, as in band pass, at low concentrations of AHL make cyan, have high concentrations of AHL turn on VioC and product violet"

University_College_London,2012,Team:University College London#MOYM_-_-_TEXT.html," rights and responsibilities relating to such large scale projects.  However, our research quickly revealed that these topics had been already been well-publicized and thoroughly discussed.  We decided to try and avoid the tired and abstract moral/ethical questions, and bring our debate into a more concrete setting by using a ‘crisis scenario’.
Crisis scenario
The crisis scenario was inspired by the Rathenau Institute’s Synbio futures ,  a series of ‘techno-moral vignettes’ – short stories imagining possible futures in which synthetic biology technologies have become commonplace.  Our crisis scenario, which is set in 2030, imagines the mutation of widely-used synthetic fertilizer, FertiBac, to produce a toxin that is spreading into crops and waterways.  See the full scenario here .
Using this crisis scenario we provide a framework for the debate by setting out a possible future in which the fears raised by synthetic biology have come true – to discuss the ‘what now’ rather than the ‘what if’, to debate in practicalities rather than generalities.
The debate
We are very pleased to have Annemiek Nelis of the Dutch Safety Board chairing our section of the Meeting of Young Minds.  We will also have a panel of representatives from the UEA Norwich and Paris Bettencourt iGEM teams, the Oxford Conservative Association, GreenLeft Youth Organization, and National Federation of Young Farmer’s Clubs, amongst others.
They will act as the ‘European Council of Synthetic Biology’, who will come together in a public hearing in the aftermath of the crisis. They will be responsible for deciding the best course of action to take and interrogating members of our team, as the scientist, manufacturer, marketer, and regulator of the failed technology.  We will also hear questions and suggestions from the public, of which the best three suggestions will be announced on the iGEM wiki and the Rathenau website.
Position Paper
As preparation for the debate, we were asked to write a 2500-word position paper.  The paper, which is available here , is divided into three parts.  The first part, ‘The synthetic biology present’, presents the current legal situation around deliberate release and transboundary movement of synthetic organisms.  Part 2, ‘Next steps’, questions the need for changes to the existing legislation, as synthetic organisms move out of the laboratory towards industrial applications, to reflect the new challenges – real or perceived – posed by truly synthetic (as opposed to simply genetically modified) organisms.   Part 3 ‘Into the future’, deals with the issues posed by our crisis scenario, looking at issues of liability"

For the photosystem II subproject, the aim was to successfully join and assemble the  operons of the photosystem II protein complex using 3A assembly. Within the subproject,  we successfully assembled psbDCA( [BBa_K1998014] ), psbTB [BBa_K1998002] , psbMZHWK [BBa_K1998004] and psbOPQR [BBa_K1998006] . psbELJ was assembled by the 2015 Macquarie  Australia iGEM team. Additionally, we joined operons 2 and 3 together to form psbELJ-TB and operons 4 and 5 to form psbMZHWK-OPQR. These formed larger composite parts which   have been uploaded to the Parts Registry for future users.
Fig 1. Gel electrophoresis of the operons and single parts constituting the Photosystem II pathway implemented in this  project. Samples psbDCA to psbOPQR are the five operons designed. Lanes D and CA are individual samples submitted which  make up operon psbDCA. The final two lanes; psbELJ-TB, and psbMZHWK-OPQR; are the final composite operons from the   Photosystem II design. All parts shown have been sequenced and submitted. This gel validates all Biobrick parts   and backbones to the designed constructs.

The field of synthetic biology relies heavily on mathematical models that help simulate and predict the process of biological systems. Our team established two models to simulate the process of sweeteners binding to the receptor T1R2/T1R3 and the process of sweeteners signal transduction in mating pheromone pathway. Then improve our biological systems based on the simulation results.
The T1R2/T1R3 structure was built using SWISS-MODEL, then docking with the small molecule by AutoDock Vina. The signal transduction model is established by  reaction kinetics equations (RKE) and MATLAB to solve the ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
We developed our models based on three main purposes:
1. Determine the binding pattern between sweeteners and T1R2/T1R3.
2. Establish the GPCR signal transduction model for signal measurement.
3. Simulate the relationship between sweetness and red fluorescence intensity of mRFP, which was employed as a reporter.
Overview of system
Our goal is to detect the sweetness of the sweetener based on retrofitting the mating pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (CENPK2-1C).
Fig. 1  Each domain of the T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer
Initially，to make the signal input more accurate and reliable, we simulated the model of T1R2/T1R3 receptor's structure (Fig. 1), and choose some classic sweeteners docking with T1R2/T1R3.
Fig. 2  A simplified model of the α pheromone pathway with T1R2/T1R3
Next, the GPCR signal transduction model was established for signal measurement. Based on yeast MAPK signal pathway (Fig. 2), we made simple model for our biological systems. This pathway was divided into four modules: the activation of T1R2/T1R3 receptor, the activaion of G-protein cycle, the MAPK cascade, and the expression of RFP. We used ODEs to describe the changes in the"

Public Research Seminar
On September 28th, 2016, QGEM hosted a public seminar to encourage members of the Kingston community to learn more about synthetic biology and its fascinating applications. The seminar included an overview of iGEM's purpose and the 2016 Queen's iGEM research project. A background on nonribosomal peptides was given, as well as an explanation of the fundamental aspects of our indigoidine tagging system and module modification phase of our project.
A vital aspect of the presentation involved discussing the impact of QGEM 2016's technology offer to the current pharmaceutical industry and how drug leads are explored in drug development. There is currently a shortcoming of antibacterial drugs on the market due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the evolution of new microbial pests in recent years. We discussed the advantages of modifying NRPS gene clusters to create nonribosomal peptides that have antibacterial activity with improved ADME properties and lower toxicity, rather than less accurate chemical synthesis attempts of recreating these compounds. Promoting the future of NRPS systems, we explained how our project would allow for the engineering of these systems for the ability to create new drug products with new properties by re-coding the DNA of the NRPS using synthetic biology tools.
APSC 100: Engineering Practice
APSC 100 is a first year engineering practice course taught at Queen's University. The design module, a twelve week project, offers students an introduction to team-based work. A team is formed of four to five students who are paired with an upper year advisor and a community client. Students are guided through the design process as they work to solve open-ended design challenges which often emphasize prototype development and system modeling, two critical concepts in engineering.
QGEM is continuing our partnership from last year with APSC 100 to offer a biology-related project. While engineering is a key component of the design and modelling aspects of our project, the team has traditionally struggled to breach the gap between the biological sciences and engineering within the university. By incorporating synthetic biology and the considerations of our work into an engineering project, we hope to introduce the students to the possibilities of merging applied science with more traditional forms of research, promoting interest in the biological applications of engineering.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", he explained us about procedures and safety considerations in order to manage the in vitro growth of P. larvae and M. plutonius.
The day of our visit, M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León planned to go to the bee field and carry out bee larvae transferences, for its following in vitro breeding. This activity is one of the parts that implies our project once we reach the experimentation stage with the insects and M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León attentively invited us to accompany them to the field, they even lent us suits and veils to interact directly with the bees! Previously we had consulted a protocol that showed us all the details about the in vitro breeding of bees and by observing the techniques used by Ponce de León for the transference, we were able to validate and somehow, to begin with, the practice of this activity.
Interacting with the bees and being able to observe the composition of the bee boxes, the way in which the different foods were applied and the way in which beekeepers approached the bees were all key elements that allowed us to define the optimum application method of our product and helped us ensure its appropriate integration regarding each characteristic of the hive organization and the work done by beekeepers.
When returning to the CIAD facilities we had the opportunity to discuss the use of bees in the laboratory, how many bees were used? What was this number based on? Were the three R’s considered? The reality is that in Mexico there does not exist such regulations and the bioethical part of working with bees in the laboratory is quite unattended. We found this situation somewhat unsettling and it led us to perform a more extensive analysis of this topic. (consult the bioethical essay in).
M.S. Romo and M.S. Ponce de León could broaden their panorama on the research that is currently being done with bees and
their diseases thanks to the sharing we made with them of our project and the allusion that synthetic biology is its fundamental part.
Thanks to this visit we were able to have our first real approach with bees, we knew the reality of working with them and working with the two strains according to a specialized laboratory that has already experienced the proper biosafety considerations. This visit gave us different data that is very useful for the whole experimental plan of our project, and besides that, we lived a little of what beekeepers live every day, like traveling inside the truck with many bees that stayed inside from the field and even experiencing some bee-stings. We were also able to capture amazing photos of the hives!

Engineering Life:
To the ethical and societal relevance of synthetic biology
We, the iGEM-Team of Freiburg, participated at an international ethical seminar about synthetic biology at the Department of History and Ethics of Medicine of the University of Freiburg. We wanted to learn more about synthetic biology from a different point of view. From the perspectives of ethics, law, biosafety and biosecurity synthetic biology appeared in an interesting new light. Due to the lectures our understanding of the appearance of synthetic biology in the society, the hopes and fears, grew tremendously.
The seminar was the last session in a variety of meetings during 3 years of an interdisciplinary project work. All meetings were gathered in the project with the topic Engineering Life: An interdisciplinary approach to the ethics of Synthetic Biology . Here, scientists of different institutions investigated in the field of synthetic biology with the aim to clarify
if it is justified to speak about creating life,
how the reproach against science to ""play God"" could theologically be interpreted,
how risks and chances of this field of research shall be analyzed,
if the legal regulations were appropriate,
how a clear definition can be found whether a construct is natural or synthetic,
if there is a divergence in the systematical conditioning and actual research in synthetic biology.
On 26/9/13 it was discussed how a future society based on biotechnology could look like.  Therefore, several movies from the Bio-Fiction film festival in Vienna  were shown, where artists and filmmakers should visualize their associations with synthetic biology.
Here, the panel discussion came to the result that many of the movies showed the chances but also the risks of synthetic biology. Some aspects of mythology reappeared in the movies e.g"

The purpose of the mutant circuits is to test that the reporter circuit is functional so it can be used to test the functionality of the signalling circuit.
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of LuxO D47A (left) and LuxO D47E (right) mutant circuits.
The circuits are almost identical in that they have the same promoter (BBa_R0040), RBS (BBa_B034) and terminator (BBa_B0015). This design will allow for constitutive expression of these proteins. The LuxO D47A mutant mimics the unphosphorylated and thus inactive form of LuxO, meaning that it will not bind to the qrr4 promoter. The LuxO D47E mutant, however, mimics the phosphorylated and thus active form of LuxO, and will thus bind to the qrr4 promoter and induce expression of downstream genes. Once these circuits are tested with a non-Biobrick reporter (in the KT1144 cells) they are used to test whether the reporter circuit is functional. If in the presence of the LuxO D47A mutant the reporter cells do not glow and if in the presence of the LuxO D47E mutant the reporter cells do glow, we know the reporter circuit is functional.
CHARACTERIZATION
In order to use the mutant circuits to test whether the reporter circuit is functional, we must first verify that the mutant circuits themselves are functional. This was done by transforming each mutant circuit separately into KT1144 cells that have the qrr4 promoter followed by GFP on a cosmid (this was provided by Bonnie Bassler - see acknowledgments"

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
ADD PARTS
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:

In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.
Mr. Xing Ruwen
Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification"

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#OD#F device_-_-_TEXT.html," for example, assess linearity of the measurement.
We made a commercial assessment of the OD/F Device that results in a total cost of $60. The unit is built from acrylic glass for the casing. The compact design results in a weight which is less than 200g. The device can be easily connected to any power adapter via USB. The technical details and a construction manual of OD/F Device is published on our engineering page.
Outlook
We have proven that our device is capable of delivering good results, even in hard conditions as low cell concentrations. Yet there is room for improvement. The calibration process is quite intensive work. An application to do this automatically would help for this process. For the ease of use and to prevent data loss from noting down measured values manually, a smartphone application that can directly correlate OD and fluorescence values would be a great addition. This addition will be implemented in the next version.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportFullIntroduction_-_-_TEXT.html," in the scientific approach.
Several effects and new questions will rise of that interdisciplinarity, reflexivity and critical perspectives. What are the effects of that institutional and disciplinary causes of the ethical questions? Why and how can we enlighten what is “new” in biological engineering and in the IGEM competition through ethical reflexion? As we will analyze it in the introduction, we will have to consider the ethical reflexion as necessary, once we have admitted the social responsibilities of science and scientists regarding the social effects of their theoretical and material production.  Our work will be lead by an other imperative of the ethical reflexion, in order to make it concrete and not to give up to that intellectual temptation to go through concepts and methods without actually “doing something” about it. That imperative is making that ethical reflexion “practical” and so, to see who, where and when the decision process is made and how we can operate on it. Beside our aim, a rapid check on the institutional literature about synthetic biology (see ""Institutional text and researches"" here [2] ) make us consider the fact that reflexion is shared between different kinds of actors of that scientific field, especially States, international organizations and national agencies.  The ethical questions about synthetic biology are also and mainly about questioning the governance of the field. How, as a first step, will we manage the debate? Then, how will we supply the decision making? In other words, who is going to decide? Who, after putting stakes into light, will deal and manage the tensions linked to that stakes? That tension is inherent to what could be the definition of “scientific ethics” : the coexistence, the “harmony” between a free scientific research, both in theories and practices, and the social responsibilities of those scientific theories and practices. The necessity of the ethical question can now be seen as “viral”, once accepted, it leads us necessarily to the question of the governance, of the decision making, of the action and regulation, from now, each seen as something necessary too.
Methods
The theoretical approach in this report can be regarded as quite “singular”, and that singularity has to be explained. I am student in Science and Technology Studies in the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Science Sociales of Paris and my thesis focus on practices in the field of synthetic biology. Before participating in IGEM, I worked on collaborative projects with the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity which sponsored the creation of the inter-institute Paris IGEM team, I wanted to be part of the Paris IGEM team in order"

Diphteria Toxin
To ensure the DiphTox has no toxicity, we performed literature search. First, we need to know every domain that construct the whole Diphteria Toxin (DT). We were using online databases such as Uniprot ( https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5PY51 ) and Interpro ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/Q5PY51 ).[1,2] We found that DT consists of three domains (Figure 1), which each of them has specific function.[3]
Figure 1..Diphteria toxin domain.
DT is classified into AB toxin which A fragment consists of C (catalytic) domain and B fragment consists of T (translocation) and R (recognition) domain (Figure 2).[3]
Figure 2.Diphteria toxin as AB toxin.
To cause cell intoxication, first DT binds to proHBEGF on surface membrane. EGF like domain on proHBEGF receptor binds the R domain of DT. Receptor bound toxin is concentrated in clathrin coated pits and internalized into clathrin coated vesicle. With the increase of vacuolar ATPase activity, the pH inside vesicle is decreased. The decrease of pH will change the conformational structure of DT, especially T domain. T domain function is to translocate C domain to cytosol. There are many hypotheses about the mechanism of C domain translocation from lumen to cytosolic space. After C domain is delivered to cytosol, it undergoes structural change into enzymatically active conformation and catalyzes NADdependent ADP ribosilation of EF-2, leading to cellular death (apoptosis) via protein synthesis inhibition. One publication said that only A substance can lead to cellular death. The mechanism of intoxication is summarized in figure 3.[4,5]
Figure 3.. Intoxication of DT.
From this theory, we conclude that A fragment or C domain is the main cause of cytotoxic activity. T and R domain function is only for C domain delivery into cytosol. In order to maximize the safety, we want to take the toxin as small as we can but still retain the binding activity of DT. Publication by John M. Rolf and Leon Eidels said that last 54 amino acids (482- 535) are sufficient enough to make HT and HBEGF"

SEMI-RATIONAL TARGETED MUTAGENESIS METHOD:
A fully randomized mutagenesis approach certainly allows to englobe every single possible mutation and possibly every single mutation combination but going through such a gigantic library would be time consuming and not very efficient. Furthermore such a library would include a very high number of uninteresting mutants. That is why we decided to target mutations to regions in our protein that were previously identified (Spagnolo et al., 2010) (cf. background ) as playing a role in the hermeticity of the gating portion of the protein.
We not only wanted to create leaky porins but regulable leaky porins and for maximum effectiveness we thought that our mutagenesis design would have to encompass this regulatory objective. As shown by Mathonet et al. (2006), we decided that the easiest way to achieve regulation would be to use the histidine affinity for transition metal ions, such as Ni2+ or Zn2+, and the potential conformational effect the binding of the two together has on folded proteins. Those conformational changes could be a great mean to open and close our gates and thus create a regulatory system. With all this in mind, we decided not only to target certain region but to limit the degeneracy and favor histidine content in those targeted regions.
Two Gating regions were identified by Spagnulo et al. (2010) and we decided to design two primers over each of these regions. One lightly degenerated allowing only the wild type codon, histidine codons and the intermediary codons. The other one, heavily degenerated, includes any codons but STOP codons. We were expecting higher viability of the proteins with the lightly degenerated primers but the heavily degenerated primers create libraries with higher diversity. We thus build a total of four libraries with two oligonucleotides designed over each gating region as shown the figure 2.
Figure 2: Library Construction Model
Our final design represented 65 536 amino acid combination, ranging from the wild type sequence to a sequence including only histidine codons for the lightly degenerated primers and 67 108 864 amino acid combination, ranging again from the wild type sequence to a sequence including only histidine codons for heavily degenerated primers. The figure 3 illustrates the effective design of lightly degenerated primer for our"

$$ BFU{-}E_{n+1} = BFU{-}E_{n}\times e^{\beta_{BFU-E} \times \Delta t} \tag{24}$$
Cells committed to become red blood cells continue to grow in this manner until they reach the age of 7 days. At this point, the BFU-E differentiate into CFU-E cells.
CFU-E Cells
CFU-E cells are strongly dependent on EPO for their survival.
$$ CFU{-}E_n = CFU{-}E_{n-1}\times e^{(\beta_{CFU{-}E}-\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))) \times \Delta t} \tag{25}$$
$$ CFU{-}E_{n+1} = CFU{-}E_{n}\times e^{(\beta_{CFU{-}E}-\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))) \times \Delta t} \tag{26}$$
The equation shows that the apoptosis rate of CFU-E cells is dependent on the concentration of EPO at a given time. As the concentration of EPO increases, the apoptosis rate of CFU-E cells decreases.
Figure 16. The effect of EPO on the apoptosis of CFU-E cells.
The logistic equation that governs the apoptosis rate of CFU-E is seen in the equation below.
$$\alpha_{CFU{-}E}(EPO(t))= \frac{(a_1 - b_1)}{1+e^{k_1 \times EPO(t) - c_1}}+b_1 \tag{27}$$
The CFU-E stage starts once cells reach the age of 7 days and continues until cells differentiate into Erythroblasts at an age of 13 days.
Erythroblasts
The proliferation of erythroblasts does not depend on the concentration EPO. However, the population of cells entering the erythroblast stage at an age of 13 days depends on the concentration of EPO due to the CFU-E stage coming before.

The sensing approach
Advantages of bio-sensing
In response to this recent awareness towards those toxic compounds, different systems of detection have been developed.
However with the approach of bio-sensing, we develop tools which are able to detect a pollutant with a very high efficiency, and with a great specificity.
Biological elements necessary to build those tools are cheap, easily obtained and their production doesn’t emit any pollutant.
Thus besides being effective and cheap systems, biosensors are totally biological and non-polluting tools.
Systems
To develop our bio-sensors, we looked for some natural systems based promoters inducibles by our compounds of interest. It is often promoters wich allow the expression of a set of genes which correspond to the cell's response to the compound.
For phenols, a set of genes called Dmp operon in Pseudomonas CF600 is able to degrade phenol to produce acetyl CoA, and use this molecule as an energy source.

RNA Interference
RNA interference (RNAi) is the inhibition of gene expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules binding to complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and so stopping translation of that protein. Our team has decided to use this method to stop the translation of a virulence gene required for our target bacteria to cause infection.
spiRNA
By using the process of RNAi we needed to create a siRNA that specifically targets Vibrio cholerae and Shigella. It will then inhibit the target bacterium and bind to a virulence gene blocking the production of that important protein. We have decided to rename our small interfering RNA Agent spiRNA.
S.O.R.D.
In order for us to even begin to target the bacteria Shigella and Vibrio cholerae we had to come up with a way of getting our spiRNA outside of the E. coli. We decided to focus on the protein OsmY naturally found in E. coli that is regularly secreted from the bacteria. As Hfq is an RNA binding protein it will be able to bind with our spiRNA and fusing it with OsmY creates a predicted RNA secretion device that we have named S.O.R.D. (Secretor Of RNA Device).
Expression system
Each spiRNA can be separated into two main parts, each having their specific function; the first being a sequence specific to binding with Hfq and the second being a sequence specific to the gene we want to target.
The blue area is the part that will bind to the Hfq in our fusion protein - using the binding site from micC for E. coli and chiA for Serratia. Then to make the spiRNA specific to the bacteria we want to target, we’ll add in a target-binding sequence. This is the red area and the sequence will be complimentary to the first 24bp on the mRNA strand.
A future plan for our project would be that both our expression system and our fusion protein would be on one plasmid.

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," colony pcr's (both repressor and terminator groups have the gel pictures in their lab books).
Over night cultures were made of the re-streaked ligation plates, tomorrow (22/09/2010) plasmid purifications need to be performed.
Tomorrow ligations on pAT02, pAT06, and pAT07 need to be done.
21-09-2010 - Annemi Repressor group
A new attempt to amplify pBAD, pBADz1 and pBADz2 was made. The PCR was made exactly as Maya made it yesterday (see lab-book for further details).
Patrick and I made some changes in the restriction protocol which can be found in the protocol folder in dropbox.
20-09-2010 - Patrick and Anastasiya - Terminator group
So today we've been doing a bit of work for both the terminator and repressor group.   Firstly we ran 2 pcr's on plasmid backbones (pSB1C3 and pSB2K3) which turned out successful on the gel, they were then purified via pcr clean up. (Please take note here that the old pcr buffer was used, so I suggest from now on when running a pcr, use any buffer you think will work, but use the old buffer as a form of control with an extra pcr product, so that in case it doesn't work but the control does, the problem might be the buffer and not your pcr.)
Digestions that were made on Thursday (16/09/2010) were ran on a gel, most of them weren't very visible, but successful non the less; they were purified as well via pcr clean up.
The ligation plates plated on Wednesday (15/09/2010) were restreaked and will be ready tomorrow for inoculation of over night cultures.
We also helped out Maya, and did pcr clean ups on the pcr products of the plasmid backbones, they all seemed to have worked well (pSB1C3 wasn't as strong as the others though) the only pcr product that appeared to have not worked was that of GFP, details on this can be found in the lab book, but it should have something to do with the pcr buffer again as there were 2 pcr products of GFP, one worked and the other didn't.

d. Physiology of BBa_K1352000
Both BBa_K1352000 and a negative control were grown overnight in 5 mls LB medium+ chloramphenicol. In the morning, both liquid cultures were induced with 0.2% arabinose for over 2 hours to detect aggregation. The E.coli culture aggregates (as shown below, Figure 1), demonstrating the engineered gene now lacking PstI sites is functional.
Fig.3    Physiology of BBa_K1352000 in response to 0.2% arabinose induction.
Left: BioBrick BBa_K1352000; right: negative control (untransformed E.coli).
4. Conclusion
BBa_K1352010 is the correct, iGEM RFC10-compatible version of BBa_K759001. In our experience, BBa_K759001 is not RFC10 compatible, having 6 Pst1 sites (see 'Design' for BBa_K1352010). During the construction of BBa_K1352010, the removal of the 6 additional PstI sites through Site-Directed Mutagenesis was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis, with no indels being introduced within the coding region of the construct.
Antigen 43 protein expression of biobrick BBa_K1352010 was shown not to be affected by the PCR-based Site-Directed Mutagenesis process. The biobrick works biologically as intended after modification and has the same response to arabinose induction: formation of culture aggregation.

Pxyl
BBa_K081005
dspB (optimized)
✔
✔
✔
esp (optimized)

All of the initial cloning was done in E. coli and after each construct was completed, we transferred the biobrick part from pSB1C3 plasmid to pMR10, which replicates in Caulobacter crescentus and E. coli at a low copy number. The pMR10 constructs were transferred into Caulobacter by conjugation.
One issue that gave us a hard time in the beginning of our project was that when we made the esp or dspB fusion with the rsaA C-terminal secretion signal using the standard biobrick prefix and suffix a stop codon was formed in the scar between the two genes that terminated the expression before the RsaA C-terminal secretion signal. Later, we solved the issue by modifying the suffix of the upstream gene and the prefix of the downstream gene so that the stop codon would no longer be in frame.
Data & Results
The following results show that most of our chimeric proteins were expressed and secreted from Caulobacter and had significantly greater activity against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms than the WT Caulobacter strain.
Figure 1. Expression and secretion of chimeric proteins from Caulobacter. We cultured each of our Caulobacter secretion strains and collected the supernatants from equal numbers of cells. The proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with TCA, run on a 6-18% polyacrylamide gel, and silver stained. Results show that proteins of the expected size were secreted from PrsaA with chimeric Esp/RsaA C-terminal construct. However, even though we used gradient gel and silver staining, bands did not appear easily: only those constructs that presumably had a high yield of heterologous protein had bands corresponding to the desired biofilm inhibitor protein.

                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, they invited the team instructor of Peking University to introduce us how to understand this competition.
                                                                                                                                                                Interview with the local experts
                                                                                                                                                                Since our research projects are interdisciplinary as well as socially-based,
                                                                                                                                                                 we consulted our ideas with professor in the field about the production of our experiment applying the other fields beyond the cultural artifacts protection.
                                                                                                                                                                We then communicate with Prof. Zhang, Zhejiang University, whose field is civil-engineering.
                                                                                                                                                                        Q1: How can the greasing removal apply in civil engineering?

Minnesota,2009,Team:Minnesota#Parts Characterization_-_-_TEXT.html," to the Registry by Princeton in 2004.
In the Experience section on the Registry, it was stated that although this promoter was classified as repressible, it was actually constituitive. However, there were no data to support this statement so we decided to investigate the promoter. In addition to investigating the promoter inducibility status, we also wanted to examine Transfer Function and Stability. So we attached the PoPS generator to this promoter in a ligation reaction and induced it at various concentrations of IPTG: 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and 1 mM. We took samples over 9 hours and analyzed the products using flow cytometry.
Transfer Function
As you can see on the figure below, for each timepoint, the production of GFP is virtually identical. This confirmed the hypothesis that the promoter is actually constituitive rather than repressible. Regardless of IPTG concentration, we saw the same amount of GFP production over all the timepoints.
Stability
We also examined the GFP production at varying IPTG concentrations over multiple rounds of cell division. As you can see from the figure below, not only is the constituitive promoter reliably on, but it continues to produce GFP at the same rate regardless of the number of cell divisions.
Promoter J13002: aTc regulation
The second promoter we examined was J13002 , which was submitted to the Registry by UT Austin in 2005. The part consists of two TetR binding sites and RBS and is called a ""TetR repressed PoPs/RIPS generator."" Since the part already had a RBS, we attached GFP in order to indirectly measure PoPS. The results of our characterization can be found on the Experience page at the Registry for Part J13002. A photo of this part from the Registry of Standard Parts is displayed below:
<b3 />
Transfer Function
We also wanted to examine Transfer Function and Stability in this promoter. To do this, we grew 1 ml liquid cultures in different concentration of inducer media: 0, 1, 10, 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml of aTc. As you can see in the figure below, there was a general upward trend of GFP production with the concentration of aTc. The error bars in the graphs represent the standard error. Interestingly, we observed a spike in GFP production at 50 ng/ml of aTc. During the sampling, the culture growing in 50 ng/ml aTc inducer media did not grow as fast as the others, with the OD595 as low"

For one, she recommended that we bubble air through a flask of water to hydrate it. Through this method, we learned that the hydrated air would then go to individual test tubes housing our cyanobacteria. The test tubes would be placed in racks in a small aquarium tank with a heating element to maintain comfortable temperature. Thus, initially, we aimed to replicate Dr. Colliers setup with the aquarium tank and the flasks that allowed for air to be bubbled into them. However, we later obtained a CO2 incubator from Dr. Malbon’s lab in the Department of Pharmacology. Cyanobacteria growth in a CO2 appeared to be a better setup because it required less materials and maintenance. In addition, Dr. Collier agreed that incubating cyanobacteria in CO2 as opposed to bubbling gas into a flask of cyanobacteria would allow them to grow faster. Furthermore, we did not use test tubes to grow cyanobacteria as Dr. Collier initially suggested but rather we used flasks because they provided a larger surface area. After being informed of this change, Dr. Collier further advised us to use stoppers made of cotton to stopper the flasks. Thus, through our correspondence with Dr. Collier, we considered different experimental setups and based on knowledge from Dr. Collier about optimal cyanobacteria growth conditions and we designed and improved our setup accordingly.
April 13: Meeting with Dr. Gabor Balazsi (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University)
At this stage in the project development, two potential routes we pursued for our project were the alkane and ethanol pathways in cyanobacteria. We sought to determine a method to measure alkane and sucrose (for ethanol production) output. To measure sucrose output, there were commercial kits available to allow us to measure sucrose content in a liquid solution. However, measuring alkane production was more complicated. We decided to reach out to Dr. Gabor Balazsi, an expert in biosensors at Stony Brook University to determine if we could make an alkane biosensor, similar to that in existing literature. Dr. Balazsi strongly suggested using a negative feedback loop, allowing for a linearized signal from the sensor, such that a measurement device would form. A measurement device, as opposed to a typical biosensor, he explained, does not have a threshold, but rather is able to indicate different concentrations of a molecule. This measurement device for alkane output sounded almost as feasible as"

Preface
Here we are presenting the results from the bioinformatic analysis we performed with Ginga pipeline. In order to ensure that the Ginga works effectively, the whole pipeline, from start to finish, was validated with some real world                       public data from melanoma patients. Although, this data was extremely useful to understand the workflow and requirements of the pipeline it is limited and doesn’t contemplate the full potential of Ginga. Nevertheless, accessing patient                       data have been proven to be extremely difficult due to the lack of the necessary ethical"
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," substrate chemicals to be translated and expressed.
The lack of specificity of the bacterial promoter, pYeaR, used in the hybrid promoter was a pitfall that was always a concern when it came to accurately sensing nitric oxide. From this potential problem spawned a potential solution; the Comparator Circuit. This pair of BioBricks are designed to specifically bind to each other while ligated to two different promoters of overlapping specificity to result in an integration of the conflicting outputs of the two opposing gene systems.
Our system relies on two constructs that interact via complimentary base pair sequences both before and after the ribosome binding site of the reporter protein. The idea being that, when both transcripts are present in the chassis, they would bind together, inhibiting the translation of the reporter proteins.
Any imbalance of transcription due to the presence of the substrate of interest results in free mRNA of the gene system that detects that substrate. Crucially, if both promoters detect the same substrates but differ with one extra substrate being detected by one of the promoters, it is this substrate and this substrate only that our system will be able to detect in a simple and quantitative way.
Our team have constructed a countercurrent comparator circuit in which the reporter proteins are at the same end of the complimentary region, although a contracurrent system has been theorised. Both systems share a crucial subtractive nature comparable to an analogue computer. We envisage that, should the system be fine-tuned and expanded on, a variety of different business sectors from agriculture to spinoff pharmaceutical companies (Please check out our Quanticare page for more details) could capitalise on this novel genetic technology.
What we have produced is a BioBrick pair that work in harmony, when ligated to promoters of interest and genes of interest, to sequester translation when both mRNA transcripts are present in the cell. The use of quantative tuners with these BioBricks is encouraged to ensure that the transcription rate both gene constructs are equal when both promoters are transcribing at their optimal rate. Although the parts have been submitted to the registry and theoretically characterised, time constraints have meant that further lab-based characterisation could not occur.
However, we hope to utilise any free time in our timetables sduring the next semester to characterise the BioBricks further (please see our project proposal), and hope that we will be given a chance to present our further findings at MIT!
To conclude, what we have created is a pair of antagonistic BioBricks that turned the pair of mRNAs in which they reside into translational repressor molecules when both are transcribed in tandum within a"
Minnesota,2015,Team:Minnesota#SMM_-_-_TEXT.html,", or more, methods don’t come to fruition.
We also turned to critical conversations about how science is communicated to the public. Many professionals expressed the belief that education does not really make a difference in shaping public perception of advanced science topics, because many people simply don’t have personal investment in gaining expertise in those areas: the most important part is how the science will affect their daily lives. This is why the GMO scare is so tangible to non-scientists, because there is a very visceral reasoning coupled to the food that we consume every day.
In this vein, our conversation with the industry professionals ended up transcending our intentions for critically evaluating the design of our wetlab project and turning us on to broader ideas of engagement, communication, and collaboration both within the scientific community and the lay population. From here, we renewed focus on the tenets and limitations in the iGEM registry and pursued a deeper inquiry into the existing networks and missed connections therein. We also were encouraged to foster our voice on campus and engage students from all disciplines in general discussions about technological progress and the benefits and fears associated with that. In response, we hope to bolster the Synthetic Biology Society (founded by the 2013 Minnesota iGEM team) by reaching out to collaborate on events with other student groups and really implicate biotechnology in students’ considerations of the technological future and their own place within that progression.
• Collaborations
      As important as open source is, another theme that iGEM promotes is collaboration. We tried our best to help our fellow iGEM teams  in whatever way we could.
We were able to help mentor the very first Egyptian team with regards to Synthetic Biology, BioBricks, and their experimental design, as well as sending them outreach materials and the Interactive Educational Curriculum our team presents to local schools year-round.
We contributed a protocol for yeast homologous recombination for cloning for the Eindhoven team’s Cloning Guide for future iGEM teams' use.
We also contributed surveys for the following iGEM teams: Aachen, Michigan Software,  Nankai, NEFU_China,  Paris-Saclay, Santa Clara, Seoul South Korea, and Stanford-Brown.

After the kit has been used, a biocontainment mechanism (possibly incorporated into the cuvette) will be activated.

spoVA and Fast Germination
Germination is a time consuming event. The sooner germination and outgrowth is completed, the quicker the biosensing capability of the system can be implemented, which is the primary goal of sporduino.
We came across several works in the literature in modifying aspects of germination. Many referred  to the ‘ger’ and ‘spoVA’ operons, the latter or which we investigated further.
In an attempt to increase the rate of germination, we overexpressed the spoVA operon by placing it under the control of the promoter to the ‘B.subtilis’ ‘sspB’ gene (PsspB). PsspB is a germination specific promoter which is more active than the ordinary spoVA promoter.
The construct for this was designed by Peter Setlow’s group, University of Connecticut. It involves the sspB promoter upstream of the first 354bp of the spoVAA member of the spoVA operon. Since ‘B.subtilis’ exhibits accurate and efficient homologous recombination, a single crossover event occurs between the spoVAA 354bp fragment on the construct and the endogenous spoVAA gene in the ‘B.subtilis’ genome, the sspB promoter is inserted upstream of the spoVA operon on the chromosome.
Both the sspB promoter and spoVAA fragment were amplified from ‘B.subtilis’ genomic extracts.
We added the RFC10 standard prefix and suffix to the PsspB/spoVAA construct to make it into the Fast Germination biobrick: BBa_K911008 .

The Kill Switch: A hypothetical genetic biocontainment solution
Design 1 - Release of sporicide. The cuvette may contain a thin bag made of PVC or similar polymer containing a sporicidal agent (for example bleach). After sampling, the user pierces this compartment of the cuvette with the pipette. This floods the cuvette with bleach destroying the spores.
Design 2 - Genetic 'Kill switch' This idea is based on part of the 2012 Paris Bettencourt iGEM project. They have built a system optimised for 'E.coli', the system proposed would need to be compatible with '"

Having been developed for more than a decade, synthetic biology has undergone considerable growth in scope, expectation and output, and has become a widely recognized branch of biological research. Our team put in great efforts to raise public awareness of exciting opportunities, heartening achievements and marvelous promise in the field of synthetic biology.
Technological Activities Week
Technological Activities Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year, Technological Activities Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC-China and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.

We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens, then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could learn knowledge while having fun.
The Asian Conference in Taiwan
The Asian Conference was held in Tsinchu, Taiwan by NCTU (National Chiao Tung University) from 19th JUL to 23rd JUL, 2015. Over 30 iGEM teams from the Greater China Region attended the conference and 4 members of our team---Chen Xinan, Yuan Xiaofan, Wu Ziyu, Cui Tianyi was sent to the big gathering.
During the conference, our team made a team introduction and a project presentation to the iGEMers. We received lots of feedbacks from them as well as beneficial guides from the professors of other universities. Not only have we established friendship with other teams in advance, but also we realized where our defects lie and what our future work should focus on. It can be said that we really benefited a lot from the worthy experience in NCT"

Background
HNS/HNST108I
Many species of bacteria have flagellar motility that is achieved by rotating surface-exposed organelles The rotation of the flagella is controlled by a motor complex embedded in the inner membrane (reviewed in Refs. 2 and 3 The motor region of E. Coli’s flagella is composed of several parts. The stator complex, made up of the proteins MotA-MotB, has a transmembrane characteristic and ensures the generation of a proton channel (4-6).  The rotor complex involves the interaction of three other proteins, FliG, FliM, and FliN(7,8). All three rotor proteins are involved in the processes of flagellar assembly, switching, and rotation (9,10). However, FliG is predominately involved in torque generation (8, 10, 11), whereas FliM mainly functions in switching rotor direction (12). The precise role of FliN is the least well defined, but it may participate in flagella protein-specific export and assembly (13,14)
HNS is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in E. Coli. It plays an activator role at the level of protein synthesis for many genes involved in bacterial motility.  . . In many studies it was shown that HNS is essential for the synthesis of proteins that make up the rotor and stator. The flhCD operon is a positive regulator of HNS which is responsible for the synthesis of many proteins that composes the structure of the bacterial flagella. Studies show that knock-out of the gene that codes the HNS protein results in non-motile E. Coli.
Above, we mentioned three proteins that make up the stator portion of the bacterial flagella.. These proteins are FliG, FliM and FliN and these three proteins have different activities. FliM is a regulator protein that is responsible for determining in which direction the bacterial flagella will be oriented. Although the role of FliN is not precisely known, it is thought that it acts as a guide for the assembly of the flagella’s membrane/for attachment of flagella to the membrane. As for FliG, this protein is responsible for the rotation speed and torque power of the bacterial"

Promoters and Terminators
The iGEM registry is lacking in promoter and terminators sequences for yeast, especially when compared with the number available for use in E. coli. In order to address this problem and increase the use of yeast in synthetic biology we have decided to provide a library of promoter and terminator sequences from 12 yeast genes: 4 causing high expression, 4 causing medium expression, and 4 causing low expression. We hope these BioBrick compatible parts will make it easier for future iGEM teams to work with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Characterizing the Promoters
In order to provide useful parts with better ease of use, we have decided to not only provide a library of useful yeast promoters to the part registry, but also quantitatively characterize the strength of our promoters by using reference promoters. In a nut shell, we compared the ability of our promoters to express the GFP gene to that of other well characterized promoters in identical laboratory strain. This way, iGEM teams in the future can accurately predict the functionality of our promoters in their strains of interests by referencing the functionality of the reference promoters. A diagram and a brief step-by-step explanation of the process is provided below:
Plasmids with the reference promoter (in white), GFP, ampicilin (AMP) resistance, and Ura3 production genes were provided by the Tom Ellis lab in Imperial College London.  Three different versions of the plasmids with different reference promoters (ADH1p, CYC1p, PFY1p) were provided.  The AMP resistance gene allows for selection of bacterial transformation"

IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 35(1), 351-356.). In the case of our biosensor we theorize this means that the public is likely to be more open to the use of GMO, as the potentially harmful effects of pharmaceutical pollution are not currently being addressed sufficiently. Multiple experts confirmed this sentiment: as long as the genetically modified bacteria in our device are safely contained, a majority of people will not oppose their use due to their important utility in solving the detection problem of pharmaceutical pollution (Martin van den Berg, Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences). In a similar vein, our biosensor makes current detection methods (i.e. those utilizing Daphniae and fish) redundant, leading to a reduction in the use of laboratory animals.

Exeter,2018,Team:Exeter#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," dismutase uses.
The 4 chlorite dismutase coding sequences in this collection are from 4 different species of bacteria. Exeter iGEM 2018 has shown, using a Western blot, that all coding sequences can be expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). As the four enzymes have different kinetic parameters, future teams can choose which enzymes best suits their specific chassis. Choosing the right enzyme, with the right kinetic parameters will allow teams to balance metabolic flux of intermediate substrates through pathways whilst avoiding overburdening cells with unnecessary enzyme expression.
