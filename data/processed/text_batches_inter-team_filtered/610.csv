Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2016,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," iterations, we were able to increase the transferred knowledge about synthetic biology and our project significantly.
CeBiTec Symposium ""Microbial Genomics and Metagenomics in Human Health and Disease""
From July 4th to 6th we had the chance to present our project to scientific audience from all over Germany and Europe at the 11th CeBiTec symposium . The conference with the topic ""Microbial Genomics and Metagenomics in Human Health and Disease"" occurs at the ""Center of Interdisciplinary Research"" of Bielefeld University. Among many interesting lectures and workshops, there was a poster session and much time for the scientific exchange. We were proud to have the opportunity to show our newly designed poster (figure 1) to many interested visitors. Participating experts from the field of biology and medicine provided us with a lot of useful tips and their opinions about our project.

Dictionary
As we got several understand problems with non-researchers and researchers, we started to write a dictionary . Thus we had to think about how to explain technical terms in understanding words. Writing the dictionary helped us to deal with difficult words. Furthermore we hope that our dictionary will help other iGEM teams, when they are need to explain their project easily.
Educational Outreach
With writing our dictionary our journey for an easier understandable project wasn’t over. We also started “Directed Evolution of Educational Outreach” , where we went to several schools presenting our project and iteratively improve our project explanation. Also we taught some pupils about synthetic biology and learned what difficulties in understanding basic research experiments have non-researchers to overcome with. Our last hurdle were the post card action and the NRW day . During the postcard action we had to find a way to explain synthetic biology to everyone and that on a 150 cm2 tiny piece of paper. On the NRW day we presented our project to the public and tried to explain synthetic biology. During that day we distributed our postcards.
Expert Contacts
To adjust our project to the needs of the public and industry, we contacted several experts. Some experts are working in the field of diagnostics and some devote with in vivo mutagenesis.
Searching for a target
Searching for an application field was a difficult task do deal with. Our system is designed for a wide field. But since we need an issue to focus on and optimizing our system to, we asked several experts for their opinion and a review to our mutagenesis system.

BIT,2017,Team:BIT-China#Project#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," artificial sweeteners is becoming more mature. Meanwhile ,as a food additive, artificial sweeteners are also more widely used in the field of food production. But the potential harm of artificial sweeteners to humans is still a controversial issue.
Therefore, it is imperative to detect the ideal sweetener to tackle the problems we mentioned above as well as satisfy our gustation.
THEN WHAT?
We hope to design a bio-system via synthetic biology methods which can measure the sweetness of various sugars and identify them by corresponding signal expression in microbe.
First and foremost, we found the mechanism why people can feel sweetness: the human sweet G protein-coupled receptor T1R2-T1R3.
It’s a pair of extracellular proteins with homodimer, which has six structural domains.
Different sweet substances combine with different regions of T1R2-T1R3, then triggering intracellular G protein-coupled pathway and leading to downstream signal expression.
After complex nerve transduction, a ""sweet"" feeling was led at last.
At the same time, we chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a kind of yeast as our host strain with the function of glycosylation.
In the design, the yeast original G protein-coupled receptor Ste2, which is related to yeast mating, will be replaced by the T1R2-T1R3.
Then, to amplify our signal, some side effects genes will be knocked out by homologous recombination technology.
After building a completed system, we will take some kinds of sugar to judge their sweetness according to the strength signal.
Fig.1 The design of Sugar Hunter
BUT HOW?
Our project is divided into three subsystems:
Receptor Expression system: Using OE-PCR, and other methods to achieve the synthesis of T1R2-T1R3 G protein-coupled receptors T1R2-T1R3.  
Confirming the expression and position(if on the cell membrane) of T1R2/T1R3 in our engineered yeast by immunofluorescence.
Pathway Optimization system:  Using trp, his, and ura as screening marker fragments with homologous arms to knock out ste2, sst2, and far1 genes by homologous recombination in yeast.
* ste2, sst2 gene can inhibit the signal transduction of Gpa1 protein.
*far1 gene can cause interference signal for sweet yeast normal physiological function after transformation. 
Siginal Output system: Constructing the red fluorescent protein circuit and improving the promoter Pfus to detect the sweetness through the expression of the fluorescent"

Modeling Bacteria
Let´s get a closer look to the modeling of our Bacteria constructions.
Are you hungry?
The first model we did addressed our glucose-sensitive construction. We carried out three different experiments changing the carbon source, to see its influence.  First we used glucose (1) as the only carbon source. Then we added galactose (2) as an extra carbon source. Finally we put sodium acetate (3) as an extra carbon source instead of galactose. The use of alternatives to glucose is explained because  in previous tests we observed that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth. With the experimental data we fitted the following repressible Hill-like function.
And we estimated the following parameters for the 3 different conditions.
In figures 1, 2 and 3 we plot the models and experimental data for the three experiments with glucose (1), added galactose (2) and added sodium acetate (3) respectively. IPTG was added to all the experiments to induce expression.
Figure 1.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations.
Figure 2.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Galactose added to the medium.
Figure 3.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Sodium Acetatee added to the medium.
It is interesting to notice how the Hill coefficient increases  when adding Galatose and Acetate. From here we can hypothesize that having another source of carbon  makes the promoter more sensitive to changes in the glucose concentration, as the slope of the Hill function gets larger. Also the constant K decreases, which tell us that less glucose is necessary to de-activate the promoter when there is another carbon source.
Compare this results with Are you hungry? results .
Are you hot?
When analyzing the Heat Shock promoter, we decided to model the static transfer function of the Fluorescent Intensity as a result of the Temperature following the Hill-like equation:
In order to estimate the parameters of this model we performed a heat shock experiment.
Our first analysis corresponds to a heat shock applied during 10 minutes at different temperatures, ranging from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density (OD) were measured at t1=60 min and t2=120 min after the application of the heat pulse had finished.
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and"
BFSUICC-China,2018,Team:BFSUICC-China#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM, we contacted students who had participated in iGEM before and asked them to tell us some experience and give us some valuable advice. This time, we learned a lot. At the same time, I and other students in charge of human practice will also go to other schools through WeChat or iGEM publicity. We went to a high school in Beijing to let students who were interested in synthetic biology know about iGEM. In this process, I think the biggest difficulty we encountered was how to contact other teams, how to adjust the time overlap between iGEM and learning. Through participating in this iGEM, I learned how to allocate my spare time, and I was very happy to meet many people with the same interests.
 
Clarance: I am mainly in charge of editing Wiki, which requires some basic knowledge about HTML5, that was what I had been told but the truth was far more “interesting” than that, I also need to acquire JavaScript. Well at first, I had lots of passion for learning how to create a website, but as I dug in, I became very desperate. I was far more completed than I thought. Therefore, I went out computer science teaches to ask for help. Because I don’t take computer science at school so my knowledge on either HTML5 or JavaScript were all from the internet which is not always correct and accurate. Our teacher, Mr Anton is a very patient man, he was very willing to teach me. Creating a good and nice website is a time consuming and a hard skill to learn. It is my first time ever to design a website so please, forgive me if there are many defects and mistake.

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," a network that only produces RNA rather than proteins will also be faster and more efficient for the host cell. Since our logic gates are based on transcription, translation and resource consuming protein production will only be required at the very last step.
As the half-time of RNA can be rather short, transmitter RNA will not accumulate within the cell and it is therefore less likely for the system to become saturated.

Design and functional principle of logic gates
The concept introduced above provides a framework that can potentially serve as an universal adapter between different BioBricks. However, the logic gates have not been specified more precisely so far. This will be done in the following section.
Read more
Generally speaking, our logic gates are to possess the following characteristics:
Logic gates, such as AND, OR and NOT, have to be implemented by RNA-interaction based principles (see How to connect BioBricks ).
All logic gates have to recognize their corresponding transmitter RNAs and, in response, produce an output transmitter molecule.
Logic gates should follow a basic design rule, in such a way, that their creation can be automated in silico.
The response efficiency of a logic gate toward a transmitter molecule should be comparable for all logic gates to provide calculable robustness and sensitivity. This will ensure comparable molecular concentrations and functionality of large networks.
The system has to be designed for in vivo utilization at the first place. As a reference we always assumed a temperature of 37 °C and an E. coli environment.

In order to build logic gates for our bioLOGICS system we will first create a simple switch. A switch can be activated by one transmitter RNA and produce an output transmitter RNA. In contrast to a logic gate, a switch does not perform logic operations. However by combining switches, logic gates can be created. The following text will first describe how the developed switch works and secondly, how logic gates such as AND/OR/NOT can be created using these switches.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#S-Layer#SgsE_-_-_TEXT.html," the cells were mechanically disrupted (Sonification on ice) in binding buffer containing 6 M urea. After centrifugation the supernatant is loaded as sample onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity column. The S-layer containing elution fraction of the denaturing His-tag affinity chromatography is afterwards dialysed against water. This leads to the precipitation of water-insoluble proteins. The supernatant contains the monomeric SgsE solution.
Click for detailed information
Strategy without His-tag
Scheme of purification strategy for SgsE (fusion) proteins without His-tag:
First, SgsE is expressed in E. coli under the control of a T7 / lac promoter for separation of growth and production phase due to metabolic stress of the S-layer expression. Because the SgsE protein is forming inclusion bodies in E. coli, an inclusion body purification with urea follows the cell lysis. The S-layers are further concentrated and purified by two ultrafiltration / diafiltration steps (300 kDa and 100 kDa) and afterwards dialysed against water leading to the precipitation of water-insoluble proteins. The supernatant contains the monomeric SgsE solution.
Click for detailed information
Purification of SgsE | luciferase fusion protein
After the analysis of cultivations with expression of SgsE | luciferase fusion proteins, different cell fractions were analyzed. It could be seen that the proteins form inclusion bodies in E. coli but that there are some soluble proteins left. This has the advantage that the proteins carrying an enzyme as fusion proteins do not have to be treated with denaturating agents like urea which destroys the enzyme (data not shown).
To capture the protein from the cell lysate an ion exchange chromatography (IEX) was carried out (binding with pH 7.0, 25 mM NaCl, quaternary amine beads, elution with 100 mM NaCl). A lot of protein was found in the flow-through. When concentrating and rebuffering the proteins with PES (polyethylene sulfone) membranes a lot of protein was lost. The S-layer proteins stuck to the membrane. Some could be removed again from the membrane after cutting out the filter and incubate it in ddH2O over-night. This problem has to be kept in mind when using this S-layer.
The results of the purification approach are shown in Fig. 7:

""What we do for ourselves dies with us. What we do for others and the world remains and is immortal.""
As the primary cause of death, cancer has contributed to 1/6 of the total death number all around the world. According to the report of WHO in 2017, every passing minute means that another 17 names has been added to the victims of cancer. That's why it's become more and more urgent to find a method efficient enough for cancer treatment.
Compared to other means such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, cell therapy has emerged with better results, higher speed of development as well as much more potential.
The current cell therapies mostly take advantage of existing or synthetic cell-surface biosensors to target and kill tumour cells. These biosensors include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), synthetic Notch (SynNotch) and T-cell receptor (TCR). Up till now, the most successful case of cancer cell therapy is CAR-T, which uses engineered CARs – whose ectodomains are single-chain variable fragments (scFv) from monoclonal antibodies - to target certain cell-surface antigens on tumour cells1. These kinds of ectodomains can also enable TCRs to recognise specific tumour markers, and activate the intracellular signal pathways naturally existing in T-cells.
The two kinds of transducers take advantage of natural cellular pathways, but are also restricted by it, as the downstream could not be engineered and variant cellular reactions is hard to achieve2. SynNotch, which was firstly applied in tumour treatment in 2016, utilizes the same principles, the only difference being that the signal pathway was replaced by a cleaved transcription factor which is released into the cytoplasm and activate gene expression in nucleus upon recognisation3. By changing the transcription factor to non-human ones, the SynNotch system first realized orthogonality of biosensors used in cancer cell therapy.
However, receptors like CAR and Syn"

For example, under the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, there is the Biochemical and Synthetic Biology Research Center.
As of November 2010, 70 biotech companies are listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ, two separate Korean stock exchanges. This includes Bioneer Corp., a biotech company that is listed on the SynBio map. It is the only one of those 70 companies that specifically mentions ‘synthetic biology’ in connection with its business. Others make reference to biotechnology and other subtopics under biotechnology and bioengineering (""Biotechnology in korea,”).

Architects Competition of Microorganism Application
We held the Sichuan University 2016 Architects Competition of Microorganism Application: Human Microbiome in May and June. The students from Sichuan Agricultural University and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China were also invited. 209 students from Sichuan University and Sichuan Agricultural University attended the competition. After the first oral defense, 15 teams were chosen to attend the final.
The final was held in the largest lecture hall in Jiang’an Campus of Sichuan University. More than 10 professors attended it as the judges. After the final defense, one gold award, two silver award and four bronze award were issued (details listed below).
Holding the competition, we elevated the students’ understanding on human microbiome and iGEM competition and improved their ability of designing project. “This competition makes me learn more about human microbiome and iGEM competition. I hope it will be held after many years,” said a competitor.

Recent studies suggest that gut microbes are participants in atherosclerosis development. Specifically, choline, phosphatidylcholine—trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients abundant in foods can serve as dietary precursors for TMA N-oxide (TMAO) generation, in mice and humans, a metabolite that accelerates atherosclerosis in animal models. Amount those trimethylamine (TMA)-containing nutrients choline accounts for the biggest part in human gut because it’s also the primary digestion products of phosphatidylcholine. Blood TMAO levels are associated with risks for both prevalent atherosclerotic heart disease and incident major adverse cardiac events in multiple independent cohorts. And, recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has"

Project Description
The tailings ponds that result from the extraction of heavy crude oil and bitumen (used to make synthetic crude oil) from the oil sands have used up vast amounts of fresh water and contain substantial quantities of useable organic matter. While most of the bitumen is extracted from the oil sands, some is left behind and added to the tailings ponds. The residual hydrocarbon compounds can be potentially extracted from the ponds and utilized as another source of fuel. Consequently, cleaning the tailings ponds and increasing efficiency of extraction from the oil sands.
We wish to develop and characterize a BioBrick, that can breakdown some of the more prominent toxic organic compounds found in the tailing ponds to a more useable form.  We are currently targeting catechol, a aromatic compound shown to be degraded by bacteria living in the tailings ponds (Kato et al., 2001).  Catechol is being converted into 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, which we later hope to further convert into a useful hydrocarbon compound.
Additionally, we plan to target our catechol degrading enzyme into a microcompartment which the Lethbridge 2009 team began the work on.  By compartmentalizing the converted catechol, were trying to develop a way of easily removing the useful hydrocarbon product from the tailings ponds.  As a proof of principle, we will target the catechol degradation enzyme into the negatively charged microcompartment by the use of a poly-arginine tag.  Furthermore, to avoid adding a new species into the oil sands environment we plan on using"

Methodology
In order to do an analysis of the public perception about Synthetic Biology and GMO’s we decided to modify an already done survey by Dr. William K. Hallman from the Department of Human Ecology at the State University of New Jersey “Rutgers”. Dr. Hallman´s survey title is “Public Perceptions of Agricultural Biotechnology: A Survey of New Jersey Residents”. After having his permission , we adapted the survey to the Honduran context and modified certain questions.
The survey was launched online at SurveyMonkey.com and was then distributed by email and social network pages to random selected students studying at Zamorano University, Catholic Honduran University (UNICAH), Central American Technological University (UNITEC), National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) and “another” option was also available for people studying in another university that may have received the survey. As the size of the analyzed population was not big enough to differentiate each university´s group, the team decided to analyze only two groups; “Zamorano students” and “other universities”.
The population aimed by the survey were several university students in Honduras from different majors; economy, business, agronomy, agroindustry, biology, pure sciences, among others. Their age range went from 16 years old to 26 and older.
Results were finally analyzed with the predictive analytics software SPSS in order to find significant differences between both groups and correlations among different questions looking for the causes of their level of approval about biotechnology practices and GMO’s. These results were used for the development of the risk analysis tool and the planning of the educational model we designed for Latin America’s universities aiming at the main topics we found necessary for the people in order to develop their own criteria about Synthetic Biology based upon reliable information.

Lab work safety
To meet our school requirement, all students have received systematic safety training from a supervisor before doing any lab work. In addition, we have read a series of courses called “The Experiment Safety” to ensure our own safety. We wore proper protective equipment (gloves, lab coats, and eyewear if necessary) at all times in the lab. As shown in Fig.1, we wore proper lab coat and gloves when performing the Nitric Oxide releasing experiment inside a biosafety hood.

Figure 1. Performing Nitric Oxide releasing experiment inside a hood.
Project safety
Our team mainly worked with E.coli, which belongs to Level 1 risk group. We therefore stuck to biosafety level 1 requirement. Most notably, we have blueprinted that our engineered bacteria can applied for potential therapeutic use in human patients. We attached great significance to the safety issue of the bacteria we have modified, which might be a threat to host patients as well as the environment if without proper control. We thereby designed two kill switchesto limit their spreading at the end of our therapeutic schedule.
Our first 'kill switch' is the killer red, a toxic fluorescent protein that kills bacteria with reactive oxygen species after light illumination. We have validated its function in stopping bacteria growth. Next, we also applied a cell lysis protein gene E to kill bacteria, and found its induced expression would certainly curtain bacteria growth. Thus, our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrated the kill switches we engineered inside of bacteria can be effective to stop bacteria spreading.
In addition, we sought a physical approach by designing a 'warship' to lock bacteria inside of a confined device, but still allowed exchanging chemicals with the outsides (so that bacteria can still receive nutrient and secret useful molecules). As expected, we proved that this small warship served its function in limiting bacteria spreading

In our meeting with Leiden, we talked about strategies for public outreach and education about genetics and bacteria. We stayed in touch with the Leiden team throughout the season to discuss and compare our approaches to human practices. Being able to meet Dutch teams in person gave the UAlberta team the opportunity to share ideas, compare experiences, and make connections that lasted for the duration of the season.

Tec-Monterrey,2011,Team:Tec-Monterrey#teamha#onlinearticles#english_-_-_TEXT.html,"th: The production of resistant crops to pests and weeds will create immune “super insects”.
Reality: There is no scientific study that suggests this scenario may happen as a result of a genetically engineered crop production. Even so, there are a plenty of systems to prevent this scenario: crop rotation, hybrid rotation, and pest integral manage. Insects and weeds are not the same as they were in the past, but biotechnology could potentially improve their management so they do not gain a resistant.
To get more info see: Crop rotation form Penn State university and the site oisat.org
Myth: The crops produces by biotechnology will have a negative impact on the environment.
The origin of the myth is based in the conviction that the genetically modified (GM) crops promote insects’ resistance and affect the soil.
Fact: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) cause some positive impacts. According to the Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management & Economics, GMO have benefits related to the changes of insecticide and herbicide use and the reduction of greenhouse gases.
(GHG) emission levels. The use of genetically modified organisms has resulted in 224 million kg less pesticide use and a 15.3% reduction in the environmental impact associated with pesticide use. The GM crops also contribute in the reduction of GHG emissions of 9 billion kg in 2005, equivalent to removing 4 million cars from the roads. For more information about this study, click here .
An example of the employment of Biotechnology to substitute the use of pesticides, are the transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins. B. thuringiensis is a bacterium that produce a toxin that has been used as insecticide and as a natural regulator of insects. In accordance with an article of Nature Biotechnology journal, these organisms have also the capacity to delay insects’ resistance evolution in the plants.
Myth: The long-term effects produced by biotechnological generated food are unknown.
Reality: A lot of years of research have allowed scientists to know the enormous benefits that biotechnological food provides. The scientific consensus says that the risks associated with foods derived from biotechnology are fundamentally the same as the  other food products. Current science shows that foods produced through biotechnology are safe for consumption and there are a plenty of regulatory authorities like the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and EPA that have determined that these products are safe.

The NJU iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of “Human Practices”: public outreach to the non-technical community as well as education engagement; and collaboration within the academic and iGEM community. For both sides, we participated in a series of engagement exercises, including consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational and investigating outreach to the local Nanjing community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.

We believe science is everywhere and it is a part of each person’s everyday life. For most people without science background, synthetic biology and targeting therapy seems to be a very far-off topic. In order to offer better understanding about synthetic biology and the targeting therapy applied in our project, we did a grand scaled questionnaire on social network and then gathered data for a thorough analogy.
Conclusion of normal group questionnaire
Basic situations of the investigation group
● Effective investigation number: 780.
● Age distribution: 18~50 years of age accounted for the dominant.
● Education level: 66.67% for bachelor degree, the survey group basically has the education background of high school or above.
● Family economic conditions: the vast majority of respondents are of well-off level.
The respondents’ understanding of cancer is relatively simple, one-sided and inadequate.
The way of understanding cancer is limited. Most people learn about it from media reports, even though they are uneven in quality.
Figure 1. Rumor of Tumors…
● While the respondents generally recognize that if detected early, cancer can be treated and cured in time, the data notes that there are still nearly 15% of respondents identifying cancer as a terminal and incurable disease.
● The majority of respondents still have a fear of malignancy cancer, which is believed to be their nightmare scenario. Notably, among the 780 valid surveys, only 39.1% are aware of that, during the last decade in China, LUNG cancer made the highest mortality rates amid all types of cancers; 30.9% chose liver cancer, which is of the same high degree of malignancy with Lung cancer; the remaining 30"

Thomas De Vlaam
Thomas had the ambition of becoming a neurosurgeon. He holds a bachelor’s degree in International Medicine and Global. Unfortunately after a diagnosis of Scheuermann’s disease, Thomas underwent significant spinal fusion surgery                 in 2011, forcing him to give up on his medical career.
Despite the physical challenges and long recovery periods, his dream of helping patients grew stronger and became an unstoppable driver. He joined ProQR – a biotech company in the Netherlands working on novel drugs to treat                 rare orphan disorders. He then invented and developed a completely new approach to treat Amyloid disorders.
At the age of 24, Thomas started his new company: Amylon.
Victor Dillard
Victor is a young Belgian based in London. He’s now a mondial reference for the biotech entrepreneurship! At the age of 24 he raised 3 million USD to create Desktop Genetics, a start-up that changed the way we conceive genetic                 engineering!

Team Members
 
The team Shiyan_SY_China constitutes by our nine students and five tutors such as Dr. Xu Mingkai to instruct and help us. Some of us own deep interest in biology, some are enthusiastic about mathematics, some are interested in music and sports, also some are experts at making the software and studying intensively. We utilize our curiosity and energy to construct our team. Thanks to all the people who have helped us, without them, we couldn’t explore a new and interesting field.
I am Chu Jinyan,I participate in the iGEM for challenging myself to form my leadership and to achieve some first hand experiences about biology experiments and software making. Due to the admiration of doing experiments, I own the desire to be a scientist. I am the leader of students group and the administrator of the software part in our team, and also a participator of the biology experiment.
I am Liu Yiyang, one of the members of the Shenyang_SY_China team and the leader of the experiment group in our team. As I have great enthusiasm in Biology and want to achieve more knowledge about gene engineering, I take part in the IGEM. I love Biology so much that I decide to devote my lifetime to experiments and research.I learn a lot about teamwork and confirm my will to dedicate to Biology.
My dream is to be a scientist in the future because I really love chemistry and biology. From my perspective, the coolest thing of science is that I can obtain much knowledge about the nature through experiments and studies. In our team, I take charge of the experimental parts with three other team members. I learned a lot from the lab and I plan to try to have more opportunities to study in chemistry or biology labs.
I'm doing iGEM because I can develop some interests. I'm interested in biology and chemistry. I love doing experiments. I think I can achieve more experience in iGEM. I can have more friends with the same interest, and I learn how to work with others.I love drawing and dancing and insist in doing"

UFlorida,2018,Team:UFlorida#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,", it was not possible to amplify this fragment to concentrations high enough to successfully assemble the part via Circular Polymerization Extension Cloning or restriction digestion into psb1C3 or other plasmids such as ptrC99A.  This may have been due to poor primer binding, or due to the fact that our gBlocks were not ideal for PCR reactions.
We also attempted a blunt ligation of BF #1 and BF #2 into ptrc99A, to later be moved into psb1c3.  These attempts also proved unsuccessful, as there were no bands in PCR reactions that screened for inserts.
Overlap PCR
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning
After several months of work without any results, the Parts Registry and previous projects were searched for a solution. The Toulouse 2015 iGEM biobricks (BBa_K1587004 and BBa_K1587005) had four of the five enzymes contained in our gblock, but no ter. We attempted to improve the butyrate synthesis pathway BBa_K1587004.  A critical analysis of this pathway reveals that the ccr gene, which catalyzes the reduction of crotonyl-coA to butyryl-CoA, is NADPH-dependent.  Without an enzyme that couples NADH to NADPH, this pathway will not be functional for butyrate production.  Our initial rationale for gene deletions was to force E. coli to produce butyrate with our synthetic pathway in order to maintain redox balance, but this would be impossible without an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction using NADH instead of NADPH.  For this reason, we attempted to add the trans-enoyl reductase (ter) to their pathway via restriction digestion to form a complete redox balanced pathway that could be driven further via gene deletions.
Thus, it was feasible to add our ter onto their assembly in order to complete the pathway. We successfully used PCR with primers containing the iGEM prefix and suffix to clone out ter from BF #2. This was followed by successful circular polymerase extension cloning into the psb1C3 backbone and transformation into E. coli Nissle, resulting in our first biobrick of ter without a promoter.  We attempted to add the pCAT and pBAD promoters to this via 3A assembly from the distribution kit, but such attempts did not work and there was not enough time to troubleshoot before the parts deadline.  We did confirm that our ter-psb1c3 part is RFC 10 compliant via restriction digestion"

We have calibrated the absorbance at 600nm (O.D.600) with the colony forming units.  This allows us to approximate our absorbance data into a cell count number.  We can now normalise fluorescence data to obtain the fluorescence produced per cell.
We performed the experiment and further reruns with 2-3 repeats per OD value and for 2 different dilutions.

Codon Optimization
The genetic code is a degenerate one; there are more 3-part combinations of nucleotides than there are amino acids. The topic of codon optimization-that is, the cell's preference for one codon sequence over another in translation-has been heavily researched in an effort to determine the optimal genetic sequences for an organism. This project looks at the effects of repeated amino acid sequences of varying lengths and codons and their effect on the cell.
Codon Optimization
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Circuit Model
Initial Design
To test the effect of repeated codon sequences on cell protein expression, we altered a plasmid available in the Richard lab to contain a promoter, ribosome binding site, and an AHL leader sequence, followed by a non-coding repeated sequence placeholder flanked by restriction enzyme sites. A mCherry and GFP reporter allowed us to test each repeated codon sequence.
Sources
The initial construct was partially assembled by a Ph.D student formerly working in the Richard Lab at Penn State named Mike Speer. This project was designed by Mr. Speer, but never completed. The Penn State iGEM team worked closely with Mr. Speer to successfully complete the initial construct.
Assembly
This part was assembled using Amplified Insert Assembly, a technique developed in the Richard Lab by the 2011 Penn State iGEM team. AIA utilizes the complementary sticky ends left by certain restriction enzymes to ligate inserts and vectors with benign scars.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," imine dimer (white color) should be produced in those with functional import.
Plasmid preparation of those with white color and subsequent sequencing leads to the identification of functional PTS1 variants. Afterwards, we repeat the cloning steps described before to obtain a mTurquoise−PTS1* construct and co-transform it with the corresponding Pex5 variant. Eventually, the correct localization of mTurquoise tagged with these PTS1 variants provides proof for its function.
Mutagenesis of PTS2
Imagine you need different protein concentrations in your artificial compartment. What to do? Take our modified PTS2 sequences with varying import efficiencies.
To characterize the import efficiency for the site-directed PTS2 firefly luciferase was used. Luciferase is a luminescent protein which can be split in a C- and a N-terminal part. Only when combined, luminescence can be detected. To measure the import efficiency the two parts will be expressed and imported into the peroxisome in a separated way. The smaller part (Split2) of the split luciferase will be brought into the peroxisome first via the PTS1 dependent pathway. The other part is imported via the respective modified PTS2 sequence. The better this sequence is recognized by Pex7, the stronger the luminescence of the assembled luciferase can be detected in the peroxisome. There is a chance of split parts of the luciferase assembling in the cytosol if the import is too slow. To avoid wrong conclusions of the luciferase localisation, we designed a negative control experiment. It includes a split luciferase similar to the one used in the initial experiment, but without the peroxisomal targeting sequence. Consequently there will be no import into the peroxisome. If we subtract the luminescence of the negative control experiment from the luminescence of the main experiment we can define the degree of import.
In addition to a directed approach according to Kunze and colleagues we also want to perform a random  mutagenesis experiment to alter the five variable amino acids of the core region of the PTS2 sequence in an unbiased manner. The aim is to generate a library of different peroxisomal PTS2. The 15 nucleotides are assembled by chance. In the DNA synthesis this sequence will either be described as [NNN]5 or [DNK]5. N stands for all four nucleotides mixed, K for either G or T and D for A,G or T. The “DNK” composition prohibits two out of three termination codons. Additionally with this library the amino"

The First Generation of Dr. Familict
The first generation hardware design is very simple, consisting of only one square box, cool                         polarizer, one card slot, and one chip. This also brings the trouble of the user, the user needs                         to time and rinse. Below is the structure diagram and physical map of the first generation                         product.
Fig.1 The First Generation of Dr. Familict
The Second Generation of Dr. Familict
Instruction
Dr. Familict, the visualized liquid-crystal-based urine protein detector, is a 20cm×20cm×10cm                         brick-sized box. It consists mainly a slide holder slot, a wash buffer chamber, a waste                         collector, a liquid-crystal cell, polarizer and analyzer. Up on using, just plug in a                         antigen-coated glass slide to the slot, a drop of antibody solution is loaded automatically when                         the slide is placed properly. The user then only needs to add a drop of urine to the test zone,                         and press the bottom to start timing. The following operations will be done automatically. After                         the reaction is completed, the slide is rinsed for 30 s. Then it is drove slightly to the                         detection area. Upon slide positioning, liquid-crystal is loaded and the bottom light is                         switched on upon slide positioning. After the polarized light passes, visible color changes are                         produced. Users can take a picture and upload the result to the Mobile APP and get medication                         advice.
Liquid-crystal Cell
The liquid crystal cell is the most important part of the test box. When the upper slider slides                         to the observation area, it is assembled with the upper slide of the liquid crystal cell into a                         self-assembled film spaced 6 micrometers apart, and then the liquid crystal cell on the left                         side of the slide is opened, and the liquid crystal enters between the upper and lower slides                         due to capillary action. At this point, the microstructure of the slide will affect the orientation change of the liquid crystal. After turning on the light at the bottom of the test                         box, the light passes through the polarizer, then through the cell, and finally through the                         analyzer above the cell, so we can observe changes in brightness and color.
Wash buffer chamber and waste collector
These two components are used to wash unfixed antigens, antibodies and other impurity proteins on                         the slide. When the user drops the urine and the antibody solution, the test box starts to                         timing. After the reaction reaches"

Tokyo_Tech,2014,Team:Tokyo Tech#Policy and Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," September 8th at Ohyamaguchi Elementary School. The aim of this visit was to let elementary schoolchildren know how important DNA and protein are for our human beings, as well as the essence of synthetic biology, which is: combining genes.
6-1 iGEM card game
For this event, we created “iGEM card game” which represents the essence of synthetic biology by combiningcards. This card game has several series of cards. Each series consists of 3 to 5 cards, each card represents the key parts of an iGEM project.
The rule of this game is like poker. When we gather a whole series of cards, we can get points. By gathering them together, the player can understand how the combination of different genetic parts can be used to create living organisms with new and desired function.
Fig. 6-1-6-1. Our group member playing iGEM cards with the students
 
For example, one series represented Tokyo_Tech 2013’s project, “Mutant Ninja coli”. The aim of this project was to design a story by using a state switching circuit in E. coli to represent the life of ninja: switching between the state of mimicking civilian and battling with samurai. There are three characters, E. ninja, E. Samurai, and E. civilian in this story. This series consists of three parts: “state switching”,”receiving signal molecule from E. Samurai” and ”attacking E. Samurai with Shuriken”. Each of the cards represents one of the three parts (Fig. 6-1-6-2.).
These cards not only represent the nature of synthetic biology, but also has many illustrations. Therefore, the card game became very popular among the students. Some students played the game many times and asked us if they can keep the cards for themselves.

To make sure the students understood the essence of the card game, we also explained the team’s project by using slides (Fig. 6-1-6-3.).

6-2 Questionnaire
After the game, we asked the students to answer a questionnaire. Our survey consisted of the following questions:
Q1. Was the game rule easy to understand? : Easy / Cannot Say / Difficult
Q2. Was the explanation on the card easy to understand? : Easy / Cannot Say / Difficult

Future Applications
Targeting
Previous researchers who have worked on minicells have attached Protein A/G Fc receptors to an OmpA autotransporter located on the surface of minicells. This patented approach allowed them to add antibodies specific to their target host cell to purified minicells, thereby creating targeted minicells. Additionally, the antibody coating serves to protect the minicells from the host immune system and induce endocytosis when binding to certain target cell receptors. Such a modular targeting system is ideal for such a versatile vector. We hope to create a similar system that allows our minicells utilize the vast library of commercial antibodies available as highly specific receptors for a variety of applications.

Skype-Interview with Dr. Jeremy Keenan
Download the interview as a podcast.
Dr. Jeremy Keenan is the Director of International Programs at the Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology at the University of California San Francisco. He is part of the Proctor teams conducting randomized trials investigating trachoma elimination strategies in Ethiopia.
This interview helped us further understand the underlying problems with trachoma elimination strategies, concerning the behaviour of the target population
Finding Chlamydory:
Introduction and description of our project.
Dr. Keenan:
The World Health Organisation wants to eliminate trachoma by 2020. The way WHO does this is by treatment decisions. Did you guys hear of the SAFE strategy?
Kai, Daniel C.:
Yeah
Dr. Keenan:
So you know they base the SAFE strategy off of clinical signs in the field. So you go in and pick a sample of kids age 1-9, you flip their eye lids and look whether they look infected. So you look for inflammation and if the prevalence is above 5 % or above 2%, depending on if they got treatment before. Then you do mass treatment with an antibiotic, financed by NGOs to treat the whole community. So the question is how often do you have to treat? The WHO recommends once a year for a period of three to five years, depending on the baseline prevalence of the clinical signs TF and TT (Note: These signs are categorized in a symptomatic grading scale, indicating disease progress: Trachomatous Inflammation – TF, Trachomatous Inflammation – TI, Trachomatous Scarring – TS, Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) in this area. However, the correlation between the clinical signs and the infection is not that great. In a lot of places where we work in Ethiopia [for example] the prevalences of the clinical signs stuck at pretty much around 40 % of the village, even though the infection rate when we do PCR tests is lower. [...]
   It is not really known why the TF doesn’t go down but our opinion is, that the clinical signs are probably not the best way for us to determine if we eliminated trachoma or not. We really should be looking for the chlamydial infection itself. That should guide treatment decisions, because the whole point of antibiotics is not to treat the clinical signs, but to treat the infection. The idea is"
Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," their career, preventing their career progression, but are comfortable with allowing their female partner to take time off, or leave their career altogether, then we need to focus on changing this societal bias. Professor Ryan highlighted an interesting question:
Do we ask whether men feel pressured to go back to work when they've got a small child at home?
We also have to ask if men feel pressured by their partners or if the pressure is stronger from society, affecting whether they choose to stay at home or go back to work. We also have to consider how women’s attitudes might change when they have their baby, they may be set on going back to their career as soon as possible, but this may change. From this series of interviews, we have deduced that this may be the problem with imposing a strict parental leave concept, without first changing societal norms. In the Scandinavian countries, both parents taking time off for their children is accepted and encouraged because is shows they are committed to both work and family, they have the ability to multitask and they compassionate qualities that are desirable in the workplace and at home. The fact that women who
don't take leave to look after their children (are) often judged quite harshly”
and that if men do take leave, they are often considered weird or ‘unmanly’, shows that the current concept of our parental leave may not be feasible in the UK’s society.
It is not just about making leave available it's also about how you judge people once they've taken leave
Professor Ryan further commented on the way society judges people in both the application process for jobs and in general; highlighting how it is a significant sign of gender inequality. We asked her if taking the names off of CV’s would help prevent discrimination against any one gender or race. Professor Ryan argued that whilst
you could try to achieve gender equality by having a gender-blind system
, this might not be the kind of gender equality you are fighting for. It wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem of women who have taken time off to have children, and hence have a large gap in their CV’s compared to men. Dr Wilson stressed that you need to change the attitude of the employer so that they will consider the potential in a female candidate alongside the publications of a male one; noting that the female candidate may have taken time off due to pregnancy and hence would have fewer publications. Professor Ryan stated:
when I look at two CVs I don't just want to take them at face value as if they're equal because actually, I know society is not equal
and hence a female candidate may have a reason for having a gap in the CV."

However, this work wouldn’t have been possible without the unconditional help and support of many of those wothers. In this page we would like to thank all of these people and acknowledge their contribution in our project.
Idea Conception
The idea of working on cancer came during the brainstorming sessions, during the project ideation session of the team. We investigated the problems that we could target and we talk to a few professors to understand the clinical needs. We thank Prof. Elisa Oricchio for her input in this part of the project.
Laboratory Work
All the experiments and assays performed during the project were done by the team members. Due to the immense scope of the project, the lab work was divided into specific subteams each assigned with one part of the project.
Moustafa, Violette, Thomas, Laurine and Theophile, worked in the design, production, purification and expression of the encapsulin-based vaccine. Furthermore, they worked on the design of the biobrick parts submitted to IGEM.

There were more components than we had expected, with an applicator, transfer wick, nitrocellulose, dragging wick, and a dessicator stone at the end. Through playing with the components we found that the dragging wick (after the nitrocellulose to pull the liquid sample as far as possible) was not completely necessary, but did seem to aid in covering the nitrocellulose. We believe the dessicator is for long term storage of the device, as it played no discernable role in our bench testing.
Testing Ferritin in Pregnancy Tests
To test if our system of using ferritin would give us a readable output from a prototype we blotted prussian blue ferritin onto nitrocellulose. We then enclosed the blotted nitrocellulose in one of the pregnancy tests along with the applicator and wicks that came with it before exposing it to the TMB substrate. The results of our first test can be seen below in Figure 3.
Unfortunately we didn't see any change between the before and after pictures, and after taking it apart to look inside we found that the solution had only flowed through approximately one third of the device. With that in mind we built our second prototype out of another pregnancy test, but this time we shortened the test by cutting a chunk of the applicator off. The downside of this modification was that the applicator was rendered useless, so filter paper, commonly used in western blots, was used instead. In this prototype, shown below in Figure 4, we were able to observe a change in prussian blue ferritin after the addition of the substrate TMB.
We are now in the final stages of prototyping by attempting to use our purified TALEs to capture DNA and then provide a signal from a reporter protein. Stay tuned for more results!

After the mini Jamboree, there was an organised feedback session where every team had the chance to discuss inputs and raise questions.
We are grateful for iGEM Team Copenhagen for arranging this fun conference, and for the meaningful feedback we received from all the teams that took part.
TU Darmstadt
In September, some members of iGEM TU Darmstadt visited us in Stockholm together with a high school class from the Johanna-Geissmar-Gymnasium Mannheim. It was nice to meet a new team as well as potential iGEMers while exchanging ideas on both of our projects, sharing our good and not so good experiences with iGEM so far. TU Darmstadt also helped us by taking part in our recruitment event for iGEM Stockholm 2018, where they explained why they joined iGEM, and why the attendees of the event should join Stockholm’s next iGEM team. Furthermore, we are helping iGEM TU Darmstadt to establish and refine the structure of their iGEM organisation.

iGEM Memes
A meme is most often a picture with a humorous text. Memes are mostly used to spread feelings of humour, recognition and a sense of belonging. We know that working on an iGEM project all summer can be tough, and that is one of the reasons we decided to create iGEM memes: to try to bring the whole iGEM community together through laughter. In total, we have gathered over 900 followers on both accounts, resulting in a collaboration with almost 1 000 old, current and new iGEMers across the world.
We have used both Instagram and Facebook as our platforms. All the memes we have posted are created by us, iGEM Stockholm, or submitted by other iGEMers. iGEM memes got so popular, that we ended up creating the challenge “Meme of the week”, where iGEMers would submit memes, and the best one would win the honour of being posted on a Monday.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

NJU-China,2017,Team:NJU-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," exosomes. Subsequently, exosomes bind to the plasma membrane of a target cell, and then exosomes either fuse directly with the plasma membrane or are first endocytosed and then fuse with the delimiting membrane of an endocytic compartment. Both pathways result in the delivery of the exosomal siRNA to the cytosol of the target cell where it may associate with and silence corresponding mRNA [16] [17].
In conclusion, as exosomes have the intrinsic ability to traverse biological barriers and naturally transport functional small RNAs between cells with a character ——potentially better tolerated by the immune system because they are nano-carriers derived from endogenous cells, we picked exosomes to be our delivery vesicles.
Design
In general, the project design can be divided into three sessions: (1) RNAi module, (2) targeting module, (3) assembly.
RNAi module
RNA interference (RNAi) serves as a powerful tool that employs siRNAs to silence the expression of specific target genes. We designed specific BCL2 siRNAs to act as   therapeutic agents to degrade BCL2 mRNA and block BCL2 expression and therefore allow higher apoptosis probabilities. Four siRNA sequences targeting different sites of the BCL2 mRNA open reading frame (ORF) were designed based on a free software accessible online. We conducted pre-experiments to find the best siRNA sequences on the targeted gene BCL2 to insure the maximum gene-specificity and silencing efficacy. This tool also designs the pair of oligonucleotides needed to generate short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the plasmid. At least two of the four pre-designed shRNA plasmids are guaranteed to knock down expression of the targeted gene BCL2. The access to two effective sequences allows appropriate control on non-specific effects. When the shRNA plasmids of BCL2 are transfected into HEK293 cells, Dicer cleaves the shRNA into siRNA of BCL2. However, because siRNAs in vivo are vulnerable to degradation by plasma and tissue nucleases, nano-vesicles to facilitate siRNA uptake into the neurons need to be established.
Target module
Exosomes are natural nano-sized vesicles secreted by endogenous cells. Given their intrinsic role as natural carriers of bioactive molecules between cells, exosomes are reasonable siRNA carriers in terms of therapeutic use. Since exosomes can be genetically modified and are biocompatible with the immune system, they are capable of delivering siRNA to specific cellular environments without bringing cytotoxicity or triggering the immune response."

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer

AQA_Unesp,2017,Team:AQA Unesp#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," switch
In order to control the release of the organism in the environment, our team devised a genetic circuit based on the combination of Split Cas9 domains with blue light-induced regulation based on the NEU-China 2016 team design.
Our system was designed to achieve high specificity, low noise and being lethal to the cell when activated. Because our expression system is designed to function within the microbiota, it will not have light exposure, thus, prolonged exposure to light can be used as a sign that the microorganism is growing in another environment.
The composition of our kill system is divided into two parts. The fusion of CRY2 and CIB1 light-induced heterodimerizing proteins with split Cas9 (C-terminal and N-terminal) domains.
The main purpose of the construction of the kill switch was to prevent the release of our device in nature, to do that, we choose a light-inducible protein interaction modules based on Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 and CIB1. These two proteins are able to dimerize on blue light exposure [1].
This system has been used to control gene expression as the light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (LACE). Where through the binding of the units of this proteins to transcription factors and to a programmable enzyme like dcas9 represented into the scheme in figure 1 from NEU-China team. This system is capable of creating a guide and programmable system to find a specific sequence of DNA and control your gene expression [2].
Figure 1. Light-activated CRISPR-Cas9 effector (LACE) proposed by the NEU-CHINA team 2016. At the top is the representation of the expression system; Below, on the right is the configuration used to join dCas9 to the light-induced proteins, CRY2 (BBa_K1592015) and CIB1 (BBa_K1592016) . On the left, the representation of the junction of this activated proteins in presence of the light [2].
Based on this idea we proposed a system that uses split cas9 to make a programmable and guide system to gene knock out and so kill the cell in presence of light. The CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) is a protein from Streptococcus pyogenes used in genome editing. This protein is able to target specific targets being guided by a small sequence of RNA (gRNA). To find your target this enzyme needs protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) positioned downstream of the DNA recognition site [3].

Kent,2015,Team:Kent#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s something I never thought about before. I know we’re exploring different ways of doing things and it’s a good thing this research is going on. We wouldn’t be where we are today if we didn’t continue to research and move in different directions all the time. I would say there is a need to explore more and come up with new ideas.
Raneem: I know you don’t have much knowledge within synthetic biology, I was wondering what ethical dilemmas you think they introduce within the society?
Terry: I don’t think they’re particularly negative. Sometimes you have to explore these avenues, but overall I’m not a scientist; I know very little about this side of things. So it is interesting to find out what is being done. Everyone’s future is at stake and future generations will benefit from things you do. Sorry I can’t be more specific.
Raneem: it’s your opinion and everything, so it’s fine. Like I said there is no right or wrong answer here. You said you read about our project but I would like to summarise it. So we’re basically producing conductive nanowires that can be used in everyday products such as replacing metals used in conventional circuit boards.  So we’re looking into going down that path with our product. One of them was using a portable charger powered by the bacteria. Would you be comfortable with that?
Terry: As long as its safe.
Raneem: Do you believe that there are any risks associated?
Terry: Well you just assured me about the E.coli
Raneem: So that was your main concern?
Terry: Yeah. I know there are issues sometimes like these chargers and that, there’s been problems with them overheating and causing fires. There is an element of risk. Also, the other thing is about people making copies and trying to copy. There again that causes a lot of problems. They cut cost. So whatever you do someone’s going to try and copy. S many things these days with all these branded items and the fakes out there. It’s a massive problem in the world.
Raneem: how do you think we should approach the public with our product? When we approach them we’re going to say our product is harmless. Do you think they will be acceptable?
Terry: I think that’s something that will need a lot of consultation.
Raneem: Like you said not many people are for renewable energy and some are for. Just the general publics opinion, how do you think we should approach with our product?
Terry: How do you"

After obtaining her Bachelor degree in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, where her main focus was on Human Genetics and Pharmacogenetics, she came to Heidelberg, attracted by the many research facilities and the scientific environment the city has to offer. She thinks that joining iGEM was one of the best decisions she has ever made. For her, it’s the right place to gain unique experiences in the field of synthetic biology as well as in working within a team of highly experienced students who come from various majors and countries. She greatly enjoys working in synthetic biology and the company of her lovely lab partners.
Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher
Laura has just completed her Bachelor's degree in Biology at the University of Heidelberg this summer before joining the iGem team. For her bachelor thesis she was working on the evolution of transcription factors in the zebrafish retina. Her laboratory experience has so far been focused on neural differentation, development and marine biology. She will further her studies in the major Developmental Biology within the Master's program Molecular Biosciences in Heidelberg. Laura joined iGem in order to experience a novel field of biology and because she is interested in the scientific as well as the socio-cultural implications of synthetic biology.
Lea Flocke
Lea Flocke is a Biology diploma student at Eberhard-Karls-University in Tübingen where she will write her diploma thesis post iGEM on cellular motile functions driven by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). After her A-Levels, she studied two years in Darmstadt, where she did internships: for example, on Postranscriptional Gene Regulation and RNA Therapeutics. During her graduate studies, Lea got an insight into functional proteomics, cell biology, human genetics and during her internship at the Bioquant, Heidelberg into systems biology. There, she was interested in iGEM and sees this competition as a great chance to learn how to arrange one's scientific projects. She is fascinated by the huge number of possibilities that arise through synthetic biology.

There are several forms of data archives, each with their own     benefits and disadvantages. Cloud-based data archiving is becoming     more popular as online data transfer speeds increase, while storage     media costs drop. Although cloud storage is initially inexpensive,     it requires ongoing maintenance and consumes far more energy in the     long term than offline data storage. Offline archiving involves     writing the data onto removable media such as magnetic tape.     Tape-based archives do not consume power during storage, and are     therefore a cheaper alternative to cloud storage.
Archives contain records that have been generated as a result of     administrative, commercial, legal or social activities. There are     several types of archives, based on the type of data being     preserved, including:
Government archives
Corporate archives
College and university archives
Historical archives
Religious archives
DNA is an incredibly dense and durable storage medium. When     encased in bacterial spores its durability becomes even greater.     For these reasons, in addition to safe storage and transfer of     data, our device is perfectly suited for data archiving.
Time capsule
Collins English Dictionary defines a time capsule as “a     container holding articles, documents, etc, representative of the     current age, … [meant] for discovery in the future”.  Essentially,     it is a historic collection of information and items placed in a     durable container and buried underground or interred in the     foundation of a new building.
Time capsules are a way to communicate with civilization of the     future, particularly with future historians and anthropologists [1] . For this reason, time capsules are typically assembled with     the intention that they will someday be opened. The Crypt of     Civilization, constructed a Oglethorpe University in 1936 is     considered to be the first modern time capsule, and is scheduled to     be opened in the year 8113 [2] . 6,000 years is quite a while, but     the Crypt has been designed to withstand the test of time. However,     the same cannot be said for many other time capsules. Several     preservation issues must be addressed when constructing a time     capsule. Many time capsules are destroyed by groundwater, or simply     lost because their location is forgotten. The choice of media used     to preserve time capsule information is crucial, if it is meant to     be retrieved in the future. Technology advances at a rapid pace,     quickly becoming obsolete, while electronic and magnetic storage     media suffer from deterioration after just a few decades,     illustrating some of the preservation issues that must be taken     into"

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on"

Cardiff_Wales,2016,Team:Cardiff Wales#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the time-scale of a ten-week project this can be challenging as by the time you realise there is a problem, the project has significantly progressed.
When we started our lab work, the whole team was involved. This has the effect of making the work a bit fractured and disjointed, not to mention complicating the management of samples. In discussion with other teams it became apparent that it was more routine to have only a few members designated to lab duties. We therefore decided to reduce the number of us in the lab, and split off into two groups with each one focusing on a project each. This is something we look to do from the start in 2017.
We didn't start our FUEL project until after half of our lab time was up, this really restricted the amount of time we could devote to it. Next time we would aim to split into two lab groups that start at the same together but work independently, which again would improve the management of lab work.

Unfortunately we were unable to practically collaborate with Saclay due to failures in our related dCas9. In future years we aim to increase our number of collaborations. We dedicated most of our lab time to cloning our own constructs, which meant there wasn't much time, or manpower left for collaborations."

Minnesota,2014,Team:Minnesota#Templates_-_-_TEXT.html," and to determine the effects of changing methylmercury concentration on the conversion rate. A combination of enzyme kinetics and protein expression equations was in the model. The reactions below shows the four-step reaction network for the conversion of methylmercury to volatile mercury using the mer operon in E. coli. This network involves the transport of methylmercury into the cell, its subsequent conversion into ionic and volatile mercury, and the transport of volatile mercury to the extracellular space. This simplified network follows the proposed mechanism of the mer operon and it captures the primary steps of methylmercury breakdown in E. coli. Furthermore, a system of ordinary differential equations was used to model the biochemical reactions taken place at each step of the conversion process. The cofactors were not included in the equations because at sufficient concentrations, they do not significantly alter the rates.
Mathematical Modeling
The equations used in conversion steps 3 and 4 are extracted from studies done by Maria on ionic mercury uptake by E. coli
cells (Maria, 2010). These equations can be used because ionic mercury is converted into elemental mercury which in turn
diffuses into the extracellular space; these two steps were described in the Maria paper. It is assumed that methylmercury
and ionic mercury have similar orders of magnitude of transport rate into the cell.
Since step 2 is not explicitly included in the Maria paper, a different approach was used to determine the equation. During
our literature search, we did not find any primary publications that specify the methylmercury conversion behavior of both
MerA and MerB. Our pBBRBB plasmid is designed in the way that the mer genes are induced in the presence of methylmercury and
ionic mercury. Through our literature search, we were able to calculate the steady state concentrations of basal and induced
states based on the presence of methlymercury and ionic mercury in the cytosolic space. Therefore, we used the below
equation to extrapolate the reaction rates of both the mer proteins. For details, please see Supplemental Materials A.
The above equations show the reaction rates of the mer proteins under induced steady state. To represent the full MerA and
MerB expression, we include terms for the basal protein expression, the induction of the Mer proteins, and the degradation
of proteins. For details on the calculations, please refer to Supplemental Materials A. We have determined from our
calculations that Va and Vb resemble Vmax in the equations.
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed sensitivity analysis to give us insight into which parameters will have the greatest effect"
Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html,", tripolar cuff electrode are used (Cf. Figure 3). For the nerve signal, the main point of the cuff is that it reduces the volume of tissue in which the action currents flow and, therefore, increases the potential differences between the electrodes. For the EMG interference, the fact that the cuff is a tube of uniform cross-sectional area means that the gradient inside, due to each external source, is approximately constant and, therefore, the potential differences between the pairs of electrodes are equal and cancel. How they are canceled depends on the amplifier configuration but the principle is that out-of-cuff signals are canceled while neural signals do not.
The variation of the ENG is not linear over the entire length of the electrode, it is at a maximum in the center of the cuff. Moreover, the average value of the EMG potential is zero or close.
Thus, the impact of EMG on the measurement is significantly attenuated, while the ENG is preserved
Figure 3: Comparison of the potential in the cuff due to EMG and ENG sources [6].
The electronic realization of this treatment is very simple, it can be done in two different ways using either one or three differential amplifiers, these structures are named respectively ""quasi-tripole"" and ""true-tripole"" (Cf. Figure 4)
Figure 4: (a) The QT amplifier configuration connected to a tripolar cuff. (b) The TT amplifier configuration [6].
2. Type of nerve fiber selectivity [7]:
Nerves carry a lot of different neural signals, with both afferent and efferent traffic. However, by recording the signal we reduce it to only one artificial signal and we lose a lot of information. As the different types of signals are transmitted by fibers of different diameters, it should be interesting to select the fiber we record according to its diameter.
The method (Cf. Figure 5) uses a double differential array of amplifiers ('tripole amplifiers') and, for each selected velocity (of either sign), artificial time delays, as well as an adder and a narrow-band filter. An action potential transiting the nerve will be perceived in the same way by each tripole, but with delays inversely proportional to the speed of propagation of the action potential. If this time offset is compensated by the delay added by the measurement system, the action potentials appear simultaneously at the output of the delay stages. Thus, summing them to each other, the amplitude of the action potential is amplified. This system makes it possible to amplify the measurement for this particular action potential. Whereas,"

Overview
At the beginning of iGEM, we created a flyer showcasing the strengths of our team and the various ways we could help other teams. As a result of this, we were contacted by three teams: Edinburgh overgraduate team, Exeter, and Evry Paris-Saclay.
For the Edinburgh team, we used our modelling knowledge to help fix their model. We aided the Exeter team by repeating one of their experiments, and they gathered single-cell fluorescence data for our deGFP construct using their FACS machine. Finally, Paris designed a novel psicose-regulated promoter to be used in a biosensor. We then incorporated their promoter into our framework so that many different variants of a psicose biosensor could be designed, made and tested.
Edinburgh OG
We were initially contacted by Anton Puzorjov from the Edinburgh Overgraduate team after meeting them at the Northern UK iGEM meet-up. As our team contained members who have been trained in modelling for synthetic biology, they were wondering if we could help them with their model as they were struggling to convert their deterministic model into a stochastic one.
We organised a Skype call to discuss how far they had gotten and to explain the theory behind stochastic modelling. After a long talk, we understood the issues and Anton had shown us the software they were using to model with (StochPy). We were then given their code and went off to work out the issues.
We corrected their code by fixing the reaction for infection of bacteria by phage, and converting the rate law for infection of bacteria by"

Parameter Estimation
The Estimation of $s$
Recall that $s$ is the stoichiometric number in the reaction
\[ \ce{s \ monomer -> seed} \]
Wakabayashi et al. (1969) gave an estimation of $s=3.3$ from their experimental data. Our using this estimation directly instead of rounding it to an integer is justified by Kashchiev (2015), which illustrated that $k_nC_m^s$ is in essence not the nucleation rate, but an approximation of the forward flux in Kashchiev’s more sophisticated model. Therefore, $s$ need not be an integer, and using the more exact result $s=3.3$ is actually more accurate. Also note that although this estimation is for Salmonella flagellins, it is also basically valid for the E. coli case due to their great similarity in polymerization (K"

different clones
Sequencing reports for the size verified biobrick parts of last week showed no mutations in all sent samples, meaning we have already four biobricks ready. Transformation of pSB1C3_BBa_K1670004 was repeated. Obtained transformants were streaked out again and their plasmids isolated. Correct cloning was verified by restriction digests with EcoRI /PstI and run on an analyzing gel (Fig.1). Sequencing of both clones showed no mutations in clone 1, verifying our fifth biobrick.
Sequencing results of the repeated attempt of site directed mutagenesis of esaR showed that we were able to correct the deletion. Additionally, we also sequenced the other genes of the fragment esaR_cepR_esaI that also verified the sequence of the OE-PCR. Thus this fragment was excised from the pJET backbone and purified.
Furthermore, the sequence verified pJET_esaR_cepR_esaI clone was used as a template for PCR to attach the biobrick pre- and suffix to esaR to generate our last biobrick pSB1C3_BBa_K1670005 .
After the successful site directed mutagenesis experiment all fragments for the Gibson assembly of pCERI (PaidA_mRFP, PesaRC_cfp_cepI, PesaS_esaR_cepR_esaI and bla_p15A) were finally available. Gibson assembly was performed according to the protocol: 0.05 nmol of each fragment were used for the reaction. 2µl of the reaction mix were transformed into E.coli TOP10. Plated transformants were grown over the weekend.
Additionally this week we also started to set up the vectors needed for the characterization of our biobricks. BBa_K1670001 and BBa_K1670003 each were cloned into pSB3C5 to receive a vector backbone with a lower copy number of 10-15. Further J61002_J23100 from the distribution kit was transformed into E.coli TOP 10. After plasmid isolation the vector was cut with SpeI and PstI and dephosphorylated to be able to clone the regulatory genes of our quorum sensing systems BBa_K1670005 and BBa_K1670002 right after the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 next week.
