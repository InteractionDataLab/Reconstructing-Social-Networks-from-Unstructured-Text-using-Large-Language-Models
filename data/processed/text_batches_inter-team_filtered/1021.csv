TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Main-Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," et al. 2016 ). The RNA sequences will likewise be cleaved by the activated Cas13a. After cleavage, the previously long ‘collateral’ RNA is no longer able to form coacervates, and thus the method allows the naked eye detection of Cas13a target recognition. In absence of the RNA target, Cas13a will remain inactive and the collateral RNA remains at its original length at which it still coacervates with spermine. The solution will show increased turbidity. This difference in turbidity (see Figure 2) shows whether Cas13a has been activated or not. This indicates the presence or the absence of the RNA target. We were in fact able to demonstrate that coacervation can be employed as a reliable method. More elaborate experimental results can be found here .
Figure 2: Schematic outline of the CINDY Seq method. CINDY Seq is a method that can allows detection of specific RNA sequences with the use of Cas13a. If the added RNA sample contains the Cas13a target, the long RNA polymers will be collaterally cleaved by the active Cas13a. When there is no target present in the sample, Cas13a remains inactive and will not cleave the RNA polymers. These RNA molecules will form coacervates that are visible to the naked eye.
Perspectives for characterizing existing and future BioBricks
The nature of CINDY Seq is such that, in principle, it can be used to visualize any significant change in polymer length. As a result, this provides a promising outlook to characterize existing and future biobricks that involve the polymerization or degradation of coacervate-forming polymers (see Figure 3). Examples of such enzymes are: nucleases, proteases and amylases. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that even the molecule ATP can form coacervates ( Jia et al. 2014 ), so that one can even imagine to demonstrate energy consumption or ATP synthesis.
An obvious example of a BioBrick that can directly be characterised using the coacervation detection method is BBa_K1923001 , encoding for a variant of Cas13a closely related to the one we have used in our project. With the coacervation detection method any crRNA and RNA target combination can be tested, for activating Cas13a, and even binary tests for off-target effects can be done by introducing mutations in the target RNA.

The growth was considerably decreased in the M9-MM, however we are not sure whether the bacteria were able to use the compound as a carbon source because the MM contained glucose.  The fact that the growth decreased showed that they might depend on the glucose in the media to grow.
Denitrification
On Monday and Tuesday we used the database primers to attempt to isolate CarAa, CarAc, CarAd, AntA, AntB, and AntC from the Psuedomonas putida we plated last week. CarAd, AntB, and AntC were all put in the gradient PCR machine to account for the wide range of their primers’ melting points, while the others were done via regular PCR. Unfortunately, no positive results were obtained from these reactions.  The PCR on CarAc and AntA was repeated on Wednesday, still not giving positive results. Finally, we attempted to use a salt concentration gradient on the PCR reaction for CarAc and AntA, using concentrations that ranged from 1.0 microlitres/tube to 2.0 microlitres/tube in increments of 0.2 microlitres/tube. This helped as CarAc showed bands in samples that had concentrations of 1.2 and 1.4 microlitres/tube. AntA also showed bands, however they were not the correct size, indicating contamination and/or non-specific annealing of the primer.  The positive control also showed bands of the correct size. Earlier in the week we also made overnight cultures of 3 environmental strains (28, 29, 30) of Psuedomonas putida from -80 glycerol stock. On Friday we performed a genomic prep on these cultures, and plan on attempting to amplify genes from the isolated DNA next week.
Desulfurization
Since we wanted to make sure we would not run out of pUC18(plasmid containing the hpaC gene), we transformed some E.coli cells with it. We grew them on plates containing A, K, T and C antibiotics and they only grew on A. Therefore pUC18 has A resistance. We did a three sets of PCR with primers designed against hpaC, one using 1/10 dilution of pUC18, the other using 1/100 dilution of pUC18 and one with the colonies we had just obtained by transforming the E.coli cells. The PCR worked and we saw bands of the same"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#projectAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,". The species matching and products generating modules are essential to implement our automatic modeling idea.
To complete the final systemn network from initial conditions, we break up the task to several parts:
Setup initial conditions and environmental parameters read from the input file;
Species produced are inserted into a list in the order of time. For each species, we search the database to find template species which could be matched to this species in structural pattern. If not found, then go for the next species;
For each template species found matching, we continue to search template reactions containing this template species as a reactant or modifier or both. Only forward or reverse reaction is handled, never for both at the same time;
For each template reaction found possible to occur, we search in the species list for possible species which could be instances of templates of other reactants and modifiers. If not found, then go for next reaction;
For each possible combination of reactants and modifiers, if the reaction parameter conditions are satisfied for given constraints, we generate the structure of products based on the transfer table and structural templates of products. And then add this new reaction to the reaction list.
Go to step 2 until the end of the species list;
In the following, we will focus on the step (2), (3) and (5). Our algorithms are totally different with that of other software tools since we design them for the purpose of proving the feasibility of MoDeL for synthetic biology. They are kind of complicated because the complexity of biological systems require so.
Figure 1: Algorithm Flow Chart
Special reactions and volume strategy
Transcription and translation reactions are not supported by MoDeL reaction definitions; they are handled specially in the core program. We use pseudo first-order reaction to model both transcription and translation reactions. The rate constant k is the value of forwardPromoterEfficiency/reversePromoterEfficiency for transcriptions and forwardRbsEfficiency/reverseRbsEfficiency for translations defined for each part in the database. It means number of mRNAs per DNA per second for transcriptions and number of proteins per mRNA per second for translations. A transcription will not end at a terminator with termination efficiency less than 100% (values are stored in attribute forwardTerminatorEfficiency/reverseTerminatorEfficiency): RNA polymerase will pass over and continue transcription. For translation reactions, the prerequisite condition is that the part next to RBS along the 5' to 3' direction must have non-zero attribute value forwardStartCodon/reverseStartCodon. Opposite to transcriptions, translation reactions would stop if one part with non-zero attribute"

Motivation for Igem Participation
As a 3rd year Bsc Biotechnology student I was looking for ways in which I could learn more about my chosen field of study. Being part of the IGEM team provided that opportunity for me. I value the theory gathered from textbooks as well as the lecturers who go out of their way to ensure that we understand the things we learn in class but theory alone is nothing without being put into practice. I see IGEM as the first step to putting my knowledge to good use.
Over the last few months that I’ve been part of the IGEM team I’ve come to appreciate the beauty of science, its challenges and the solutions that it offers to real life problems.  There are a lot of areas that are still to be discovered which makes it more interesting. It has also exposed me to the vast scientific paths and careers and applications thereof. I’m grateful for this opportunity; I now have no doubt that I made the right choice in pursuing a career in science.

Motivation for Igem Participation
The three years that I have been enrolled in my field of study, I have begun to appreciate the vast capacity of application of synthetic biology. I believe that synthetic biology is the next step in the evolution of science in the 21st century. Being a part of the IGEM group has opened my eyes to the endless potential of this rapidly growing field to all components of science.
The opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people in their various fields of study is truly inspirational, as we are all able to learn from one another. I look forward to taking the knowledge that I’ve acquired and incorporating synthetic biology into human genetics.

SSBE Conference
We were kindly invited by Prof.Maerkl (one of our advisors) to participate to the annual meeting of the Swiss Society for Biomedical Engineering (SSBE). We gave a talk there ( download the presentation) and presented a poster (download the poster ).
Meetup with ETH Zurich
The team from ETH Zurich was also invited at the SSBE. They gave a presentation on their project. We met up afterwards to talk about our projects and our experiences this summer. It's not very often you can tell jokes about cloning...
We exchanged many ideas on how we could model our photosentitive proteins and what experimental setup we could use for our and their purposes (E.Coli vs. mammalian expression). We thoroughly discussed LovTAP modeling and gave advice to each other about the lighting setup for the LovTAP experiments. We also helped them with parameters for the LovTAP protein model. We kept in touch through emails and we actually want the #SwissIgemMeetup to be a thing!

Westminster & UCL: UK iGEM Meet-Up 2017
Together with The University of Westminster and University College London, we co-hosted the UK iGEM meet-up for 2017, which was a great success!
https://2017.igem.org/Team:UCL/Collaborations https://2017.igem.org/Team:Westminster/Collaborations
Day 1
18/8/17
The first day of the meet began at 10am with team registrations at The University of Westminster. Each of the thirteen teams handed in their posters and then we all introduced ourselves to the other iGEM members over breakfast. Many of us had travelled from far and wide with very early starts, and so coffee was consumed in abundance!
We then heard from different speakers, who gave interesting, insightful and varied talks about different areas within synthetic biology.
After lunch, each group had the opportunity to present their poster and peer-review the other teams. It was fascinating to see such a diverse range of project ideas, conveyed and presented in all sorts of different ways. We can’t speak for the other teams, but for us it was a really useful opportunity to put together a draft poster in preparation for the Jamboree. We were inspired by the other posters and have since altered our layout and design to make it more eye-catching and accessible for readers.
The day ended with an iGEM social event, kindly hosted by Westminster in their SU building.
Day 2
19/8/17
After a well-earned rest, we all assembled at UCL in time for a morning of debating! Each team was split up and their members mixed with other iGEMers. These smaller teams of 4 or 5, were then given contentious ethical issues linked to the field of synthetic biology. We were given some time to prepare arguments either for or against the topic in question, before embarking in heated debates! The topics chosen by UCL made us all take a step back and really think about the ethics and safety of the field, which in turn helped enormously when we came to look at our own Human Practices.
After lunch, everyone travelled across the Thames to meet at the iconic tallest building in the UK"

Singapore SB7.0 conference
THE FLIGHT
At about 12:00 we met at the Düsseldorf airport, with our bags packed and ready to go. Being about 2 hours early, we had absolutely no trouble getting through the check-in and security. After that we met up with Rocio a PhD student from our university who coincidentally was also going to the SB7.0 and spend the last hour before boarding eating something small and talking about the trip.
￼
Because we were supposed to fly with an A380, we were a little disappointed when we realized that there was just a A330 waiting for us but after a pretty fast boarding we were ready to leave for our first destination — Dubai.
￼
The food as well as the service on board were outstanding and so the hours until landing past in no time.  When we reached Dubai international airport we were already pretty exhausted but while we were rolling to our gate we got our first glance at the A380 in the flesh. That thing looks like a building with wings.
￼
The time we had to spend at the airport between flights passed pretty quick even though it was getting late and we were getting pretty sleepy – no wonder when you’re on the go for over 10 hours. When we queued in the boarding line we realized that we were going to fly with an A380 after all and seeing a man made construction like this getting ready for take-off and then actually leaving ground with you in it, is something we will probably never forget.  Because we were so tired, we pretty much fell asleep right after the lights of Dubai under us disappeared in the distance and when a nice stewardess woke us up for breakfast the sun was already rising over the horizon.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance. The ‘antibiotic apocalypse’ needs to be prevented, so action should be taken now!
Benelux Meetup at Wageningen UR
During the Benelux Meetup we attend an extensive workshop.
Citation Wageningen iGEM Team 2017
""""The goal of the workshop was for each iGEM team to get out of their expert point of view and discover what the needs or problems would be for the end-user of their project. The teams were to find out: What would it mean to use the technology in practice? Three to six people of each iGEM team were coupled to a small group of another team. Next, one team got to shortly explain their project as 'developer'. The other team was to ask questions as 'end-user' about how the use of the technology and its influence on their lives or work. After 15 minutes, the roles were reversed. The experts and alumni iGEM teams were also invited to participate.
- Wageningen iGEM Team 2017
Brainstorming
As described before, combating the development of antibiotic resistances was a project we thought worth working on. Nevertheless, we did not consider the application in fish farms as a feasible option anymore. So, we went back to brainstorming. Here, we thought about a new potential application: fighting (the formation of) biofilms, for example in industrial pipelines and on boat hulls. Additionally, we came up with ideas to remove biofilms from food and plants (Agrobacterium). Nevertheless, all these ideas either had a much easier and well-implemented chemical alternative or they were very questionable with regards to safety (i.e. containment of the genetically modified organism) and effectivity. Luckily, we ran into new possibilities!

Wellesley_TheTech,2015,Team:Wellesley TheTech#Team#Notebooks_-_-_TEXT.html," of work done today! We developed prototype for certain designs for our markers today. We also worked on our MarsTest program today.  We looked into the hardware of the marker recognition. So we experimented with laser-printed markers vs. inkjet printers to see if the quality of the markers actually influenced the recognition on the multitaction screen.  For a lot of the day, we tested out different marker sizes and found the optimal marker size for the screen. We also added functionality that allowed for up to four markers to be recognized by the screen.   We also played around with a keyboard widget to add into our program! This  was super exciting because in the future, users of our program will be able to add their usernames! We need to play around with this more. Every Thursday we also have a department wide talk during lunch.  We had two professors from the CS department talk as well as a physics professor and a math professor talk about their research. I really enjoy going to these talks because it’s really cool to learn about what professors are doing and the fact that even professors still do ongoing research! I really like learning about what other people from various concentrations of science do.
6/12/2015: Day 10
We created a new interface today. We came up with this really cute interface that asked users to pick their favorite flavor.  Once they picked their fruit, they can drag it into the flask and the flask is then tipped, another message pops up that says what flavor the user has picked.  We also had another google hangout call with Romie and Anja from the Innovation Museum. We are so excited that they are coming into the HCI lab this Monday! We showed them what we have done on the multi-taction screen thus far. We are so excited to brainstorm and collaborate with them next week.

Romie and Anja from from the Tech Museum came to Wellesley today. I was so happy to finally meet them and work with them in person.  They talked to us a bit about what the Tech Museum’s philosophy is and what they were looking for in their exhibit.  After they told us a little bit about their museum and their work, we proceeded to show them our current prototype programs we created for the past 2 weeks. We also then started phase 1 of brainstorming for what our exhibit will be and also what kind of experience we wanted the visitors of the museum to have.  We started brainstorming by using two broad parameters, Big Frame and Places.  Then we started to name anything that popped up"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic"

How It Works:
To create the antimicrobial calculator we found data on the levels of triclosan in selected consumer products, given in g triclosan/g products.   We also found data on the daily use rates of consumer products, given in g triclosan/day. By combining this information we were able to calculate the users’ “antimicrobial footprint,” in grams triclosan/day. The app will also give you this metric in grams triclosan/year.

Once media is cool, add other desired ingredients. Use the magnetic stirrer to mix, but do NOT add a stir bar now, or the media will be contaminated. (If one wasn't added before, you must do without.)
Pour agar into plates
Common additions include:
Ampicillin (stock 100mg/ml, final 100μg/ml)
Kanamycin (stock 50mg/ml, final 50μg/ml)
Chloramphenicol (stock 50mg/ml, final 10μg/ml)
To achieve final concentrations, add 1mL of stock per 1L of media, except for chloramphenicol, where 0.6mL per 1L of media is added instead.
Pour directly from the flask into sterile petri plates. Use a quick pass with a Bunsen burner flame to eliminate any bubbles that form during pouring. Do not subject the plate to continuous heat or the plate will melt, and the heat sensitive ingredients added in the previous step will be destroyed. Bubbles can allow cells to access nutrients without being exposed to the plate's antibiotic, and should be blown out immediately before the gel can set. It's a good idea for one person to pour while another flames bubbles.
Allow the plates to stand right side up overnight, or until the gel sets if they are needed sooner. Plates should be stored upside down to prevent condensation from falling on the media. Store petri plates in the plastic bags they ship in, in the 4 degree cold room.

After taking the samples at Pomposo Castellanos, we got in the car and continued our journey. The next point was located in the town of Villa de Acala, where there is more unregulated agricultural activity and a greater incidence of hazardous pesticide use. On our way to the Grijalva river, we found two children taking a bath in the water. We told them who we were and what we were doing and they came with us to the sample gathering.
We were told there has been raining a lot recently, this is why we couldn't use a boat to get to the center of the river. We decided to take the sample at the shore. Samantha measured the pH of the water and we found a pH of 8, indicating high levels of alkalinity and contamination.
Figure 9: Alan taking a water sample of Grijalva river at Villa de Acala.
We asked a man that lived in Villa de Acala about the activities done. He told us his people spent their lives dedicated to the primary sector of economy, fishing, agriculture and farming. Villa de Acala is also called Place of canoes.
Figure 10: Nora and Sofía asking about the main activities done in the village.
Third and last day, July the 26th
On our last day, we went under the bridge of San Cristóbal de las Casas highway, where a part of river Grijalva flows. We also travelled to Lagos de Montebello Natural Reserve, located near La Trinitaria town. We have been told that the color of the lakes of Lagos de Montebello Reserve have been changing for a while now, they are known for having a bright deep blue, one lake is even called Bosque Azul.
The team took the water samples from Rio Grijalva river under the bridge. It was a bit dangerous because we had to climb and go through a rough road. The pH of this location was 7.
Figure 11: Human Practices team taking water samples under the bridge.
Climbing all the way back to the top was difficult for us. We had to be extra careful because we were carrying the water samples inside a cooler. Martín Hernández was of great help because he had experience on those roads and he never took us out of his sight.

5/27 Messing Around with Silk Purification Products
Messed around with the supernatants from the wash step that contained that viscous liquid
Adding 1 ul of DNAse for 15 minutes, and rotating, followed by 15 min centrifugation at 10000 g seemed to get rid of the viscous substance.
This result substantiates that it was most likely chromosomal DNA. Next time I will add DNAse while doing the purification protocol.
As noted in yesterday's entry, the inclusion body solubilized in 3% SDS and stored in the cold room seemed to gel up overnight.

Then, Mingjun Zhang introduceed the primary responsibillities of members who want to participate in the competition. After that, some main contributions that iGEM has made to the development of synthetic biology were also introduced, including the construction of RSBP and some novel ideas raised from the competition. In addition, some achievements that the previous teams made were also included in this part.
At last, this speech was concluded with the introduction of our own project. Since the time was limited, we just introduced the basic ideas and the important progresses of our project. We also illustrated some of our results from experiments, human practice and wiki.
The talk was a big success, since the audience showed great interests in synthetic biology and the treatment of solid tumors. It also promoted the public awareness of iGEM among universities in Northeast region of China.
5.HUST-Cheering Meeting
5.HUST-Cheering Meeting
We always wanted to have a chance to communicate with iGEMers from other teams. During July 7th. – July 9th. , we attended a HUST-Cheering meeting in Wuhan. We were glad to have an opportunity to change our thinking about iGEM with other brilliant iGEMers in China.
The HUST-China team gave an excellent presentation. Their project focused on a new type of biological filter. They designed two ingenious plasmids that can work in prokaryote and eukaryon. This excellent team is also the sponsor of the meeting. They also held many other meetings to introduce the ideas of iGEM.
NCTU-iGEM team talked about a new protein they produced. They named it Pantide and it could be used as an alternative option as an insecticide by decreasing the efficacy of ion channels in lepidopterous larvae. Their presentation was really flawless, and they also talked about two biobricks they made.
NJU-iGEM team mainly introduced a plasmid that could produce hydrogen in prokaryote. The team members were very experienced researchers and we consulted a lot from them.
We also presented our project and many iGEMers gave us advices. They think our project is really interesting, and our modeling is really good. They gave us some advices on improving our experiment, and we are very grateful about that.

Paris_Saclay,2015,Team:Paris Saclay#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," the environmental samples contained various organisms (as demonstrated by the pre-test), so these three experiments are close to the environmental conditions (as the temperature or light fluctuation).
Figure 2.7 - Soil
We observed a large decrease of the number of living laboratory E. coli bacteria with time (100 to 1000 fold decrease between day 1 and day 9), for the three tested strains.
Figure 2.8 - Fresh water
Figure 2.9 - Sea water
For the freshwater and seawater environments, we observed a small decrease or a stability of the population of living laboratory E. coli bacteria with time. The results for the seawater environment is surprising, as it is has often be described that E. coli populations rapidly decline in this environment, although in some experiments, a lag time before the decline of the population of  up to 20 days has been observed. (Vaccaro et al., Am J Public Health Nations Health. 1950 Oct; 40(10): 1257–1266).
Conclusions
The experiments we conducted showed that during at least 9 days, laboratory E. coli bacteria can survive in environments as varied as the soil, the water of a pond or ocean water. We were careful in designing our experiments to try to limit as much as possible the factors that could bias the results  of our study (three E. coli strains tested)  and included all the control we could think of. We also noticed that in all the liquid conditions tested, a biofilm was visible from day 3. The fact that these biofilms appeared in conditions such as sterile water or filtered water led us to the conclusion that our E. coli strains can form biofilms, a property that is thought to be important for the survival in the environment (Vogeleer P et al., Frontiers in Microbiology, vol5, 2014).  We did not study here if DNA fragments could be exchanged between organisms, which could be a real issue, especially in case of a prolonged survival in the environment. Altogether, this experiment confirmed the necessity of elaborating physical and biological containments for GEO that could be released in the environment, either accidentally or for a specific application.
A special thank to Purificación López-García's team to explain the limit of our experiment and help in the process of making it. We also thanks the Philippe Bouloc's team (Signaling and Regulatory Networks in Bacteria) for the MCK and the help.

1. Extraction and electrophoresis of 9 plasmids cultivated on 4th.
Result: One light band of 2000bp and on dark band of 3000bp appeared.  As the length of recombined plasmids is close to 3700bp and the length of the original plasmid is about 2000bp, we suspect that the enzyme digestion is not complete.

UPO-Sevilla,2011,Team:UPO-Sevilla#Project#Epigenetic Flip Flop#Background_-_-_TEXT.html," states are thought to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. Nevertheless, some of the patterns that govern the switch between on and off of certain genes by chromatin remodeling have seen the light, allowing something new to start.
Epigenetics, as it has been demonstrated in cellular reprogramming, has opened a new era in our understanding of life and it is a new precious tool that will contribute to improve the treatment of many human diseases.
In previous works, there were used heterologous synthetic gene expression systems to demonstrate that spatial distribution of activators and repressors binding sites influences gene expression  resulting in monostable or bistable regulation of a promoter. ( Kelemen et al, 2010 ; Kramer et al, 2004 ) It has been demonstrated that if repressors bind both downstream and upstream of the coding sequence, the response is bistable, but if they bind only to one site, the response become monostable. ( Kelemen et al, 2010 ; Ratna et al, 2009 ) It has also been studied the behavior of repressors when they bind to specific sites and spread their inhibitory effect along the DNA.( Sedighi, 2008 )
Figure 1. (A) The steps involved in the reaction–diffusion model (from top to bottom): nucleation, autocatalytic recruitment, and nonlinear diffusion. (B) Evolution of the simulated concentration distributions of silencing proteins along a DNA segment nucleated at two sites. The internucleation distance was 1.2 kb.( Kelemen et al, 2010 )
In eukaryotic genomes, specific genes promoters are flanked by silencer sequences in a chromosomal region that control their expression. It has been observed that repression is distance and position dependent. Distance between upstream and downstream operator sites also regulate promoter activity. Moreover, heterochromatin context of genes, as those located near to centromeres and telomeres, seems to be important in gene silencing. ( Ratna et al, 2009 )

uOttawa,2017,Team:uOttawa#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," student advisor Danny Salem and the wet-lab team, more differential equations were generated with the purpose of finding out the dissociation, transcription, and decay/maturation rates based on the promoter gene sequence upon which sgRNA-dCas9 results would be calculated.
\begin{align} [\dot{\text{GEV}}_m] &= p_1-\gamma_m[\text{GEV}_m] \\ [\dot{\text{GEV}}] &= p_2[\text{GEV}_m]-k_1[\text{GEV}][\text{est}] \\ & \qquad +k_{-1}[\text{GEV}/\text{est}]+\gamma_p[\text{GEV}] \end{align} \begin{align} [\dot{\text{tetR}_m}] &= p_1-\gamma_m[\text{tetR}_m] \\ [\dot{\text{tetR}]} &= p_2[\text{tetR}_m]-k_2[\text{tetR}][\text{dox}]+k_{-2}[\text{tetR}/\text{dox}] \\ & \qquad -\omega_2[\text{tetR}]+\omega_{-2}[\text{tetR}]_{nuc}-\gamma_p[\text{tetR}] \end{align} \begin{align} \dot{[\text{Timer}_m]} &= b_0 \\ & \quad +b_1\left(\frac{1}{1+[\text{tetR}/\text{dox}]^n_{nuc}}\right)\left(\frac{[\text{GEV}/\text{est}]^n_{nuc}}{1+[\text{GEV}/\text{est}]^n_{nuc}}\right) \\ & \quad -\gamma_m[\text{Timer}_m] \end{align}
Based off these derived differential equations of binding parameters to the different sequences on the gene sequences, assumptions of steady state and constitutive expression of gene sequences can be made. Therefore, the 1st and 3rd equations simplify to:
\([\text{GEV}_m]^*=\frac{p_1}{\gamma_m}\) and \([\text{tetR}_m]^*=\frac{p_1}{\gamma_m}\)
With tetRm and tetR also at steady state (where N is a newly defined term to represent the simplification),

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html,"-approach pursues the creation of an organism as a „cassis“. A variable frame where every BioBrick can be introduced into the genome (Gibson et al. 2008).
The protocell creation approach seeks to build a new organisms „de novo“ after the „bottom-up-approach” (Luisi et al. 2006). Unlike the two other approaches the protocell-creation is not guided by an archetype (Boldt 2008).
These three approaches raise different ethical questions.
The ethical implications using the appellation of „living machines“ and „artificial cells“ will be elucidated. Focusing on the implicated hybrid-character of such designation, with regards of the relation between machines and living organisms and the deceptive idea of an “artificial cell”. Also the acquaintance arising from the determination between “artificial cell/living machine” is illuminated.
The term „living machine“ - a hybrid between machine and living organisms
Machine originates from the Latin term „machina“ and means „tool, artificial equipment“ and is defined as „a piece of equipment with moving parts that is designed to do a particular job [...]“ (Pons; Oxford dictionary 1884).
It follows that machines are designed for a particular purpose, according to the plans of humans and adopt a predetermined, defined and by itself immutable function. Machines are per definition not in the position to plan and conduct their behavior autonomically. They cannot change actions by themselves and can only operate in a certain way with the environment. Crucial characteristic for a machine is the autonomy but not the material, organic or inorganic (Deplazes 2011).
In contrast to the heteronomous machine stands life itself. The discussion about the concept of life in synthetic biology is a complex and wide-ranging field, where the difficulties of a definition lie just in the diversity of life. It is noteworthy that the researchers themselves are trying to find a suitable explanation, as it is an objective of synthetic biology to create new life (Deplazes / Huppenbauer 2009). Here is a brief description how researchers are trying to define life or alive.
After a minimal definition each organism is alive, which has an independent genome, has a cellular membrane structure and a sustainable and autonomous replication system (Endy 2005; Toepfer 2005).
The autopoiesis theory acts on a philosophical assumption when developing a concept of life. Living organisms differ from non-living organisms by ""[the fact that they are] the product of their organization […]. There is no separation between producer and product. Being and doing"
METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," very fast as the iGEM becomes a bigger organization.  Moreover, other data resources like NCBI can be imported to this application, hence the user group of application is gets bigger and bigger. In such a situation, extendibility of the application is vital. New data resources and new functions should be added easily.
Before starting to think about those, first we have to ask to other teams and iGEM headquarters about the BioGuide 1.0 to see the missing points in our idea, and to check our theories. Until developing this idea we were not using professional software approaches. We were planning our weekly tasks and doing those as in the notebook.
After finding a novel software project we have to change our approach. We have to use professional software development approaches to develop such an application to be able to state the requirements exactly and to use a common language between software oriented and biology oriented members in the team.
As we mentioned above, our software can be extended, and new data resources can be imported. The requirements are changing and the problem can be understood better in time.  Extreme Programming Approach is developed for such software projects. That is the approach we are going to use in BioGuide2.0

We use C++ as our programming language, cmake to manage our project, git to reversion control , yacc and lex to build our model file input assistant tool, Qt4 to build the GUI, Oracle dbxml as our Database manager system. Other wise, several 3-rd party open source software or tools are used in our iGame source code. Libsbml is used to deal with sbml file operations. Qwt and Qwtplot3D are used for simulation data visual system.  At the early stage of our project SBML Ode Solver and Sundials were our main ode solver to produce the simulation data from our sbml model file, because the latest SBML Ode Solver is 1.6.0, developed in 2005, which is out of date and fail to support the newest sbml Level 2 Version 4 standard. We succeed in updating the SBML Ode Solver 1.6.0 to support SBML L2V4, but some unfixed bugs was found, so we turn to a better ode solver copasi , which moreover can flexibly display the ode solver output data and modify parameter to adjust the simulation output data curve. Obviously, those open source library and tools convenient to our design and implementation and help us to focus on our  core working.

Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh,"

Alkaloid Isorhy Against Parkinson's
- It is rumoured to be a potential treatment for Parkinson's and it would make a good project if this were to be produced by bacteria
- On further research it turns out that the evidence for this drug as a treatment is weak and there is no information available about the gene or genes that encode it, so the idea was dropped (Text by Frank)

Vampiric Bacteria
-The aspect of a Vampiric bacteria that is designed to get rid of blood clots produced by trauma induced clotting or during complex medical procedures is intriguing.
-Expression of Hirudin is possible in systems such as E. coli. In 2007 Berkeley produced a chassis for a E. coli that could be introduced into the blood stream after inactivation. -However, it is difficult to have the non-viable cell lysis occur in the correct location and therefore an anticoagulant could just as well be injected into the patient. -For this to work, we would require an expression system that is able to express Hirudin (produced usually by leech salivary glands and has been successfully expressed in E. coli [1]), express anti-angiotensin (it is possible to express Fab fragments in E. coli [2]) and targeting the fibrin (can be done by expressing Tissue plasminogen activator). -The idea would be to have the chassis recognize a blood clot or an area of damage and prevent clotting and/or clear clots. A method for having the system recognize when to secrete hirudin would be by having the bacteria sense trauma related chemokines and have the chassis secrete the protein only when it senses above a certain threshold of these chemokines or we could try to express protease-activated receptors (GPCR) that are cleaved by activated thrombin (the target of hirudin). Direct application would only benefit over the use of leeches in that the chassis is more aseptic then a leech bite. The biggest issue remains the fact that for this to work we would have to inject the patient with living E. coli that can evade the human immune system.

ShanghaiTechChina_B,2016,Team:ShanghaiTechChina B#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," than half a year. Furthermore, 50% people get the diseases once or twice, while the rest suffer more often. Among all the intestinal tract diseases, diarrhea, bellyache and stomachache are the most common ones. In this part of survey, we mixed intestinal diseases and tract diseases intentionally, and we are surprised to see that only 50.69% of participants can distinguish one from another. However, people know about detailed intestinal diseases, i.e. 70.6% heard about IBD . They also know about common treatments of these diseases. 60.44% know about dietotherapy, 66.21% know the Chinese traditional treatment. Medicine and operation are the most known. 26.37% are conscious of fecal bacteria transplantation, along with the strict test it needs to run, which could be considered a disadvantage. The other advantages of tradition treatments mentioned by participants are pain (58.52%), immune system disorder (53.57%), drug allergy (52.2%) and others (i.e. slow effect). 64.19% of participants never came into contact with any propaganda or advertisement on intestinal diseases, and most (95.87%) of them feel it important to strengthen people’s comprehension of intestinal diseases.
In the second part we asked about gut flora. Most of participants believe the relationship between gut flora and intestinal to be symbiotic. Nearly all of them heard about Escherichia coli, while 49.18% knows Enterococcus faecalis.
In the third part we started propagating our project and gain feedbacks.
In conclusion, the result gives a proof of our initial conjecture that people are unconsciousness of the severeness of intestinal diseases, while they have been suffering from such things greatly. Besides propagating our project, we managed to make respondents aware of the differences between tract diseases and intestinal diseases and the detailed treatments to these. Consequently, we keep popularizing the knowledge in this field, as we always do.
Social Media
People nowadays spend a lot of time on social media, gaining information fragment by fragment. Subscription account on WeChat is a very popular form of social media in China. In the previous survey, our team found out that most Chinese know little about intestianl diseases and much more superficial about synthetic biology, many of whom having no idea what it is.
In order to create a window for our team to communicate with the world, our team applied and managed a WeChat subscription account, trying to share the knowledge of synthetic biology and trending news about medical treatment responsibly. This account recorded our progress and interesting comments about synthetic biology. The articles"

Intellectual Property Strategy
After confirming the patentability criteria and dismissing the risk of infringement, we discussed our IP strategy with experts in the field from the patent company, Groth & Co, and KTH Innovation (Figures 4 and 5).
Figures 4. Andreas, Blanca, Joanna (European Patent Attorney), Helena (European Trademark and Design Attorney), Stamatina and Chrismar after the meeting at Groth & Co.
Figure 5. Discussing our Intellectual Property strategy at KTH Innovation office with an European Patent Attorney.
We decided to apply for a patent in Sweden through PRV (Figure 6). Since Biotic Blue is a product invented by 20 students, the patent application was filed in the name of every single member in iGEM Stockholm. Therefore, the ownership belongs to the entire team, producing fair and equal grounds. Prior to the patent filing, all members signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to ensure confidentiality and compliance of the invention.
Figure 6. iGEM Stockholm patent registration.
Within the 12-month period after the filing date (the priority year), we will be able to add new findings to the original application. We also intend to file an international application through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to possess simultaneous protection in a large number of countries [27].
Once the invention is more developed, we will be able to conduct a Freedom To Operate (FTO) analysis. It is important to perform several evaluations in different stages of the project since FTO is not static and suffers changes over time. We will continue monitoring for emerging inventions that may be within the scope of Biotic Blue to ensure that no other party is infringing our protection rights.
Trademark Strategy
In addition to filing a provisional patent for Biotic Blue, we also aim to protect its trademark. A registered trademark will give us legally exclusive right of using the mark (Personal communication H Perneborg 15 Jun 2018) and will extensively help us build a valuable brand among our customers. Therefore, we conducted an initial search for trademark rights on the Swedish Trademark Database from PRV as well as on the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) trademark search. The search gave us the result of no existing trademark rights in the process, or in the current registration for “Biotic Blue”. Furthermore, to be eligible for registration, our trademark must be distinctive, must not be confused with another and must not describe what we sell [28].
Once we confirm Biotic Blue is accepted for protection, the trademark will consist on a"
Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html," El proyecto del equipo de Heidelberg está dirigido por el Profesor Dr. Roland Eils, de la Universidad de Heidelberg y el Centro de Investigación Alemana contra el Cáncer (DKFZ).
La biología sintética es un campo de estudio joven en ciencia que combina tecnología genética clásica con un enfoque de ingeniería. De un modo similar a la construcción de un avión, la biología sintética utiliza bloques simples de construcción genética para construir nuevos sistemas complejos con funciones distintas. Estos bloques de construcción genética son agrupados por iGEM en una base de datos y pueden ser utilizados por todos los participantes de la competición. Hasta el momento, la colección contiene más de 1000 bloques de construcción genética, gracias al continuo desarrollo de nuevas partes a lo largo de los últimos años. Durante el verano, todos los equipos trabajan en proyectos que ellos mismos desarrollan y que serán presentados a principios de Noviembre en el encuentro de Boston. Múltiples premios en diversas categorías serán otorgados.
El equipo de Heidelberg consiste en 15 estudiantes de la Universidad de Heidelberg y un estudiante de la Universidad Técnica de Darmstadt, todos ellos con diferente formación dentro del mundo de la ciencia incluyendo biotecnología molecular, biología y matemáticas. Los estudiantes reciben soporte y consejo de miembros del equipo de Victor Sourjik (ZMBH, Universidad de Heidelberg) y de la división de Roland Eils (Universidad de Heidelberg y DKFZ). El proyecto se lleva a cabo en el recientemente fundado edificio Bioquant, un centro para análisis cualitativo de sistemas biológicos celulares y moleculares.
El equipo de Heidelberg desarrolla una máquina biológica que es capaz de detectar y matar específicamente patógenos e incluso células cancerígenas. En un estudio piloto el equipo ha rediseñado genéticamente dos cepas de E. coli, logrando como resultado una cepa capaz de matar y una presa.
El sistema consiste en dos módulos, uno para el reconocimiento de la célula presa que representa el patógeno en la cepa matadora, y otro para el movimiento dirigido de la célula matadora hacia su presa. "

Ryan Ashley
Ryan James Ashley, at first glance, seems to be a quiet, unassuming fellow. Often referred to as “the only one who’s actually working,” Ryan is known for his unwavering focus, matched only by his superhuman productivity. Little did we know, however, that Ryan had all of us fooled. Ryan is impervious to pain, insensitive to temperature fluctuations, and unlimited in his capacity for retaining knowledge. He had mastered every martial art form in the universe by his twelfth birthday. Since then, he has looked to dominating the dance floor. Having already prevailed over the more exotic varieties, he can now be found salsa-ing his way into onlookers’ hearts at every turn. In his spare time, he has been known to traipse about the Norwegian countryside with an army of mountain goats.

Standing in the purple light of the cave, something seems amiss. The beautifully morose bass music that drew you here, almost against your will, has faded to a single, wavering note in the darkness. A figure is approaching, a calm grin just visible atop her slight frame. Suddenly, you are afraid. You raise your longsword just as your vision succumbs to a fiery halo; then, you open your eyes groggily. A scene from Skyrim flickers from the screen on Nupur's Thinkpad; yet, during your nap, ninety-six minipreps were completed, the lab reorganized, and the wiki redesigned and updated.

Tec - Monterrey  Meet Up
One of the most important aspects of science is the ability to share with others our discoveries and achievements, but also to establish communication with others to ask for advice or collaborate in different aspects of our projects. That is the reason this semester we held a Meet Up from April 30th to May 3rd at our school, Tecnológico de Monterrey. In this Meet Up, we received several iGEM teams from Mexico and Latin America who came to discuss more about customs regulations to facilitate the reception of material from abroad. We also had a session where teams got to learn about each other’s projects, received feedback from invited experts on the biotech field, and finally discussed the current state of synthetic biology in Latin America and the various ways open for improvement. During these days, teams were also invited to attend several synthetic biology workshops in FEMSA Biotechnology Center. We are thankful for the participation of UNAM-CU, UANL, TecCEM, TecCEM_HS, TecMonterrey_GDL, IPN and also for the participation from our neighboring teams from Honduras: UNA_Honduras and Zamorano.
Mexico: a new scenario for synthetic biology
Overview
A process is never easy. There is a long road to travel and many obstacles to overcome. The development of science in countries like Mexico and those in Latin America are a clear example of this. In 2006, the first Latin American team participated in iGEM. Mexico participated for the first time in 2007 along with only one other Latin American team. There has been great growth in the participation of our region, but when we compare ourselves to other countries and regions, we still aren’t close to their numbers.
We’ve come a long way but, can we go further? We believe that Mexico and countries in Latin America can continue on their road and let science and synthetic biology thrive. Our purpose is to understand more about the current situation in Mexico regarding scientific advance, its strong points and barriers, and ultimately strive to provide proposals to contribute to its progress.
Mexico is a country with a lot of potential for science development. However... students and researchers always confront many different problems that reduce the rate of progress.  The question is: why? What is still"

LACTOSE-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of three parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter,
the repressor-binding site outside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (blue) protein. Our construction uses the well-known lactose operon system [1].          Since there is an operator region that blocks transcription, it is necessary to know it and avoid it.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the blue fluorescent protein two conditions have to be met.  First condition: there is no glucose in the medium. Second condition: lactose is present in the medium (it also works with other inductors, like IPTG).
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: a lack of glucose promotes the formation of CAP (or CRP [2]), which binds to specific sites upstream of sugar-metabolizing genes and activates its transcription. The binding of this molecule depends on the presence of the allosteric effector cAMP  (the concentration of this metabolite changes in response to the presence or absence of different nutrients). Moreover, another condition is needed since LacI repressor, produced constitutively by the lacI gene inside the lactose operon, will bind to the operator region and will block the transcription unless lactose is also present in the medium. Once lactose enters the cell it is converted to allolactose [3], and this molecule binds tightly to the repressor so it can no longer block the transcription. Then, the fluorescent protein can glow in the cytoplasm!
How did we deal with this construction?

NTNU_Trondheim,2012,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," formation of a homo-serine lactone (HSL) compound from S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) and Hexanoyl-ACP (Hex). When both LuxR and HSL is produced, they combine irreversibly to form a complex which activates the promoter in front of the lysis device (BioBrick part <partinfo>BBa_K112808</partinfo>, designed by the University of California Berkeley iGEM 2008 team).
Detailed overview of our genetic circuit.
In order to have the presence of lactate activate the production of LuxI, we need a lactate-sensitive promoter . We chose the lactate-sensitive promoter found in the lldPRD operon of E. coli by PCR. However, the available literature indicates that this promoter is repressed under low-oxygen conditions due to the action of the ArcA regulatory protein. A possible solution is using site-directed mutagenesis to change the nucleotide sequence at the probable binding site of ArcA on the promoter to reduce its binding affinity and abolish its regulatory effect.
Challenges
The goal of making bacterial cells detect and attack cancer cells present several challenges. First, how can cancer cells be reliably and effectively detected? Early in the process after deciding on the goal, we considered using several human signalling molecules such as HGF and VEGF as cancer indicators, as these are known to be over-produced by tumors. However, we were unable to determine quickly if these would be able to enter and affect E. coli cells, due to their large size. In contrast, O2 and lactate are small molecules which are easily taken up by the cells, and are known to directly regulate the expression of various genes.
Parts
Promoters
To allow our system to work correctly, several different promoters are needed. Of these, the most simple is a constitutive (always on) promoter in front of the toxin-producing gene. For this purpose, we have extracted the BioBrick part <partinfo>BBa_J23119</partinfo> from the iGEM DNA distribution kit. Second, a promoter having higher activity at low oxygen levels, similar to those found in tumors. As a candidate for this function, the vgb promoter BioBrick part <partinfo>BBa_K561001</partinfo> was tested. Thirdly, a promoter that is activated by lactate, a possible indicator of tumor cells in the vicinity. We cloned the lldPp promoter of the E. coli lldPRD operon for this, as well as the corresponding promoter from Corynebacterium"

Figure 7.Insulin Price after government subsidy under the Insulin Access Program from the Philippines Department of Health. Citizens outside of major urban areas report difficulty gaining access to this program.[23]
Tanzania - Developing Nation with Developing Health Care System
According to the World Health Organisation, considerable progress has been made in Tanzania in recent years to better provide healthcare to its citizens, especially in remote areas. Crucial medications such as insulin are transported to the Central Medical Store, where they are distributed to those who can afford treatment or are lucky enough to come under the umbrella of a charitable organisation. [29]
“ Ludovic Festo, the young man being treated for diabetes at Mwananyamala Hospital, pays 10 000 Tanzanian shillings (US$ 5) a fortnight for his insulin
Diet and lifestyle changes are major contributing factors to the rise in diabetes prevalence inside the nation, but so is greater awareness and improved diagnosis. Dr Mavura Nurdin, head of the Diabetes clinic, says;
“We have 7 000 patients at Mwananyamala Hospital alone. We don’t always have enough medicines for all of them, so when we run out, we tell the patients they need to go and buy their insulin in a pharmacy, and pay the full price.” [29]
The Tanzanian government is currently working to implement a national healthcare system that takes contributions from citizens relative to their personal income. Ideally this would reduce dependence on other nations, but it will not affect the local price of insulin. [29]
Another problem stems from ‘counterfeit’ insulin (and other medications), as it can make the patient even more sick and directs them away from actual medication. The lack of government resources to invest in large-scale manufacturing makes Tanzania an ideal location to attempt the ‘bathtub insulin’ business model - however, as discussed elsewhere, this would be a regulatory nightmare.
Once again, the burden of action lies upon the Developed world to introduce efficiency into the manufacturing chain of this essential medication.
Figure 13.Tanzania is an excellent location for Insulin Redistribution charities like “Insulin for Life” to send excess vials. Contact them today if you are oversupplied! [21]

Sharing with our Community
This year our team had the opportunity to participate in several outreach activities both within our city and across our province. Being an Albertan team, it was easy to get people talking about the beef industry and the continual risk of E. coli outbreaks. In addition to talking to experts in the beef industry though, we wanted to carry our dialogue out into the community, to your everyday beef-consumer here in Alberta. Through our outreach activities, we got the opportunity to do just that. In addition to some new actvities such as our participation in Beakerhead, we were also able to continue to build some of the community relationships that we started last year, by continuing our work with the Telus Spark Centre and Genome Alberta.
With our ongoing collaboration with the Calgary Telus Spark Centre , we were able to interface with over 200 Calgarians who got to do some hands on science at our station. At Beakerhead , we got to be part of a five day science and technology festival right in the downtown core of Calgary. We got to showcase some of our work to industry and academia through continued collaboration with Genome Alberta .  Finally,  we ventured out of Calgary to Consort Alberta where we mentored their first ever high school iGEM team who took the prize for best human practices at the High school jamboree last spring.

Northeastern_Boston,2015,Team:Northeastern Boston#Open Source_-_-_TEXT.html," they can quickly be shared and fixed. This “peer review” creates a more robust program, often performing better than standard commercial software. In the field of synthetic biology some of the same principles apply.
The international genetically engineered machine competition is characterized by camaraderie and scientific cooperation. iGEM has evolved from a small independent study course at MIT, to an event involving hundreds of different universities and organizations. Much of this growth has been driven by the open source nature of iGEM. Students, professors, and industry professionals who are involved in the competition know the fruit of their efforts will become completely accessible to future participants. The competition supports the usage of other group’s research through awards. To qualify for a gold or silver medal a team needs to further characterize or improve the function of a previously submitted part. In doing so the competition has built a culture of working together for a common cause.
Outside of iGEM many companies and individuals are also supporting an open-source culture in synthetic biology by making their biological machinery or processes for editing organisms freely available. One example is DNA 2.0, a company which designed a series of fluorescent proteins using their own time and resources. The genes to produce these proteins were then released for public usage. This may seem unorthodox but it fits into larger business plan. DNA 2.0 provides a number of products and services such as gene construction, or design. An open source effort by DNA 2.0 could therefore spur innovation from others, and support commercial growth for both companies.
Almost every facet of human life has been touched by the advent of personal computing. We may see similar effects as synthetic biology moves past its beginning stages. Already the principles behind genomic editing are being used across many industries such as agriculture, energy, chemical synthesis or pharmaceuticals. Complex projects may involve the synthesis of dozens of different molecular pieces or use many engineering processes. In the beginning of the computer age a single person with enough time and knowledge could create functioning code, possibly for commercial gains. On the other hand, a biotech startup may face a host of problems if they want to move their idea from paper to process.  A company or individual interested in starting their own project will require significant capital. Computer code can be compiled and functionally tested in seconds. Genetic experiments may take weeks or months.
How the future plays out for synthetic biology will depend on how these issues are dealt with today. Certainly the argument is more complicated than open-source being “good” or “bad."" But, regardless, the continuing support for an open-source culture from organizations like iGEM could have serious ramifications for how people interact"

Tuebingen,2015,Team:Tuebingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," the GFP-trap offers an easy purification method for all GFP-tagged proteins, we wondered whether it would also bind to Dronpa, as it has a high structural similarity to GFP. We also tested the RFP-trap to see whether this might bind if the GFP-trap did not. Yeast cells were lysed and the lysate was added to the GFP-trap, as well as an RFP-trap and blocked beads as a negative control using the protocol provided by ChromoTek GmbH .
Figure 4 shows the resulting SDS-PAGE gel, stained with coomassie, of the positive control, Sec61-GFP. As we could not see any bound GFP after elution of all bound proteins from the beads, the lysis of the yeast cells may not have been efficient enough to retain the structure of the GFP or since the SEC61 is located in the ER it might be that the fusion protein is hyperglycosylated and cannot be recognized by the beads. As we did not have enough time to optimize the lysis protocol, we could not do any further experiments.
Figure 4: SDS-PAGE gel after GFP-trap purification.
Fluorescence microscopy
In order to assess Dronpa fluorescence we expressed Dronpa and NLS-Dronpa in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the pTUM104 plasmid ( BBa_K801004 ). Expression of the normal Dronpa protein and an NLS-Dronpa fusion showed different distribution of the protein throughout the cell (Figure 5). The circular arrangement of the fluorescence signal in the cells expressing NLS-Dronpa indicates that the protein accumulates in the nucleus and that the nuclear location sequence (BBa_K1680004) works as intended.

The iGEM teams of Chalmers University (Gothenburg), Copenhagen University, Southern Denmark University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology  (Trondheim) were invited. With the first three of those teams attending, 35 happy iGEM:mers met in Uppsala the 1-3 of September.
The schedule for the weekend combined social and scientific activites. The teams got to present and discuss their projects, discuss iGEM issues in workgroups and listen to presentations by Uppsala syntetic biology researchers. During the monday, we had invited Herbert Boyer, the first researcher to express perform a genetic cloning in 1973 and express a synthesized gene in 1977. He also held an open seminar, with about 100 attendees from the university faculty, about the history and development of genetic engineering.

Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#EricDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," to our model of the Nootkatone pathway we found that overexpression of Valencene Synthase is necessary to maximize the Nootkatone yield, while both alcohol dehydrogenase and p450-BM3 have only minor effects on the yield.
One of the hard problems, as shown in our penalty model is the toxicity of nootkatone and nootkatol. Since the toxicity most likely stems from both nootkatone and nootkatol clogging up the cell wall we present our peroxisome as a solution for this problem. When comparing the cytosolic model to our peroxisomal model we found that, if our assumption that neither Nootkatone nor Nootkatol are able to pass the peroxisomal membrane holds up, we can greatly increase Nootkatone production.
A further  problem is the influx of the pathway precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). We used OptKnock analysis to design yeast strains with optimized FPP production. With this analysis we got hints that growing the yeast cells on a fatty acid medium might be a simple alternative to  knocking out the desired genes.
Violacein
Working on a project is a process of well planned steps. It starts with an idea and theoretical research to create a design. When finally demonstrating the mechanism of the project it is important to point out the benefits with a suitable application.
Synthetic biology offers countless numbers of new opportunities, especially in the field of metabolic engineering. To testify some main parts of our artico project, we decided to relocate a metabolic pathway into yeast peroxisomes. There are several reasons why this approach fits perfectly as a proof for our concept.
Based on described of advantages of violacein this pathway was chosen. Violacein is naturally produced in numerous bacterial strains, most popular in the gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum . It is related to biofilm production and shows typical activities of a secondary metabolite (Seong Yeol Choi et al., 2015) .
Figure 8.1 The synthesis of Violacein requires five enzymes encoded by the VioABCDE operon. VioA, a flavin-dependent L-tryptophan oxidase and VioB, a heme protein, work in combination to oxidize and dimerize L-tryptophan to an IPA imine dimer. Hydrogen peroxide is released as a by-product of the VioA reaction. Next step by VioE is the rearrangement of the IPA imine dimer to protodeoxyviolace"

Introduction
As it is known to all, Sherlock Holmes is a famous detective. Based on synthesis biology, our team creates a smart system called Micro Holmes which can monitor the pollutant inside the water in real time. Once the system was founded, through users' laptops, smartphones or some other media, we would acquire the statistics of pollutant which has been analyzed by the system. Reforming the E.Coli, we endowed them with the ability of sensing the pollutant inside the water and delivering the message of it. Therefore, raising them inside the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), they can rapidly augment the voltage as soon as the polluted occurred. Then, by the automatically collecting and analyzing equipment, we can know the concentration of pollutant converted by the instant electric signal. Escherichia coli, a tiny but full of power creature, perfectly plays an important part as Holmes in our project. So, are you interest in how he was created and how he works?
First of all Mr. Holmes must has a piercing eye to find the trail of pollutant; And after detecting pollut"
Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," the reaction of society to it differs from case to case. As an example, scientific discoveries in the field of nuclear physics where treated as classified information having a high relevance for the national security as shown in the case of the Manhattan project 17 . A comparable censorship is not established in life sciences research apart of some cases when national security was endangered.
Another point concerning the threat arising from biological weapons is the absence of methods that can be used to monitor such weapons of mass destruction as pointed out by M.R. Dando. This fact and the increasing world-wide mobility would make it impossible to prevent the spreading of such weapons when once accessible to potential assassins.
Is a revision of basic research necessary in sensitive research fields?
The publication of research papers containing dual-use knowledge caused several people to call for regulation. In the United States, the so called Fink Committee evaluated the possibility that research in life sciences could be used for biological warfare purposes and how this could be avoided. 1
This committee had two recommendations:
To familiarize the scientific community with the dual-use problem in the life sciences.
To review experiments of concern. Experiments are of concern if they:
render a vaccine ineffective
confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or antiviral agents
enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a nonpathogen virulent
increase transmissibility of a pathogen
alter the host range of a pathogen
enable the evasion of diagnostic/detection tools
enable the weaponization of a biological agent or toxin
To review publications with a strong dual-use factor
To create a National Science Advisory Board
To improve the oversight and reduce unauthorized accessibility of hazardous gene material
To include the life sciences into the efforts for national security
To harmonize the international oversight over dual-use research
The implementation of these recommendations would be desirable, even though they might cause inconveniences for scientists working in the affected fields.
Conclusion
Include something in your project description and presentations that demonstrates that you have thought about how others could misuse your work.
For sure there is allway the possibility that knowledge to produce transgene viral vectors could be used to produce bioweapons. Therefor it was important for us to use a system that does not bear the risk that someone could use it for evil purpose. In the case of the Adeno-associated virus the very limited packaging capacity is the major reason that excludes it from the list of agents that could realistically be used for the pruduction of bioweapons. Even a fully replication potent AAV will depend on the coninfection of a helpervirus and is therefore not suitable for a fast"

The day we saw fluorescent colonies on our plates was definitely one of the best days of the summer. Unfortunately, we did not have access to a scanning electron microscope to be able to visualize GFP on our flagella. After combing through some literature, we developed two different protocols for isolation of flagella: one involving shearing the flagella with a Waring"
BostonU_HW,2017,Team:BostonU HW#LearnMARS_-_-_TEXT.html," is not guaranteed. The process may need to be repeated dozens of times to get a fully functional microfluidic chip.
These difficulties with replicating and testing microfluidic devices was experienced first-hand by the BostonU HW Team. While replicating chips from journal articles, similarly to our synthetic biologist, we noted three repeated issues:
Lack of thorough documentation of experimental procedures
High level of design specificity and a lack accessibility of design files
Lack of standard evaluation system to grade devices against
As a result, the final chip manufactured cannot be run correctly due to lack of protocol documentation. Additionally, it is not possible to use a quantitative system of evaluation to ensure the device is working as intended. We have classified these limitations as barriers in the “implementation” stage of the microfluidics workflow.
Our Project
The CIDAR Lab at Boston University has tackled many of these design and manufacture shortcomings with an easy to use software workflow, including last year's iGEM Hardware project Neptune , and a low-cost rapid prototyping manufacturing system Makerfluidics . However, this system does not address the barriers we had identified under “Implementation” which limits the accessibility of microfluidics to everyday synthetic biology labs.
This year’s iGEM Team, decided to focus on removing these barriers in the implementation stage of the workflow which led to the creation of our project MARS (Microfluidic Applications for Research in Synbio).
MARS aims to increase the accessibility and relevance of microfluidics to synthetic biology through three defined goals:
Increase the ease of access of microfluidics to synbiologists
Design chips relevant for day to day use in synthetic biology
Create a standardized method of evaluating chip functionality
These goals have been built on and expanded to create the three branches of MARS which are:
Microfluidics 101
The MARS Repository
Fluid Functionality

We discussed about iGEM JAPAN’s future initiative at this meeting. Setting up iGEM JAPAN was committed to making it easier for iGEM teams to communicate with each other. However, the interactions between the iGEM teams have been decreasing recently, and the only event that iGEM teams gather together this year is the meetup held at Tokyo Metropolitan University in August.
We had to seek a solution for this problem. At this meeting in Nagahama, iGEM JAPAN created a Facebook page. Our future plan is to make a website directed toward the outside.

Each team take turn to have a short presentation about their project and other teams will give them some advice to improve and some questions to innovate them.Then,           we divided into three groups Wet, Dry, HP to have a further talk about our passion and profession. We share our experience and observation of how to do things more smoothly and successfully.At the end, every one get a chance to taste one of           the most famous Tainan snacks-- Douhua (soybean pudding),ending this meet up sweet.
FEEDBACK
In the meeting, CSMU team asked us that how to culture E.coli in cold water,because our target aims to approve the water quality of aquaculture but the temperature often too low for E.coli to thrive.It was a good point for discussion and we had figured           out the way to improve our design.Our device was also challenged for its size and position.Also, we talked about the integrated HP definition,and got useful advice from each other.Their presentation and powerpoint design also widened our horizons           and motivated us to give better performance in the future.
For Other iGEM Teams
We thought this meet-up will be a good way to spark new idea,and gave a near-look of our project.Also, meeting brought conversation,forcing us to step out of our comfort zone.If you want to hold a meet-up like this, you can reserve more time for discussion           and invite teams who engage in different tracts (or the same tract if you want).

   iv. Threats:
        1. Well-established industries control the high-end markets with related products.
        2. Industrial chain is currently complete
        3. Technological applications are matured
b. Comments:
   Comparing to technology equipped by clinics and hospitals, The use of adjustable aptamer and genetic modified microbes made JACOB more economical, adaptable, and stable. The integration of automated proceeding made JACOB more user-friendly and portable. JACOB does not need professional physicians reading results, behaving like glucose meter but less risky. In China it is likely to be deployed in units of household or local communities. Similarly, for United States the Food and Drug Administration classified the core mechanism of JACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though, Chinese in vitro diagnostic market is relatively new and have few competitors. Those few players can no longer support the concrete increasing demand for medical cares. Chinese government had ratified a great number of acts as well as guidelines and simplified documents examining and approval process to encourage innovation in the field of medical devices, which offers our team a great market environment.
Wireframe Connects the Underlying Conceptual Structure
In market analysis we had solved many issues regarding our project background, but also generated more questions about operability.
To obtain a better answer, we had visited 北京永翰星港生物技术有限公司和博奥生物芯片公司.
We asked 蓝晶 mainly on how to construct a viable procedure to industrialize JACOB. Our plan for JACOB after the iGEM jamboree is divided into developments, commercialization, and resource transformation. For development we currently divided it into small, medium, large scale trial. Based on our current knowledge, small and medium trial is planned as below

Formularies
Formularies are national guidelines for the veterinarians, by the WVAB (Workgroup Veterinary Antibiotics Regulations) - KNMvD (Royal Dutch Society of Vetenary Medicine). These documents prioritize the antibiotics that can be given to treat a disease. Veterinarians are allowed to prescribe first choice antibiotics. The prescription of second- or third choice antibiotics need legitimate reason depending on laboratory results or monitoring activities.
Putting relevance into our design
When initialising mastitis treatment, it is of great importance to know that the infection is commonly caused by 6 different species of pathogens, the most harmful being Staphylococcus aureus (SAU) ( GD Diergezondheid, 2017 ). This pathogen forms the biggest threat to the cow’s health and is highly contagious. To treat mastitis, first choice antibiotics are first used. These antibiotics are shown in the table below.
Ranking prescription antibiotics  ( WVAB 2015 ):
First choice antibiotics: are used for empirical therapies. These antibiotics can be included in the farm treatment plan without further reasoning.
Second choice antibiotics: cannot be used except if there is enough reasoning to prescribe these antibiotics. These antibiotics can be limited included in the farm treatment plan.
Third choice antibiotics: can be used in exceptional cases. These antibiotics cannot be included in the farm treatment plan.
Fourth choice antibiotics: forbidden to use on food producing animals.

PEX19-dependent
ER-dependent
Experimental Work/Design
In order to test our hypothesis we fused the last 59 amino acids of the C-terminus of human PEX26 (AA 246-305) to a red fluorescent protein, to further elucidate the Pex3 /Pex19-dependent import. mRuby is generally used as a marker in combination with a fluorescent microscope to visualize the localization of the fusion protein. The C-terminus of PEX26 contains a helical signal-anchor, which serves as both, a mPTS and transmembrane domain. We designed our construct with mRuby2 fused to the N-terminal side of the PEX26 -C-terminus, this way the mRuby should face the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane.    Quite similar to our mRuby- PEX26 approach, we designed a construct for the ER-dependent import. Therefore, we fused the mRuby2 fluorescent protein to the N-terminus of Pex3 (AA 1-39). This construct should be N-terminally anchored in the peroxisomal membrane, with mRuby2 again facing the cellular lumen.
Our main goal is to introduce a rather complex membrane protein to the peroxisome that can alter specific traits. For that we fused the Pex3 N-terminus (AA 1-39) to a Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin protein (AA 16-262), replacing the first 16 amino acids ( Pex3 -BacR). The original archaeal bacteriorhodopsin acts as a proton pump by capturing light energy to move protons across the membrane out of the cell. The resulting proton gradient is subsequently converted into chemical energy.  Our assumption is that the first transmembrane segment determines the orientation of the following protein and that therefore due to the N-terminal anchoring signal the bacteriorhodopsin will be inserted in reverse orientation, pumping the protons into the peroxisome. This way the pH of the peroxisomal lumen could actively be controlled and adjusted.
Finally, our project involved combining the work of other subteams to verify the localization of our constructs in the peroxisome and analyze the effects they have on the import. Therefore, we are using the superfolded-GFP protein, another fluorescent marker, which is in our case fused to the peroxisomal import sequence PTS1, and a version of Pex11 that is fused to the"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Receptors_-_-_TEXT.html," cells for initial testing and stably integrated cells for final experiments and the later bioprinting experiments. As there was the need for such BioBrick-compatible vectors, we adapted the pDSG vector system (semi-stable, transient: BBa_K2170300 ) and the pcDNA5 vector system (stable integration using a co-transfected rekombinase: BBa_K2170301 ).
Semi-stable transfection of the receptors in human cells
For the first trials of testing our constructs in human cells, we chose the MEXi™ cell line for semi-stable transfection.  MEXi™ is a suspension HEK293E cell line that encodes the viral protein EBNA1 in it's genome. EBNA1 is a protein derived from Eppstein-Barr-Virus that mediates the viruses' replication initiation, gene regulation and maintenance of its DNA in the host cell. The second part of the MEXi™ system is made up by the pDSG-IBA vector, which carries the specific origin of replication that is recognized by EBNA1. EBNA1 binding to this origins results in the recruitment of the replication apparatus as well as inducing the maintenance of the inserted DNA in the host's nucleus, leading to episomal maintenance and co-replication of the plasmid during every division cycle. [15]
Thus, our receptor constructs were cloned into the pDSG-iGEM vector and used for transfection of MEXi cells using the PEI transfection method (see methods). Polyethylene imin (PEI) as a cationic polymer forms complexes with the negatively charged DNA. These complexes are taken up by the cell via endocytosis and carried to the nucleus. [16]

RMIT_Australia,2010,Team:RMIT Australia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"oprocess will involve heating the bacteria below the threshold of the thermolabile bond, then following clarification or polishing, heating above the threshold to separate the peptide from the Taq protein. The peptide and Taq may then be purified allowing two income streams from the manufacture.
Our project seeks to produce several unique parts for the registry: Firstly, a plasmid and system for producing Taq polymerase as a useful part for future iGEM projects undertaking PCR as part of their experiments., Secondly, an expression device will be provided to the registry that will allow peptides to be inserted easily and quickly by a process of ligand independent cloning into the device to produce any peptide at will, or even allow the rapid and economical production of a library of peptides for drug design and screening.
Project Details
Creation of the Taq Polymerase Part
Taq polymerase was chosen as a carrier molecule because of it's physico-chemical properties - most notably, Taq's thermostability at high temperatures; being able to fold and unfold repeatedly and through temperature gradients up to 95degC. Taq polymerase is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, using any DNA strand as a substrate and, conceivably, Taq expression levels within E.coli will be limited by toxic effects the protein will have when binding to genomic DNA and disrupting cellular functions. Fortunately, the natural polymerase function is not required for this project and so mutagenesis was chosen to knock-out DNA-binding, but retaining the favourable physico-chemical properties of Taq.
Using the ExPASy proteomics server the aliphatic index, instability index, extinction coefficient and theoretical isoelectric point were determined to distinguish mutations that increase the thermostability and through literature research, amino acids which are essential for catalytic activity of Taq were identified and these mutations to inactivate polymerase activity and reduce DNA binding were chosen: N485V, S515L,  K540L, R659I and K663L. Mutating these residues would render Taq incapable of polymerase activity but retain thermostability. Mutations to enable ligation independent cloning (LIC) were added to the N and the C terminus (see LIC section for more information), along with the prefix(P) and the suffix(S). These mutation were incorporated into Taq sequence to produce the mutTaq sequence (see modeling for more information). The sequence was then sent to Mr. Gene (Gene Art) for the production of the (pMA-RQ) vector containing the muTAQ sequence conforming to standard 10 cloning (below is a pictorial"

The simulation results are supported by the substrate screening experiments, adding the value of predicting the effect of substrate uptake rates on growth behaviour.
We fulfilled purpose 2: using Flux Scanning based on Enforced Objective Flux (FSEOF) simulations. We identified the short list of genes that could be amplified to optimize beta-carotene production.
The results will serve as excellent starting point and guidance for future genetic engineering efforts in the lab.
Theory
As annotated whole genome sequences become common, It is possible to reconstruct a genome scale representations of the metabolic network as a computational model. The GSM has information on what metabolites are in the cell, which reactions each metabolite takes part in, the stoichiometry of the reactions, reactions’ rate limits, reversabilities, charge balances, genes associations etc. Each organism has its own GSM, containing its specific metabolites, reactions and genes.
The living organisms must abide by certain constraints or limitations, such as mass balance, limitation of nutrients in medium etc. The different types of constraints are explained in Price et al.'s paper from 2004 1 . These constraints can be modeled in GSM by setting balanced equations and limiting reaction rates (fluxes).
Setting different constraints on the fluxes allow us to define different cultivation environments. We can set some fluxes to certain levels to simulate a specific environment, or gene manipulation, allowing us to simulate the Wild-Type’s (WT) and/or Mutant’s growth behaviour in that specific environment.
We have algorithms from literatures which help us to perform these simulations. The algorithms are implemented in Cobrapy extension Cameo and Matlab’ Cobra toolbox, some functions are modified by our team to better suit our needs. The algorithms include FBA (flux balance analysis) based PHPP(PHenotype Phase Plane), and FSEOF (Flux scanning based on enforced objective flux). In the next sections, we will tell our story on how we used these algorithms to achieve our goals of exploring Y.lipolytica growth and predicting gene manipulations to achieve better beta-carotene yield.
Using FBA to Calculate Steady-State Flux Distribution
Most GSM problems are solved using the flux balance analysis (FBA).  It formulates a constraint based optimization problem from the constraints we defined for the GSM. If solved, FBA reveals the flux distribution within the metabolic network. FBA assumes the network is in steady-state, which means the concentration of metabolites are not changing and in balance. The other constraints are lower and upper bounds on feasible fluxes of various reactions."
