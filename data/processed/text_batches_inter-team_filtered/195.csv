Juan          Jose Diaz
I'm studying the last year          of Microbiology in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. This moment          I'm doing my thesis about artisanal cheeses in Honduras. I can't say more about          my investigation but If you want to know more about my thesis, you can write me          an e-mail.
I love everything about          Genetics and for that reason I'm a team member of iGEM UNA_Honduras. And my          hobbies are: going to cinema, listening to music and hanging out with my          friends.

My name is Ricardo, I am a biology student at UNAH and          a proud member of the IGEM UNAH team. During my leisure time, I enjoy          practicing many kinds of sports, like football, basketball, and tennis. I am          also passionate about dancing, especially latin rythms like salsa and bachata,          and of course, I also have a geek side obsessed with videogames. I joined iGEM          unah as a way to acquire a new vision towards a brighter future, both for          myself and my country.
Juan David Sifontes
I’m studying Biology in the          UNAH. In a future I would like to study Molecular Biology or Genetics. I hope          to continue this project next year because I see future to help my country with          Synthetic Biology to resolve real problems what affect the population of my          country.
My hobbies are: playing the          guitar, listening to music and hanging out with my friends. My interesting          areas are: Zoology, Genetics and Biotechnology.

For our experiments we cloned the gene synthesis of the NM region of Sup35 into pSB1C3 and used site-directed mutagenizes to construct the part BBa_K2201231 containing a His6tag, one amber codon at position 21 and a cysteine codon at position 121. The control BBa_K2201232 contains cysteine codons at positions 21 and 121. In addition, we constructed these three parts also with a T7-promoter and RBS ( B0034 ) ( BBa_K2201331 and BBa_K2201332 ), for the inducible expression of the Sup35 variants.
Expression and Analysis of the Sup35 Test Protein
The expression plasmid of Sup35 containing one amber stop codon at position 21 (BBa_K2201331) was co-transformed with the evolved PylRS synthetase for the incorporation of PrK (BBa_K2201201) .  The cells containing both plasmids were cultivated like described in expression of recombinant proteins, without PrK in the medium and with 1 mM PrK in the medium. Sup35 was purified through Ni-NTA chromatography . As positive control Sup35 without stop codons was expressed and purified the same way. All three samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: SDS-PAGE of the eluates of the three cultivations to check the incorporation of the ncAA PrK. The positive control (PC: BBa_K2201332 ) left and BBa_K2201331 without PrK (-PrK) in the media in the middle and with 1 mM PrK (+PrK) in the media on the right side. Information to the marker can be found here .
The SDS-PAGE confirmed the results from our screening system. The positive control showed a high expression of the recombinant Sup35 and both samples with BBa_K2201331 showed a band on the same height (~28 kDa) as the positive control. This proved that the PrK-aaRS incorporates endogenous amino acids if PrK is not supplemented in the media. But if PrK is present, the expression of Sup35 seems to be increasedr. The affinity of PrK-aaRS to PrK seems to be"

Since we need to express proteins in C. elegans, introns should be added to achieve a good expression level of proteins. The part … is reporter mcherry (a kind of red fluorescence protein), we get the sequences of mcherry and add introns.
The mcherry part we use is optimized for C. elegans and performs excellently under confocal microscope. The whole neuron with dendrites can be observed distinctly. We can even observe the branch of dendrites near the arrow.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Propagation_-_-_TEXT.html," optimum beginning time of advertisement;
The applied range is so wide that it can be used in almost any advertising propagation of newly emerged problem;
The basic thought of our model is rigorously derivate and is theoretically accurate.
Our model has the following disadvantages:
It is hard to get the initial propagation speed V0 because their strong relation with the problems themselves. We have to do some trial experiments of the propagation to get these data;
We have ignore the change of public attitude towards such issue;
In practical, we had better test the consumer behavior reaction of different advertisement and duration;
The intensity of the advertising propagation is actually not a constant;
We have not make a table to represent the V1and Q(t) at different t, which will be helpful for us to choose.
Future Work
Our model can be improved in the following aspects:
Consider the conditions when some products are advertised before emerged but predicted by some scientists
We can also take into our consideration the case when the problems are advertised many times to enhance its effects to be aware by the public
To make our model better, we have also provide the following advertisements to evaluate the effects of different advertising propagation:
To adopt the study on mass behavior and mass psychology including the effects of celebrity influence, the distribution of public preference and their major ways to get information. With the analysis on such subjects, we can establish many better models.
We also put forward the evaluation number of advertising effects (AET), the definition is listed in equation (11)
In the equation, A stands for the number of people who have seen such advertisement and also paid attention to the problem. B stands for the number of people who have not seen the advertisement but paid attention to the problem. C stands for the number of people who have seen the advertisement but have not paid enough attention to the problem. D stands for the number of people who have not seen the advertisement and also not paid attention to the problem.
We also propose the function of proportional benefits to assess the effects of proportional benefits of the advertising propagation. The definition is listed in the equation (12)
In the equation, B is the function of proportional benefits, s1 means the speed of propagation before the advertisement. s2 means the speed of propagation after the advertisement. r means the social welfare rate created among the public, p is the cost of propagation.

Spent most of my time in the lab this week performing analytical restriction digests on transformed biobricks and transformed plasmids from Lisbon. We have had varying success shown in the lab book but will need to repeat some next week.I also saw how to perform minipreps and nanodrops.
Outside of the lab I have been sending out e-mails to biotech companies for sponsorship which will be followed up with calls next week. We have also been contacting various environmental, political and legislative organisations in order to have representatives for our debate in August.

Participated in the team meetings about more effective lab planning for the next few weeks. We talked about the cloning strategy in detail and developed an idea of future lab plans. Going to take responsibility for allocating lab weeks to people and having an outline ready for each weeks lab agenda before beginning the lab work for the week.  Participated in human practice meeting and discussion about obtaining speakers for the debate.  Went with Edo to a few talks at the origin of life conference and later to the talk by Adam Rutherford. Spoke to him about our project, gave him a business card and invited him to be a speaker at the debate which he was quite receptive to.

What We Did
This year Tsinghua iGEM team works on a human practice based approach to contructing a targeted gene therapy vector. In order to synthesize a targeted gene therapy vector with as more advantages as possible, we conducted several brainstorming meetings and finalized our whole project design via synthetic genome approach.
Furthermore, we hope our designed targeted gene therapy vector accords with the standards of BioBricks, so that it can be further explored by future research. Thus, we designed, constructed and characterized a BioBrick composed of cell-specific peptide, adenovirus fiber shaft and RGD domain, which we termed Targeted BioBrick .

About Tsinghua
Tsinghua University was established in 1911, originally under the name “Tsinghua Xuetang”. The school was renamed ""Tsinghua School"" in 1912. The university section was founded in 1925. The name “National Tsinghua University” was adopted in 1928.
The faculty greatly valued the interaction between Chinese and Western cultures, the sciences and humanities, the ancient and modern. Tsinghua scholars Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, Chen Yinque and Zhao Yuanren, renowned as the ""Four Tutors"" in the Institute of Chinese Classics, advocated this belief and had a profound impact on Tsinghua's later development.
Tsinghua University was forced to move to Kunming and join with Peking University and Nankai University to form the Southwest Associated University due to the Resistance War against the Japanese Invasion in 1937. In 1946 The University was moved back to its original location in Beijing after the war.
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the University was molded into a polytechnic institute focusing on engineering in the nationwide restructuring of universities and colleges undertaken in 1952. In November 1952, Mr. Jiang Nanxiang became the President of the University. He made significant contributions in leading Tsinghua to become the national center for training engineers and scientists with both professional proficiency and personal integrity.
Since China opened up to the world in 1978, Tsinghua University has developed at a breathtaking pace into a comprehensive research university. At present, the university has 14 schools and 56 departments with faculties in science, engineering, humanities, law, medicine, history, philosophy, economics, management"

Activate the Gal1 promoter. After that, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated.
2)   Step two
Cultivate two groups of yeasts together. (one is SynⅩ-dUra-416, the other is normal BY4741 MATa) If the MTS has been accomplished (SynⅩ-dUra-416 can become MATα), the two groups of haploids can mate with each other and become diploids.
3) Step three
Test the results of mating by PCR method. We designed the primers for both MATa locus and MATα locus. The amplification of both MATa locus and MATα locus indicates that the yeasts has turned into diploids, the MTS has been achieved in other words.
According to our design, after activating the Gal1 promoter, the expression of HO gene in the SynⅩ-dUra-416 can be initiated.
Then we cultivated two groups of yeasts together. (one is SynⅩ-dUra-416, the other is normal BY4741 MATa) If the MTS has been accomplished (SynⅩ-dUra-416 can become MATα), the two groups of haploids can mate with each other and become diploids.
To test whether MTS has happened, we selected some colonies in the selective plates (Sc-Ura ) and adopted PCR method. With designed primers for both MATa locus and MATα locus, the amplification of both MATa locus and MATα locus can indicate that the yeasts has mated with each other, and turned into diploids, in other words, the MTS has been achieved.

Modeling
Modeling proved to be an invaluable tool during both the design and testing phases of our CUTSCENE project.  In order to construct this complex recording circuit, we needed to understand not only steady state outcomes, but the dynamics of the system as well.
We tackled this challenge by breaking down our key goal (i.e. does CUTSCENE work as intended?) into smaller questions, focusing on both storage and retrieval of our signal of interest. As a direct result, our group was able to update the design of the system and gain insight into a variety of performance testing methods.
Acheivements
Built an accurate model of the base editing system using a variety of recursive bayesian estimation techniques, including extended kalman filter and particle filter methods
Used initial readout predictions to improve the design of our system and induce a more digital behavior
Extended 2017 British Columbia’s cas9 off-target modeling by expanding the scope to include base-editing mistakes

Questions about Recording
Can we accurately model the recording circuit?
Because the cas9 base editor lies at the heart of our recording system, it was essential that we understood it's dynamics and regulators clearly. The first step we took in designing a model for this component was specifying all major elements and relationships. The binding kinetics for cas9 and DNA are not fully known, but have generally been broken down into the following stages: PAM recognition, DNA melting, R-loop formation, DNA cleavage/mutation, and dissociation DNA dissociation [Salis, Raper, Mekler].  To simplify our interactions, we chose to combine the first three into a single binding step. The point mutation and subsequent dissociation are also combined into a single step, since it is known that unbinding is rate limiting. We choose not to use the Michaelis-Menton type equations for enzymatic reaction since it assumes that substrate exists in much larger quantities than enzyme. In this scenario, we also assume that both the promoter for cas9-base editor and its associated gRNA are turned on, leading to a constant production rate.

⇒ Subcultured 500µL of both DS1-Y (YFP) and BW35001 (GFP) in separate elm. flasks with 50mL of fresh LB and 1mM IPTG to induce them. About 3 hours later, each cells were harvested via centrifuging and resuspended in 50mL of 1X PBS separately.
⇒ Removed hybridized microarrays from the hybridization solution and inserted microarrays into fresh 1X SSPE solution in a tube for 3 min, and the same washing step is repeated one more time; each time during washing the tube was gently shaken. After the 2nd wash, the microarrays are transfereed to fresh 0.25X SSPE buffer for 30s. Then, microarray #5022 is dipped into the PBS solution with LOZ transformed GFP cells and #5023 into the PBS with LOX transformed YFP for an hour. After an hour, each microarray is rinsed with 1X PBS + 50µM Zn + 0.1% v/v Tween20 to wash off unbounded cells. When rinsing is done, the microarrays are flicked and gently centrifuged to remove excess solution.
⇒ Both microarrays are scanned with GenePix 4000B with .gal file to analyze the scanned image, but no observable image is scanned from both slides. Then the slides were taken under the fluorescent microscope, but either microarrays showed any fluorescent cells on the surface.
⇒ It seems that the transformed fluorescent cells were unable to attach to microarrays successfully, yet we plan to repeat the experiment again before the Regional Conference in Indianapolis, IN.

iGEM Teams Worldwide
Many people and organisations are trying to reach the general public on social media by posting on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook or Instagram. Our team is not an exception and we also have those accounts. But one of the most entertaining experience was to be a part of project @igem.teams.worldwide on Instagram, created by team Toulouse INSA-UPS. The main idea of the project is that various iGEM teams can manage this Instagram account for a week and introduce themselves by showing their casual life, laboratory issues and everything they imagine. We also had such an opportunity from 9th to 15th, July and it was a pleasure to share some brilliant daily routine moments, receive supportive comments about SynDrop project, gain more followers on our own Instagram account, and present Lithuania at once. It was not only an entertainment or a possibility to familiarize ourselves with other teams and their projects, but it has also induced our creativity in order to present ourselves differently.
iGEM goes green Survey
Last year team TU Dresden 2017 initiated the project “iGEM goes green” intended to share the ecological improvements of their work. This year the team didn‘t take part in iGEM but team METU_HS_Ankara was so impressed by this idea that they decided to continue the project this year. After agreement and permissions from team TU Dresden were given, team METU_HS_Ankara has sent a Lab Poster and “iGEM Goes Green Guide” to us which were placed in our laboratory. Also they asked to enter our data on GHG Emissions Calculator, as well as share it in Lithuania widely. That helped us to turn our community’s attention to the environmental impact of a daily working routine and share eco-friendly thoughts in Lithuania too. For more information about the movement visit team METU_HS_Ankara page.                  https://2018.igem.org/Team:METU_HS_Ankara
Exchanging self-designed postcards
In June we received an invitation from team Duesseldorf to exchange self-designed postcards between iGEM teams. The idea was to bring synthetic biology closer to general public by sharing other teams‘ postcards in our neighborhood and events. We had to send 100 postcards to Dusseldorf with the image on the front and a small piece of text on the back describing the idea of our project. As you may presuppose, we designed a liposome with the Iron Wolf, the main symbol of"

Field research
To promote our project and seeking professional advice, we paid a visit to wastewater treatment plant at Hsinchu Science Park. During visitation, we learned more about how industry purify and recycle wastewater. After discussion with professionals, we improved our device so that it can be integrated into current industrial wasterwater treatment.
Questionnaire
We designed a questionnaire to survey public’s knowledge about PFCs. In the questionnaire we inserted multiple video clips and news introducing PFCs and synthetic biology.
Let the public be aware of the danger of PFCs and promote our project at the same time.

The strong difference of the binding affinities between the P39K mutant and the wtTetR, might be due to the altered recognition of the P39K. This mutant was shown to have  a new recognition specificity for the tetO-4C operator in Helbl et al, 1998 .

UIUC-Illinois,2012,Team:UIUC-Illinois#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
Our new biobrick parts do not raise any safety issues. The protein that we work with binds site-specifically and cleaves single stranded RNA, which means that its safety is approximately equivalent to that of restriction enzymes. The PUF protein itself is harmless in the environment.
In addition, the PUF gene is not cloned into mammalian expression vectors, so it cannot be expressed even if it were to enter mammalian cells. Our gene does not produce any toxins, and the organisms that we used to test our gene are not infectious. In the unlikely case that the PUF gene were to be expressed in mammalian cells, it could have potential translational modification effects.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Our research work was conducted in the Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB) on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. This institution and its researchers must comply with the guidelines set forth by the Office of Safety and Compliance (OSC). Thus, we were required to complete three web training modules online before beginning laboratory work. Two web training modules were produced by the Division of Research Safety (DRS) on campus, and one was produced by the IGB itself.
The two modules administered through the DRS dealt with general laboratory safety and biosafety. The biosafety training module was sufficient to prepare us for work in our level two biosafety laboratory in the IGB. All team members passed these training modules, and records of training completion were retained by IGB staff. In accordance with its standards, the OSC also trained us to use any potentially hazardous equipment. We worked closely with IGB faculty and staff advisers who monitored our progress with understanding of safety requirements. Overall, our team members made efforts to comply with the safety regulations of our institution to make sure our work did not present any safety hazards to ourselves or those around us.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
In the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, it is of utmost importance that safety standards are updated as technology advances. In future years, iGEM projects will become not only more complex, but more commercially viable. Safety within in the laboratory, within society, within industry, and perhaps even within the body all must be carefully considered. In order to deal with these magnitudes"

Week of 5/23/2011
Design Team:
Started collecting sequences of relevant fluorescent proteins and entering them into GenoCAD.  Learned about attribute grammars.
Fabrication Team:
Lab Training.
Characterization Team:
Started looking at model, ways of analyzing data that we'll eventually get, and fitting model to it.  Started training on microscope, cell culture.  Started learning Matlab for GenoSIGHT changes.
Week of 5/30/2011
Design Team:
Created first draft of attribute grammar.  Collected more fluorescent proteins for GenoCAD.  Started looking at modeling aspect of project - explored modeling software that can handle SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) input - Matlb Simbiology looks nice.
Fabrication Team:
We were split into two teams to work autonomously on Miniprep procedure for plasmid DNA extraction and SalI and EcoRI restriction digests of mCherry and pDSRed.
Characterization Team:
Started looking at parameter estimation - methods of getting maturation and degradation rates from fluorescence over time data.  More Matlab training.  More microscope training, in preparation for real experiments once fab team finishes transforming some cells.
Week of 6/6/2011
Design Team:
Small changes to grammar (fixing stop codon issues) and big changes to grammar (changing how parts are ordered and thus how GenoCAD constructs the sequence of a construct we make).  Looked further into modeling, how our attribute grammar will connect to that.  Collected more fluorescent proteins, started to look into degradation tags and linker sequences for fusion proteins.
Fabrication Team:
We were split into two teams to work autonomously on Miniprep procedure for plasmid DNA extraction and SalI and EcoRI restriction digests of mCherry and pDSRed.

Started working on Prolog compiler which will take a construct from GenoCAD and use it to write a Java file, which will in turn write an SBML file for modeling (this is a good way to do it, we promise).  Carefully documented gene sequences"
Carnegie_Mellon,2015,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," networking with organizations around our area. We typically participate in various community events such as the Hill District Back to School celebration and Carnegie Science SciTech Days in order to reach out to kids.
How are the Mentor-Mentee relationships?
Mentor-Mentee relationship between students and teachers which develops naturally. Karri Ann, one of the teachers of New Citizens Science Lab forms bonds with kids. They do not force such relationships. Typically on the first day, kids don’t want to be there, however when they start hands-on activities, they gravitate toward the teachers and want to learn more.
Are there any limitations to the lab?
There are several that can be aided through more funding, which I am currently in the process of completing. One such limitation includes construction problems and delays. Getting the lab up and running in time is a challenge with choosing the right easy-to-use equipment and setting everything up. We want to ensure everyone has what they need at a lowered cost given the incredibly high costs of the equipment. There is also a large equipment room with not much use. The lab also has no access to fume hoods, which can pose a huge safety concern as well as no -80°C freezers. This is a normal limitation for biology labs as competent cells normally need to be stored around this temperature. To maneuver around this limitation, we use a liquid nitrogen dewar instead, which can also be costly.
How have our fluorescent proteins assisted your lab?
We have used the fluorescent proteins a few times. We did DNA transformation experiments at high schools where we would plate Calcium Chloride transformations to get orange and red colonies. We produced GlowGerm which are petri dishes that go on top of pieces of paper with a logo and take these fluorescent bacteria and use cotton swabs to trace images. The students love the glowing image at the end.
What goals do you have for the future of the lab?
We would like to help people understand simple biological skills. For example, being able to conduct in-house sequencing rather than using an outside service such as Retrogen. We would like to try to provide an environment for the Maker’s Movement to exist in biology, of course within the constraints of Homeland Security. We would want to expand our name and be open to everyone who wants to use it, not just students. We would like to expose individuals to STEM fields, especially individuals from disadvantaged communities, which would help change the demographic of such fields. Ultimately, we would like to be that transitioning role to support and develop new ideas and expand the use of such creations. Teaching students about biological literacy, such as what things are, can"

Biological solutions: Nematode populations have been declined by biological microbes- mainly by two parasitic fungi, Nematophthora gynophila and Verticillium chlamydosporium, which attack the developing female on the root surface.  95 to 97 % of the females and eggs are destroyed (Kerry, Crump and Mullen, 1982). Thus the natural control of cereal-cyst nematode in a range of soils is predictable and effective, but slow acting.
See: http://www.fao.org/docrep/V9978E/v9978e0b.htm for a list of potential biological agents and their shortcomings
The two most problematic species, the root-knot and cyst nematodes, infect roots of plants and feed off of their tissue. Nematodes are known to find food by chemotaxis and one type of bacteria, Bacillus nematocida, attracts nematodes by secreting volatile organic compounds and is then ingested by the worms. When it adapts to the intestine, it secretes prote"

Will It Work?
So, will our project be realistically applicable? With this in mind, we met with two well-known individuals in Hong Kong society. Professor Albert Yu and Professor Juliana Chan helped us to understand our project at a whole new level. As a scientist and an entrepreneur, Prof. Yu identified the issues that we need to consider if we want to see our project used as a biotechnology product. Prof. Chan, a medical doctor and an expert in diabetes, provided us with deeper insights on diabetes and the possible application of our project to fight diabetes and obesity.
Interview with Professor Albert Yu
Professor Albert Yu is the chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO), and is also a professor of the Department of Neurobiology in Peking University, China. As an entrepreneur and a scientist, Prof. Yu gave us realistic insights to our project. Meeting Prof. Yu helped us to evaluate our project beyond the laboratory environment and to think about its application as a biotechnology product. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the bioethics and biosafety issues regarding synthetic biology.
Interview with Professor Juliana Chan
Professor Juliana Chan is a professor of medicine and therapeutics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). She is also director of the Hong Kong Institute of Diabetes and Obesity, CUHK, co-director of CUHK-Prince of Wales Hospital International Diabetes Federation Centre of Education (IDFCE), and chief executive officer of the Asia Diabetes Foundation. With extensive knowledge on diabetes, obesity and clinical practice, Prof. Chan brought to our attention practical aspects of developing treatments for medical purposes. Meeting Prof. Chan helped us to understand more about the biochemistry of diabetes. Also, by giving us information on current treatments for obesity and diabetes, she allowed us to consider our work in context. Towards the end of the interview, we also talked about the regulations for the development of new treatments in medical fields.

Networking: our objective is that people share knowledge, make comments about science and about everything they would have learned throughout the day. We want to create opportunities for students and bidirectional communication as well as connections with our special guests, increased confidence, respect, and excellence.
Promotion of the forum by the development of the Official Announcement, as well as a first look at the propaganda that was shared on our social media. Here we attach the flyer we made to invite people to our forum!
Fulfillment of the event, where we carry out months of planning and see results. For a matter of time and logistics at our university, the 4th step is forthcoming. The forum will be hosted at Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Chihuahua, our university in 2019 and we expect an outreach of 100 attendees.
Forum's Objective
What we are looking to receive with this event is to invite people to get interested in topics such as synthetic biology and to wake up their curiosity for science. To achieve this, we planned this forum with the objective of creating competencies in our attendees and to observe how synthetic biology lights up future scientists' hearts.
ERA for GMOs
Science evolves every day without even noticing it, so there has to be laws and protocols that regulate what new technologies do. After participating in the developing of Topic A in MEXMUN 2018, we got concerned about what synthetic biology could do without regulation. With this in mind, we decided to get informed about biosafety and how access to technologies is pertinent to the sustainable use of biological diversity.
When we were planning activities for our Education and Public Engagement and Integrated Human Practices, we searched for past iGEM members in order to receive mentoring. To achieve this, we scheduled a reunion  with  Saúl F. Pizarro Medina, member
of iGEM Team Tec-Chihuahua 2015. We explained him the project and what we were planning for our Human Practices.
Saúl is a committed student who involves himself in several activities related to biotechnology. At that moment, he was working, along with other students, to collaborate with biotechnology experts. These prestigious experts were developing an Environmental Risk Assessment Guide for Genetically Modified Organisms (ERA for GMOs).
We found this a great opportunity to get informed about biosafety and how an evaluation should be done in order to commercialize a biotechnological product without violating established standards. Saúl commented to his mentor, Ph.D. María Mercedes Roca, that we wanted to participate in this collaboration and she invited us to"

Experimental results
Furthermore, the blue light promotor was extensively characterized. The strength of the promoter was compared to the standard iGEM promoter, , using the protocol from the iGEM measurement kit.
Comparison of the blue light promoter (blue) to a standard promoter strength  (orange) in RPU. The blue light promoter shows ca. half the strength of the standard promoter, meaning it can be classified as a weak promoter
Next, the effect of blue light on this promoter was examined. As shown on the graph below, blue light irradiation has a significant effect on the strength of the promoter. However, aside from light, temperature also has an important effect on promotor strenght (possibly even bigger then light). The influence of temperature will be on the amount of repressor available compared to the plasmid copies. For example, cells grown at 37°C will have too little repressor, resulting in constitutive activity. At 16°C, there will be more repressor and more receptor, however the low temperature will put the receptor in its active state causing it to inhibit the repressor from doing its job. When grown at 25°C the ratio between repressor and receptor is better, without light irradiance the receptor/represssor are in the ground state resulting in a good repression of the promoter, when exposing the cells to light the repressor is removed and the promotor is active.
Effect of blue light irradiance on promoter strength. Cells grown under blue light irradiance (blue) show a stronger expression compared to cells grown in the dark (grey)
Experimental set-up
Liquid cultures were ented (and re-ented in the evening) and grown on two different temperatures: 37° and 25°C.  Note: enting of the cultures needs to be done in a dark room (red light)and it might be best to use medium that was put at 4°C overnight. From each of these growth conditions some of the cultures were put in 16° and the other at 25°C. Each of these groups were then again divided in a group that was exposed to blue light and a group that was not exposed to light.  We decided upon using FACS because then the fluorescence of single cells is measured. Since each time the fluorescence of 10,000 individual cells is measured, FACS allows more elaborate and accurate statistical analysis. Our samples were analyzed by flow cytometry with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and CELLQuestTM acquisition"

Mission: 2018 iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
Date: May 6, 2018
Location: Shenzhen University
Not very long after we formally set up our team, we received the invitation to attend the Southern China Regional Meeting organized by the iGEM team of Shenzhen University (SZU-China). At the time, our project has not been decided yet. However, in order to experience the feeling of competition, we decided to use papaya anti-ringspot virus as an example to introduce our project ideas at the exchange meeting. So, on the morning of May 6, 2018, we, the members of the first iGEM team of Shenzhen high school started our journey. First stop, Xili campus of Shenzhen University.
Entering the lecture hall and taking our seats, the meeting began officially, the confident team members were all absent-minded at the beginning, only to listen to each other. However, as the meeting went on, each member of the team finally realized the seriousness of the problem, is that we barely understand other team's projects after listening to their presentations. We were bombarded by the terms which we have no idea about. At this point, we finally realize that what we had is blind confidence backed by no actual knowledge. We prayed and prayed for the people on the stage to slow down. Our presenters, Charlie Li, and Lindsay Mo are already under great pressure. Finally, the host announced: ""Let's invite SSHS-Shenzhen to present their project!"". Charlie and Lindsay took a heavy step onto the podium and began their presentation.
The two speakers showed remarkable composure when they first appeared despite being clearly underprepared compared to other groups at the meeting. In the briefing words, they explained our aim to ""increasing crop yield by killing diseases in a non-transgenic manner"", and they closely combined the practical examples of papaya ringspot virus with admirable results.
But we didn't stay optimistic for that long. Only minutes in the Q&A session, our presenters encountered questions like:
1) Why make papaya instead of other crops?
2) Why should the non-transgenic method be adopted to pay for it, while the transgenic method"

Our iGEM adventure began in January 2015. From this moment till the very end of our iGEM Project, we were guided by our advisors Luc Brunsveld, Maarten Merkx and Tom de Greef. They helped us with brainstorming, by asking the right questions at the right moment and by advising us on problem solving. We wouldn't be able to pull this project off without them. Please find below a short profile for each of our advisors.
Prof.dr.ir. L. (Luc) Brunsveld
Prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld is professor at our university. He lectured our team in courses concerning chemical biology, for example 'pharmacology' and 'molecular biology of the cell'. Besides lecturing students, he conducts research at our university concerning protein-protein interactions. Him being a busy man, we are more than happy that he took the time to advise us during the project.
For a more extensive (and professional) biography, hit the button.
Luc (Lucas) Brunsveld (1975) received his PhD degree in 2001 under supervision of prof. Bert Meijer at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann. From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new approaches to modulate biological processes. In 200"

Mechanism
Chlorophyll is a photopigment found in the chloroplast of green plants. Chlorophyll absorbs light strongly  in the blue and red regions of the visible spectrum. It absorbs very poorly in the green region, and that  light is reflected, hence, making plants green. Chlorophyll is an excellent photoreceptor because it  contains networks of alternating single and double bonds. Because, the electrons are not held tightly  to a particular atom and can resonate, they can be readily excited by light. There are two varieties of  chlorophyll molecules, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. They have small differences in absorbance  spectrums allowing the plant to absorb and utilize more of the sun’s energy. The power of chlorophyll  is its ability, when excited, to transfer an electron to an acceptor creating a separation of charge and  chemical potential. Thus, light energy is converted into chemical energy (Tymoczko et. al., 2010).

Chlorophyllase Generator Construction
Protein generator part for chlorophyllase.  The wheat (Triticum aestivum) chlorophyllase gene was kindly provided to us by Dr. Joseph Jez, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.  Primers were designed to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the TaCHL open reading frame from the pET28a vector that the gene was provided in.  Since we were using the chlorophyllase gene in gene fusion applications, RFC 23 sequences were incorporated into the primers used for amplification.  The amplified product was cloned into pSB1C3 and designated as BBa_K1418000.  Primers were then designed and PCR was performed to remove the stop codon from TaCHL. This amplified product was cloned into pSB1C3 and is designated as BBa_K1418001.  By removing the stop"

A DMAPP and several IPP molecules can then be linked together into natural rubber through the action of the prenyltransferase (HRT2) from the rubber tree. IPP and DMAPP are molecules naturally present in E. coli, produced by the bacteria through the MEP pathway. MEP pathwayMethylerythritol phosphate pathway The MEP pathway converts molecules of GAP GAPGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate - produced by the degradation of glucose (glycolysis) - into IPP and DMAPP. To increase the amount of IPP and DMAPP available for rubber production, we optimized the MEP pathway by elevating the levels of rate limiting enzymes in the pathway.

Through gene manipulation, we codon-optimized and introduced the prenyltransferase gene from the rubber tree to E. coli. This enables the bacteria to express the prenyltransferase enzyme. In so far that the system is regulable, the bacteria should be able to convert sugar into natural rubber through; the glycolysis, the MEP pathway, and the prenyltransferase activity. Our experiments point towards this being possible. In fact, our data indicates that our bacteria do produce rubber, and we have proof of expression control.

Seeing a male role model that has taken time off for reasons of child care would be just as powerful or even more powerful for males and females
From the initial interview with Dr Griffiths, to the interview with Dr Lewis, all academics have spoken about giving women more confidence in putting themselves up for promotion, however Dr Dixon had a different perspective. She recognised that more needs to be done to give support to women and give them confidence to apply for more senior roles, however, she indicated that university culture was actually affecting the health of men, due to the pressure of promotion:
There are more young male (staff at Sport science) who are under pressure from the culture of the university to consider progression in terms of promotion, all the time
This makes us question whether we are doing enough to support staff of both genders in applying for promotion and if the focus on changing female attitudes to career progression and confidence is at the expense of male staff health and mental health. Consequently, we come back to the idea of a massive social and structural change that is necessary for there to be any progress in equality and diversity. It is more than just changing maternity/paternity support to parental leave, to which Dr Dixon emphasised
the Scandinavian model is brilliant
-  and it’s more than just trying to alter people’s unconscious bias about gender - we need to consider changing societal judgements for the sake of health and mental health as well.
The social pressure that males can feel under to be the main bread winner is quite strong
This echoes what Dr Santos said about how maternity leave allows for a lot of social pressure on young mums. Consequently, we think that society needs to look hard at how the pressure is affecting all, especially young people in the developmental stage of adulthood.  Dr Dixon gave us a lot to consider for there to be a significant move in the right direction in equality issues. Our take home messages from the meeting were that:
“Only one person to do it and be positive about it for there to be a significant change”
“It’s not something that can be changed overnight”
Most gratifyingly, we asked Dr Dixon what more students can do to to improve equality and diversity, not just in science, but in general; her response was thus:
The kind of thing you are doing, what you are doing is drawing attention to it

Overview
Analogous to the transfer of data as electronic packets in a computer network, the concept of engineering bacteria to transport packets of chemical signals between bacterial populations arose. In this way, the bacteria themselves can form network connections.
In order to aspire towards this ultimate objective, we decided to focus on reprogramming bacterial motility. Each bacterium will travel in a stimulus-directed fashion to specific points of the network (the nodes), where they can communicate signals. Such a stimulus should be unique to the bacterium and not be part of the natural environment. With these specifications in mind, we needed a way of manipulating the chemotactic behaviour of bacteria.
During chemotactic movement, the expression of CheZ induces counter-clockwise (CCW) flagellar activity - resulting in a “run and tumble” bacterial motion (Figure 1). For more on bacterial chemotaxis, see here .
Figure 1. The reprogramming of bacterial chemotactic response by using post-transcriptional activation of CheZ using an analyte-responsive riboswitch. CheZ expression results in counter-clockwise flagellar rotation and a “run and tumble” movement. (Click to enlarge)
The WITS iGEM 2011 team focused heavily on the key idea of guiding E.coli to move up a concentration gradient of a specific exogenous analyte – through controlled expression of this motility factor, CheZ. Our ambitious goal was to show that we can reprogram bacterial chemotaxis and thereby transfer products of any coding sequence to a desired location.
“Biotweet” is a theoretical concept of a framework for bacterial networks, using reengineered bacterial motility. Any network requires the establishment of connections between nodes of the network, allowing for the transport of node-to-node data packets. Reengineering the mechanisms of chemotaxis is the first step in"

In principle, our biosensor is based on the repressor BlcR under the control of a constitutive promoter, and the binding sequence of the promoter Pblc. This binding sequence is following an inducible T7promoter. The promoter is followed by a specific translation enhancing 5' untranslated region and controls transcription of sfGFP, which is the output signal. In the absence of GBL or GHB the BlcR repressor binds to its operator sequence and inhibits the transcription of sfGFP. If GBL or GHB are present in the sample solution, BlcR cannot bind its operator sequence anymore. The T7 polymerase is then able to transcribe the sfGFP and a fluorescence signal can be observed. A more detailed description can be found in the result section .
For testing beverages, the biosensor test strip needs to be cell-free to prevent the contamination with genetically modified organisms. Hence, this device is optimized to function in our cell-free protein synthesis ( CFPS ) assay, but works in vivo as well. For even faster results than in CFPS, we added a his-tag to the repressor BlcR. This aims to obtain a purified repressor for use in our developed plasmid repressor interaction assay ( PRIA ). While in CFPS proteins still need time to be synthesized, they are added fully functional in PRIA. This optimization enables the quick detection of date rape drugs.

GHB and GBL are both toxic substances for humans which requires special precautions in terms of safety. Therefore we first started with the idea to detect not the toxic substances itself, but similar analogs. The substance GABA ist not toxic for humans and only differs to GHB in the amin group instead of the hydroxy group. The aerobic gram positive bacterium B. subtilis has been analyzed comprehensively. It is able to use GABA in the so called GABA-shunt pathway. This pathway uses the gabTD genes, which are activated by the transcription factor GabR in the presence of GABA and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). For this activation, GabR binds the gab"

In order to achieve the functionality of pneumosensor, we must have a highly specific reporting system which will only give fluorescent signal under the presence of S. pneumoniae. In search for the suitable gene circuit, the discovery by Prof. Morrison on the competence for genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae which depends on quorum-sensing system to control many competence-specific genes acting in DNA uptake, processing, and integration has provided the ideal framework for this module. (Lee and Morrison, 1999) There is a link between this quorum-sensing system and the competence-specific genes, which is an alternative σx (ComX protein) that serves as a competence-specific global transcription modulator. (Luo and Morrison, 2003) In S. pneumoniae, competence (a state capable of being genetic transformed) happens transiently during the log phase growth, and is regulated by a quorum sensing system utilizing the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). Upon stimulation by CSP, σx will be expressed and associated with RNA polymerase apoenzyme. The resulting holoenzyme will then be guided by σx to initiate transcription of a set of “late” genes enabling genetic transformation and other unknown functions. Characterized genes regulated by σx were found to contain an 8 base pairs consensus sequence TACGAATA known as the Cin-Box or the Com-Box. (Piotrowski, Luo, & Morrison, 2009). Taking advantage of this competence-specific mechanism, it is now able to produce the S. pneumoniae sensing device of high specificity by incorporating this system into E. coli.
iGEM 2014 Hong_Kong_HKUST Team has cloned σx from S. pneumoniae strain NCTC7465 and characterized its ability to initiate transcription of two downstream promoters with different lengths: PcelA ( BBa_K1379000 ) and PcomFA ( BBa_K1379001 ), which have the consensus Com-Box sequence. Though much information about the promoters is readily available nowadays, its characterization of promoter activity, specificity, sequence, as well as the biomolecular mechanism can be greatly enhanced with further investigations and experiments. Hence, we were interested in reproducing this gene circuit with all the associated genes and promoters to be combined into a single transcriptional unit. Despite the suggested susceptibility to leakage and other factors that may hinder or interrupt the mechanism, researches have reported that the pathway was highly specific to certain environmental conditions and stress, suggesting minimal or no leakage in the entire process.
PcelA and PcomFA promoters have high specificity to σ"

Overview of Parts
Our team submitted a total of 6 parts to the iGEM registry. The parts that were submitted were all components to N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing systems. The parts are all RFC10, 23, and 1000 compatible with some parts possessing other compatibilities. There are 5 basic parts that are part of the part collection and 1 composite part. The senders for the Aub, Bja, Bra, Cer, and Sin systems were submitted as part of the inductance test with the F2620 part, and compose a submitted part collection. The 1 composite part is the modular cassette (vector) for the inducer.

Design Considerations
In order to fully understand the mechanisms that facilitated AHL quorum sensing, we researched the mechanism behind AHL synthesis. The graphic below created by_____ displays the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6 AHLs. As shown below, an acyl-acyl carrier protein must react with an intermediate molecule with catalysis from the AHL synthase to produce the AHL.
Because our parts are nearly all Senders, we felt that an understanding of the AHL Receivers was also important. Utilizing the well characterized Tra system receiver, we created a 3D model of the Tra system binding its native AHL (3-oxo-C8-AHL), in which the interactions between the binding pocket and the AHL acyl tail was demonstrated. The semi-specific binding of these transcription factors gives us a better understanding on how crosstalk can occur.
From these mechanisms, we summarized the overall AHL induction mechanism below:

Abstract
An intragenic complementation approach to engineer a faster fluorescence biosensor
Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.

Assembling the Construct
Sortase A was isolated from S. aureus genomic DNA using a simple PCR reaction. In order to add the GB1 domain, two methods were used in the lab - a Gibson assembly and an Overlap Extension PCR. Both of those methods require homologous sequences on the fragments that will be ligated. Those overlaps were added to Sortase A with another PCR reaction, which also allowed the introduction of a C-terminal Histidine tag for IMAC purification of Sortase A.
Figure 4: Assembly of Sortase A construct
Gibson Assembly relies on the activity of a 5’ exonuclease which creates 3’ overhangs on the complementary sequences, leading to annealing of the two fragments.
Overlap Extension PCR on the other hand requires no exonuclease and instead utilizes a slightly modified PCR reaction. Two different fragments (in our case GB1 and Sortase A) are added into a PCR reaction and will be denatured. In the following step, the DNA strands will be allowed to anneal again and due to the overlapping sequences, a part of the GB1 strands will anneal to Sortase A strand. By carefully selecting the primer combination for this reaction, those recombinant DNA molecules will preferably be amplified and can be used for downstream applications.
Functional Testing Sortase A
After successful assembly with Gibson assembly or overlap extension PCR, we planned to add a T7 promoter to the GB1-SortA hybrid for subsequent expression, purification and functional resting.
Figure 5: Expression, purification and functional testing of combat proteins
To test the activity of Sortase A, simple methods can be applied: attaching two peptides with the correct tags to each other and performing an SDS-Page to observe the shift in molecular weight. Additionally, fluorescent proteins such as RFP or UnaG can be attached and visualized using a fluorescence microscope to get a better idea of the distribution and density of attached proteins. A final test would of course be the assembly of our finished product, SMITe.

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

Evolution of the iGEM Team Frankfurt
Our Team startet to search for a suitable project for the iGEM 2012 competition in November 2011. First we screened former iGEM Wikis for interesting but incompleted ideas. Some of us informed theirselves and presented the topics to the rest of us for an open discussion. In parallel some presented their own ideas and gave small lectures about important methods in molecular biology, since the teammembers are from different scientific disciplines. In late November the topic of stevia occurred both in the public media and in our team, because the trade and production of steviol as a sweetener was going to be legalized by the European Comission. We investigated the scientific state of knowledge about the molecular background of steviolglycoside bioynthesis and found that the genetic basis is on the one hand explored in its principles, on the other hand we noticed, that no publicated trials for a microbial production have been attempted so far. By this procedure, we ended up with three ideas (beneath the steviol subject those were the biotechnological explotation of autophagymechanisms and in vivo drug production) and finally decided to pursuit the mircobial steviol production for this years iGEM competition.
We used the christmas holidays for a more specific literature research and began to contact several groupleaders and professors at our university to inform them about the existance of our team and ask for creative and professional assistance. If this was appreciated by the groups, we presented our project in their seminars. Now the question about the practical realisation became urgent. What we needed most was laboratory space, which emerged to be even more difficult than the need of financial support. We invested"

Inform the public about synthetic biology
Promote an education in science
Showcase opportunities in the field of science
Create an enriched science experience for students
Broaden the influence of iGEM
For more information about outreach and synthetic biology see:
This ground breaking study by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc. on awareness and attitudes of the public about synthetic biology found that 9 of 10 individuals think the public should know more about developping technologies
2020 Science aims to provide a complete picture on the development of new sciences
Synthetic Biology Project examines the development of synthetic biology
The Events
The method that we have chosen to achieve our goals is science education. This is the avenue most accessible and familiar to us as science students. By participating in events in our community we are able to influence multiple audiences by different means. Our outreach efforts are primarily focused at young students still deciding whether to continue in the field of science, students pursing science education, and the general public. Some of the events facilitated delivering the information on a small scale (in depth discussions with one or two students) while other events necessitated speaking more generally to larger groups. The events fostered synthetic biology awareness and were great learning experiences for our team.
ESQ Partnership
ESQ ( Engineering Science Quest ) is a day camp hosted at the University of Waterloo that brings hundreds of curious young minds to Waterloo each year to learn more about science and engineering. We held a weekly activity for the campers that introduced concepts of DNA and synthetic biology. The campers were aged 10-13 with only basic knowledge of molecular biology based topics. After learning about the basis of synthetic biology and some of the exciting potential applications, the campers extracted DNA from their own cheek cells.  The activity allowed us to share our excitement and passion for science with young budding scientists. This program is something we plan to develop and continue in the future.
Students were also given a protocol to extract DNA from fruit with materials that can be found around the house, you can find this protocol here: download the protocol . We hope that this initiative will help engage students outside of the classroom and get them excited about science.
You can also download the presentation we used to introduce concepts like DNA and synthetic biology to the students (approximate age of the campers was 10-12)
Through ESQ, members of the team also participated in a week long outreach orientation.  During the week we learned the skills necessary to effectively deliver science outreach. You can get some tips and review what we learned by checking out this document: Outreach Orientation

Tip: Antibiotics should be added to liquid medium immediately prior to use from stock antibiotic solutions that have been filter-sterilized, distributed into aliquots, and stored in the dark at –20°C (see Antibiotics).
Sterilizing media
Sterilize liquid or solid media by autoclaving, using a pressure and time period suitable for the type of medium, bottle size, and autoclave type.
Tip: Fill bottles only 3/4 full with medium and loosen the caps before autoclaving to avoid hot medium boiling over. Tighten caps once the media is cool (<40°C) to keep it completely sterile.
Tip: Antibiotics and nutrients such as amino acids are inactivated by the high temperatures of an autoclave. They should be sterilized by filtration through a filter unit with a pore size of 0.2 µm, and added to the cooled, autoclaved medium from properly stored stock solutions.
Solid media
E. coli strains can generally be streaked and stored on LB plates containing 1.5% agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s). Preparation: Prepare LB medium according to the composition given in Liquid media. Just before autoclaving, add 15 g agar per liter and mix. After autoclaving, swirl the medium gently to distribute the melted agar evenly throughout the solution. Take care that the hot liquid does not boil over when swirled.
Tip: Cool autoclaved agar medium to below 50°C (when you can hold it comfortably) before adding heat-sensitive antibiotics and nutrients. Mix thoroughly to obtain an even concentration throughout the medium before pouring.
Tip: Pour plates in a laminar-flow hood or, if no hood is available, on a cleaned bench surface next to a Bunsen. Use 30–35 ml medium per standard 90 mm petri dish (~30 plates per liter of medium).
After pouring plates, any air bubbles may be removed by passing the flame of a Bunsen burner briefly over the surface. Do not linger with the flame as this may destroy antibiotics in sections of the plates.
Dry plates either directly after solidification or just before use by removing the lids and standing the plates in a laminar-flow hood for 1 hour. Alternatively, if you do not have access to a hood, plates can be dried with the covers slightly open in a 37°C incubator for 30 min, or left upside down with lids on at room temperature for 2–3 days.
Tip: Store plates inverted at 4°C in a dark room or wrapped in aluminum foil"

Exeter iGEM Lab Book
Welcome to our lab book. The following pages contain a chronological description of everything we did in the lab – starting on Day 1. Different days contain short descriptions of our experiments and notes, as well as references to the appropriate protocols.
We were not adept at keeping a concise lab book during the first few weeks of iGEM – the descriptions get more organised and detailed as the weeks progress. The first part of our lab book relates to the Interlab Study, and the later parts to our actual project, Ribonostics.
All protocols can be found at the bottom of the page,and there will links throughout. If you have any questions you can email the team or individual members emails can be found on our team page.

Only two white colonies grew on one of the plates. Therefore, the DNA will be retransformed to determine if the quality of the DNA is good.
Friday
Constructs created on May 11, 2011 were retransformed into E. coli DH5α cells.
Saturday
Transformation from May 13, 2011 resulted in white colonies growing on tetracycline plates. These white colonies were mini-preped, so that an agarose gel could be ran to determine if we had successfully assembled our constructs.
Sunday
An agarose gel of mini-preped DNA was ran to determine if construction of constructs, May 11, 2011, was successful.  DNA from mini-preps was restricted with EcoR1, and then as much of the post restriction mixture was loaded into the gel wells. Concluding from the gel: pSB1T3 was much larger than expected, and constructs that will be sent for sequencing are:
1) pLacI-sRBS
2) pBAD-sRBS
3) K331025-B0015
4) K331033-K331035

Tuesday
More Plasmid Backbone and K331031 in pSB1C3 were made. Cells were incubated overnight at 37oC. Then the cells were mini-preped and ran on an ~1% agarose gel by Terrance. The gel was of poor quality and so they were re-ran.
Wednesday
Justin and Boris obtained the biobrick plasmid containing P0440. Then transformed this part into E. coli DH5α cells.
Thursday
Transformed cells were plated onto 2 plates. Plate #1 resulted in 5 colonies and Plate #2 4 colonies. A single colony was picked from each plate and incubated overnight at 37oC.

SDU-Denmark,2016,Team:SDU-Denmark#Perspectives_-_-_TEXT.html," routines. Biodegradable plastic, produced by E.coli, has a huge potential, because it can possibly replace conventional plastic. The main thing that withholds this from happening, is the price. PHB is today far too expensive compared to the traditional production. Nevertheless further improvement in mass production of biodegradable plastic offers a wide spectrum of usage, e.g. in the agricultural and horticultural sector, for food, medicine packaging and much more "" PlasticsEurope "" . Hopefully, this breakthrough will happen within the next 10-20 years and thereby change the plastic market drastically. The price of one kilo Polystyrene (used commonly in today’s tableware) is between 0.50-1.29€ "" Plasticker"" . PHB’s price is however, very high at the moment. A price around 1.5 - 2€ pr/kilo may rise the interest of PHB for future investors.
Our contact with several plastic companies gave us hope for this to happen, but they also pointed out, that it is the customers that should be convinced if they were going to implement PHB in their company.

Ideas from high school students ( Top )
We asked the students to imagine how our project would be incorporated in 50, 100 and 150 years in our everyday lives. They were especially very interested in the future prospects of bacteriocins. Some of their ideas are presented here.
50 years
Bacto-Aid can prevent scar tissue creation
it will be possible to buy Bacto-Aid at the local pharmacy and grocery stores. Hospitals will use it and it will be a part of people’s first aid kit
Bacto-Aid will be in spray form
Bacto-Aid can treat people with psoriasis
100 years
bacteriocins could be a composite of makeup, shampoos and creams to prevent infections
bacteriocins could be applied on door handles to prevent bacteria to spread
disinfection gels will contain bacteriocins. Hans Jørn Kolmos also told us that resistance towards disinfection gels has become more common. We are therefore obliged to invent a new alternative
Bacto-Aid can now be bought as a cream and in a tablet form. The tablet will be able to cure internal infections
the bacteriocins will be incorporated in bedclothes
apply bacteriocins in chewing gum
Bacto-Aid as a special bandage for people with amputated bodies
150 years

Aachen,2014,Team:Aachen#Parts_-_-_TEXT.html," IPTG shows the functionality of GFP inside the fusion protein. After the induction a TEV protease is produced which is specifically cutting the recognition sequence build inside the linker (K1319016) between GFP and K1319001. The cutting results in a separation of GFP and REACh1 collapsing the FRET system between the two. This results in a fluorescence signal of GFP due to the fact that the emission is no longer absorbed by REACh1 and emitted as heat but rather as fluorescence with a wavelength of 511 nm.
The very low fluorescence in the non induced double plasmid system of K1319013 and K1319008 shows the functionality of K1319001. As established before, the GFP is being expressed correctly inside the fusion protein, therefore the reduction in fluorescence in the non induced double plasmid system is a direct result of the quenching ability of K1319001. The quenching, after subtraction of the background fluorescence, reduced the fluorescence of GFP by a factor of 12,5. This also includes the slight leakiness of the TEV protease.
To eliminate the effect of the leakiness of the K1319008 construct in determining the quenching ability of K1319001, K1319013 was also compared against I20260 and B0015 on its own under the same condition as above (again in a biological triplicate).
Comparison of the fluorescence adjusted for OD of I20260, B0015 and K1319013
The expressed fusion protein K1319013 exhibits a fluorescence more than 30 fold smaller as the positive control of I20260.
This experiments shows that the fluorescence of the fusion protein GFP-REACh1 is more than 30-fold lower than normal GFP expression under identical circumstances (same backbone, promoter, RBS, terminator and cultivation circumstances). This demonstrates a quenching percentage of GFP of >96 %!
To prove that the measured constructs were the same as assumed the plasmids were tested with specially designed Check PCRs with one primer binding upstream on the plasmid backbone and one primer binding specifically inside the insert. The following results were obtained for K1319013.
Check PCR for K1319013
The length of the PCR product matches the length of the control plasmid.
The PCR clearly shows that the used plasmid had the correct insert. After a positive identification of K1319013 the double plasmid system was also checked for the correct TEV protease plasmid K1319008.

Com R/S
Approach 2
ComR approach details
Still with the aim of creating a rapid UV-response system, we elaborated a second approach based on a regulation pathway, the ComR and ComS system, originally found in Streptococcus thermophilius. Our goal is to produce a UV inducible promoter.
ComR and ComS mechanism
The ComR and ComS system controls natural competence and allows quorum sensing in S. thermophilius.  ComS is a small peptide encoded in the genome. After synthesis, it is matured and extruded from the cell into the medium. The peptide’s import allows other cells to sense the signal. When a basal level is reached it will trigger a competence in the whole population.  Indeed, once reimported in the cell the ComS will be able to bind ComR protein. This will allow the formation of a ternary complex (peptide-protein-DNA) with a specific DNA motif (ComR-box) and trigger the downstream gene’s expression (See schema here below).
Our little trick
The ComS’s mature sequence is LPYFAGCL. An aromatic’s substitution by an alanine would block the binding to ComR. Hence our objective is to synthetize this peptide while replacing the tyrosine by a tyrosine-ortho-nitro benzyl (tyr-ONB). This should indeed prevent the binding unless there is some UV exposure and the ONB or photocage is released. This will result in the gene’s expression controlled by the ComR box’s  induced by exposure. Using a red fluorescence protein should signal the UV exposure.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics results_-_-_TEXT.html,"% has a more holistic point of view and believes that there is more to living systems than just it's subsystems.
The lack of a majority that either agrees or disagrees with the statement shows that there is no concise answer for this question. Although many people think that the reductionist approach can reveal the properties of biological systems, there is an almost equally big group that is not yet sure about this. The 14% that does not agree with the statement are assumed to believe that the reductionist approach is limiting in explaining life, because either other approaches are needed or because life can never be explained by science.
Graph 15-1.
15. I think that a complex living system is more than the sum of its biological components
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this.
This question is kind of contrasting to the previous one, and works from a different angle where people are asked if ""the whole"" is more than the sum of its components, the holistic view on complex systems as appear in biology.
Compared to the previous query, this one show a more universal answer, where a majority of 65% agrees with the statement, indicating that they support the existence of emerging properties. 23% is not yet sure whether or not living systems are more than its components, and a minority of only 13% is rather sure that biological systems can be explained by their reduced subsystems.
The majority of the scientific community support the holistic approach of describing complex biological systems where emerging properties appear when putting the biological components together. The question remaining: can we ever characterize the emerging properties? Can a living system ever be explained completely materialistically?
Graph 16-1.
16. Life is physical and can be explained materialistically
Please indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much you agree on this.
With materialistically is meant that all things are composed of material and all phenomena are the result of material interactions. The statement made is quite extreme, and might go even further than question 14, where systems were stated to be explainable by the reductionist approach. Nevertheless, the outcome is almost the same. The group agreeing on the statement is 40% versus 19% that rejects the statement. Again a rather large group does not choose sides and keeps his answer in the middle.
There might be a conflict between the traditional perception of life where it is thought that living systems are just too complex to understand and the breakthroughs in science getting closer and closer towards explaining life. Will the scientific community ever be able to reveal the principles of life completely, or will there always be things we"
OUC-China,2014,Team:OUC-China#Project Policy Practise_-_-_TEXT.html," recirculating aquaculture is developing to higher density and intensification. The outbreak of fish disease will result in huge losses. It’s best if we can take precautions against fish disease to reduce losses. We visited fish farms to find how to cure ill fishes and prevent the fish from catching disease.
ABOUT THE CURE:
1. They put the ill fish into another fishpond  in quarantine.
2. Put CuSO4 or some medicine into the fishpond to kill the pathogens.
3. Feed the fish with food which includes antibiotics.
ABOUT THE PRECAUTIONS：
1. Using smart system to control the temperature of the water.
2. Periodically filter the water and disinfect water.
3. Treating the fish with potassium permanganate before they put the fry into the fishpond.
At present, Chinese aquaculture industry suffers serious losses because of disease and most of the solutions (such as delivering chemicals and antibiotics) pollute the environment and have little effect. So we hope that we can apply our project on oral DNA vaccine of fish in the future. But many researchers who study DNA vaccine do not actually understand the needs of farms or markets. Actually, the feed is the key, as it is the simplest and most direct oral vaccine carrier, and it is also the most essential element of aquaculture industry. Now the question is whether we can use the pellets as a carrier for oral DNA vaccine. In order to answer this question, we visited Hu Haibin who is the most authoritative expert in aquaculture feeds in OUC-China, in hope that he can help us to find a reasonable feeding way.
During conversation, we learned that fish's feeding selection is diverse, such as some fish like floating feed, while others prefer micro particles. But these feeds do not have DNA or living microorganisms. However, there are still some feed containing micro-organisms or micro-organism products, but these biological materials are inactivated. At present, the yeast is the most commonly utilized kind of feed; its main role is to improve palatability and to ameliorate the intestinal environment. Thus, experts recommend us to use yeast for chassis because it is easy to feed. But whether E. coli or yeast, there will be leaks if fed to fish on farm, and there will be some bio-security threat. Some fodder was wrapped with an outer coat which only can be digested in the intestine, such as sodium alginate, which was supposed to prevent contamination of food residues in aquaculture water. If it could be applied on our project, we could effectively solve the microbial leakage problems."

Rafael Lizarralde
Rafael is a member of the latest generation of ninjas, and spends the majority of his time battling creatures from the seventh dimension. Not only has he mastered the art of dandelion decapitation, he also recently learned how to call forth the power of the heavens after many long hours studying rain dance simulations.
His interactions with other dimensions have left him with an uncanny knack for engineering. Some of his latest creations include the mobius bagel and a controller eerily reminiscent of the iPhone 5, but so dangerous that he won't let lesser mortals even approach the device. Any ideas about what exactly this controller does are mere speculation; however, since its invention Rafael seems to have developed an unhealthy obsession with spirals, and can occasionally be found talking to snails.
When not trying to save the world from impending doom, Rafael enjoys cuddling with his favorite glow-in-the-dark purple cuttlefish, crushing defenseless plushie Totoros, and tormenting young iGEMers with a gaze that makes even E. coli scream (research pending on how this affects transformation efficiency).
Oat Luengvarinkul
Portrayed by actor Jesse Eisenberg in the upcoming 2014 film TSN, Episode II, Oat is a Thai architect/computer programmer and internet entrepeneur. The film's production studio offers a spoiler-removed description of his biography/ the movie's plot:  """"Together with his college roommates, Oat launched social networking site ******** from Cornell's dormitory rooms to great success before introducing  ******** onto other campuses nationwide and relocating  ******** to Palo Alto, California. But his hearty  ******** payday would come at a price. Mired in legal disputes, Oat soon discovered that many of those he had befriended on and off  ******** during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. As ex-friends engage Oat in the courtroom for ownership of  ********, it appears that the young entrepreneur might have let  ********-based greed eclipse his better judgment.

Yi Fan Chen
This man has been ingrained with Confuscious virtues since the day he was born. He works hard, hardly ever plays, gets barely any pay, yet never complains about the hardship to his bosses. In fact, he does not even regard his daily tribulations as difficulties. He merely sees them as challenges that builds character. (Hell, he evens cooks his meal, and he cooks it better than my mom does, whats up with that?) He knows that one day the mountains will be moved, the foes will be vanquished, and the sea departs to make way for him toward that stockpile of Nobel prices that is his birthright. And so he waits. He pipets. He autoclaves. He transforms. He only sleeps during the few hours of incubation. When he sleeps, he dreams:""when that day comes, I am going to give 10% of every one of my Nobel Price money to my buddy_____"" (Yeah he better, because that buddy of his does not have a pension plan).

Week 1 (May 1-4)
The following section covers wetlab aspect of our overall project focusing on microbial conversion of naphthenic acids into economically-valuable hydrocarbons. The approach taken in this endeavour will be from four strategic starting points - ring cleavage, decarboxylation, denitrificaiton, and desulfurization. Overall, the 'hydrocarbons' aspect of the project is a critical one to our overall design and construction of a biosystem capable of not only detecting but also converting naphthenic acids in what will be an economically viable solution to the remediation and recovery of tailings pond water, while removing these toxic compounds before they can have significant detrimental impact on the environment.

Peking,2012,Team:Peking#Project#Phototaxis#Demonstration_-_-_TEXT.html," formed larger colonies in the form of a ring (Figure 1.c). The results show that CheZ indeed influences bacteria motility and thus we can regulate the expression level of CheZ in order to control bacterial behavior.
Figure 1. (a)(b)(c) DH5 α, ΔcheZ and wild type MG1655 on semi-solid medium, respectively. The medium contains 5g tryptone, 2.5g yeast extract, 5g NaCl per liter, and 0.25% agar, buffered by HEPES (pH 8.0, final concentration 20mM), and 0.5% (w/v) glycerol was added as the carbon source. 20ml of the above medium was poured into Petri-dish (9cm internal diameter), and harden at 30℃ for 1h. 2μL cell culture(OD0.4-0.6) was spotted at the center of the plate and dried for 15min. Incubated at 30℃ for 20h.
Recovery of Motility
As CheZ influences bacterial behavior, we suspected that bacteria would have different diffusion radius associated with expression level of CheZ. We constructed CheZ under the control of promoters with different strength: BBa_J23112 , BBa_J23113 , and BBa_J23114 , following which these constructs were transformed into ΔCheZ strain, respectively. It shows that ΔCheZ strain diffuses and forms larger colonies in the form of a ring similar with wild type MG1655 (Figure 2b). The results indicate that CheZ can be regulated and the expression level of CheZ and bacterial motility have positive correlation.
Figure 2. (a) Wild type MG1655; (b) ΔCheZ strain with BBa_J23113 (promoter of medium strength).
Result
Experiments show that different light intensity can change diameter of the bacteria colony, indicating light intensity can regulate the bacteria motility.

Tsinghua July 19th, 2016
Through sharing our initial crazy ideas with the Tsinghua team, we even build up our beliefs to save human beings and the earth by using synthetic biology! We were so much imaginative that we planned to make the mosquitos extinct, and to cure HIV by synthetic biology! The Tsinghua team discussed with us about the realization of our imagination. They are possibly realized! What an exciting news! We believe that by using synthetic biology and our efforts, we can really improve human beings’ living quality!
BIT-China July 23th, 2016
Through exchange with the BIT-China team, we got a more profound understanding of genetic engineering and conduction of the whole program. We discussed with them about our ideas and division of labor, they analyzed our ideas and gave us useful suggestions. We had great difficulties in constructing our gene circuit and were not clear with the parts we need. They used their examples to show us what is a feasible gene circuit and how to construct it. We only had a raw idea at that time, they guided us on the right track of synthetic biology! 
 
BNDS-China
They suggested us to insert a GGPP gene to our gene circuit and let E.coli convert GGPP to CPP directly, and then by testing the yield of CPP to identify production of our target enzymes reversely. This is such a good idea which can help us improve our results and really show others the application of our biobricks. We also gave BNDS-China some suggestions, such as their gene circuit might need"

Survival of Genetically Modified E. coli in a Saline Environment
The 2016 Kingsborough iGEM team was focused on importing a new nitrogen metabolism pathway into E. coli; the anammox pathway. This pathway could potentially make E. coli more efficient at degrading the nitrogenous waste molecules found in sewage. The intended use of such a microbe would be in a wastewater treatment plant; however, this carries with it a risk that the bacteria could escape the confines of the facility and disrupt the local ecosystem.
Many iGEM teams address the risks of unintended spread of their modified organism by introducing (or at least proposing to introduce) a ‘kill-switch’. In fact, the focus of the Kingsborough team this year is to develop a new kill switch to be used in a wastewater treatment plant environment. However, we wanted to first assess the risk. Can a modified E. coli really survive outside the intended environment, and spread through the local waterways? Will it retain its plasmid and new genetic elements while doing so?
To answer these questions, we took a commonly used BioBrick, BBa_J04450, that expressed Red Fluorescent Protein as our stand-in for a genetic modification. This choice made it easy to track the presence of the plasmid, since the bacteria are colored red when they express these plasmid genes. We tested the ability of this bacteria to survive or thrive and maintain its plasmid multiple times.
In one representative experiment, we started by growing a 5mL culture of E. coli with plasmid J04450 overnight in LB with chloramphenicol (Cm). 1mL of this culture was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl). Dilutions of this mixture were then plated on LB + Cm by spotting 10uL of bacteria and allowing the drop to dry into the plate. This gave the following result (picture on the"

Today we started the experiment for bioaccumulation. The main idea is to let the bacteria let bacteria E. coli DH5α with our construction (BB_Essential + K346004) in liquid medium and after, quantify how much mercury is on nutritive medium and how much it has inside the bacteria. This is due to the bacteria capacity to accumulate mercury inside it
For that, it was tested four different concentrations (0.5 ug/ml; 0.25 ug/ml; 0.1ug/ml; 0.05ug/ml) besides of a sample without mercury. We used as control the same bacteria linage with a gene not related to mercury metabolism (GFP) to analyze the influency of the mercury binding proteins naturally expressed by bacteria.
The procedures were made based on bio detection’s procedures. We also continued the validation and characterization of our parts regarding to genetic-molecular level.
Backing to the rigorous digestions of our bio bricks with the following system for BB_Essential + E0840, BB_Essential + K346004 andd BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:

In summary, countries in South America are still beginners in developing synthetic biology. There is still need revision for their legislation to include synthetic biology, there is need to extend the iGEM competition participation, and there is need to promote events related to synthetic biology. In that way, the number of companies in the area and entries in the SynBio map may transpire greater involvement of the countries of South America in this amazing area!

Future Perspectives
DIY FUS Transducer
To test the Effector module as described in the project description , we had initially thought of building a Magnetic-resonance guided Focused Ultra-sound transducer (MRgFUS) to test the functioning of the thermal bio-switch with FUS.
This was motivated by some recent articles like [1] by the FUS Foundation that talks about an open source DIY-MRIgFUS device proposed by Vanderbilt University [2] , and shares access to detailed instructions on the hardware and software requirements for building it. Compared to commercial options, this is much cheaper although less powerful in terms of precision and less sensitive in terms of control. The idea was to demonstrate a proof-of-concept that would contribute to the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of the bacterial cancer therapy CATE.
However, as advised by our very FUS-expert, Beat Werner, a FUS-compatible test-bench requires proper material (acoustic impedance, thickness, etc.) and appropriate-containment for the test-sample. Also, adding MRI steerability increases the cost exponentially; typical MRI compatible FUS machines cost around $200,000. Due to lack of dedicated expertise in the team in this field, this idea was kept very low priority as far as iGEM was concerned. Instead, the FUS test conditions were emulated using an incubator at 45°C.
Moreover, due to requirement of an MRI compatible transducer, amplifier and waveform generator, the Vanderbilt University open-source system costs around $10,000 [3] , which was not feasible in the scope of the funding we received, but more importantly not critical to the demonstration of the idea of CATE, as a bacterial cancer therapy, in the time scope of this competition.
CATE, FUS and Beyond
For future development of a bacterial cancer therapy such as CATE, it would be essential to develop a high intensity FUS curved-transducer phased-array, for triggering the thermal switch that lyses the cells and releases the cancer-toxin. Popular FUS transducers (like from Sonic Concepts Co.) cost around"

Biotinylation Acceptor Peptide (BAP)
Schematic overview of BAP insertion into AAV-2 viral capsids, followed by biotinylation and binding of streptavidin-coupled molecules
The BAP (Biotinylation Acceptor Peptide) included in the Virus Construction Kit is a 15 amino acid peptide identified by Schatz et al. (1993) in a library screening approach and published under the number #85. This peptide with the sequence GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE contains a central lysine residue that can be specifically biotinylated by the prokaryotic holoenzyme biotin synthetase, encoded by the BirA gene of E. coli. Specific biotinylation of this peptide sequence can be performed in vivo by cotransfecting a plasmid with the BirA gene as described for the AAV by Arnold et al. (2006) or by an in vitro coupling approach using the purified Escherichia coli enzyme biotin ligase (BirA).
Biotin molecules specifically coupled to the viral loops can either be used to attach Streptavidin-coupled molecules to the viral capsid or to chemically couple molecules with a reactive group to biotin. Consequently, the inserted motif can enable the visualization of single virus particles by coupling fluorophores to the virus capsid empowering further uses of the Virus Construction Kit in fundamental virological research. In addition, targeting molecules such as Streptavidin-coupled affinity molecules (i.e. Antibodies, Nanobodies or Affibodies) can be coupled for manifold targeting approaches.
Materials and Methods: 
Transfection of the AAV-293 producer cells was performed in five 10 cm petri dishes with 3.4x10^6 cells (grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS) resulting in a confluence of 70-80% according to the standard protocol. Producer cells were harvested and together with the culture supernatant subjected to four cycles of freeze and thaw cell"

Education and Public Engangement
Synthetic Biology Exhibition during the  HKUST Information Day
Aim of the exhibition:
- Promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs. (For public engagement)
- Demonstrate our project and give explanations to encourage public engagement. (For integrated human practices)
- Promote environmental sustainability (For project benefits)
Apart from involving public's participation, there are several objectives for our exhibition. We would also like to promote the use of synthetic biology as an advance concept to solve current problems, promote student activities in HKUST through demonstration of iGEM project and suggest bioenergy as a fuel source for environmental sustainability.
There are three things we would like to do for the exhibition: the promotion and introduction to iGEM and synthetic biology, the project description and survey, and education on bioenergy as a renewable energy source.
To start with, the team would like to take this opportunity to promote synthetic biology as a tool to solve current problems and explain on how the synthetic biology field tries to involve safety, ethics, policies, and the environment into our research and product designs. The iGEM competition calls on students to build interdisciplinary teams of biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists to ask new questions about what synthetic biology can do. We are required to ""go beyond the lab"" and apply our project in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of our technologies.
Besides, a project can never be made into a product if we do not consider its users carefully. Thus, project explanation to the public is one of the key components in the development of our iGEM project. We would need to consider the many ways that our project can impact society as well as how the public might perceive our project in order to build a safe and sustainable project that can best serve the public interest. For biosafety concern, we will not use any engineered bacteria for display. We will"

BCCS-Bristol 2010 Biobrick
1. First Experience with BBa_k381001
Objective:
1. Test operation in liquid LB at 37 ° C and to KNO3 50 mM.
Methodology:
1. We used six falcon tubes of 25 mL. Three tubes were used for inoculation of the colonies from 06/09/11 and 12/09/11.
2. Two positive controls were prepared and one negative control for each test.
3. To positive control tubes we added 10 ml of liquid LB, 9.7 uL of chloramphenicol (33μg/mL) and 50mM of KNO3.
4. To negative control tube we added the same amount of LB and Chloramphenicol specified in the previous line, except KNO3.
5. Each tube was inoculated with the colonies; three of them with the conlonies from 06/09/11 and the rest with colonies from 12/09/11.
6. Tubes were incubated at 37 ° C for 48 hours.
After 48 hours we noticed that all the tubes for both tests showed no
change, including positive and negative controls. Our experiment was
based on BCCS-Bristol experiment. While reviewing the experiments of
Edinburgh in 2009, who designed the promoter used in the BioBrick
BCCS-Bristol, we realized that the promoter express better in minimal
essential media than in LB, but we do not rule out that we could have
made a mistake in the experience preparation prevented us from
showing the right results, which is why we decided to do the experiment
again.
2. Second Experience
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures, using KNO3  40 mM:
a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C
37°C
2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.

Constitutive Bacillus Promoters
Luminescence measurements
The constitutive promoters PliaG and PlepA were evaluated in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE, which contains the lux operon
. The promoter activity results in gene expression and production of the protein luciferase. The luminescence produced by this protein can be measured with the plate reader Synergy2 ( BioTek ) (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1: Luminescence measurement of the constitutive Bacillus promoters PliaG and PlepA in the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. OD600 (up), LUMI (middle) and LUMI per OD600 (down) depending on the time (h) are shown for two different clones (green/blue). Data derive from three independent experiments, the graphs show the mean fo the three experiments and the standard deviation. Curves were fitted over each other (t=0, OD600=0.3) and smoothed by taking the average of three neighboring values.
All clones show a normal growth behaviour. The activity of both promoters increases during transition from log to stationary phase. PliaG has an activity maximum of about 100.000 Lumi/OD600. PlepA shows a maximum of about 400.000 Lumi/OD600. Comparing these two constitutive promoters, the activity of PlepA is about four times higher than the activity of PliaG. In the late stationary phase the activity completely disappears. The second clone of the promoters PlepA and Pl"

In this project the quorum sensing genes luxI and luxR will be used to make so called ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ cells. This was done before by Basu et al [9]
S. Basu, R. Mehreja, S. Thiberge, M. T. Chen, and R. Weiss. Spatiotemporal control of gene expression with pulse-generating networks. PNAS USA, 101(17):6355–6360, April 2004.
. Here, luxI was put behind a constitutive promoter on a plasmid in one strain, and luxR in another. In the latter the LuxR-HSL complex activates certain genes. This is one of the applications where these quorum sensing genes can be used.
Using this signalling mechanism the cells will be defined to have an ON-state, in which they continuously send a signal to their neighbors, and an OFF state in which cells do not send at all. In order for a cell to count the number of neighboring cells in the ON-state we will develop a novel genetic detection mechanism which will be able to distinguish between three types of signals: ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’. In parallel with Conway’s Game of Life these will be assigned the meaning of respectively ‘less than three neighbors in the ON-state’, ‘three neighbors in the ON-state’ and ‘more than three neighbors in the ON-state’. In the lab we aim to engineer these genetic functionalities in order to work in E.coli cells and additionally determine a physical setup such that the E.coli cultures can live and interact in a grid-like, two dimensional environment as they do in Conway’s Game of Life.
To be continued...
As yet we have not succeeded in developing a fully operational system, nevertheless in this report we describe the steps we took towards being able to reproduce Conway’s Game of Life in vivo. The the Design/Interval Switch menu describes the design and workings of the detection mechanism, the interval switch. The complete genetic circuit design and the choice of genetic parts are explained in "" Genetic Circuit "". In "" Physical Setup "" we provide suggestions for a suitable physical setup in which to incorporate the cells. In "" Single-Cell model "" and "" Spatial Model "" computer modeling work is presented and expectations of the system’s behavior are discussed both on the single cell level as well as involving cellular interactions on a grid (spatial"
