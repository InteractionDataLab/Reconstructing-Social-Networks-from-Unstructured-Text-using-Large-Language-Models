However, we don’t know whether 0.1nM is the bottom limit of detection. We speculated that with multiple PC reporters recognizing more sites on one target, enhanced bioluminescence signal could be observed. In that way we could get a relatively high signal at a lower concentration of target DNA. The results confirmed our speculation (Figure 9).

After validating the specificity and sensitivity of PC reporter system. We were eager to apply it to detect the real MTB genome. Fortunately, we got the absolutely safe MTB genomic DNA from Prof. LIU Cuihua (Chinese Academy of Sciences).
First, we used the most popular commercial TB NAD toolkit (TB-LAMP) to amplify MTB genome and found out that there was a large yield of non-specific product after amplification (Figure 10a,b), which could be mistakenly considered as a positive result if using the conventional diagnosis method. However, our PC reporter system can easily distinguish the true from the false (Figure 10c).

(b) Amount of amplified nucleic acid measured using the method provided in TB-LAMP toolkit. (c) Bioluminescence intensity generated by PC reporter, which is able to distinguish the true PCR product from the false.
Then we set out to test whether our PC reporter could be applied to the clinical cases where patients might be in an early stage of TB thus the copies of MTB in their pathological samples could not be that many. The key factor is to figure out the minimum copy numbers of MTB genome in crude sample that can be detected by PC reporter when combined with PCR. We performed a series of dilution on the MTB genome before PCR amplification and found that, when the PCR products are subjected to the measurement, our PC reporter can easily reach the detection limit of only 1 genome copy per tube, which is sensitive enough for real TB diagnosis (Figure 11).

Phenotype of aSTARice
β-carotene is the major compound of Golden Rice. When we endosperm-specifically co-expressed PSY and CrtI genes, the expected phenotype of Golden Rice was obtained (Figure 5). Although re-transformation of Golden Rice using BHY and BKT would get aSTARice (astaxanthin rice), it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, the application of transgene stacking the four genes (PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT) is more effective and easier to directly biosynthesize astaxanthin.
 
Astaxanthin is an orange-red carotenoid. When we directly stacked the four genes in rice and specially expressed in endosperm, the transgenic polished seeds showed pigmentation of orange-red astaxanthin (Figure 5). Wild-type rice remains colorless without astaxanthin accumulation.
Figure 5   The polished grain phenotype of aSTARice. The yellow arrow indicates production of Golden Rice by stacking PSY and CrtI gene (380MF-PC). The black dot arrow indicates the re-transformation method using BHY and BKT genes. The red arrow indicates direct astaxanthin biosynthesis in rice endosperm by stacking PSY, CrtI, BHY and BKT genes (380MF-BBPC).
Astaxanthin content in aSTARice analyzed by HPLC
To confirm the level of synthetic astaxanthin in aSTARice seeds, we used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the pigment composition and astaxanthin content from the methanol extracts of aSTARice and wild-type rice HG1 seeds. Astaxanthin is identified on the basis of retention times related to standard sample. Content is determined by integrating peak areas and converted to concentration. According to the retention time of the standard astaxanthin sample, astaxanthin compound of extracts from aSTARice seeds can be confirmed (Figure 6). The HPLC results also showed that astaxanthin was the predominant carotenoid in aSTARice, and did not exist in wild-type"

Conclusion:
As we’ve obtained and analyzed all data that was compiled at the end of our survey, we came to the conclusion that fossil fuels are a great concern for most of the population and people would do their best to avoid the negative outcomes of fossil fuels’ use by taking action. However, a great portion of attendees showed ignorance to the use use of biofuels as means of renewable energy. Thus, we expanded our human practices to further educate the public about the importance of biofuels, and lead them to take action in this direction for a clean and green future, free from pollution and many other negative impacts caused by fossil fuels’ use.
Meeting with Republic of Turkey Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources Minister Advisor Oğuz Can
At the developing stages of our project, (with the help of our principal investigator and Figen Ar, PhD.)                  we arranged a meeting with the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources Minister Advisor                  “Oğuz Can”, to obtain more information about renewable energy and bioethanol production in our country along                  with the comparison to other countries. He provided significant information that helped us in shaping our work                  and its target population. He stated that the role of renewable energy increases every passing day both in our                  country and the world which encouraged us even further to continue with our work in that direction. He also                  mentioned that biomass energy fields had a lot of improvement and usage potential in the future. Mr. Can explain                  to us that he thinks bioethanol production is essential for the elimination of harmful petroleum-based energy and                  transmission to green energy sources. Moreover, he mentioned that they also work on some projects about producing                  and enhancing the production of bioethanol because of the same purpose as our project.
Though we were aware that bioethanol was blended with the fuels and commonly known for its use in cars, we asked him                  whether bioethanol can also be a potential fuel in air transportation and how can this be possible. He was positive,                  and mentioned Turkish Airlines’ launched project, encapsulating this concern. However, the project did not catch enough                  attention and couldn’t be finalized.
Mr. Can provided us with data about our country’s energy policy suggesting that Turkey imports 97 out of every 100 liters                  of petroleum used. He also told us only 73 thousand tons of petroleum was covered by us in 2 million and 300 thousand tonnes.                  The data portrayed our country’s dependency on others which has aroused wide concern in economic and politic matters.

Sporulation with xylose
It was decided that sporulation of B. subtilis should be done but with using xylose during different times during the sporulation process to test if and when spores are be able to retain competence after activation. The initial culture and addition of xylose (to end up with 1% xylose in culture) to B. subtilis was done by Israt and I added xylose when the culture was added to the SGx2 media before being shaken for 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, I miss interpreted Israt's instructions and put xylose in both cultures, and not just in the one that did not already have xylose in it.  Because of this, is was determined that we would re-do the experiment after making a new batch of xylose (Israt) and SGx2 media (Shelby).
Week 23: September 29 - October 5
Xylose sporulation and SGx2 media
SGx2 media was made for the sporulation process. The recipe was originally obtained from Anna Fei, and was modified  for a smaller volume, as the media tends to get cloudy quickly and then can no longer be used.  The original recipe was for 500 mL total volume and was reduced to 250 mL for our purposes.
Original recipe:
500 mL of distilled water
8 g Difo nutrient broth
1 g KCl
0.5 g MgSO4 • 7H2O
Autoclave above mixture before adding the remaining ingredients
0.5 mL 1 M Ca(NO3)2
0.5 mL 0.1 M MnCl2 • 4H2O
0.5 mL 1 mM FeSO4
1 mL 50% Glucose (filtered)
This recipe was cut in half and was finished being made on September 30, 2014, the same day that culture and xylose was added for the 2-3 day shaking process.
A new batch of B. subtilis was cultured and a new batch of 10% xylose were made by Israt in preparation for the  xylose sporulation of B. subtilis.  She also added xylose (final concentration of 1%) to one of the cultures before shaking for 6-8 hours, resulting in a 1% xylose concentration in the culture, and left the other with out xylose so that it could be added when SGx2 media was added.

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#stakeholders_-_-_TEXT.html," in Koblenz in Germany. Their work consists of the defusal and disposal of unexploded ordnance found in the German Bundesland Rheinland-Pfalz. We met with the head of the organization, Mr. Horst Lenz, with whom we discussed the search and disposal of unexploded ordnance and the possible role the TNT-sensing module of Electrace could play in that.
In Germany, still a lot of unexploded ordnance, mostly remnants from the second world war, is found. When a area of land is developed into a construction site,  contractors have the possibility to screen the area for the possible presence of explosives. This screening was formerly done by the Kampfmittelräumdienst, but as of July 1st 2014, this part of their activities has been cut, a fact Mr. Lenz did not seem too sad about. Not very surprising, since this screening mostly consist of the tediously painstaking study of old photos taken by military planes.  Nowadays, this screening is done by the private companies. “It is big business.” Mr.  Lenz mentioned. “Private companies will ask between €2.500,- and €10.000,- for the screening of a single construction site, which comprises just doing historical review and taking a look on air photographs.”
Mr. Lenz showed us a large number of the photographs they have used for bomb screening purposes.  The images were obtained from the British Air Force.  Lenz: “After an air read, they flew over the area to take pictures and investigate if they had done there work right.” The images, which were of surprisingly high quality taking into account that they had been taken seventy years ago, showed parts of Germany just after being bombarded, displaying impact craters and destroyed buildings. In these pictures, one has to search for small dots indicating unexploded bombs. It is nearly impossible to deduce the presence or absence of bombs from these pictures with an acceptable degree of certainty. Lenz mentioned he felt “like a shaman hovering with his hands over the pictures to pick up signals” when he was searching for bombs on these pictures.
When it is suspected that a certain area contains bombs, the Kampfmittelräumdienst goes over there to thoroughly search the area for bombs with the use of a magnetometer. “Magnetometers sense changes in field lines of the earth’s magnetic field due to the metal in the bomb. A larger bomb has more influence on the magnetic field, but depth, position and shape also matter.” When a signal is picked"
Austin_UTexas,2018,Team:Austin UTexas#Results#Electroporations_-_-_TEXT.html," options for next steps. These involve picking colonies and plating them on new plates to see if they grow normally, and/or sequencing colonies for their barcodes which are specific to origins. This will allow us to check which origins are working. From there on we might want to retransform for further verification.
Electroporation into Mu-Free Donor E. coli
In order to test the BHR kit’s function in a diverse array of organisms, we demonstrated how a one tube plasmid mix, which contained multiple assembly plasmids, could be transformed into DAP auxotrophic Mu-Free Donor (MFD) E. coli cells. These transformed Mu-Free Donors would ultimately be used to conjugate with non-model organisms in which electroporation is not a viable option for transformation. When attempting to conjugate with a target non-model organism, donor cells carrying the BHR plasmids must first be created. Rather than performing an independent transformation with the donor cells for each assembly plasmid, it is more time-efficient to perform a single procedure that transforms all of the assembly plasmids into the donor cells that is followed by a selection of the recovered cells. In this demonstration, we show the how the one tube transformation can easily be applied to Mu-Free Donors for conjugation.
Figure 4: Transformation of One-Tube Reaction Into Mu-Free Donor E. coli. The above photos show LB plates with varying types of antibiotics. MFD E. coli were electroporated, recovered in SOC media, and plated. Although very few different reporters can be seen (sGFP dominates each plate except on CRB), it is possible that multiple plasmids were transformed into cells on the plates.
Electrocompetent MFU donors were electroporated with a single mix of DNA containing eight assembly plasmids. This eight-assembly mix consisted of two plasmids conferring AMP resistance, two plasmids conferring CAM resistance, three plasmids conferring KAN resistance, and a single plasmid conferring TET resistance. Therefore, the selective plates used to plate the transformation recoveries were AMP, CAM, KAN, and TET plates.

Dev's gel of second restriction digest of E0040+B0015
Miniprep
Today we spent a considerable portion of the day miniprepping our overnight cultures of all of our parts from yesterday.  We eluted in new water and we're hoping that this will solve some of our problems that we've been having with the parts that we've transformed from the regitsry.
Team Meeting
This afternoon, we also had a team meeting.  We talked a bit about what each team member has been working on this week.  We also discussed some possoble solutions for some of the problems that we have been having with not seeing bands on gels as well as having problems digesting mnay of the parts from the registry.
This weekend we shall be heading off to Lethbridge as a team for a regional workshop with Alberta Innovates Technology Futures and the University of Alberta and University of Lethbridge teams.
Patrick
Today, I miniprepped the samples of cpxP in pSB1A3 for screening purposes. After this, I digested the pieces with XbaI and SpeI enzymes. They have been frozen to run in a gel next week.
Dev
Today, I did a second reconstruction of the E0040+B0015 construct. Bands were found in the wrong base pair range.
Alex
Today we mini-prepped plasmid from the cpxp overnight colonies, also we did a digest of the plasmids to screen if the plasmid was inserted directionally, or if the Xba and Spe scarred onto each other. We didn’t have time to start of a gel of the digested plasmids.

Ethical question
Among you there are persons who think that in a good science project, not only the fundamental science counts, but also the implementation of the eventual products, or, in short: what it means for society. But what does this mean for iGEM? Do we have to consider the impact on society of any application (without further definition of end products)? To what extent do we have to take issues relating to commercialization into account? It is already clear that all of you have different opinions on this matter. But this doesn't mean we can't think about the main question for this week:
Which advise can we give to the iGEM organizers at MIT on this matter?

Sequence Verification
Sequence from plasmid
For verification of Tn5-lin insertion in pACYC, primers 003, 012, 029 and 030 were used for sequencing. The sequencing starts from the -20 bp position of fragment Tn5-lin, flanking the promoter of T7 and terminator from T7 of the vector. Sequencing sample was prepared in 1.5 mL tubes for each primer as indicated my Macrogen for specific concentration of plasmid DNA.
Primer sequences can be found at: Primer sequences .
Within 2 days, the sequence was retrievable online and alignment with the in silico designed molecule showed 100% match of the insert lin-Tn5, by aligning both primer sequences obtained.

Since the research strategy of systems biology is well fit to analyze the biological complex systems. I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.

Our Solution
The results above did not sound good to us, but there was another experiment that interested us in the same research. Researchers also conducted oral test with artificial PBAN/pyrokinin analogs (Fig.3-3-1), in this experiment, they fed moths with sugar solution which contained their PBAN analogs, and measured the amount of pheromone produced over time. (Blank: natural PBAN in low concentration) This result inspired us. Although natural PBANs can’t be maintained for a long time in moth’s body, we could solve this problem by simply feeding moths with high concentration PBANs continually.
Fig.3-3-1 Amount of pheromone, relative to the maximum pheromone amount induced by injected PBAN, produced by Hyp-analog and Oic-analog, 1.5, 3, 4, and 6h following oral administration. Dotted line at 100% denotes maximal pheromone production of injected PBAN (positive control). This figure shows a very important information that blank (natural PBAN in low concentration：50 pmol, the blank was measured when it was 2 hr after feeding with nature PBAN) still has some ability to stimulate pheromone production. Thus, we decided to try to feed the female target insects with high concentration PBAN continuously.(Ronald J. Nachmana, Peter E.A. Teal, Allison Strey, 2002)
Thus, as long as female moths suck the high concentration PBAN solution continuously, the PBAN in the moths’ body will be replenished continually even if peptidase degradation occurs. Then, there is a high possibility of PBAN being absorbed by the moths’ body from the digestive system and succeed in stimulating the pheromone gland. Thus, if we feed the female insects with high concentration PBAN solution continuously, the female insects will produce pheromones for us, which theoretically solves the problem of PBAN's inability to maintain for a long time in the insects’ body. As to how we produce PBAN and apply our concept to capture wanted harmful insects, we will explain in the following.
How We Are Going to Use PBAN?

Central China Conference (July 7~July9)
Invited by HUST-China team, we participated in the Central China Conference in Wuhan. In the conference, we shared our project idea with other team members, including Jilin_China, Nanjing-China, WHU-iGEM, HZAU-China, ShanghaiTechChina_B and NUDT_CHINA iGEM team. Through the discussion, we came up with fresh new points and solutions for the projects. Obviously, all of us got great suggestions to improve projects further for the Giant Jamboree.
2016 NCTU Meetup (July 31)
This summer, we invited three iGEM teams in Taiwan. They were Mingdao, NTHU_Taiwan, and CGU_Taiwan. As a warm-up for Asia-Pacific Conference, the meetup set up as a stage for each team to present their progress of the project in this summer and exchange ideas and experiences.
Additionally, we arranged some other activities, including campus guide and playing the simulative board game. Also, NTHU_Taiwan guided all of us to enjoy the beauty of National Tsing Hua University as well for the two schools are adjacent. All of us have established friendships among teams, and we all had an exciting and fruitful day in NCTU.
Conversation with Aachen iGEM Team (August 3)
NCTU_Formosa and iGEM Aachen had a Skype video chat. In the online chat, we grasped the project bilaterally and exchanged opinions. Apart from exchanging academic opinion, we had a great conversation in the history of the team, habits and also the simulative board game we designed “Pest Crisis’’. In the conversation, we gained better understandings of each other in science and culture.

At 20 hours [DNA.(LuxR.AHL)2] begins to rise rapidly, signifying the quorum sensing transition. It is one of the first bacteria in the colony to transition into QS, thanks to its central position.
Progression of [AHL] dynamics on the small agar plate of simulation 2. Left: spatial distribution of [AHL] on the agar cylinder as it evolves in time. Same geometry as on [figure 13b][here] (cylinder axis on the left, rim on the right, surface on top). During the first 10sec (video time), the dynamics are dominated by the colony’s outwards growth. This expansion phase prevents AHL from reaching critical concentrations and delays QS. After the colony growth slows down, the spatial maximum in [AHL] stops moving and grows slowly. In this case, there are many more bacteria occupying a much larger area than in simulation 1. At 14sec the quorum sensing transition begins, but the visualization appears quite different than in simulation 1. One reason for this is that the larger area the bacteria occupy produces a phase difference between them, with those that are further away from the [AHL] maximum taking more time to reach QS. The transition is therefore more gradual. After 16sec, most bacteria have transitioned and the rapid increase in AHL production is evident by the sharpening spatial distribution. Right top: total amount of AHL in the agar plate. Right bottom: maximum [AHL] from the left graph at each time step.

S11 split inteins
Interestingly, there seem to exist only very few inteins with small C-terminal halves. The shortest and therefore most suitable  were the S11 split inteins, engineered and thoroughly, but solely described by Lin et al. [11] . S11 inteins are engineered from mini-inteins, meaning that, unlike most other inteins, they do not have an internal homing endonuclease domain. Naturally, they are not trans-, but cis-splicing inteins and their crystal structure reveals twelve β-strands. To gain very small C-terminal split inteins, they were artificially separated between the 11th and 12th β-strand resulting in a 120-160 aa N- and 6 aa C-intein. We decided to use the Ssp DnaX, Ssp GyrB and Ter DnaE3 inteins since there properties were promising i.e. they showed the highest splicing activity.

Initially a screening for the caging of three different S11- inteins, namely SspDnaX, SspGyrB and TerDnaE-3, at various positions within the J-alpha helix of the LOV domain was planned (Figure 2). The best split fluorescent protein was thought to provide an easy read-out for the best combination of caging position and C-terminal split intein. Unfortunately, we encountered many problems: the assembly construct with two insertion sides in which the LOV domain ought to be embedded for an easy exchange of caging positions via golden gate cloning was not ready at this time point. Secondly, a screening for the best split fluorescent protein turned out to be more time intensiv than expected.
Figure 2) Planned Caging Positions
Originally intended plan to clone 3 different C - inteins in 4 different postions.
Therefore we designed a fast track cloning strategy with solely two caging positions of one intein in the alpha-helix and two split fluorescent proteins(Figure 3). In case of the S11- inteins, we chose SspDnaX, since they it was described as the most efficient C-terminal S11 intein [11] . Previous studies showed that the amino acid sequence of the J-alpha helix in front of the isoleucine at position 539 (I539) should not be changed, in order to preserve its"

Stockholm,2017,Team:Stockholm#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," probably our most interesting answer as this clearly states that there is a need for a new effective medicine targeting mucus. Although we have to take into account that over 60 % are satisfied with their treatments. After going through the answers individually, we concluded that the patients suffering the worst from excessive mucus are not satisfied with their current treatment as it does not target mucus, whereas patients with milder mucus production are more satisfied with their treatment. About 40% said yes to a medication being a GMO, and the rest stated maybe. 50% said the most suitable device would be any type of inhaler. The rest of the solutions, such as an orally dissolving tablet (ODT), injection and a surgically implanted device had a similar small percentage.
From the results we obtained from our surveys, we decided to create personas. Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. By writing about personas we are able to emphasize the need and to put our reader in the skin of the person suffering the disease.
David
David is 12 years old and was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when he was just a baby. David loves being outdoors and doing sports, but unfortunately, he has to spend many hours inside taking his medicines and doing his breathing exercises. Last week he missed three classes in school due to his doctor's appointments, and now he has to change medicine again, as the current one is not as optimal as before. David hopes that he will grow older than his grandparents and that in the future there will be a cure for cystic fibrosis.

4. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project, and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
For our project we came up with two reporter ideas for our diagnostics device. The first plan was to use Hemerythrin. Hemerythrin when bound to iron, in the presence of oxygen, undergoes a conformational change. That change results in a colour change from colourless to pink. Our team tried Hemerythrins from three different species. Mc Hemerythrin

The second reporter idea was attaching a ryhB binding sequence to GFP. In the absence of iron, ryhB siRNA binds to ryhB binding site and marks GFP mRNA for degradation. In the presence of iron, the Fur regulator represses ryhB, and GFP is fully translated. We used two different promoters from the Registry [

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"Figure 5. Amplification of the target fragment and introduction of the PAM sequence synthetically.
Although miRNAs are potentially very valid candidates as biomarkers, they are associated with some hurdles (particularly low abundance) which are not completely overcome by currently existing detection methods ( Miao et al., 2015 ).
Among different recent amplification techniques, Rolling Circle Amplification has been proved to be one of the most suitable, thanks to its robustness, simplicity, specificity and high sensitivity ( Cheng et al., 2009 ). Rolling-Circle Amplification (RCA) is an isothermal amplification (contrarily for instance to Polymerase Chain Reaction) where miRNA (or another short RNA or DNA sequence) is amplified by means of a circular DNA template (i.e. a probe) and a special DNA (or RNA) polymerase: the miRNA acts as a primer, with the RCA product (i.e. the amplicon) consisting in a concatemer containing tens to hundreds of tandem repeats that are complementary to the probe ( Ali et al., 2014 ).
Toehold-initiated Rolling Circle Amplification (tiRCA), in particular, employs phi-29 DNA polymerase and is based on structure-switchable dumbbell-shaped probes ( Deng et al., 2014 ): upon hybridization with the specific target miRNA, one of the two strands of the double-stranded region of the probe is displaced, resulting in an ""activated"" circular form of the probe with triggers the start of the RCA reaction. The complete mechanism of RCA is shown in Figure 6:
Figure 6. Schematic representation of the tiRCA reaction. miRNA is represented in magenta, the dumbbell-shaped probe is shown in light blue and the amplicon in green.
Although it is the probe - and not directly the miRNA - to be amplified, RCA allows to significantly increase the concentration of the miRNA sequence in solution: indeed, since a large portion of the probe is complementary to the miRNA, the amplicon of the probe will incorporate several copies of the original miRNA. This can theoretically be exploited to increase the sensitivity of an assay for quantification of miRNA. As later explained, while our Amplification step was mostly inspired by Qiu et al., 2018 , we explored a new, ambitious Detection step after RCA based on Cas12a (and not on Cas9 and split reporter proteins). This implied designing new probes with specific characteristics for Cas12a, as explained in the following sections.

Subtilosin-A is a bacteriocin, antimicrobial peptide that was first discovered in Bacillus subtilis 168. Subtilosin-A is classified as a class V bacteriocin because it has unique circular structure compared to another bacteriocin. The circular structure of this protein is caused by disulfide bond that formed in post-translation modification
Subtilosin A was coded by SboA gene that exist in the genome of many strains of B.subtilis. Modification proteins that help post-translational modification of Subtilosin A are located downstream. Genes that encode modification proteins of Subtilosin A was AlbA, AlbB, AlbC, AlbD, AlbE, AlbF, and AlbG. Aside from post-modifying the Subtilosin-A, some of the genes also transport the Subtilosin-A to extracellular compartment. SboA gene and AlbA-AlbG genes make a complex cluster of gene called operon. SboA operon is about 6816 base pairs, meanwhile SboA gene itself only 132 basepairs with its protein weight about 40 kDa (43 amino acid).
There are three possibilities of the mechanism of action of Subtilosin A.
The first possibility that cause cell death is interaction of Subtilosin A within receptor in cell membrane and its trigger cell lysis.
Second possibility is interaction of Subtilosin A to membrane plasma that cause disorientation of phospholipids which will make pore in cell membrane.
Third possibility is Subtilosin A cause malfunction of some chemical pathway that will disturb physiology of cell. Recent observation shows that Subtilosin A tied directly to membrane plasma.
Subtilosin A tied with membrane plasma at high concentration because this protein has its function when it was multimeric, it has to tied up with another Subtilosin A before it could tied with membrane plasma and disorientate its phospholipids. Subtilosin A become monomeric when concentraiion of this protein is below 16.4 uM.  Beside of Subtilosin A concentration, type of membrane plasma also factor that affecting Subtilosin A activity.

We tested these (MFCs) extensively and found that there are two crucial keys to success for these cells. These two things include: optimal connections between adjoining MFCs and standardization of the size within each component of the MFC. We troubleshooted the first problem by hand-building an acrylic compression system to hold the MFCs in place. The MFCs are also readily disposable by flame, which will sterilize any biohazard, and are easy to use.  We unfortunately were unable to finish troubleshooting the second main problem but managed to obtain up to 1.8mA of current across six MFCs that maintained good connections. We would want to standardize the MFCs by 3D printing them which would allow for optimal connections and a successful system as displayed in the literature (1).

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#test#max#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," We explore the possibilities of ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system and the hurdles to overcome with these strategies. As iGEM UNL is working on E. Coli and iGEM Amsterdam on the production of  fumarate, we first define a strategy to make a fumarate producing E. Coli mutant. Then we assess the mechanism to reduce methane emissions with fumarate. Finally, we explore different ways to deliver fumarate in the cow digestive system.
How E. Coli can produce fumarate
E. Coli can in theory produce fumarate by an oxidative (aerobic) or a reductive (anaerobic) route. In the latter case, the fumarate molecule itself is used as a final electron donor in this process, which is believed to be coupled with cell growth in anaerobic conditions (Iverson et al. , 1999). It is assumed that for this reason, it is not possible to genetically engineer E. Coli to produce fumarate in anaerobic conditions (Song et al. , 2013). This is problematic,as the cattle rumen is anaerobic.
Now if it would be possible to introduce E. Coli in aerobic conditions in the cow’s digestive system, we would be able to use aerobically producing fumarate E. coli strains. For this, we could imitate a genetic engineering strategy used by the iGEM Amsterdam project.
How team Amsterdam produces fumarate in Cyanobacteria
In the Cyanobacterial model organism Synechocystis PCC 6803 , iGEM team Amsterdam managed to produce fumarate in a genetically stable, growth-coupled way, by knocking out the fumarase encoding fumaric acid hydratase (fumC) gene.
How we can apply the Amsterdam genetic engineering strategy in E. Coli
To apply a similar approach in E. Coli and to end up with a respectable titer, multiple gene knock-outs are required. E. Coli has more fumarase encoding genes, then Synechoscystis,  namely anaerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumB) and aerobic class I fumaric acid hydratase (fumA), which both need to be knocked out as well (Song et al. , 2013). Knocking out the Fumarase proteins leads to a dysfunctional or a ‘broken’ TCA-cycle, since malate cannot be formed anymore from fumarate. This impairs"

The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been widely used in plant research, as it can transform plant cells with the help of the Ti-plasmid (tumor-inducing plasmid). A. tumefaciens is able to utilize the uncommon carbon and energy source GBL found in plants. To do this, the bacterium uses the enzymes of the blcABC operon ( Chai et al. 2007 ). This operon is localized on the second megaplasmid of A. tumefaciens C58 strain, pAtC58. blcABC expression is controlled by the repressor protein BlcR . When GBL is not present, two dimers of BlcR form a tetramer and inhibit operon expression by binding to an operator sequence localized in front of the operon, thereby hindering the polymerase from transcribing the DNA ( Pan et al. 2011, 2013) . The inhibition of operon repression was shown to be inducible not only by GBL, but even more so by GHB and SSA (succinic semialdehyde) ( Chai et al. 2007 ).
The enzymes coded for in the blcABC operon catalyze the reaction of GHB to GBL in a first step (Figure). If GBL is taken up by an organism containing the operon, it is processed to GHB, facilitating increased induction. Further, GHB is processed to SSA that finally enters the GABA pathway. Therefore, the operon enables the chassis to utilize GHB or GBL as carbon and nitrogen source. It has been shown that the transformation of the operon enables E. coli to grow on GBL as sole carbon source. ( Carlier et al. 2004 ). Hence, the induction might be increased by the additional transformation of the operon containing blcA in further experiments.
Molecular function of BlcR repression and derepression in A. tumefaciens.
The BlcR tetramer binds the operator site which is overlapping to the blcABC promoter and precents transcription of the operon. In the presence of GBL or GHB, BlcR is inactivated and can not bind to the DNA. The blcABC operon is transcribed.

We                                         made a quick trial into the recreation of burn assay into our cellular lines,                                         we obtained interesting results showing that the exposure of 15, 30 and 60                                         seconds to PBS at approximately 80oC showed a decrease in cell morphology and                                         cell viability, the results were obtained by cell counting in Neubauer chamber                                         with trypan blue and microscope visualization.
Hardware
We came to a possible proposal of a skin chip and designed a 3D model including                                         the mechanisms, the proper calculations and how to automate the system. This                                         model still very naive and is needed to get proper correction in order to create the first design of the skin chip.
Interlab
The parts of iGEM kit plate distribution was transformed in E. coli DH5 alpha                                         strain and alkaline plasmid extraction was performed and agarose gel analysis                                         was done to verify plasmid existence. Calibration and cell measurement                                         protocols were performed and submitted in the wiki                                         (https://2018.igem.org/Team:TecCEM/InterLab).
Week 29th
29 July- 4 August.
Summary
This week was the last week of summer break so we had to work harder than ever.                                         A briefing about what was done during the summer was broken down in a meeting                                         and a new planification of objectives was done.
Wet lab
We performed the transformation of all project parts (BBCOL5, BBLEP and BBTNC5)                                         into protein production strains such as BL21(DE3) and Rosetta (DE3). After                                         alkaline plasmid extraction and analysis in electrophoresis we could conclude                                         that the existence of the parts project BBLEP and BBTNC5 were achieved, even                                         though several more analysis must be performed in order to obtain significant                                         results. In the case of BBCOL5 an experiment of induction/non induction was                                         performed to analyse if the ligation product was a re-ligation of iGEM plasmid,                                         the results obtained concluded that the part was indeed a re- ligation product                                         and for so on BBCOL5 ligation was discarded as part of the project but used as                                         a medium to obtaining RFP for nanoencapsulation experiments.

Who is good at what? We need to start thinking about how we are going to divvy up lab work. - We need to write out specific protocols. - We will partner up. - We will set aside time at the beginning of the summer to simply write out protocols and seriously and thoroughly learn all of the procedures. - Overall, we need a good wetlab plan as soon as possible. PUF stuff : - The PUF sequences have been put in the iGEM dropbox. - Why do we need the PUF sequences? Because we need to design primers. o Yellow = 8 PUF repeats o We got this from UniProt, searching for PUF1. The information from this site has been put on the Word File in the dropbox. o An alternative search site is the NCBI, using search “Protein”. - Biobrick foundation website has lots of assembly methods. Using RFC, we get the biobrick prefix and suffix for the PUF coding sequence. These prefix/suffixes contains restriction sites. *****put website from the green handout here ******** - Plasmid backbone: pSB1c3 (this is what we submit our biobrick in). pSB=plasmid synthetic biology. C= colminithol resistance. A map of this backbone can be found on the parts registry to physically see the restriction sites. - Annotation is getting sent to everyone.
iGEM Advisor’s Meeting 4/24/12 Conference Call with Dr. Zefeng Wang_of UNC___ - Slide #2 – 2 constructs (one with PUF binding, one without). The one without the PUF binding site gives YFP because it can be translated. Dr. Wang wonders if this will this work? - Currently there are no papers about the prokaryotic recognition sequences. Dr. Wang thinks it will not work. He recommends changing to a reporter that will work. - Papers suggest that PUF binds to the 3’ UTR in eukaryotic cells. We are unsure of if this will work in prokaryotic cells. No one knows exactly how PUF works in eukaryotes – they recruit other factors that stop translation. These other factors might not exist in prokaryotes. - There is a paper that claims PUF has worked in prokaryotic cells, but no plasmid was included in that paper. - Yeast 3 hybrid system works"

cwlD: When knocked out, germination occurred at a rate of 0.003 to 0.05%. This gene codes for recognition components for cleavage by the germination-specific cortex lytic enzymes.
By knocking out all five of these genes, our goal was to yield a B. subtilis strain which produces spores completely incapable of germination. Germination is stopped during the process of spore coat breakdown. Without the lytic enzymes to break down the coat, the spores should be unable to outgrow into the vegetative stage.

Germination Gene Knockout Success!
Two methods were employed to knock out germination genes: replacement by resistance cassettes and clean deletions. Resistance cassette knockouts were generated by using long-flanking homology PCR (see Protocols ). Single knockouts were created first using different resistance cassettes; then they were combined to create multiple knockouts. A graphical representation of the genome with all gene replacements can be seen in Fig 3.
Fig. 3: Schematic representation of the B. subtilis chromosome with four germination genes replaced by different resistance cassettes. For more information about these knockout strains, please see our Strain Collection .
The germination rate of our mutants was checked with a germination assay , shown in Fig. 4. The assay was developed based on published protocols ( Harwood, Cutting (1990) Molecular Methods for Bacillus subtilis. Wiley ).
Fig. 4: The germination rates of B. subtilis germination mutants. All germination rates are relative to wild type 168 (W168), our positive control. W168 showed near 100% germination rates. The mutant spo0A::tet is unable to form spores, and should therefore show no germination (our negative control). Our results were consistent with this expectation."

UFAM-UEA_Brazil,2016,Team:UFAM-UEA Brazil#Project#MerOperon_-_-_TEXT.html," of mercury resistance and bioremediation by microorganisms.  Each component of the mer operon orchestrates meticulously with each other, and MerA is a  key component on it. Source: Bioremediation of mercury and importance of mer genes.
Mercuric ion reductase needs contribution of a NADPH molecule, able to offer  the reductive power that turns Hg(II) into Hg0. MerA also may work alongside  MerB, another gene from the operon which codifies the enzyme  organomercurial liase, capable of break the bonds between mercury and  organic radicals (organomercury), leaving Hg(II) available to the following  mercuric ion reductase reduction. Since organomercury ties itself in biological  tissues, it can be accumulated in living organisms and biomagnified through  food chain, till it reaches humans. So, the cooperation of MerA and MerB is  essential to the effectiveness of the bioremediation system.
Structure and mechanism:
Mercuric ion reductase presents itself as an homodimer. It has two terminal  sites, each containing a pair of cysteines: a short and mobile C-terminal and a  long N-terminal. The C-terminal cysteines of one monomer would lie next to the  redox-active cysteines of the other. Together, these four cysteines engage in  Hg(II) binding at the active site but, alone, don’t take part in Hg(II) reduction. C-  terminal cysteines are responsible for catching Hg(II) ions from solution and  delivering them to the active site, where the pair of inner cysteines would  establish chemical bonds with mercury. C-terminal cysteines would also provide  a pathway to remove basic thiolates at the active site before mercury binding,  since the presence of negative charge would inhibit reduction.
Figure 02: General structure of MerA homodimer. Source: Xray Structure of a Hg2+ Complex of  Mercuric Reductase (MerA) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical Study of Hg2+ Transfer between the CTerminal and Buried Catalytic Site Cysteine Pairs.
Since N-terminal site has several similarities with MerP periplasmatic mercury  transporter protein it was suggested that this domain would be part of mercury  capture mechanism, but mutagenesis studies have ruled out this hypothesis.  The role of N-terminal in general enzyme function was unclear until very  recently. It facilitates the"

About half of the respondents said that they didn’t know what aflatoxin is or had little knowledge of it. Nearly 75% respondents never knew that Pu’er tea might be infected by AFT. With a brief introduction passage of AFT attached to the questionnaire, we made our effort in raising public awareness on food safety.
Through the survey we can also see that the respondents are worried about the possible contamination of Pu’er tea and is willing to accept our product of detecting and degrading of AFT. This greatly strengthened our confidence in benefiting people’s health through our project.

Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from iDUET101a contained the full functional promoter region annotated in pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen). We believed that EF-1alpha did trigger transcription but failed to translate the GFP coding sequence due to insufficient 5’ untranslated region (UTR). After the regional jamboree, the promoter was re-cloned with additional 3' sequences after the identified TATA box to allow a longer 5’ untranslated region before the GFP coding DNA sequence. From the the results above, we believed that translation of GFP is successful this time.
Conclusion
The EF-1alpha promoter is fully functional and has a weaker transcriptional strength than the CMV promoter in HEK293FT cells.

AHL combines with the product of luxR, and they act in concert to  repress the function of promoter R0063. As a result, the MIN system cannot  work. However, AHL will be degraded by the proteins expressed by Aii gene. As  the population of E.coli grows, the concentration of AHL gradually decreases.  When it reaches a threshold value, AHL lose the ability to bind with the  product of luxR. Then the depression of MIN will be removed. MinC proteins and  MinD proteins can bind with each other to form MinCD division inhibitors. The  inhibitors can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of  cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all  the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves.
We use a classical model, density-dependent  growth model, for our population of E.coli growing simulation. Also we use some  other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR  proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
 
M
The    concentration of total MinC proteins
N
Cell    density
R
The    concentration of total proteins[LuxR]
A
The    number of AHL signal
k
Growth    constant
kA
The    binding rate between AHL and LuxR proteins
kM
Production    rate of MinC.
kR
The    production rate of LuxR proteins
d
The    death rate related with MinC proteins.
di
The    degradation rate of materials.
Then we use these equations to simulate the function  of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
 
Figure 1. The dynamic change of  cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell  stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of  LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
 
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC  proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of  E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is  removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell  division process is inhibited.

Northwestern,2017,Team:Northwestern#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html,"en’s controversial price increase.
Dr. London emphasized the importance of physician-patient relationships and public health policy to lowering the rate of antibiotic overuse. Hospitals are essentially hotbeds of bacteria, more so than individual physician practices. People without insurance (due to de funding) also have the tendency to wait until things are bad before rushing to the emergency room, where carers unfamiliar with the patient prescribe antibiotics “just in case” the problem is a bacterial infection, which it's often not.  Dr. London believes our project is a clever idea, as antibiotic resistance must be attacked on all fronts with as many new ideas possible. The onus, however, lies with us to educate the public about gene editing, which often sounds like a dangerous idea to the average citizen.
Takeaway: We tried to take Dr.Londons emphasis on educating the average citizen that genetically modified does not inherently correspond to something negative. For example, while presenting to CTD students, we made an “ethical consideration slide” that balanced the pros and cons of potential genetic engineering applications. Projects such as experimental mosquito (i.e to fight Zika) or GMO foods often get a bad rep in the media, but have many positives such as disease eradication and feeding hungry populations.
Interview with Dr. Levy
Dr. Levy is the director of the Center of Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. He studies how Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells adapt to environmental signals and hazards. Currently, Dr. Levy is studying the efflux of the Tet Protein and Tetracycline use.
Dr. Levy thinks that the fight against antibiotic resistance should be multifaceted. Treatments to aid conventional antibiotics should be developed, as well as new antibiotics. From his knowledge, Dr. Levy thought that are proposed gened editing therapy was feasible and that ""young individuals should be able to try out new techniques"". As an afterthought, he mentioned that a easy way to fight antibiotic resistance is swap out your toothbrush multiple times a year, especially after sickness.
Takeaway: Our interview with Dr. Levy gave us confidence that our project could potentially be feasible. Dr. Levy was very encouraging and supportive of the scientific process. However, he gave us advice to do failure analysis on our solution. Often times, treatments improve in some areas over their predecessors and fall short in others.

By promoting SE, we can achieve the same level of system output with fewer resources (i.e., lower chain generation rates).  It should be noted that since the TC chain is no longer likely to contribute to system output after losing its transcription factor, using the TC chain to measure SE is a bit of a hassle. However, the structure of the PC chain is always the same, which means that we can easily measure $SE$ with parameters related to PC chain.   Therefore, we advance the birth-death process model above to an ordinary continuous-time Markov chain, in order to research the behavior of a PC chain. The state transition diagram of the advanced model is shown in Figure 7. The meaning of each state the PC chain can be in is as follows:       State 1: (free state) it moves freely on the cell membrane,     State 2: (semi-bonded state) it binds to an exogenous ligand,     State 3: (effective binding state) it binds to a TC chain with the help of exogenous ligand, so that they may produce transcription factors,     State 4: (invalid binding state) it binds to a TC chain without transcription factor with the help of exogenous ligand, which means it is occupied but cannot help produce transcription factors.
Figure 7. State transition diagram of the Markov process.
Using the theory of stochastic process[5], we find the analytical solution of the stability probability of this chain in each state after a long enough time, which can help measure system efficiency. Hence, we obtain the relationship between the binding abilities of the two chains to the exogenous ligand.
Conclusion
Through the equations obtained from the model (Eqs. 42, 43 and 44 in Section 2.2 of our entire model report ), it follows that under the condition that our basic system does not contain a specific degradation pathway to free TC chain out of transcription factor, we cannot increase system efficiency by changing binding abilities. However, if we design the pathway, it will be feasible to increase system efficiency by improving the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand or reducing that of the TC chain and exogenous ligand, which is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8. Effect of the binding abilities on system efficiency under the condition of the existence of a degradation pathway to free TC chain out of transcription factor. λ1 are negatively correlated with the binding ability of the PC chain and exogenous ligand, and λ2 are negatively correlated with that of the TC chain and exogenous ligand.

Making standard for regulatory relations Update Database Improve SBOL Redesign LGD Cooperate with the Registry of Standard Biological Parts Promote the software Back to Homepage
Making standard for regulatory relationships
So far, we have made standard for logical gene module and genetic circuit (RFC 101 and RFC 97 version 2.0). In order to store and share the regulatory relationships between biological parts in circuit, we need a standard to standardize those relationships and give logic symbol to describe them.
To achieve this goal, we need
1 A complete standard of logical gene module.All of the logic genetic gates could be described in our standard,and all the inputs ,outputs and related variables could be quantified. As a result, any logic genetic gates in any genetic circuits could be simplified into a logical gene module.
2 All the stimulants and products could be quantified.  Credible equantion could be applied to thess signals and the prediction can reflect biological phenomena.
Updating Database
The information stored in the database is not perfect now. We will update our database both from structure and content in the next version. The structure can be improved to coordinate the new version genetic circuit standard . More and better quality of circuits will be recorded from collecting and uploading.
Also, the database would collect all of the experiment data in the world for each circuit, and an actual measurement would be taken by our wet lab to ensure the working state of these circuit. In the anticipation, the database will be non-redundant, so that  all of the high rank circuits we provided will be useful and well reproductive.
Further more, we will collect and call for more information for those incomplete circuits, such as useful parts or useful genes or measured data, to help build them successful.
Improving SBOL
We will add our software to SBOL’s website as an example of how to use SBOL and join in the g+ group of SBOL to build a better SBOL support.

IISc-Bangalore,2017,Team:IISc-Bangalore#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," by BioBrick assembly, improving the initial ribosome-mRNA binding and thereby increasing the rate of translation.
Figure 1: the amino acids glycine (left), serine (center) and threonine (right)
The AgeI site was chosen to simplify assembly of fusion proteins in this backbone: by inserting a protein coding sequence at the N-terminus of the existing protein using the HindIII and AgeI sites, a fusion protein can be formed with a benign scar. The AgeI site (A\CCGGT) is translated in-frame to Thr-Gly, amino acids commonly used in linker sequences for fusion proteins. Threonine's hydroxyl group makes it hydrophilic — allowing stabilizing interactions with the aqueous cellular environment — while glycine's small size makes the linker more flexible, allowing both protein domains to fold independently. In addition, the AgeI site is useful if the user wishes to transfer an RFC25-compatible fusion protein (Freiburg format) into our expression system.
Our Second Modification — BBa_K2319004 (TAAG)
A stop codon (TAA) and the nucleotide G are added immediately upstream of BBa_K731721 (T7 terminator). This extra stop codon (assuming the fusion protein sequence has its own) ensures that translation is halted and prevents any translational read-through. The extra nucleotide G is added for a more subtle purpose: when placed just before the T7 terminator sequence (5'-CTAGC...TTTTG-3'), it forms the NheI restriction site (G\CTAGC). This allows any fusion protein to be inserted into our expression backbone using the HindIII and NheI sites.
Using the T7 expression backbone
Figure 2: T7 expression backbone showing HindIII, AgeI and NheI sites
Expressing any protein of interest
This T7 expression backbone can be used to express any protein if its coding sequence (with a start codon) is inserted using the HindIII and NheI sites. These sites can be added to the coding sequence using PCR with primers having 5'-overhangs.
Fusing a protein domain at the N-terminus of an existing protein
By inserting the coding sequence of a protein domain (including the start codon) using the HindIII and AgeI sites into the T7 expression backbone (which already contains a protein coding sequence), an N-terminal fusion can be performed.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," But otherwise it is that of surveillance where we see Oh these [...] people [...] have trachoma! We intervene. When one comes and says: Oh there is one here. we will deal with it like that. So with this information we will trying to be very fast and very clear. So that will be my role in BICO. The Ministry of health, [...] the trust, [...] the WHO they need this type of following up. Anything that comes up should be noticed. So we are taking over establishing that type of networking, especially with clinicians. If they see anything, they have to notify me and I am supposed to copy. Other people who are also doing some surveillance they also need to copy me. So I am supposed to find out who are those people keeping data. Like HIA’s . This is something they send it to my e-mail or they send it to this server of BICO. Something like that, so we know exactly what is happening.
Daniel C.:
How many months have you now been at BICO?
George:
Working for BICO? I can say one month [laughing]. [...] I was working full time in the Ministry of Health. Because these things are happening much in the southern part of Malawi, but I was working in the northern part, [...] they tried to make me come to this side. So to come here, it is just one month. So that’s why I said I am new [laughing].
Daniel C.:
But you also worked in this area when you were in the northern part.
George:
Yes.
Daniel C.:
And is it different, the northern part of Malawi and the southern part?
George:
Yes, very. Because in the North we don’t have [trachoma]. I come from there also and there is no such a disease. I was there, I talked to Prof. Kalua and I said: Why are you not coming to our region? and he said: Yeah George, we don’t have that disease at that side. And I said: No, no, no, I think we have. And then I think he sent some people to do the survey and they found that the disease is not there. So we hope it’s true that the disease is not there. That’s why we are thinking about is it culture? Is it what? Why is it not found there but it is found in other places? That is difficult to know. Because we can’t say in the North people are rich, or they are hygienic, or they are what. I don’t know is it culture"

Welcome to iGEM Göttingen
iGEM is an international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""biobricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further biobricks by the participating iGEM teams. These biobricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already 165 universities from all over the world competed against each"

So we integrated our activities into local activities that people choose to participate in the weekends. We want to convey a concept that “science can be a part of their life, and their engagement do matters”.    In that way, we need to prepare some funny things to attract people’s attention. Various creative educational tools are designed by team members. We think about using a stall that integrates these tools to introduce synthetic biology and our project to the public. The stalls were put up in different places, such as the exhibition hall of STEM festival and the information hall of a science & technology museum. And we adjusted the types of the tools and the way to communicate with people in the process of activities conducting.
Video about synthetic biology for kids
Applicable age range: 5-15
    Kids like stories, and it always a good way to convey some basic concept in stories. So we made a video about synthetic biology, in which a story of a bacterium changing itself by means of synthetic biology was told. It conceals some proper nouns, and focus on sparking new curiosity of the kids.
Room escape game
Applicable age range: 15-35
    Speech filled with proper nouns will make people unwilling to recept the information. But game can always fascinates people. Have you ever feel learning motivation is extremely high during the game time?    Taking that phenomenon into consideration, we think about designing a room escape computer game for the public. The background of the game is set in the lab, you are unable to escape the room until you collect all the clues. In order to get the clues, you have to know basic knowledge of synthetic biology and our project. If not, it is easy to get the wrong clue, and fail the game! The player will find it difficult at first, and be eager to know the knowledge about synthetic biology behind the game, which meets our original intention.

    In consideration of biosafety, it is not possible to bring our biological cipher machine outside the lab. However, we can change the way to present it! Then a mechanical cipher machine came out. It used the same principle of our biological enigma machine, but it is much faster, which enables it to show how our biological enigma machine works to the public.

Parts modification
As described in the project page, we have successfully constructed, assembled and tested our device and each of the parts works well as expected. Since our device is designed for clinical application, extra works must be done to reduce potential harm to the body and guarantee an optimal effect. Sensibility, specialty and safety should be together put into consideration. So each of the parts should be elaborated selected, combined and tested.
First, the suicide gene. We want to find out a suicide gene that can function without extra stimuli from the environment. Also, the killing effect should be stable among different cell lines and cell situations. So, we select the response signaling elements in pathways relative to cell death. We have already tested the RIP1 and RIP3 and both genes successfully lead to programmed cell death. However, there are three ways to induce cell death: apoptosis, nercrosis and autophagy. Theoretically, the apoptosis pathway is the safest one because cell fragments will be degraded within apoptosis body. We have tested for hBax, hBaxS184A and fragment caspase3 and none of them works out because of the wrong origin of plasmids. We should also test the immunity response when the cells go through suicide.
A special gene called apoptin is also within our consideration. According to published papers, apoptin is a 121 amino acids peptide which was first isolated from Chicken anemia virus(CAV )and can induce cell death in several cancer cell lines but not in normal cells. Apoptin possibly functions by recognizing some early signal of cancer and inducing apoptosis via a non-p53 dependent pathway. Preclinical in vivo models based on different human xenografts indicate that apoptin is a safe and efficient potential anticancer drug.
If the safety, sensibility and speciality of apoptin can be guaranteed, it would be a one-shot solution to prevent cancer in every kind of directional redifferentated cells.
Secondly, the microRNA targets. In our project, miR-122 target is selected as a sensor module in our design. In normal cells, microRNA-122 can control more than 200 genes by binding to 3' UTR of their mRNA and lead to degradation of the mRNA hence controlling gene expression. The naturally occurring miR-122 target has mismatch to microRNA-122 but can still function with knockdown efficiency. We have"
York_UK,2013,Team:York UK#Project.html_-_-_TEXT.html," same transcription factor can also allow the bacteria to sense the presence of gold ions in the environment (3).
There are few problems involving CueR transcription activator for gold sensing. First of all; it is not entirely selective for gold ions and copper as well as silver ions can be involved in the activation of response genes. Secondly; it is a naturally present regulator of 2 genes in E. coli (4), therefore its use would involve some unsuspected behavior- we could not measure the exact response. The solution might involve mutating these 2 genes (which requires a lot of time) or finding alternative regulator system.
S. typhimurium also contains a MerR like transcription activator GolS (6). It is responsible for expression of the gold detoxification system involving the transcription of golB (gold ion binding protein) from the promoter PgolB as well as golS (transcription of itself gene) and golT (gold ion transportation system) transcription from promoter PgolT/S (Fig 1a) (7). The deletion of these genes was shown to affect the bacteria in the presence of gold and increase mortality. Additionally, GolS is also able to control some other efflux systems, however it requires much higher levels than for the gol regulon and therefore would not be very sensitive for quantitative studies (9).  By using this knowledge several attempts have been made to develop and characterise the gold sensing system from S. typhimurium (5, 8). Some of them involved PgolB and some PgolT/S promoters where the most common response molecule fluorescent proteins like RFP or GFP (Fig 1b). However, they faced some problems with basal expression levels of golS, which was causing some inconsistencies with their results.
Fig 1. Gol regulon found in S. typhimurium with all of the required components for detoxification system (a). The synthetic gol regulon with reporter molecule RFP under PgolB promoter (b).
We decided to use lacZα as a response molecule and make a gold sensing device containing PgolT/S-lacZα-golS in a standard iGEM plasmid. Also, the lacZα gene would have two restriction sites around it so it can be removed and exchanged with another response molecule or a response molecule that would transfer the signal to further downstream elements. The device would look like synthetic gol regulon Fig 1B, however the PgolB and RFP will not be present and between PgolT/S and golS the “replaceable” (SacII and San"

Modeling
We have a first set of equations for the PREDCEL Model, but did not solve it yet. Probably finding a solution symbolically is not possible. For that reason the next step is to write a python script that solves the system numerically.
Modelling the specialised variants did not start this week, as well as the overview.
However we have a basic model running in the browser, written in javascript with numjys and plotly.js. The next set of models should be written the same way, also the old ones have to be translated.
PACE
The current PACE setup was documented. Future PACE setups were discussed. Especially a setup that allows for host strains to be switched would be interesting for PamPACE. The idea is to use two turbidostats alternating. The host supply for the lagoons has a Y-connector that potentially connects both Turbidostats to the lagoons. Only one of the two tubings to the lagoons is allowed to be open at a time. When strains are switched, the block is switched. The Turbidostat that is not in use anymore, can be disconnected, the resulting open Luer-connector has to be sprayed with incidin, H2O2 or whatever kills phage and bacteria. Then the unused Turbidostat can be cleaned, autoclaved and reinstalled. It should be possible to switch strains every 12h theoretically. This setup needs either a second bottle of medium or changed lids, that hold two tubings that collect medium. New tubing to the turbidostat waste is needed.
This setup makes it possible to switch back and forth between two strains, that can live on different media.
The overall principle of a chemostat is that the population is kept constant by adjusting the amount of an essential resource. This helps to save medium but decreases the metabolic activity of the E. coli which may be problematic for PACE. But there are papers (Dickinson et al.) that used chemostats. Probably their protocol can be used with a few adjustments.
Phage_Propagation_and_Quantification
Phage Quick-Test
To find an easy and quick detection and quantification method for phages, the activity of beta-galactosidase, which is under control of a psp-promoter can be measured.
Therefore, 100 µl of the E. coli strain S2208, stock ID: 47 (OD600 ~ 0.5) was pipetted to 8"

So the point of all of these PCR rxns is to linearize out the pSB1C3 backbone, promoter, RBs, and start codon from either meffRed or rAIP in a format that is compatible with the assembly of this melanin binding construct:
○
There are two different decapeptides and two heptapeptides. One of each of them binds melanin (decapeptide 4B4, heptapeptide 4D), and one is a dumb control(decapeptide P601G, heptapeptide PA1). P601G is sometimes labeled P601 or P6 due to the size of the tube caps. In the most recent gel extraction that yielded the best results, we extracted pure repetitive sequences of 4B4, 4D, and P601G, as well as a hybrid of 4B4 and 4D (which we are most interested in). We did not extract PA1. So we will need to make linearized backbone with its 3’ blunt end compatible with the beginning of each of the three types of melanin binding sequences, and its 5’ blunt end compatible with the flag/lumio/his tag we have been using. To do so, we will run these PCR rxns--

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference"

Considering the environmental risks to which they are ascribed, policy frameworks ought to engender effective governance that seeks to foster good science, not to hamper it. It also recognises that good science goes hand in hand with open, clear, transparent regulation to ensure both trust and accountability. Another prominent feature of synthetic biology is its ‘cross-borderness’, in addition to the embedded scientific uncertainty. It simultaneously crosses the borders of scientific disciplines, industrial sectors, and geopolitical areas. Considering the transboundary and uncertain nature of this emerging technology it might be interesting to look at how policies are being developed within the framework of transnational governance. Some views support the idea that synthetic biology policies should not only be regulated from a top down perspective through governments, but that non-governmental stakeholders and organisations should be able to engage in self-regulation. The transboundary – and transnational nature of synthetic biology practices makes it pertinent to examine biosecurity and sustainable innovation discourses at the level of transnational governance structures such as iGEM. The latter holds a series of promising characteristics with regard to innovative regulatory frameworks.
Key words: dual-use governance - environmental discourse - ecological modernisation - risk society - UCL iGEM 2014 - sustainability - uncertainty - reflexive modernisation
Introduction
Facing Duality in Synthetic Biology
Biology is said to bring the greatest innovation in the twenty-first century. With the promise of synthetic biology to design and build biological systems, this innovation appears to not only change science and technology, but even have considerable transformational potential for societies that continue to seek progress. A high-level expert group on new and emerging science and technology within the European Commission specified a total of six domains where biotechnology as a discipline could be strongly affected due to the emergence of synthetic biology: ""biomedicine, synthesis of biopharmaceuticals, sustainable chemical industry, environment and energy, and the production of smart materials and biomaterials and counter-bioterrorism measures"" (Calvert 2010; European Commission and Directorate General for Research 2005: 13-17; Kelle 2013, 2012). And as these processes of innovation expand, synthetic biology becomes functional in creating highly beneficial applications to society. However, as with many emerging technologies, synthetic biology has the potential to cognate with issues of misuse and risk. Considering that in synthetic biology principles of engineering are brought to biology, safety and security thus come to the fore as relevant topics in designing an appropriate governance structure for emerging technologies (Kelle 2012).

Our team is made up of engineers first. Biologists and students of medicine complete us. We were brought together by the Georgiev Lab whose engineering and innovation philosophy set the bar for all ideas and activities. We strive to make synthetic biology more comprehensible and bearable to engineers. This is the first iGEM team from the Czech Republic, hence the name. In a country where synthetic biology still lacks footing, we are outsiders in all of our respective departments. This brings us close together to a single lab from multiple corners of our country. In the months of hard work on the IOD band, our own band of friends and lab geeks emerged.

The team includes a mix of complementary expertise. In the end the work was naturally split between the members. It goes without saying that these wiki pages are primarily the work of all team members with constant language corrections and comments on content clarity coming from the advisors and instructors. The advisors kept the work on track and helped answer the tough questions. They also checked wiki pages related to their field of expertise. The instructors were closely involved keeping the message clear and the team on track to reaching the goals. The external help was indispensable providing advice on medical topics where team expertise was lacking.

TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," ion source for the gel formation. We found such a material in LB agar to which we added calcium chloride at a concentration of 0.1M.
This turned out to be quite successful: diffusion of calcium ions from the agar was able to trigger the hydrogel formation even through a thickness of eight layers printed successively on top of each other. However, we identified one major flaw: in order to redissolve the hydrogel, the calcium ions are complexed with sodium citrate and replaced with sodium ions. Introducing an excessive abundance of calcium into the agar would thus lead to problems at a later stage when trying to redissolve the alginate.
4.6 cm in diameter
1.5 mm single line thickness
3 mm final line thickness (8 layers).
For this reason, we adapted the system in the following way: we plated 500 µL of 0.1M calcium chloride solution directly before the printing. In this manner, the top layer of the gel was sufficiently saturated with calcium ions to produce the hydrogel, but calcium ion abundance was kept as little as possible.
The distance between the tip and the print surface is of great importance. Initial experiments with larger distances were optically characterised by resembling a pearl necklace: due to the large distance, droplets were able to form in a repetitive pattern disturbing the straight line. In order to prevent this, the distance between the tip and the print surface thus must be kept as little as possible. However, due to unevenness of the surface, this lead to some problems. Being close to the agar, the needle often got stuck in the surface due to the nature of the mechanical movement. To tackle this problem, we decided to change our setup from extruding the alginate through a needle to leaving out the needle and only using the tubing. This offered the advantage of a simpler setup and improved flexibility when the tip touched the print surface.
This setup has proven to meet our purposes well and was used by us until the end.
Finally, we are working with bacteria, so what about sterility? To ensure high quality in our experiments, all our solutions were autoclaved to prevent unwanted contamination. Unfortunately, sodium alginate is decomposed during autoclaving. For this reason, we decided to use a trick that is more than a hundred years old: pasteurisation! The alginate solution was rapidly heated to its boiling point using a microwave and then immediately cooled down using a water bath. Like this, the amount of microorganisms was reduced while maintaining the alginate functional. Finally, antibiotics were added to all our samples to kill all bacteria which"

Reporter Plasmids
Our reporter plasmids were designed with the iGem’s BioBrick system. The plasmid pSB4A5 and pSB4K5 carrying the Amp and Kan resistance gene. A low copy ORI and the GFP or RFP gene where inserted. (See Experimental section)
Killer Plasmids
Our two plasmids - one targeting the RFP gene, one targeting the Ampicillin gene - where designed from the mobilizable pK18mob plasmid (carrying the KanR gene), received from the C.E.N. The Cas9 gene (and promoter and terminator) was             cutted and inserted in this pK18mob plasmid, followed by an insertion of a synthetic cassette containing a sgRNA (Crispr/Cas9 system), targeting the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene.
Killer Plasmid : design and construction
Design
We received a mobilizable plasmid (pK18mob) carrying Kanamycin resistance gene and OriT. Our purpose in to combine its conjugative capabilities with the Crispr/Cas9 system, so the final killer plasmid will be able to conjugate and to cut             a target gene (the RFP gene and Ampicillin resistance gene). So, from the pK18mob, we have inserted the Crispr/Cas9 system : the Cas9 gene (with its promoter and terminator), and a synthetic single guide RNA.             We have design two single guide RNA, to target the RFP gene and the Ampicillin resistance gene by Crispr/Cas9 system. The sgRNA sequence was design in Benchling, and carry : cut/ligation sites at extremities, promoter pJ23119, the guide             RNA and the terminator. Three DAM site (GATC) was cleaned, to avoid methylation. This sequence was synthetized by IDT.
