Transmission electron  microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX).
After the Cd2+ adsorption induction was completed, the bacteria were collected by  centrifugation and resuspended in ultrapure water. Samples were sent for TEM  image acquisition.The thick carbon film (20 to 30 nm) on the copper grid was  immersed in the bacteria solution for 1 second before imaging, dried under atmospheric conditions, and then imaged using TEM. At the same time, the EDX  system (EDAX, AMETEK) was attached to the microscope for elemental analysis.  All TEM images were imaged using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope at an acceleration bias of 200 kV.
Characterization of  biologically precipitated CdS nanoparticles
 
The photocatalytic MV2+ reduction assay was performed using a 10-mm quartz cuvette with a cap and a  light source(350-W Xe lamp). E.coli cells containing biosynthesized CdS  nanoparticles were harvested from LB medium by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10  min). The reaction system consisted of the same amounts of different  semiconductors [TiO2 anatase (10) and synthesized free CdS nanoparticles  (29)] and 3ml of 100 mM tris-HCl(PH 7), 150mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 100mM  ascorbic acid, and 5mM MV2+ in the quartz cuvette. O2 was  removed by bubbling N2 into the solution for 30 min. The reaction  was initiated by light irradiation and stopped by centrifugation and separation  of E.coli-CdS nanoparticles from the MV buffer. The absorption spectra  were immediately measured after centrifugation (1000g for 1 min). The  amount of reduced MV2+(MV+) that formed was calculated by  monitoring the OD605 using the molar conversion coefficient ɛ=1.3 × 104 M-1 cm-1.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#8 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," digestion of the DNA. At higher concentrations, EDTA can inhibit enzymatic reactions, such as PCR, by chelating metals ions like Mg2+. However, the low concentration of EDTA present in IDTE buffer will not interfere with subsequent enzymatic reactions. TE buffer can be made with common lab reagents or is conveniently available for purchase from the IDT catalog. Alternatively, nuclease-free water, pH 7.0, can be used for resuspending oligonucleotides, but it will not modulate pH over time as will TE buffer. Use of HPLC- or molecular biology–grade water is preferable, as water from a deionizing system (such as Millipore) can be acidic, with a pH as low as 5.0. Water treated with DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) is not recommended for resuspension of DNA oligonucleotides because it can degrade the DNA during long-term storage.
Concentration and Dilution. Investigators commonly call in for advice regarding the concentration at which their oligos should be resuspended. This is largely up to the discretion of the researcher, and is dependent on how the oligo will be used in future experiments. Oligonucleotides are stable when stored over a large range of concentrations; however, for optimal stability we recommend concentrations no less than 1 µM, and no greater than 10 mM. IDT offers a Resuspension Calculator as part of our SciTools® suite (www.idtdna.com/scitools), which is useful for calculating the volume of buffer to add to a dried down oligo to obtain a desired concentration. Resuspension calculations can be made using the yield information that is provided both on the oligo tubes themselves and on the IDT oligo product specification sheets provided with the order. For your convenience and utility, this yield information is presented in optical density (OD) units, mass (mg), and copy number (nmoles). Our standard recommendation is to resuspend oligos to a 100 µM stock concentration, as this is a simple concentration to make and is highly versatile for subsequent dilution purposes. The volume of TE buffer required to achieve a 100 µM stock is easily determined by multiplying the number of nanomoles listed for a particular oligo by a factor of 10, and then resuspending the dry DNA in that same number of microliters of TE buffer. For example, if the oligo specification sheet states that 20.3 nmoles of oligo were delivered, add 203 µ"

Protocols
OD600 Reference Point
LUDOX-HS40 was used as a single point reference to obtain a radiometric conversion factor to convert absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement. The Reference OD600 divided by the Abs600 from four replicates of LUDOX was used to obtain a correction factor for use against the cell based assays.
Fluorescein Standard Curve
A dilution series of fluorescein in four replicates was prepared and measured in the plate reader to obtain a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. This was used to correct cell-based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration, and to then convert this to a GFP concentration.
Plate Reader
Competent E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with each of the devices and plated onto LB+Chl agar, and two colonies from each transformation plate were grown overnight in 10 ml LB + Chl in 50 ml Falcon tubes. Protocols for making competent cells and cell transformation can be found here (link to protocol). Fluorescence was measured as specified in the InterLab protocol on a Synergy H1 plate reader.

To prove the commercial potential of our product, we have done market surveys, PMR research, cost-benefit analysis, a SWOT analysis, and created a business model. We have visited potential customers to understand whether they have really suffered from the problem we were trying to solve. Then we evaluated the profitability of our product by estimating the total cost, total revenue, gross margin, and the rate of Return On Investment. Through a SWOT analysis, we understood our product’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. After learning the features and competitive advantage of our product more clearly, we created our own business model to plan for the successful operation of our business, identifying sources of revenue, the intended customer base, products, and details of financing. Finally, in order to find our first pot of gold, we held a fundraising session not only to promote our product but also to build social network. (As in the following picture).
Who are we?
We are CCU iGEM Team,.a group of students from four different colleges and seven different departments at Chung Cheng University, located in southern Taiwan. With enthusiasm and determination, we hope to change the status quo, to try to help solve a major problem in the community, by developing an instrument to detect the risk of tooth decay–Carindex.
What are we trying to do?
The team is currently developing a saliva test for dental caries - Carindex.
According to statistics, among Taiwanese adults, eighty percent will suffer from dental caries, but using current medical technology, preventative detection of dental caries and oral risk assessment is not a complete system.
Therefore, the team wanted to detect the concentration of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus mutans"

HZAU-China,2014,Team:HZAU-China#Humanities#ethics_-_-_TEXT.html,"ra4se ""ethics of science"", then, maybe. And in some cases, definitely. Because ethics is fundamentally about humans, and since humans are composed of LARGE chunks of irrationality only plus SOME evolved rationality,[4] we think some irrationality SHOULD be employed when it comes to the exploration of human problems. Science is a great feat, but it is not all of the story.
     Then we will use an example to demonstrate how to put this theory into practice. After all, the whole framework didn't reveal itself until we have finished with our project.
4. Testing This Model With Example: When ""Rewire"" goes Haywire---Ethical Concerns of our Project
Our project has a lot to do with artificial evolution, and artificial evolution has a lot to do with major ethic concerns of synthetic biology. The ""shoulds"" and ""don'ts"" about synthetic biology itself mainly ask one question regarding its ending: will the organism that you create end up beneficial, or malignant?
     People trust evolution, because it has been there for millennia. It makes humans what they are today, and it's so slow we almost think we will not see the day when it finally has anything to do with us during the short span of a lifetime. People don't care about its direction, because nature has been so benign to us and we see no understandable reason for it to suddenly go mental and evolve us back to a mollusc or even better, a chimera. Artificial evolution, however, is another story. People seem to not trust it very much, because they are afraid that something will go wrong, despite the best effort of the scientist to control the potential danger. And besides, it is happening too fast for people's understanding to catch up; people can feel like the woman reported in the news who suddenly gave birth to a child on the train and she hadn't realized she had conceived. This is the issue that lies at the heart of conflict in the debate of artificiality vs. naturality: about fear and trust.
     Our project builds a rewirable circuit that can automatically rewire itself into another circuit adapting to its environment. This is an attempt at the imitation of natural evolution, and with human engineering, we were helping the circuit evolve. Like the analogy we used to describe our project: what synthetic biology has been doing is constructing cars from scratch, and what we are trying to do is evolve this car to be a bacterial amphibian vehicle, or fancier, bacteria ""transformer"". The concept is thrilling enough: transformer? It is a very fitting analogy, and it sounds marvellous if it"

Our inference approach was to manipulate the model for the Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533. Based on the METACYC identifiers, we added those reactions for which \(70%\) of the other lactobacilli models contained an orthologue correspondents. Afterwards, we used the feature lists of the PATRIC (Wattam et al., 2014) database to identify those reactions that are unique for each strain, and made according changes, although, we still retained those reactions with \(70%\) prevalence.
Analysis for the inferred model
For fulfilling an external function, metabolites can leave a system through outbound fluxes. For instance, ATP can leave a system through a growth function and thus driving proliferation. Often, the objective function is an outbound flux. Our project attempts to create an organism incapable of processing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) while still being viable. Consequently, the corresponding analysis should have two objectives: maximize growth and minimize G6P metabolism. In general, models contain a growth function. However, we had to create an objective function for the G6P metabolism.
We implemented such an objective by considering G6P production and usage separately. For each scenario, we introduced a pseudo-metabolism whose concentration was linked to fluxes that involve G6P. The pseudo-metabolisms serve as"

Streak out the strain to be made competent on an LB or TBAB agar plate as a large patch and incubate overnight at 30 ℃.
The following morning scrape off the cell growth off the plate and use to inoculate fresh, pre-warmed, SpC medium to give an OD600 reading of about 0.5.
Incubate the culture at about 37℃ with vigorous aeration and take periodic OD readings to assess cell growth.
When the rate of cell growth is seen to depart from exponential inoculate 200ml of pre-warmed, SpⅡmedium with 2ml of stationary-phase culture and continue incubation at 37℃ with slower aeration
After 90min incubation, pellet the cells by centrifugation at room temperature.
Carefully decant the supernatant into a sterile container and save.
Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 18ml of saved supernatant and add 2ml of sterile glycerol; mix gently.
Aliquot the competent cells in sterile tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or a dry-ice bath and store at -70℃.
12.Transformation
Thaw competent cells rapidly by immersing frozen tubes in a 37 ℃ water bath.
Immediately, add one volume of SpⅡEGTA to the thawed cells; mix gently.
In a sterile test tube add competent cells to the DNA solution and incubate in a roller drum at 37℃.
Dilute the transformed cells as appropriate in T Base containing 0.5% glucose and plate immediately onto selective media.
13.Amylase activity analysis
Apply iodine on the plate with 0.1% starch and spectinomycin.
Incubate the engineered bacteria and non-engineered bacteria onto the plate at 37℃.
See if there are hydrolysis circles on the plate."

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,"bound pili able to bind to the zinc ions and so a higher proportion of zinc ions is taken out of solution. As more pili become bound to the zinc ions, fewer collisions occur between the zinc ions and the unbound pili resulting in the zinc becoming bound less frequently. As such, the filter becomes less efficient and a lower proportion of zinc ions is taken out of solution until eventually the filter is not taking enough zinc out of the water to meet the desired concentration. A similar shape graph was obtained experimentally using a solution of mannose and unmodified MG-1655 E. coli.
Example 2
Figure 2: Example Graph 2.
If, however, we had access to a metal binding reactor just ten times larger with a volume of 15 litres, then the model predicts that this graph would be obtained. The larger reactor needs replacing significantly less often. Initially the graph is almost horizontal with an output concentration of approximately 0. This is because there is such an abundance of pili in the reactor that the zinc ions are very likely to have a successful collision with an unbound pilus in the time it takes to get through the reactor. Thus, the vast majority of zinc ions entering the reactor become bound to pili. The exponential curve is also more pronounced. This is because the greater size of the filter and so the greater abundance of pili, means that smaller proportion of the pili need to be free in order to continue taking a sufficient number of zinc ions out of solution. As the proportion of free pili reduces, the number of successful collisions between pili and zinc ions decreases and so the number of free pili reduces far more slowly. This allows for an extended period of time when the filter is operating at a lower, but sufficient efficiency.
Example 3
Figure 3: Example Graph 3.
On the contrary, if the volume of the metal binding reactor were reduced to just 1 litre, then the graph looks almost linear. This is because of the relative abundance of the zinc ions in comparison to the number of pili, means that each pilus is experiencing many more collisions per unit time and so the pili are all bound very quickly and there is no extended period of time where the reactor can operate at a lower efficiency, as in the other scenarios.
Assumptions
We made an assumption for the ""number of pili per E. coli"". The decision made was based on information from literature (Group, 2017) (Christof K. Biebricher, 1984).    We used sensitivity analysis to check the effect that an in"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Attributions_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

We then discussed the evolution of genetically modified plants, the misconceptions and the boundaries of human intervention. GMOs and GMO foods were a recurring theme in our Human Practices, as we presume it to be a sensitive topic in the greek society. Prof. Haralampidis declared that “we [humanity] would be hypocrites if we were to assume that we could survive without genetically modified organisms,” referring both to GM foods and plants as well as to the production of pharmaceutical drugs. However, as he mentioned, scientists strive to propose novel, more environmentally and consumer-friendly solution, than the existing ones. And of course, detailed knowledge of the organisms and their genome will prove to be a strong asset in humanity’s journey to developing more robust and safe engineered biological systems.
Prof. Fragkiskos Kolissis
Professor Emeritus at the School of Chemical Engineering, NTUA, Greece - OMIC-Engine, Greece
Prof. Fragkiskos Kolissis, by our team’s side since the beginning, found our intention of concluding our actions into a report most promising, suggesting its publication on the OMIC-Engine webpage, Greece’s newly established infrastructure for Synthetic Biology. He also suggested the creation of a video that would explain synthetic biology, addressing high school students. The link for the video can be found on the next session.
Explaining Synthetic Biology - A Linguistic Approach
The following video was created as an introduction to Synthetic Biology for greek high school students. Thus, we adopted a simple approach to describe the principles of Synthetic Biology, by making an analogy with linguistics. Enjoy!

We use modeling in our project.
Although our project is promising and exciting, there are many difficulties when it comes to the practical fermentation. We need to consider lots of things before we can get our precious health pudding kit. For example, what culture medium should we use? How much carbon source should we add? How long should the fermentation process be? Well, we can hardly get what we want if it’s too short. On the other hand, a too long process is a waste of source and time, and you know, time means money in the industrial production. Most importantly, will our operation be harmful to the bacteria so that they can’t even survive? These are all we should take care of.
These practical questions are to be solved by our modeling. For details, click here.
Outside the lab……
As Peter Carr puts it, ""Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."" This year, our team communicated with lots of teams and exchange our ideas.We also bravely showed our ideads on national confenrence.  We were in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang Provicnce and so on. Through communications, our team are growing and our ideas are spreading! Here for more information.
Our feature: iShare!
As we all know iGEM has already established a functional platform for participators to share Bio-bricks. However materials related to those Bio-bricks are still missing, like bacterial strains and expression vectors. It’s difficult to repeat previous iGEM projects and we want to make a difference by introducing iShare to all the iGEMers.
iShare as we pictured is the first step to all-round resource sharing platform. We suggest iGEM teams put information of materials used in their project on iShare and label those they are willing to share. In this way, future teams could have more resources for similar work and may come up with more improvement.Please see more information on iShare .

Introduction
The physical properties of polysilicate are different than those of the cell. We wanted to determine how the physical properties of the cell changes when encapsulated by a layer of polysilicate. Therefore we determine the stiffness of cells with and without a layer of polysilicate using atomic force microscopy (AFM).  The stiffness is the rigidity of the a material, describing how easy the cell is deformed.
AFM is a technique used to determine surface characteristics of a sample. In AFM a very sharp tip scans over the surface of the sample. While scanning over the surface every height change is detected by a laser which is reflected by the cantilever on a position-sensitive photodetector (Figure 1). We used the PeakForce QNM mode of AFM, in which also surface characteristics like the stiffness and deformation can be determined. The stiffness is computed from the relation between the force at which the cantilever pushes on the sample, the adhesion force and the deformation of the material.
Figure 1: AFM Setup. A laser is reflected by a cantilever and detected by a position sensitive photodetector. Every change in height of the sample results in a change of height of the cantilever and is measured.
Methods
Experiments were performed using E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the plasmid containing the OmpA-Silicatein gene and induced with IPTG. Silicic acid was added to one sample to form the polysilicate layer around the cell. Another sample with no silicic acid added was used as a control. The cells weres spun down and resuspended in MilliQ and fixated on a glass slide using 1% ABTES. The samples were imaged using the Bruker FastScan-Bio.
Figure 2: AFM experiments in the cleanroom.
Results and discussion
We have imaged two samples with AFM. The first sample is OmpA-silicatein with silic acid added so that the cell can encapsulate itself with polysilicate (figure 3A, B). The second sample, that was used as a control, did not contain silicic acid (figure 3C-D).  From both samples a height map (figure 3A, C) and the stiffness (figure 3B, D) was determined. Both samples were fixed on a glass slide in the same way. Due to a tip change is there a factor 10 difference between the measured stiffness of the glass slide of both samples.

Our Goals
Goal A: Characterization of R0011, a strong lactose promoter
We used R0011, which is one of the most commonly used parts in iGEM, to characterize our genes because the strength of promoter activity is very high. However, in previous iGEM, no teams characterized R0011 with RPU. We tried to determine how the activity of R0011 [10] changes.
Goal B: Quantitative characterization of λ lysis cassette
We found a new fact that cell lysis caused by λ lysis cassette become an apparent equilibrium state, and the value of OD550 depends on the strength of induction of IPTG. We defiend it as LAV (Lytic Activity Value） as a quantitative parameter of lytic activity, and we established a standard method for lytic activity of λ lysis cassette. We characterized the lytic activity of λ lysis cassette quantitatively as our established method, and linked the result to the strength of induction（RPU）.
We characterized the lytic ativity of λ lysis cassette with time.
Goal C: Characterization of the anti-killer gene, SΔTMD1
To check function of the anti-killer gene, first, we made construct and measured A550 of E.coli transformed with the device in medium with IPTG and without IPTG, and we compared this result with that of E.coli transformed with killer gene, lysis cassette. Then, we were able to make sure that Transmembrane domein1 (TMD1) is essential for , lysis cassette.
^Top
Achievement
We measured RPU of R0011 in eight kinds of concentration of IPTG, and made continuous curve representing the relation between concentration of IPTG and RPU of R0011 by simulation fitting.
We characterized the lytic activity of λ lysis cassette quantitatively as our established method,and linked the result to the strength of induction (RPU).
We found that a new fact that cell lysis caused by λ lysis cassette become an apparent equilibrium state, and the value of OD550 depends on the strength of induction of IPTG. We defined it as LAV（Lytic Activity Value）as a quantitative parameter of lytic activity, and we established a standard method for lytic activity of λ lysis cassette.
We checked the activity of SΔTMD1, which can't form pore of holin and cells don't die although endolysin expresses.

**Bioluminescence >>drug delivery The induced pathway can be interchangeable. At the moment, BioWatcher is designed to output autonomous bioluminescence signal. The system can be altered into therapeutic application when the bioluminescence signal is changed into drug delivery. With boundless creativeness, the application diversity of this system is limitless.
2.    Is the design of BioWatcher better than the current blood test?
Yes! Current blood test is the most direct approach for everyone to learn about his/her bodily health. However, it’s rarely performed due to its several drawbacks, invasiveness, time-consuming procedure and the fact that it can only be carried out with the help of medical professions. Although new smart wearable devices attempt to deal with these problems by offering noninvasive measurement and instant report, what the trackers can tell the users, such as heart rate, steps taken and calories burned, are not direct and useful indicators for early-stage diagnosis.
BioWatcher aims to overcome the disadvantages of both blood test and current smart wearables and combine the advantages of both:  using noninvasive measurement wearables providing instant report to directly assessing disease indicators.
3.    Are we sure that this system can be used in humans?
Not until the experiment can successfully prove feasibility will we be able to give a confirmed answer. However, even at the worst scenario--failing to apply this system in humans-- this design can be widely apply on other experiment animal model. BioWatcher is going to be a great help to scientists and bring them immense convenience and efficiency in lab.
We are very grateful for all the questions asked that once again examine and improve BioWatcher.

We tried many ways to introduce synthetic biology, Biowatcher and iGEM to the public. One of them is presenting our posters in both Mandarin and English in front of the National Conference Hall and the library of National Tsinghua University where hundreds of students and visitors sit, hangout and pass by everyday. We hope to share with as much people as we can the fun and potential that biology can bring into the future."

For an inhibition of bacterial population, Hill function can be described in the form 1 / (1 +x^n). Because many of the in vivo rates of the biochemical reactions we simulated are unknown, the values of the kinetic parameters used in the simulation were initially obtained from the literature and educated guesses. From the gene network design procedure, initial values and numerical configurations were given, which lead to several rounds of simulation and results. (Fig.2).
Fig.4: The simulation result of the population  control system. When the population size of E. coli rises to the threshold level, ccdB proteins are induced by AHL to  restrict the population size.
At  present, we have satisfactory in-silico results.  The next step is to implement  the “population control system” into the genetic circuit and ultimately the  host bacteria for experimental data.

EGF Expression
Introduction
At the beginning of our project design, we thought of many possible treatment but during the process of reasoning we encountered some difficulties. In the spring of 2016, at National Center for Protein Science Shanghai we interviewed professor Lu.P who was a researcher at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in the University of Manchester. After he understood that we wanted to fight IBD, he pointed out to us that EGF, which is an important factor of his ongoing research, is a molecule that has the ability to promote regeneration of cells in the inflammatory region and therefore can be a possible treatment to IBD.
Figure 1. 3D structure of EGF protein
Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) is a 6045-Da protein with 53 amino acid residues.
It can stimulate cell growth, proliferation and differentiation by binding to its receptor EGFR both in vivo and vitro. Some people utilize it as cosmetic product because of the potent ability of recovering epithelium.
EGF expression
We found inspiration in the interview with Lu, P. and designed a bacterial strain that can secrete hEGF in patients’ gut. E.coli. has been chosen as expression strain because it is aborigines in human’s gut and easy to be programing. A signal peptide phoA is added at the N-terminus to facilitate secretion. We engineered two peptide tags, a phoA signal peptide at the N-terminus and a FLAG tag at the C-terminus of hEGF protein. PhoA is a fragment of signal peptide that guides the protein to go across cytomembrane and do not decrease activity of the protein. FLAG-tag is a polypeptide protein tag that can be added to a protein using recombinant DNA technology, having the sequence motif DYKDDDDK.

Physiological activity of recombinant EGF
Figure 3. Technological process of recombinant EGF purification.(note: this picture is from the website of Qiagen)
In order to test the physiological activity of recombinant EGF, we substituted FLAG tag for 6*HIS tag and purified it by Ni-NTA Agarose.
The purified recombinant protein was applied to mouse models of intestinal inflammation by enemas (performing by SYSU-MEDICINE, click here to get more information). The I"

Bioinformatics analysis
Aim: construct a fusion protein that is embedded in the plasma membrane and allows quantifiable analysis of the PMDS.
We designed and tested two different transcription units (TU) containing a CMV promoter (BBa_K747096), a signal peptide with cleavage site (BM-40, BBa_K2170214), GFP (BBa_K648013), a TMD, PhoCl, mCherry, a NLS and a poly(A) tail (BBa_K1150012) with the aim of finding the most reliable TU that will produce a transmembrane protein embedded in the plasma membrane.The difference between the two TU’s is the TMD: In construct 1.0 the TMD is taken from TLR4 (TMTLR4, shown to work in Nagaraj et al 2011 and Qudrat & Truong 2016) and in construct 1.1 the TMD is taken from EGFR (TMEGFR, shown to work by the iGEM team Munich 2016).
We used the SignalP 4.1 Server [Link] to predict signal peptides and cleavage sites, ProtScale Hydrophobicity Plot (Hphob. / Kyte & Doolittle) [Link] for analysis of a TMD in relation to the entire predicted structure and Transmembrane Analyzer [TMHMM] to predict the precise location of transmembrane domains inside our design.
Results: Construct 1.0 and 1.1 both show the existence of a signal peptide with predictable cleavage site and a hydrophobic peak where the TMD is implicated. However, the TMTLR4 failed to be predicted as a reliable transmembrane domain in our construct. We, therefore, decided to assemble construct 1.1 and thereby further characterise TMEGFR which has previously submitted by iGEM Munich 2016 as a BioBrick.
Discussion: The registry entry of TMEGFR says: “The EGFR stop transfer signal in the 3' region of the TMD increases the membrane stability. The part is ideal for combining internal and external membrane domains to one fusion protein. The glycine linkers in the 5' and 3' region of the part lead to a better flexibility and a better performance of the fused parts.The part is flanked by RFC25 pre- and suffix for further use in protein infusion.”

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html,"obbes 1651) , now take on the meaning of that regulatory body. Our way to deal with risks, unpredictability and uncontrollability caused by naturality make us entrench ourselves to the State, understood as a complex, artificial, reliable and predictable body. I admit that argument can be seen as quite exaggerated but it is a way to put into light how, sometimes, we are tempted to refer, to protect ourselves through simple diagrams. Here, we entrench ourselves in the protective arms of States, agencies, procedures and protocols, not only because of rational explanations, but also because they indirectly refer to something very artificial, constructed, by man, for man, and, through Hobbes' eyes, in order to find the security we hadn't in nature.
Different from the “winner” bacteria of biosafety concerns, people with malicious intentions are qualified with a different lexicon, lying in law-and-order discourse, formulated through the intervention of the States, agencies or necessary suspicion of labs. The unpredictability of the living, with a meliorative lexicon, is compensated by a pejorative discourse about mankind through figures of the failing scientist or the malicious terrorist.
3. Conclusion : the Steve Kurtz's case
To conclude this part, I wanted to enlarge the debate, to complexify it with the help of an example, the concrete case of the artist Steve Kurtz. The Kurtz case allows us to illustrate a large scale of stakes in life science practices nowadays. Among that stakes we could find intellectual property matters, containment, bioterrorism, DIY practices, exchange between the scientific and uninitiated communities or repression.
Steve Kurtz is professor at Art at SUNY Buffalo and is founder of the activist and artistic association Critical Art Ensemble (CEA). In 2004, the artist worked on the GenTerra project, an ironic look at GMOs, GenTerra is about producing organisms “that help solve ecological or social problems”  and on the Marching Plague project, mocking “the notion that biological terror presents any serious practical threat, arguing instead that extravagant spending of tax dollars to defend against bioterror is no more than a means of ""maximizing profit and consolidating power through the matrix of biocatastrophe."" . To carry out these projects, Kurtz kept at his home strains of Escherichia coli, Bacillius subtilis and Serratia, considered as inoffensive and daily handled in academic laboratories. After the heart attack and the death of his wife, Hope Kurtz, Steve called 911. Finding his “home"

Accessibility and portability
The accessibility and portability of our ""Micro Holmes Measurement System"" have been demonstrated by both TJU (Tianjin University, China) and SZU (Shenzhen University, China).
As previously described in the Day lab section, our ""Micro Holmes Measurement System"" contains both biology components and other non-biology components. We ask for TJU to test
We invited TJU, which is studying MFC - the same with us, to verify the accessibility and portability of the biology components in our system. Their experiments showed that our biology components are stable and repeatable enough to be used in different labs.
Here, we present their results as follows:
we also helped them characterize the Cu2+ sensing part in our MFC device.
As for BBa_K1755301, the voltage in MFC was documented. The MFC‘s anode was added with Cu2+ from the very begging (0 min), and their voltage (with BL21-K1755301"
UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#8 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Storing Oligos with Fluorophores. Typically, fluorophore labeled oligos show a reduction in signal of about 20% after 24 months when stored at –20°C in TE. For oligos with a fluorophore modification, particularly the Cy and FAM dyes, researchers may wish to store these oligos in amber tubes or covered in foil to prevent photo bleaching which can occur over time with prolonged exposure to light.
Resuspending your gBlocks™ Gene Fragment:
1. Centrifuge the tube for 3−5 sec at a minimum of 3000 x g to pellet the material to the bottom of the tube.
2. Add 20 µL TE to the tube for a final concentration of 10 ng/µL.
3. Briefly vortex and centrifuge.
Storing your gBlocks™ Gene Fragment: gBlocks Gene Fragments can be stored in TE at −20°C for up to 24 months. If gBlocks Gene Fragments will be stored for less than 1 month, they can be resuspended in nuclease-free water rather than TE.
Procedures:
Today 15mL of TE buffer was made from 150uL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH8) and 3uL of 0.5M EDTA (pH8) and bringing the total volume up to 15mL in a falcon tube.
All primers were resuspended in TE buffer.  For the colony PCR primers, a 40uM stock was made for long term storage, and a 20uM working stock was made.  For primers for pET22b, sequencing, and amplifying, a 100uM stock was made for long term storage, as well as a 20uM working stock for the pET22b primers.
Conclusions:  The bacterial plate with the Yeate’s strain was not found in the cold room.  Tomorrow, agar plates will be made in order to restreak the bacteria from the glycerol stocks.  Dr. Kosuri suggested working trying to work with the PSB1C3 sequence by adding a T7 promoter and RBS to the PCquad sequence.  A his-tag and stop codon would also have to be made for this purpose.  This may be done tomorrow, as well as making the plates for downstream PCR and protein expression."

ENGAGEMENT
Public Engagement had occupied the largest segment of our Human Practice activities. We used other materi-
als and video games to illustrate the function of standard elements in synthetic biology; we present small
lectures to senior high school students and freshmen, introducing main principles and sharing our project
ideas, discussing safety and ethics problems.
FUNCTION ILLUSTRATION INTRODUCTION, SHARING & DISCUSSION
Function Illustration
Garden party for introduction of synbio to the public
   We, together with SYSU-CHINA, held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our
audiences were all enthusiastic, including not only students from life sciences and many other majors, but teachers of
different backgrounds. Also, some residents and tourists showed an enormous interest in our garden party. This time,
we divided our parade into 2 parts. First, you could splice a fundamental Circuit Project in the “Splice a Circuit” part.
What you need to do is to put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. By using the electronic bricks
to symbolize the different parts in synbio, we managed to introduce the four fundamental parts to the public by visual-
ized approaches. If a circuit is completed correctly, a light bulb which symbolizing a certain functional CDS would be
lightened. By turning the microcosmic process into the visible and operable way, we successfully attracted many partici-
pants to get involved in our game, especially some kids and teenagers who got the pure pleasure of scientific research.
“This is absolutely the most exciting game I’ve ever played. “It inspires me to take more time in biology study as a stu-
dent of senior high”, said by one student.
   As to the second part “Design a Circuit”, you must use the synbio knowledge you’ve already learned in the first
game and your imagination to design a much more complicated circuit. Made up of more than twenty biobricks and re-
lated to Toggle Switch, the circuit was so hard that even some of our team members were stumped. However, to our
surprise, some participants did finish the circuit with least effort, including a pupil. During this"

Awareness Campaign
By means of a guerilla marketing campaign, we sought to raise awareness of our project in conjunction with our presentation and public engagement. That is to say, we embraced the fact that we lacked resources for a major marketing campaign and further embraced the futuristic and 'mysterious' angle on our project. We opted to produce merchandise and rather than giving it out blatantly, we made sure that stickers appeared in public transportation, at bars and in bathrooms. Furthermore a good marketing campaign includes things such as mugs appearing in public kitchens, pens given out at university campuses and notepads strewn about auditoriums. Our hope was that in unity, we could make a serious difference in educating people about human future in space.
Media Outreach

METU_Turkey,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html," Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks with a promoter,      where appropriate. - 57% of participants have been agree that RIPS      (Ribosome per Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks      with a RBS brick.
Though most participants agree the need for POPS and RBS information     , they are concerned about the workload it would bring to individual     labs.
“To do this, the Registry need to define a reliable and easy method     of determining the PoPS for teams to use. However, I would say that     there are better systems for quantifying promoter output than PoPS,     and they should be used instead, if possible”.
67% of participants have thought that entering POPS      information should not be mandatory while submitting new parts.      Similarly, 65% of participants disagree that entering RIBS information      should be mandatory while submitting new parts
Even though the researchers feeling the need for this information     they are shying away from requesting it as a mandatory title for parts     registry as it would be difficult for underfunded and inexperienced     groups to perform these measurements.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would be even better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately.
82% of participants have thought that information on      working conditions of the parts should be mandatory while submitting      new parts. Most find submiting the detailed experimental      information and working conditions is crucial and even easier than      submitting measurements of POPS or RBS.

Found primers to amplify pACYC184. Ordered these and the ones for pBR322. The reverse promoter was the same for both pACYC184 and pBR322.
Two 0.8% agarose gels were made.
Checked transformations from yesterday: 4 colonies grew on the UV+pACYC184 on the low concentration chlor plates (50ug/mL) and 2 colonies grew on the UV+pACYC184 on the high concentration chlor plates (150ug/mL). These 6 colonies were PCR amplified diluting them with 200μL of water, and then taking 20μL out from here and combining that with 2.5μL of the forward and reverse promoters for the inputs. These were PCR amplified with two controls, DH5α with input promoters, and UV with input promoters. We also PCR amplified some HSP and GFP just to get more g-blocks.
The 6 PCR products along with the two controls were run on a gel.
It appeared that H2 (The second colony from the high concentration chlor plates) had a faint band. Since only 1μL of each was used for the gel, it was repeated for the 6 PCR products, without controls, using 5μL each. Again, H2 had a band. YAY!
More 10X primers were made from the 100X stock. 10μL of primer was added to the existing 10X microfuge tube along with 90μL of water.
The UV, HSP and GFP from today's PCR and Monday's PCR were purified. However, we maybe mixed up some UV and HSP so after purification, 2μL of each of these purified samples were run on a gel to see if there are two bands that appear in either one. There weren't!!!! YAY!
We NanoDropped the three PCR'ed g-blocks, after there were purified. The concentrations were UV: 105.2ng/μL, HSP: 64.1ng/μL, and GFP: 77.6ng/μL.
We inoculated our GFP+pBR322 (that the gel showed it actually had the insert inside of it) and left it to grow overnight. We inoculated at 5:30PM.
The UV+pACYC184 that the gel showed actually had the insert in it was restreaked and left to incubate and grow overnight. Incubated around 5PM.

Bio-safety
Questionnaire about laws on transgene and bio-safety
In order to know more about the opinions on transgene laws from iGEMers and students majoring in synthetic biology, we designed questionnaires and finished the survey. 177 students finished our questionnaire, most of whom were iGEMers or undergraduates and graduates majoring in biology. We found out that laws on bio-safety problems still need to be advertised, since a number of students were not familiar with them and thought it would be helpful to know more. Also, we provided some of the details in the laws, and majority students replied that they were useful to their study and research work.
Video about bio-safety in laborites
This year, UCAS iGEM team collaborated with other nine Chinese iGEM team, making a series of videos which focused on bio-safety to help Chinese students learn more about bio-safety. The topic of our team’s video is personal protective equipment, mainly concerns about the proper use of gloves, lab coat etc in laborites. Here comes our video.

XJTLU-CHINA,2015,Team:XJTLU-CHINA#HumanPractice.html_-_-_TEXT.html," we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cottonocracy and oil industry could be replaced by bio-synthesis. Particularly, the majority of people chose oil because they know biofuels have been widely used. However, only a few people knew that synthetic biology could be applied in metallurgic area as well.
Question 3
Have you ever heard about bio-safety before?
您在这份调查之前是否听说过生物安全？
Biosafety is an important issue in biological research as well as human society. We wanted to find if people knew about bio-safety and we hoped they could pay attention to bio-safety after this survey. Result was that less than a half people heard about bio-safety before and over a half people did not consider about safe problem. Therefore, we provided some information about biosafety after they answered this question; they could learn and start to think about bio-safe problem.
Provided information: Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.
Question 4
Some people consider that modern biotechnologies including synthetic biotechnology may cause problem in safety of human society. do you agree or disagree?
有人认为现代生物技术包括合成生物学技术会对人类社会安全带来严重问题。你是否同意这个观点？
Modern biotechnologies improve the development of human society in many areas, for example clinical treatment, biofuels and GMOs. Nonetheless, some people worry that biotechnologies may cause ethic or safe problem in human society. Hence, we ask people this question to find their opinions about biotechnologies. Result was that 32.5% of people agreed that synthetic biotechnology may cause safe problems. While, 28.75% of people considered it was absolutely safe. However, over one third people were not sure that it had positive effect or negative effect. We thought many people in China did not accept biotechnology, they worry it would be harmful to their heath. We should do more work to ensure the safety of biotechnology so that more people will trust it.

From figure 4, the concentration of S2- in the group of CysDes is higher than the wild type which proves that CysDes promotes the reduction of cysteine to S2- with good enzymatic activity certainly.
Under the catalysis of same amount of raw enzyme, we measure the production of S2- with various concentration of cysteine after 2h at 37˚C (shown in Figure 5). The value of OD650 has approximate linear relationship with the concentration of cysteine which means CysDes almost catalyzes the reduction of all cysteine to S2- and CysDes functions well.

5. Transmission electron microscopy image of CdS nanoparticles on bacteria
From the above, we can see that this enzyme CysDes has strong enzyme activity to generate S2- ion from cysteine. However, in this photocatalyst system, the duty of this enzyme does NOT just stop here. It needs to precipitate CdS nanoparticles with additional Cd2+ ions in the system. In the toxicity text section, we can see that strain expressing CysDes had a better resistance than wild type strain. This primarily proves the assumption that this enzyme can enhance the bacteria’s resistance to Cd2+ ions by precipitating them.
To valid this assumption further more, we used Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to take a closer look to the bacteria. With this, we can valid the existence of CdS precipitance with our own eyes!
Here, we need to express our most sincere gratitude to those teachers in Center for Integrative Imaging(Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale). They helped us to process those samples for TEM.
We prepared four samples—the strain expressing CysDes with and without additional Cd2+ in it and the same for the wild type strain. Here are the results for these four samples.

WHU-China,2018,Team:WHU-China#Experiments#Lab1_-_-_TEXT.html," verification of the entire pathway illustrates the coupling of the light-controlled promoter and the Not Gate, and preliminarily demonstrates that our system can work cyclically. Although in this experiment, the data is still not perfect. Factors such as expression time should be considered more in subsequent experiments.
II.Functional proteins to collect Phosphorus
Since we decided to take phosphorus as example, we must find the functional proteins to be controlled by the PcpcG and Not Gate. Two functional opposite protein can do this job, One to accumulate the Phosphorus from the environment and the other release them to the Ark. We found PPK to accumulate, and PPX to release. Later we add a part-PPN to strengthen the efficiency of PPX.  In this section, we will test the function of these three proteins.
1.PPK—phosphorus accumulation
After a careful information retrieval, we decided to choose the Polyphosphokinase (PPK) from Team Manchester_2017 and  we test the efficient of it again.
Firstly, we found that this PPK gene originally exists in our E.coli.
Figure 7 This picture shows colony PCR results, the wild type control originally possesses PPK.
This suggested that PPK protein is compatible in our chassis, and transformation of the PPK was actually an overexpression.
Then, we tested the function of PPK, We did this through measuring the change in phosphorus concentration in the medium. And we made a calibration curve before.
Figure 8 The calibration curve of phosphorus
Figure 9 This picture shows the effect of phosphorus accumulation of the engineered bacteria which we have transformed extra PPK gene.
This experiment verifies that BL21 transferred to the pET28a plasmid containing PPK has a certain phosphorus-concentrating effect, and it is not caused by bacterial growth and natural PPK.
2. PPX,PPN—phosphorus release
We refer to PPX’s data from the Team 15_York. Because our system requires faster and more complete release of phosphorus, we added PPN as a protein to assist in the release of phosphorus. Thus we built BBa_K2789032.
PPN is a protein that originally comes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, before the function test, we must verify that PPN protein can be expressed in E. coli.
Figure 10 This picture shows the SDS-PAGE result of the E.coli that we have transformed PPN. Track 2 and track 3 show that PPN is expressed.

Carnegie_Mellon,2014,Team:Carnegie Mellon#Fish_-_-_TEXT.html," smaller food source, while simultaneously making it easy for the fish   to find food due to the combination of a large food source and low competition for that food source. Thus the   population is back to the initial starting conditions, and the model continues to cycle through these scenarios ad   infinitum. The user can tamper with the ecosystem by adding varying concentrations of estrogen. The estrogen   leads to the feminization of male fish, with higher concentrations of estrogen corresponding to an increased   likely hood of feminization. Feminized male fish cannot reproduce, which leads to more frequent dips in the   fish population and can throw the entire ecosystem out of the equilibrium that was described above.   To run the model simply go to the interface tab, hit setup, and then run.  Each fish in the model represents a school of 100 fishes. The pink fish are female, the cyan fish are male, and the yellow fish are feminized males.
The Parameters
The parameters do not entirely reflect reality. For example both the max age of the fish and birds are the same  in the model, even though in actuality birds typically live much longer than fish. However, the parameters   are organized in such a way that the math for the model works out in a manner which is easy to program.   Essentially the most important thing for the model to do is capture the effects of estrogenic on a freshwater   ecosystem, which is what the default parameters do.

SynBioSoc conference in Oxford
To start the summer with a boost, we made a road trip to attend the Oxford iGEM meetup.
Meeting for the first time other iGEM teams was definitely the highlight of the event. There was a real buzz and we came back vibrant and eager to start on our project.
Exchanging ideas helped us judge which of our initial ideas caught the interest the most.
The drive home came all too soon.
“The aspect that struck out the most was the warmth and friendliness of all the teams. We didn’t feel competitive rivalry, it was really about sharing ideas”
Randy Rettberg
""Effort, Integrity, Openness""
Randy came to meet us in June. He told us about his career start in design, how he met Tom Knight and his vision for iGEM. “Find the truth, stick to it and have fun”, he told us.
Getting a historical perspective of iGEM placed the competition in a wider context: iGEM is driven by students like us! Randy's talk highlighted the importance of striving for openness, open exchange of ideas, parts, information and resources that we all contribute and take from - and made us feel part of this movement.
John Sayers
We had the chance to meet John during our crash course. He found and promoted the use of T5 exonuclease.  Through our conversation with him we learned more about the biology of the enzyme and about the Giibson assembly method. It made us realize the years of work that were dedicated to setting up the tools we now use every day for our own experiments. The encounter also clarified the importance of understanding the basic biology of the procedures we do - only with this understanding can we rationalize why things go wrong!

Dear Diary,
What a beginning! As the new term starts for students at Linköpings University, they will be welcomed by a colourful driveway to school, tagged by students from various student organizations. And of course, we are one of them! One early morning in August, a couple of us went with dye and brushes to this driveway in order to paint our LiU iGEM-logo on the avenue to the school.
I would like to say that the result isn't too shabby!

What a night! One of our teammates was a speaker at a TEDx-event in Norrköping and he was A.W.E.S.O.M.E! A night in the name of Biology, what could possibly go wrong! Six months of planning and preparing for this night and it has finally happened and we could not have wished for a better outcome. To Norrköping we brought friends a family and everyone we could find interested, including our two mentors (Lasse and Per) and as far I could tell, they were happy with the result.
We are all very proud of Martin who took the stage. He spoke for us and with us, and we can all agree that no one could have done it better!

Our post regional data demonstrates the success of our proof of concept system. We will now demonstrate that our detector TALEs can detect target DNA with specificity and our coiled-coils allow in vitro assembly which is further characterized to show proper reporter activity compared to a direct fusion. We have further characterization of our parts and a full system kinetic model. But most importantly, we can show that our final capture system works!

Can we detect DNA with specificity?
  We ordered 60mer FAM-labeled [A] (target sequence for TALEA) and FAM-labeled [B] (target sequence for TALEB) oligos and hybridized them with their reverse complement oligo to make double stranded pieces of DNA containing the target sequence of our TALEs. Using these target sequences and following the TALE Nitrocellulose Functionality Assay , we showed that TALEs bind their target sequence. We incubated Ferritin fused to an E coil to TALE fused to a K coil to make the ferriTALE complex. The complex was then blotted on strips of nitrocellulose paper. The strips were then blocked with milk and soaked in the appropriate DNA solution. Finally, the strips were washed and imaged. We showed that not only TALEs bind DNA (figure 24 and 25), they are also specific for their own target site (Figure 26).

The fact that we see no significant difference means that the polysilicate layer does                                              not have a detrimental effect on the optical properties of the cells.
Concluding, the spectroscopy experiments showed that our biolenses almost have no influence on the amount of light that was passed through. More than 99% of the initial light is transmitted through our microlenses, making them a good option for any kind of optical application. Moreover, the results obtained from this experiments verify the assumption made in the modeling of microlenses that we have non-absorbing materials, so the imaginary part of the refractive index was set to zero. Furthermore, it verifies the scattering model where we concluded that we have hardly any backscattering from our devices.

Characterizing Biolenses on solar cells
Introduction
Solar panels are used to convert the potential of solar energy into electrical energy. A lot of innovation had already happened in this field, however the efficiencies can still use quite some improvement. As it was stated by Jutteau et al. (2015) , the efficiency of solar cells could be increased significantly by adding a layer of microlenses: as parts of the available light get lost due to the fact that solar light is parallel and non-focused, the amount of electrical energy that can be retrieved from the sun could be higher. This limitation can be solved by applying a layer of microlenses onto the solar cell that focus the light in the solar panel, as shown by Jutteau et al. (2015) .
The microlenses used in the research of Jutteau et al. (2015) are chemically produced under harsh conditions, such as extremely high temperatures, low pressure and caustic chemicals. This does, in our opinion, not complement the aim of being more environmentally friendly.
Our E. coli cells covered in polysilicate however, could suppose a biological alternative for these chemically produced microlenses. The biological microlenses, were produced under physiological mild conditions (37 ºC, 1 atm and no harsh chemicals) and would fit much better in the image of environmental friendliness.
To put our cells to test and see if these are just as promising in increasing the efficiency of solar cells as chemically produced microlenses, we have called for help in the department Photovoltaic Materials and Devices at the TU Delft. Here, prof. Dr. Arno Smets, introduced us to Stefaan Heirman (see acknowledgements ), a"

It is a vivid illustration of the central dogma and other molecular facts of synthetic biology. The rules and other details are available on the chess game page.
The activities, survey and outreach we carried out this year are various. This is a timeline showing what we’ve experienced since the formation of our team. In early April, we joined Zhejiang Museum of Science and Technology and Guokr.com to hold a booth at the Science Fair. At the same time, we carried out a survey on synthetic biology. Later Dr. Yuhua Hu from University of Edinburgh visited our lab and shared the experiences of Synthetic Biology Society of their college with Synthetic Biology Club of ours. In May, team NJU-China visited our lab and we shared each other’s project. In August, we were invited by NCTU_Formosa and visited Taiwan to meet 7 iGEM teams from 6 universities. During the summer vacation, we held the Qiushi Summer Camp with College of Life Sciences, where 72 high school students from all around China joined the camp.
We gave lectures of iGEM to the pre-undergraduates, and guide them to do some real lab work including PCR. In September, as we were working really hard on our project, we also did some interviews with companies that produce herbicides. We did it both online and offline. For the online track, we interviewed big companies like Bayer and Dows via email. For the offline track, we visited three local companies and interviewed their managers of sales departments and R&D departments. We think that our interviews are really important because we want to know the approaches and strategies of turning our devices in lab into products in the market. The experiences and results benefit not only our team, but also the whole iGEM community.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

It is significant for synthetic biology to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement, the same to all the other engineering disciplines. We Jiangnan_China have volunteered to test some devices that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable by measure the expression level of GFP, in order to help the iGEM community collect data about how reliable will these devices turn out to be in labs around the world.

BIOSINT_Mexico,2014,Team:BIOSINT Mexico#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," the equations of its expression are deduced by the same way, so:
In our system, both expressed gene constructs are part of another reaction in presence of deep red light (660 nm lightwave). When photoreceptor protein (PhyB construct) detects deep red light, it fuses to its interaction factor (PIF6 construct) and form a protein
For the complex creation, follow the following reaction in presence of 660 nm light.
Where Ku is the constant of the reaction, and is on concentration units. And K-u is the constant for the inverse reaction (separation of the complex), and the active form of the complex can be abbreviated as CPPA. Then, we can infer the concentration of active complex by the equation.
Also, in presence of far red light, the complex passes to its inactive form, represented as CPPI, by the following reaction:
Where KD is the constant of the reaction and K-D equals zero, because deactivated complex can’t return to its active form.
Then, if we despise the degradation rate of the inactivation of the protein complex, we can simplify the calculi of concentration of active photo protein by replacing 6 in 5.
Equations for mer Operon production
For the mer operon expression we start from the reaction
Of all the genes of this operon we used two specific proteins. merE is a transport protein in charge of the active transport od methyl-mercury from the environment of the cell to its interior. Once in the inner cytoplasm, merB protein attacks the molecule and breaks the covalent bond releasing methane and Hg2+(s) to the cell. Methane is metabolized and the quicksilver is accumulated.
Then, for the merE production rate we know that
And, as mer operon is attached to a minimal constitutive promoter (PCMV), the production rate of the messenger molecule is
The same process is applied to merB from the operon. Therefore:
Equations for Hg transportation
Methyl mercury transportation is mediated by the merE enzyme from the mer operon. The metal present in the environment of the cell is transported to the inner plant cell following the reaction:
Where the metallic molecule is taken from the outside (MHgout) to the inside (MHgin) by a constant of reaction of KT and where K-T equals zero because the mercury inside cannot return to the exterior of the cell by the same reaction, given that mercury transportation mediated by merE is a one way process.
Since the reaction is mediated by an enzyme, it could be expressed by:
Then, it is"

We also tested methods of sterilising plant tissue, such as using different concentrations of ethanol and bleach. Seeds and seedlings were inoculated with wild type Pseudomonas sp.
Performed square plate assays with Herbaspirillum seropedicae and Azorhizobium caulinodans, but results were inconclusive as colonies grew too large and overlapped. Repeats will be performed with bacteria inoculated at greater distances from each other.
As wiki freeze draws closer, we are trying to develop more pages of our wiki and keep on top of it to hopefully lighten the load later when the deadline becomes imminent.
Week commencing: 17/09/2018
In the lab this week we carried out repeats of the square plate assays, and processed the results. H. seropedicae showed positive chemotaxis, whereas A. caulidolens showed no chemotaxis towards naringenin. We also learned to use the microscope to look at our nitrogen fixers in preparation for using the u-slides gifted by our sponsor ibidi.
We assembled a streptomycin resistance gblock into a pSB1C3 backbone by Gibson assembly, and successfully transformed E. coli DH5α with the streptomycin resistance gene via heat shock.
For the naringenin operon, 4 Gibson Assemblies were set up in parallel with different volumes of DNA. These were then transformed into commercial DH5 alpha cells. Between 30 – 60 colonies grew on all 4 plates.
Week commencing: 24/09/2018
The streptomycin resistant part made last week was characterised by comparing growth rates of the transformant and wild-type E. coli DH5α at a range of streptomycin concentrations on a 96-well plate.
We were lucky enough to set up a stand at the European Researchers Night held at The Great North Museum this week. We explained the basic premise of our project as well as our Victoria Tunnel vision to members of the public. This was a chance to see how the public felt about the scheme, we also took the opportunity to ask how people felt about GMOs and if they felt our project was tackling the stigma surrounding them.
We also gave a talk to the new students in the School of Engineering. The talk was very useful in helping us create a narrative for the presentation in Boston. There was substantial interest in the hydroponics and the application of engineering in Synthetic Biology.

We advised about cloud funding, especially which website to use, and how to collect sponsors and patrons. For the website, iGEM nagahama team actually used the website ‘campfire’, which we also used in advance and advised to use.
＜May Festival＞
On May 20th and 21st, as iGEM JAPAN, we participated in university festival of University of Tokyo, ‘May Festival’. In this festival, with KAIT JAPAN team, Tokyo Tech team, Kyoto team, Kobe team, Nagahama team, and Gifu team, we held an exhibition booth and presented our projects with posters. Since May Festival is one of the most famous university festivals in Japan, many people including middle school or high school students, university students, many professors and many researchers came to the exhibition booth. They listened to our projects and gave us a lot of opinions from many perspectives. Since many teams of iGEM participated, we discussed our project and deepened our knowledge in details especially the protocol.
＜Creating a document about GMM(GMO) legislations＞
Genetically modifying is a technique of modifying DNA using genetic engineering methods. This technique is used in food, agriculture, and many other fields. In Japan, there are quite a lot genetically modified foods, and we are quite familiar with GMO regardless of pro or con. (Find out the survey that we took on human practices page!) However, in Japan, there are both people feel positive about GMOs and people who feel negative about GMOs. Having this background, and also thinking of safety and conservation of ecosystem, we consider that these are the reasons why the GMM(GMO) legislations are quite restrict in Japan. On the other hand, if we look outside Japan, the legislations are really different in each country and area. So, our team collaborated with 9 iGEM teams: Manchester team from the UK , Virginia team from the USA , AQA Unesp team from Brazil, , UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team from Chile , ITB_Indonesia team from Indonesia , KUAS_Korea team from Korea , IIT_Delhi team from India ,  and UAlberta team from Canada ,  and created a document of GMM legislations. This document has created by 10 teams from 10 countries in 5 continents. By researching GMM legislations and comparing those legislations between countries, we aimed to understand the depth and diversity of laws, and also the"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of the BAR can either lead to kinase activity or phosphatase activity of EnvZ (depending on the conformational change in the receptor and the intracellular osmolarity) which in turn leads to dephosphorylation of OmpR inside the cell. When the osmolarity is low, phosphatase activity of EnvZ is pronounced which leads to increased expression of ompF gene and vice versa. Our first goal was to express RFP which is OmpR regulated. See OmpR-Regulated-RFP in Figure 6.
Silencing protein expression with MicF RNA
The micF gene has been shown to regulate post-transcriptional expression of ompF gene. The micF gene encodes an antisense RNA which binds to its target region in ompF gene, leading to inhibition of translation . Taken this fact into consideration, we tried to incorporate MicF Target (MicF-T) and GFP in one plasmid in order to express micF-Regulated-GFP. See MicF-Regulated-GFP in Figure 6.
Showing differential expression of RFP and GFP
This is the final part of the fluorescence signaling system. In order to investigate both the effects of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated OmpR, this part is created. The main idea is to introduce micF RNA in a plasmid, together with OmpR-Regulated-RFP and MicF-Regulated-GFP. In high intracellular osmolarity condition, micF binds to MicF-T in MicF-Regulated-GFP and silence production of GFP (Red colonies are pronounced here). In contrast, GFP is pronounced in low osmolarity when micF is not binding to MicF-T. Thus, it makes the whole system sensitive to both kinase and phosphatase activity in the BAR. See OmpR-Regulated-GFP/RFP in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Signaling biobricks: OmpR-Regulated-RFP, MicF-Regulated-GFP and OmpR-Regulated-RFP/GFP.
Replacing RFP and GFP with quorum sensing molecules
After showing that differential expression regulated by OmpR is possible, we want to extend this system to production of quorum sensing molecules. Each fluorescent protein is replaced by a  quorum synthase, keeping the backbone and other parts same. See OmpR-Regulated-RhII and MicF-Regulated-LuxI in Figure 7. OmpR-Regulated-RhII is basically similar to OmpR-Reg"

UFMG_Brazil,2014,Team:UFMG Brazil#Project#Policy_-_-_TEXT.html," in this field.
Other important problem for research in Latin America addressed in our survey was the importation experience (Figure 12). Many reactants used in research are produced elsewhere, out of Latin America and the countries from this continent face a great difficulty in acquiring those reagents. Since iGEM happens in a short period of time, reagents necessary aquired to project development that are not received in time happens often, limiting the experiments and compromising the quality of the project.
In our survey, more than 40% of the answers said they had bad importation experiences.
Moreover, because the vast bureaucracy of the import supervision agencies, the arrival time of the material is extremely long , often exceeding 2 months (Figure 13).
This delay impairs the quality of the reagents and affects project development, because during the long time the reagent takes to arrive to its destiny they are not properly stored, presenting worst quality or even inactivating reagents such as enzymes and antibodies.
Sometimes, the long wait can cause the abandonment of the project (Figure 14).
In addition to be time consuming, the importation process is also expensive. The price of reagents in Brazil are in average three times higher when compared to USA and Europe, burdening even more the limited science funding available.
The good news for us in Brazil is that former soccer legend and now congressman Romário de Souza Faria (Fig 15), is trying to approve a new law (Project of Law 4.411/12http://www.camara.gov.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra?codteor=1024048) which would facilitate importation of goods for research and technology, accelerating the time these goods take to get to their destination. We believe this is a very important initiative to start to improve our participation in the world scenery of science.
We tried to contact Romario’s accessors to talk about his law project, but it was election times in Brazil, so it was not possible. Fortunately,  Romário was just reelected for more 8 years in the congress, giving us the opportunity to further discuss this important issue to Science development in Brazil.
In this context, we asked others Latin America universities whether or not there is some government initiative to improve the importation situation in their countries, and unfortunately, most of them does not even know about any bill in this field (Fig 16).
Solutions
We believe that Science is important and that it can change the world. We think synthetic biology can help. We also believe in iGEM and we wish that brazilian students have"

1. Collaboration: We have greatly enjoyed interacting with iGEM teams from around the World and we generated an important piece of data for the team from the the University of Exeter . In addition we had useful discussions about each others projects with the Valencia and WashU teams. These interactions are documented on our collaborations page.
2. Human Practices: We have engaged in a number of outreach events to publicise the potential of plant synthetic biology. These have included University Open days, school and public events.
In addition we conducted a survey that assessed public attitudes to the use of genetically modified organisms for food or medicine. These are outlined on our public outreach and survey pages. We also extensively communicated with professional plant bio-technologists for insight into using plants as a biofactory. This information was incorporated into our modelling .
3. Validated Parts: We have generated a set of biobricks that contain a novel set of plant promotors in the Phytobrick standard. These are outlined on our parts page . We tested these parts by expressing the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone antagonist (TSH) in the tobacco leaf expression system. These parts are outlined on our composite parts pages and our attempts to express these proteins are outlined on the Results page as well as in our lab diary .
Due to an unfortunate mix up we did not submit our Judging form on time. However the generation of these novel basic and composite parts fulfill the Silver requirement.
Please ask any questions about this during the poster sessions."

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Part Collection_-_-_TEXT.html," (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With help"

HUST_Cheering
On July 7th, members of team ShanghaitechChina_B attended HUST-CHEERING seminar hosted by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. After several days of heavy rains, the city suffered serious water-logging. Power supply was damaged in HUST. Organizers and participants had to move from the hall to the teaching building to continue our seminar. The classrooms were not spacious but were big enough for passionate IGEMers.
Because ShanghaitechChina_B is a newly founded team, we gave a presentation about our project and received many pieces of valuable advice. Experienced IGEMers also gave their encouragement to our team. Our team gained a more comprehensive understanding of IGEM competition through this event and became much more interested in synthetic biology. It was quite an experience to establish friendships with other IGEM teams.
iDPI
Owing to one of the purposes of IGEM that is to improve public awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology, as the first team founded in ShanghaiTech IGEM, we decided to establish an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI). This year, the IDPI invited students and teachers from Shanghai Concordia International High School and held an IGEM Open-Lab Day on Sep 3rd, 2016. Along with another IGEM team at Shanghaitech, we warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Concordia. Their delegation included two major science teachers and eight students from different grades. We delivered two introduction speeches about and synthetic biology and the IGEM on behalf of two ShanghaiTech IGEM teams respectively. One was done by Haolong Zhu, a member of ShanghaitechChina Team, another was by Shenjian Ai, one of our team member. We introduced our IGEM project Gutrio to these curious visitors. To explain the design of our project, we made analogy of engineered bacteria to trained agents who carried secret weapons to terminate their targets. Thus, we described our potentially complicated experimental system in an understandable manner - an amazing adventure. Those high school students were all cheered up: “It was really cool!”. Our provocative speeches did stimulate their interests to synthetic biology.
After that, we held an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of the"

6th Cebitec Symposium
European iGEM teams meet in Bielefeld, Germany
A review on the 6th CeBiTec Symposium Genome-Based Microbiology: From -omics Research to Systems and Synthetic Biology
The annual CeBiTec Symposium, first held in 2006, deals with prospective topics in the broad spectrum of biotechnological research. Each year international scientists come together in Bielefeld setting the focus on current innovations, approaches and methodologies. The issues so far included Solar Bio-Fuels (2008) , bioIMAGING (2009) and New Frontiers in Microbial Genome Research (2010) . The 6th CeBiTec Symposium was held under the topic Genome-Based Microbiology: From -omics Research to Systems and Synthetic Biology took place between the 18th and 20th of July, 2011. As this year’s topic included Synthetic Biology, this offered the opportunity for the iGEM team Bielefeld to add an iGEM session to the symposium’s agenda. The students accommodated five teams from all over Europe to present and discuss their past and future projects in front of the international scientific community.

Smile Mates_Best Education and Public Engagement:
Best Education! Although dental caries trouble people around the world,especially in China, we haven't pay enough attention to oral caring methods or to our own oral conditions. Thus we organized this human practice to benefit our mates in the campus, arousing individuals' attention to dental caries prevention. Most of our participators were students, but we also met with a 5-year-old little girl and some faculties and dustmen above 40 years old. By giving and explaining a certificated oral condition exam for free, we helped our mates know more about the role of bacteria population in containing our oral homeostasis. Then we offered several advice for each of the participators while explain our new dental caries solution, including some basic transgenic principles. At last we asked them to check their oral condition routinely so our idea could be spread from time to time. Best Public Engagement! As mentioned above, we have a large scale of engagement and triaged a wave of curiosity and care about the oral hygiene throughout our campus. Our mates' attention covered from their own well being, which is our primary aim, to the principle of homeostasis and transgenic, even to the final cure of dental caries. We gave them a little questionnaire during the queuing, chatting with them, from which we not only established dialogue but also found some interesting points of views outside the lab:
1.Relating to human health care, the public needs more patience and confidence for young scientists while young scientists must try to make the product practicable and easy to reach.  Kindness and care outside the pure medical science is what matters most.  Since the young dentists and the young scientists are actually college mates here, we received massive trusts and kindness during the whole process. However this also"
