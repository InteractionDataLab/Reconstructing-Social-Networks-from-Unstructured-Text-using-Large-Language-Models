What does DNA stand for? The National Dyslexics Association!
Ignoring the attitudes of Brexit, our iGEM team has set up a two-way collaboration with iGEM Marburg. We’ve worked hard to create easily understandable resources to help teams make the content they produce more accessible for those with disabilities and special educational needs.
iGEM Marburg reached out to us, asking if our wiki fit their criteria for being an accessible web-page. We checked out their page, and we met most of them!
Our wiki has:
Has a high colour contrast. Our text is easily distinguishable from the background, and we do not use a red-green combination to make text distinctive.
Text and headings are distinguished by both size and colour, and is defined in boxes/obvious segmentation. The links we use are descriptive.
The page is scalable- we used % and ems.
Information that belongs together is shown in one frame.
We sent them an infographic (see below) in turn on how to make sure all content the team produces is dyslexia friendly. iGEM Marburg were proud to tell us that they had made an effort tick off every box!
Double Trouble(shooting)
In September, we hosted a troubleshooting meet-up with Imperial, UCL and Westminster that had been in the workings since the Oxford Conference. We were lucky enough to have design students from UAL give us advice on how to make the materials we present look decent, and had the opportunity to discuss our projects.
Imperial were keen to continue our collaboration, and asked us to review the app that they are producing. In turn, they offered to work with our Max to help him with mathematical modelling.
Wading into Research
We kicked off our collaborations by supporting Warwick’s lab research. Our own lab team headed down to London’s “beach” and into the river to collect samples of water and sediment from the Thames."

Our Safety Case
The safety case we created will ideally serve as a model for other iGEM teams and set the precedent of how safety cases can be used as a safety platform for the iGEM competition. The scope of our safety case is limited to the serA kill switch.
Identified Environmental Hazards:
Bacterial Conjugation
Accidental Release
Natural Migration
Decomposition of biomass from dead E. coli cells
Gene products - serA
Reliability of the BioBricks
Knockout Nitrate: Our serA Kill Switch Safety Case Diagram

Our safety case is not perfect. Realistically no safety case applied to biology really can be. Since the scope of the iGEM project is limited due to time constraints, experimental results that validate the safety of systems in simulated environments may be hard to come by. In software engineering, when safety arguments are not fully developed, it is common practice to indicate this in the diagram with a diamond following any claim that cannot yet be supported with current evidence.

    However, from our Orthogonality test and killing test , we find that we can just find warrior II that can be killed by warriors from the other group but not itself. Warrior I cannot satisfy this Therefore, we improved our gene circuit by choosing specific combinations of AHL, receptor and promoter.
II Design 2.0
Fig. 2 Improved gene circuit of two warriors. The one on the top is warrior I while the one below is warrior II. The gene circuits of beggar and farmer are modified in a similar way.
    In this circuit, warrior II can only be killed by C4HSL secreted by warrior I, but not 3OC6HSL secreted by itself. (This can be shown in Orthogonality test )
    Without TetR, we can see that C4HSL can activate expression of LacI by binding to RhlR and LuxR from results of orthogonality test . However, we have TetR here! C4HSL forms a complex with the protein RhlR inside warrior I. This complex activate expression of TetR, TetR can then inhibit the promoter Plux/tetR, thus counteracting the self-activating effect. In this way, the expression of LacI is not activated so warrior I does not kill itself. We modify the gene circuits of beggar I and farmer I in a similar way so that warrior I no longer kill them. Its feasibility can be seen in Improved gene cicuit ."

Helping Another Team
In the spirit of collaboration and continuing research that really characterizes iGEM, we helped the 2012 iGEM team from CU-Boulder with their project by providing them with our tobacco cell lines (NT-1 cells). We also gave them directions for growth and transformation of the cells. Another person contacted us and we worked with them on the ethanol genes from last year. The person ended up being a postdoc from India and not an iGEM team member.
The Importance of Education
Our team's various human practice projects aimed to introduce our project and synthetic biology in general to the public. Because we believe many of the controversies and concerns involving synthetic biology stem from a lack of education and discussion, and because we believe scientific awareness should be spread to all age groups, we tried to reach out to a diverse range of people at various events and through various media.
Bill Nye The Science Guy Science Expo
On September 6th, Bill Nye The Science Guy came to the University of Nevada to give a talk, and the University decided to host a science fair before the event. All clubs, teams, and organizations related to science were invited to bring a cool demonstration for the public. In addition to this being the official unveiling of our public iRICE poster and answering questions about our project, we set up our vitamin catching game and taught the public (mostly little kids and their parents) how iRICE could, dare we say it, CHANGE THE WORLD!
The Vitamin Catching Game
In our pursuit to help the public understand our project in a fun and simple way, we created a game that demonstrates how iRICE allows for the binding of vitamins to rice. Using only simple household items (a swimming noodle, velcro ball catchers, and a few tennis balls), we have created a giant rice grain that can hold"

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

The focus was mainly on STEM fields and were often a combination of the core fields of STEM, namely biology,physics, chemistry and engineering. This discussion led to the introduction of synthetic biology as a field that students interested in biology and engineering could pursue.
As we discussed the possibility of universities abroad- the main question in hand was the requirements to get involved in things outside of academics. Out of the many suggestions made by the team member, she also presented about iGEM NYUAD’s project and explained the unique aspects that were added due to the combination of two distinct fields.
This session was followed by a question answer session in which the teachers and students asked about various topics related to STEM field.

Brief Description:
The students were introduced to the IGEM competition in general and informed about the different tracks as well as the different aspects of the competition such as the engineering, biology and outreach aspects. They were then briefly told about our NYU Abu Dhabi and introduced to the team members. After that, the general idea behind our project was presented and the problem our team is trying to solve, namely the issue to food safety. More focus was placed on the biology aspect of the competition as this was biology class, and the biology mechanisms used in our projects, such as bacteria transformations and different amplification methods such as PCR, LAMP and RPA,  were explained in more detail. Next, the students were given an idea of what the experience of being part of such as team is like and some of the outreach activities the competition entail. Finally, the students were given the chance to ask questions about the competition and about university life and the application process in general.

Results
The model has utility for anyone trying to grow mycelium within a mold. The user will input the size of the initial sample, the size of the mold, and the number of days given to grow. The model will tell the user whether the mold would be filled or not. Furthermore, the model will tell the user how much mycelium was grown in the time given.
Discussion
Before this model, there had been no published model to accurately simulate mycelial growth, let alone within the constraints of a mold. The Eden model was a necessary but insufficient starting point for this model, and the reference used can be found at this link: http://www.jfgouyet.fr/fractal/fractauk/chapter4.pdf. Overall, the ability to accurately simulate mycelial growth is useful for anyone attempting to use mycelium as a building material. The model was able to simulate mycelial growth accurately, adhering to the results obtained in the lab with high fidelity. The code base is given in plaintext below. Finally, the code is extensively commented. Please refer to the code base below if you require further clarification.

FAFU-CHINA,2016,Team:FAFU-CHINA#page4_-_-_TEXT.html," our project idea is good to solve the root of the problem.
Medication
After consulting with otologist, we learnt some knowledge about treatment for hearing-loss people.
Ear is composed of four main parts. Outer ear is the entry of sound waves. Middle ear amplifys sound waves. Inner ear is responsible for the transduction of sound energy to electric signals. Acoustic nerve transmits the electric signal to the nerve center. All parts are important for the ability of hearing and any damage will result in hearing loss or disability.
The treatment for hearing loss involves reconstruction of the ability of each component. Normally there are five major approaches, external ear reconstruction, tympanic membrane repair, ossicular chain reconstruction, hearing aids, and cochlear implantation. Those surgical cure methods generally recover the structures in the ear for normal function, and hearing aids create the sound vibration with engineering methods.
Sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing loss the most difficult to cure. At present, for mimicking function of cochlear, cochlear implants (CIs) are used to create special electric signals responding to different sound signals it catches. However, ear can sense more than 100,000 kinds of sound frequencies, while the manufacture we made can only generate about one hundred kinds of sound frequency. As a matter of fact, the signal generated by CI is also different largely with natural cochlear.
For the most important part, CI is more than expensive for a normal family.
Apart from those function and cost issues, CI is potential to lead to immune response and other problems for the body as an artificial equipment in a human’s body.
To deal with these problems, firstly, we believe that we should advocate people to protect their ears. In addition, for people who have suffered from these problems, we want to do something to improve their social acceptance and discover better resolutions for hearing loss treatment.
Charity associations
We consulted several local charity associations about the issues they concern related to hearing-impaired population. We also expressed our interests and we hope to further our Human Practices after the Jamboree.
Lions Club of Shenzhen: They irregularly hold activities to help blinds in rural areas of China under the help of government. In Shenzhen, they keep tight contact with community health center all over the city and they periodically organize health care for people with hearing impairment. Other events including helping them with employment and other living problems and holiday consolation are often arranged. They also have special service team formed by individuals and authorized to develop activities on their own.

I am a senior research associate in the Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology, Newcastle University. I did my undergraduate and Master Degrees in China. I entered the world of bacterial chromosome segregation when I did my PhD project at Oxford University with Jeff Errington. Understanding the process of chromosome segregation and how it is coordinated with cell division in Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis remain my main research interests. Currently my work focuses on chromosome behaviour in B. subtilis L-forms and its application in synthetic biology.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html,"Background
In China, because of the UN human issue that scientists used 60 children to examine their new transgenic product, Golden rice last year, the question about the safety of transgenic technology remains indistinct. The masses even became scared of the transgenic technology as well as the total biotechnology. As a result, transgenic products were resisted all over China.
Lectures
Although many biologists came out to prove their justice, many Chinese still have stereotypes of biotechnology. We hosted two lectures about the correctness of biotechnology for college freshmen and high school students. We introduced the current stereotype phenomenon, then presented the biological applications that have made great contributions, such as bio-fuel, Artemisinin (kind of drug for malaria, first extracted by Chinese pharmacist Youyou Tu) produced by yeast and microorganism which can curb environmental pollution. Because our project involve the knowledge of both biological process and the lecture also involved the development of Synthetic Biology, which is a course of cross-disciplines, requiring us to look at a living organism from the perspective of information system. These contents attracted the attention of students from College of Information.
Brochures
To circulate synthetic biology knowledge and inspiration, we demonstrated key ideas in the discipline in a booklet and handed out the booklets to more high school students. Two students e-mailed us to express their interest in synthetic biology and consulted to us about how to be admitted by Tsinghua University.
COLLABORATION
Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM.
Communication & Collabroation
With University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB)
We cooperated with the iGEM team from University of Science & Technology Beijing (USTB) and we both learned a lot of thing from each other.
We often had friendly conversions through WeChat and told each other what our projects is about and how our projects is going. They told us that they had some trouble in assembling a plasmid they needed. They tried a lot of ways to assemble the plasmid but failed and they asked us for help. They sent us the photo of their unsuccessful plasmid and after some analyses we suggested them using a method called Gibson Assembly. They adopted our opinions and did some try again. Later, they told us that they had made it successfully and we were all glad to hear that.
We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are"

Natural midges (chironomidae) form swarms with the shape of a circulating sphere. The swarms consists of male adults congregating for courtship. They are organized through the sound of the wingbeats of the male midges.  Our system uses the sensitivity of chironomidae for sound and organize  them with synthetic wing beat sound.
above:  Fly pahts of wild type chironomidae
right:  Sound system for the neuronal training of the midges
""what happens, if nature is becoming a mirror of our culture?""
Product Description
'Sustainable Luminosity' takes your advertising message and delivers it using the medium of glowing insects. We train non-biting midges (Chironomidae) to fly in a way that their swarm takes the shape of your advertisement message. The insects are genetically modified to glow in the dark and alter their genetic make-up according to the training and sound input we provide. This initial training will be inherited over generations and keeps the swarm in shape.
Keep your energy bill low and be good to the environment - the natural light source we use is unchallenged by any man-made alternative to date and won’t disturb other animals. 'Sustainable Luminosity' provides cheap and sustainable advertisement with a natural charm.
Technical Description
Our midges are genetically modified to glow in the dark and trained to form into letters in small groups in response to spatial sound treatment. After the completion of complex training units, the midges learn to fly in the shape of the requested letter. Once this ability is acquired it will last and be passed on to following generations.
How can Letters be tought to insects? How can we teach the alphabet to midges? As chironommidae are sensitive to sound, we use a real-time sound spatialisation system to teach the midges. Until now we are only able to produce clouds of midges forming a simple LED Font
Midges are sensitive to sounds within the range of the wing beat of their species.  This sounds are normally ± 50 Hz around the specific frequence. To teach midges the alphabet, letters are coded with nine different sounds withing this range.  Through the spatial placement of the loudspeakers midges learn to react in a"

The first thing we had to do was to check if the gBlocks provided by IDT hat the correct sequence. For this we used the blunt end pjet1.2. cloning vector. For each gBlock we used 4 clones for sequencing. In case of the blue and the red gBlock we were quit sure we would get the correct sequence because we picked red and blue colonies. In case of the gBlocks containing the toxins we were not sure about the result. Red (Figure 1) and Blue (Figure 2) delivered like assumed correct sequences and also the mazF part (Figure 3) had the correct sequence. Only the ccdB part made problems.
Figure 1 Sequencing result for the gBlock encoding for the red chromoprotein and the mazE antitoxin.
Figure 2 Sequencing result for the gBlock encoding for the blue chromoprotein and the ccdA antitoxin.
Figure 3 Sequencing result for the gBlock encoding for the mazF toxin and the dam methylase.
When we got the results we saw, that all clones we used for sequencing looped out the sequence coding for the toxic ccdB (Figure 4). It seems that homologues region of 25bp is enough for E.coli to do recombination.
Figure 4 Negative sequencing result for the ccdB toxin dam methylase part. E.coli used the hologues RBS part to loop out the toxin part.
To solve the problem we designed a primer without the tac promoter and with a different RBS. The missing of the tac promoter was no problem because we had to use a pUC19 plasmid which already has a lac promoter downstream the MCS. After a successful PCR we used the product to do another pJET ligation. This time we did restricton analysis before sending for sequencing. We used EcoRI which hat to restriction sides and for this reason we got two fragments. One fragment should show a band at the size of 3000bp and the fragment a band at the size of about 1100bp. 3 clones"

Aims:
According to our experiment, RNA thermometer will form a loop on mRNA to inhibit protein translation, while the loop could open if temperature increases so that ribosome can pass the loop and produce peptides. We aim to use LEGO robot to present how the RNA thermometer work in E coli. Furthermore, in order to show this processing directly and teach public some knowledge of synbio, we designed and assembled a LGEO model to stimulate protein translation.
Description:
The robot represents as ribosome, a protein synthesis machine.       The double bridge represents the RNA thermometer. The bodies of double bridge are mRNA sequence; the gap between two bodies represents hydrogen bounds. The bridge in up state means RNA thermometer form a loop to inhibit translation, however the bridge in down state means RNA loop disappeared so that ribosome can pass.      The red and blue balls represent peptides of chromosome proteins.
Show time
Hello, I am a happy ribosome; now, I bind with my favorite mRNA and start to finish my job producing peptides.
BUT, WHAT IS THIS? A loop on the mRNA stops me; I cannot walk alone the way! OMG!!! Who can help me? T^T
This loop called RNA thermometer is formed by hydrogen bounds. The bounds will break up if temperature increases.

Currently, powdery mildew is controlled using mainly                         these type of fungicide, which is dispersed into the                         environment.

Powdery mildew affecting grapevines can cost annually                         up to 369$/acre, accounting for loses and expenses in                         fungicides and its application over the crops. PM can                         imply around 20% of total grapevine production expenses                         (5). By using PM resistant varieties, these costs can                         be reduced, which means lower expenses for the farmer                         and consequently, cheaper products for the consumer. In                         2013, 14 million tons of wine were produced in the                         European Union, and it is the 3rd most produced                         processed crop. The same year, it exported 6 million                         tons (6). These indicators serve to illustrate the                         economic relevance of grapevine crops and the benefits                         that would bring resistance to one of its most                         prevalent diseases, powdery mildew.
2. Nutritional qualities improvement
Nowadays bad proteo-energetic nutrition is a huge                         concern in plethora of countries. The consumable items                         do not provide enough energetic and nutritional values                         required for a proper development. The consequences                         also affect the infants causing growth deceleration,                         energy diminution for activities, more difficulties for                         learning and even a lower resistance against                         infections. With HYPE-IT improved crops could provide a                         better hedge against the previous odds named. Food                         whose assimilation and processing in the organism will                         be the best possible, maximizing their nutritive                         properties and contributing to the improvement of life                         quality of the people.
As an example for a scenario where crop nutritional                         improvement is needed, we imagine a farmer from South                         America, for example Brazil. He"

We ran the two plasmids on a gel so that we could gel purify the plasmid backbones. The results showed that we didn't let it digest long enough, so we cut the pieces out and will digest again next week. The results also appeared to show that the two plasmids had been mixed up. What we thought was UV+pACYC184 seemed to be GFP+pBR322 and vice versa.   We purified the HSP that we cut with KpnI and XhoI and eluted with 20uL. It's concentration was 16.4ng/uL. We also purified our PCR HSP g-blcok control and eluted with 50uL.It's concentration was 36.5ng/uL.  The four BioBricks parts that we transformed yesterday on 50ug/mL chlor plates all had colonies. They were parafilmed and put in the fridge. We need to design primers to get the piece out that we want and put it into our two plasmid system.
6/23/14:  I purified the pieces cut from the gel that we ran on Friday of the semi-digested UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 with KpnI/XhoI. I followed the ""PureLink Quick Gel Extraction Protocol."" Then, I nanodropped it and got 10.2ng/uL and 12.6ng/uL which is MUCH lower than it should have been. So I started over with new plasmids and let them digest (UV+pACYC184: 19.9 uL of plasmid which is 150.7 ng/uL, 3 uL buffer, 1 uL XhoI, 1 uL KpnI, 5.1"

Conclusions
In conclusion, it seems that the system is working as intended, as the OmpA-anti-GFP fusion protein stays anchored in the lipid bilayer and remains able to strongly bind GFP as expected. Whether this is the real situation is however impossible to know as the fusion abolishes some beta-sheets in OmpA that are important for beta-barrel formation.
Discussion
It is always difficult when modeling these kinds of processes to predict the time scale of the whole event.         The current model helps us to predict that the flipping process is very slow or unfeasible at all. The latter hypothesis might be reasonable enough and it would allow us to predict that the surface display system requires additional machinery which is found in living organisms. Therefore, it is unlikely to achieve a more accurate model without extra experimental information.
In eXplaY we model a system in a pure DOPC bilayer, which is also a simplified version of natural systems. Original E. coli lipids composition can make a huge impact to the model and its’ results as well.
Potential of mean force(PMF) simulations on pulling the anti-GFP across the membrane needs to be made in order to prove that the energy barrier is really high and the process can not occur naturally. Additionally, to observe flipping in a modeled system, higher temperature (37°C) might be a promising solution.

Biology technicians
The brilliant biology technicians at our school helped us by sourcing and setting up the equipment we used in our lab work, as well as generally keeping everything organized.
Kirsten Jensen, Imperial
Kirsten helped with troubleshooting whenever OpenWetWare and other forums did not yield useful info. She also helped us secure sequencing vouchers from Eurofins, as well as allowed us to store our competent cells and cell-free extracts in Imperial’s labs. When we urgently needed more pSB1C3 plasmid, she rescued us with some miniprepped BBa_J04450 that they had from last year. She has been our go-to person whenever we “hit the wall” and we have used her as the fountain of all knowledge. Her continuous encouragement was much appreciated throughout the project. Without her expertise, it would have been virtually impossible for us to test our constructs in the cell free system.
Westminster
We collaborated with Westminster, and they allowed us to use their plate reader to do the Interlab . Their PI, Dr Caroline Smith, assisted us while we carried out the interlab readings - without her we couldn’t have done it!

GP3 DELIVERY
An optimal inducible system should provide elevated levels of continuous induction product together with no gene expression in absence of inducer. It has been reported several chemical-dependent gene activation systems such as steroids or copper. We proposed a spatial controlled gene expression using the dexamethasone inducible system because of the sensibility, efficiency and tightly regulation that can offer.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
alcR is a positive regulatory gene from filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans which encodes a transcription factor that binds to alcA promoter. Therefore, alcR protein, under the influence of metabolized ethanol (acetaldehyde), can initiate the transcription process of gp3 by binding to specific sites on the alcA Promoter. alcA promoter is widely used to overexpress proteins since is one of the strongest inducible promoter in A.nidulans (Figure 4).
The pOpLac/LhGR system comprises a chimeric promoter that consists of lac operators cloned up-stream of a minimal 35s promoter and a transcription factor LhGR which is a phusion between the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the chimeric construct assembled by a high-affinity DNA-binding mutant of lac repressor (LacIBD) and the transcription-activation-domain-II of GAL4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Figure 4. Graphic representation of the dexamethasone inducible system. a) Constitutive expression of the chimeric complex that consists of glucocorticoid-dependent transcription factor fused with the transcription activation domain II (Gal4AD) and the ligand binding domain (LacIBD). In the absence of the steroid ligand, the transcription factor is trapped in an inactive complex via interaction between the GR LBD. b) Once dexamethasone is metabolized, the binding of dexamethasone to the LBD mediates dissociation of the fusion protein.
Dexamethasone inducible system exhibits a tight regulation that responds to low concentrations of the steroids. Samalova and co-workers reported that induction occurs within one hour of dexamethasone application and 1nM is sufficient for half maximal induction (Samalova, Brzobohaty & Moore, 2005). Since it has been reported that plants of Solanaceae family can be induced"

We have been having difficulties with lambda consistently going lytic. To correct this, we have plated 32 colonies from our original lambda containing strains to select for colonies that consistently go lytic when we provide stress. We found 3 strains that go lytic when we add H2O2. We will use those strains for our future tests.

This week was spent trying to determine if lambda is stressed enough during electroporation to go lytic. If that is the case, it would explain why we never see plaques after doing an electroporation.

We made a great discovery! If we plate TT9907 next to cholera, lysis by bacteriophage lambda is induced! This revelation ignited a new plan for the cholera detection team.  To our knowledge it has never been shown that Cholera triggers the lytic phase of bacteriophage lambda, but upon researching we did learn that quorum sensing molecules (AHLs) from many types of bacteria are sensed by E.Coli's SdiA receptor protein. An unknown pathway from SdiA excites lambda into lysis.  We hypothesize that SdiA detects the AHL emitted by Vibrio cholerae, and induction of lambda is a downstream result of SdiA stimulation.  Our goal is to demonstrate this, and"

iGEM teams are unique and leading the field because they ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine their projects in a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.

Safety Assessment
Once the biological device is complete, the biocontainment is implemented and the possible risks have been assessed, the robustness of the device must be analyzed. Although in an iGEM project it is difficult to implement, a biological device should be robust in the sense that even after failure of single parts or subsystems, the device will keep working in a safe way. The safety assessment allows finding weak spots in the biological design, as well as potential problems that may not have been taken into account previously. This information will help to redesign the biological device to make it more robust and safer, for example by implementing redundant circuits.
There are different ways of performing the safety assessment. One of the most common methods is the Tree Analysis. There is an inductive approach (Event Tree Analysis), in which possible failures are identified after considering malfunctioning of the different parts of the device, and a deductive approach (Fault Tree Analysis), in which failures are first defined and the possible causes are traced backward. We have developed an example of a Fault Tree Analysis applied to the biocontainment mechanism, which can be found below (Figure 2).
Figure 2: This figure shows the Fault Tree Analysis that we have developed to analyze the possible problems that might make the biocontainment method not work.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," decision making on antibiotic treatment is not only valuable in the veterinary field, but also relevant in the rapid diagnosis of the well-known MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infection ( Wielders et al. 2002 ). This infection, also known as the ‘hospital disease’, is extremely harmful to humans because it is almost impossible to treat with antibiotics. High-level resistance to methicillin is caused by the mecA gene. Detection of mecA during infections will have impact on the decision-making and the evacuation of the patient to prevent the spread of the dangerous MRSA.
We developed a versatile detection tool to detect the most relevant genes causing multiple antibiotic resistance (see Cas13a Design oage ). This expands the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies that contribute to the fight against antibiotic resistance, together with the upcoming methods to prevent, treat, or take away resistance.
Future vision
It became clear that our method could have a wide range of applications besides RNA detection. One of these applications, namely SNP detection was mentioned by one of our stakeholders (also see our Entrepeneurship page ).
SNP detection
Cas13a has single-base specificity. This means that Cas13a has the ability to detect single bases differing between two sequences ( Gootenberg et al. 2017 ). Such a variation of a single base in a DNA sequence among individuals is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Some SNPs are related to (the probability to develop) certain diseases. Being able to easily detect, study and evaluate SNPs can therefore give information about an individual’s predisposition to these diseases ( Nature Education 2014 ). Moreover, the detection of strain SNPs allows for the differentiation between different virus strains ( Gootenberg et al. 2017 ), which is important in choosing a treatment.
After the Giant Jamboree, we will meet with a multi-species animal breeding, genetics and technology companies to discuss the implementation of our technology to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock farming.

After the measurement of BPUL activity we made a scale-up and fermented E. coli KRX with <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> in a Braun Biostat B fermenter with a total volume of 3 L. Agitation speed, pO2 and OD600 were determined and illustrated in Figure 1. We got a long lag phase of 2 hours due to a relatively old preculture. The cell growth caused a decrease in pO2 and after 3 hours the value fell below 50 %, so that the agitation speed increased automatically. After 8.5 hours the deceleration phase started and therefore the agitation speed was decreased. The maximal OD600 of 3.53 was reached after 10 hours, which means a decrease in comparison to the fermentation of E. coli KRX under the same conditions (OD600,max =4.86 after 8.5 hours, time shift due to long lag phase). The cells were harvested after 11 hours.
Purification of BPUL
The harvested cells were resuspended in Ni-NTA-equilibrationbuffer , mechanically lysed by homogenization and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant of the lysed cell paste was loaded on the Ni-NTA-column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flowrate of 1 mL min-1 cm-2. The column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) Ni-NTA-equilibrationbuffer"

We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

This makes the organism inside inaccessible to both the user and the environment. This type of design serves two purposes. Not only does his design isolate our organism, but it also helps to protect our intellectual property, particularly if we continue to pursue a trade secret IP strategy.
Our design of all of these components were directly influenced by our conversations with investors, industry and potential end users. Through talking to a variety of individuals, we have determined that this seems like a feasible and necessary plan in order to ensure safety for our user, the environment and even ourselves. This will increase the likelihood of our technology being adopted in our market place as well as our intellectual property being protected.
To ensure that our organism performs the sensing task and nothing else we have engineered a bleach system into our final designs. This accomplishes two tasks in our product. Primarily, it ensures that the bacteria used in the testing does not live past it's usefulness, but it also accomplishes a secondary goal of making our product disposable in everyday waste by removing any potential biohazard. This decreases the costs associated with disposal of our product, ensuring safety and lowering costs.
Outreach and Community Development
Our team has aided in developing a synthetic biology community here in Alberta in a number of ways. Through our various networking events, we got  chance to not only receive valuable feedback that has helped to shape our project, but we also got to present our Synthetic Biology ideas in a number of ways. We shared with professional engineers in Alberta at the CPCGE talk we gave, we shared with the Alberta biotech community at the BioAlberta Gala and we shared with industry players in Alberta at the AITF summit to name a few. In addition, we collaborated with the Calgary collegiate team in helping establish the Consort Alberta high school iGEM team. Through frequent Skype chats and workshops held both in Calgary and in Consort, we helped them establish their team and develop their project ideas. With their hard work, they were able to take home the award for best human practices at their first jamboree. We hope that by encouraging future synthetic biologists we can sow the seeds for a thriving biotechnology business in Canada.

We were overjoyed to see that the prime minister takes such sincere interest in areas  we are also passionate about and that he understands the importance support for the youth in  science can make. While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such interactions where  you can see what a difference you can make are very rewarding as well. Being able to open  someone's mind, but even more so when is the prime minister's mind, to the important issues of  science and of support for the young scientists is certainly a memorable experience.
Presenting to the prime minister
ENGAGING THE YOUTH
As young people with great passion for science we found it very important to engage with other  young people.  Presenting synthetic biology to the young has the advantage that they were usually  not already influenced by the negative connotations the words genetic engineering bring with them  and are thus able to listen to us with open minds. It goes without saying that we found it important,  but also very fulfilling to present our project to our peers and connect with them trough common  interests in science.
We took the saying Children are our future to the heart and made sure to present our project to  children and teenagers as well as adults. We made sure to not only talk about synthetic biology and  our project, but also why science is so important, what had drawn us to it and our experience with it.
PRESENTATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOLS
We had presentations in many secondary school institutions across the country, talking about our  experience and how exciting our project is to our peers. We mostly presented this to students in 3rd  and 4th year of high school, who are just choosing what subjects they should take their exams in and  what university they should apply to. We were hoping to show them that natural sciences are an  exciting and rewarding career path and to inspire and encourage them to pursue science, if that was  their wish. We were glad to see that the students were indeed interested and engaged with us during  and after presentations, asking us questions about the project, synthetic biology, the iGEM  competition and our experience with research.

Gel electrophoresis
Depending on the size of the DNA fragments a 0.8 to 2 % agarose gel with 0.2 µg/mL ethidiumbromide was used. The gel was placed in an electrophoresis chamber and covered in 1x TAE buffer. Subsequently DNA samples mixed with loading buffer were loaded to the gel pockets and separated at 80-120 V for about 1 h. Last the gel was photographed for documentation.
Gel Slice Preparation
10 µL of 6x loading buffer was added to digested DNA und mixed. The sample was loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel and separated via gel electrophoresis at 75 mA for 20-40 min depending on the size of the DNA. For gel extraction, the gel was visualized on a UV-lightsource and the appropriate bands were cut using the x-tracta™ Gel Extractor tool (Promega). Gel purification was carried out using the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit.
Cloning
Restriction digest
For restriction of vector and insert DNA approximately 1000 ng purified DNA, 5 µL 10x buffer and 1 µL of each of the two restriction enzymes were mixed in a 1.5 mL reaction tube. The amount of DNA used depended on the size of the desired fragment. Water was added to a final volume of 50 µL. Restriction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by inactivating the enzymes at 80 °C for 20 min.

Promoter Characterization>
We have characterized two types of promoters endogenous to S. Cerevisiae; eleven alpha-factor responsive promoters (AFRP) and five constitutive promoters. To characterize these promoters, we cloned them into a shuttle vector plasmid to drive expression of GFP, which was subsequently integrated into yeast to create stable strains. Each construct’s fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry.
Alpha Factor Responsive Promoters (AFRP)
GFP
AFRP
Mating Factor
Alpha
AFRPs were selected from a microarray study where Roberts et. al. searched for genes responsive to yeast MAPK pathways including the alpha factor response pathway [ 5 ]. We picked the promoters of the genes that were shown to be up-regulated in the presence of alpha factor. For each AFRP, we measured its construct’s fluorescence over 7 concentrations of alpha factor [0nM, 0.5nM, 1nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1000nM, 3000nM] after 90 minutes of induction. Through multiple rounds of testing, we found pAGA1 to have the highest expression level and with very low basal expression and pPCL2 to have the highest basal expression and the second highest induced expression.
Constitutive Promoters
GFP
pTEF1
Constitutive promoters were selected from a study where Nevoigt et. al. used error prone PCR to create 14,000 pTEF1 mutants [ 4 ]. The study then selected 11 mutants with a wide range of promoter activity for further characterization. Out of these 11, we chose 5 of these mutants to use in our circuit. We confirmed that constitutive promoter pTEF1 m6 had the highest expression of GFP whereas constitutive promoter m7 had the lowest expression of GFP. Our data closely correlates with the results of the Nevoigt study.
Characterization data for all of our promoters can be found in Biobricks Submitted of our Achievements Section .

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," have relied mainly on the fermentation of agricultural crops. However, there are a number of problems with this approach: the reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. In the past there have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs (Galbe et al., 2007). Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC 6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E. coli. Cyanobacteria and E. coli will be co-cultivated in an apparatus that allows for the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. Not only will this project provide an efficient means for producing biofuels without the need for a carbon source, but it will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.
E. coli Project
The goal of the E. coli team was to transform E. coli with genes that produce medium chain fatty acids and ethanol, both of which can be used as biofuels. In addition, the group wanted to develop an E. coli glucose insensitive inducible promoter that would not be down-regulated in the presence of high glucose concentrations. In our system glucose levels produced by Cyanobacteria may be unpredictable; therefore having an E. coli inducible promoter that is glucose-insensitive will provide more control over expression of the biofuel genes.

Production of Medium Chain Fatty Acids as a Biofuel
Bay Laurel Thioesterase Cloning Strategy
Bay Laurel thioesterase (BTE) is a gene that is naturally found in the bay leaves (Umbellularia californica)and used as a spice in cooking. The BTE produces medium chain 12-carbon and 14-carbon fatty acids (Voelker et al.,1996). The Nevada team changed the codon sequence for BTE based on the publication by Welch et. al. “Design Parameters to Control Synthetic Gene Expression in Escherichia coli” by changing the codons that are more common in plants to codons common in E. coli. The newly synthesized intermediate part (BBa_K558003) also contained an E. coli rib"

After discussion we decided to use the second method to count and measure time.In retrospect this seems a interesting choice as many teams and research groups have tried and built oscillators.However, despite the simplicity of the idea, it has obvious similarities to a Integrated Chip(IC). Being able to do away with connections could allow for the complex systems to interact directly without affecting each others function.
Each of the tasks was divided up among us. Each group searched for literature regarding achieving our goals.

Best Software Tool Special Prize
Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.
To compete for the Best Software Tool prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

The HMF digest was run on a gel and purified yielding only a small amount of DNA.  This will be redone in the coming days.
G4 was digested.
Wednesday, August 27, 2014
Four lambda red-dCas9-L6 digestion reactions were run.  We digested the plasmid with AvrII and PacI.  These were PCR cleaned, instead of gel purified, and were then transformed into P. putida competent cells.
G4 was attempted to be ligated into the backbone. Cells were transformed and plated with the G4 ligation.
Thursday, August 28, 2014
The same digestion was repeated today as we did not get the DNA concentrations we anticipated.  This made it hard to transform, so we will do that again tomorrow.
At this point, G4 has not been successful transformed into the backbone. It has been decided to stop pursuing this GFP variant because it is being too problematic.
Friday, August 29, 2014
The digestion was PCR cleaned again using an additional wash cycle.  This still did not yield better DNA concentrations and we were unable to move forward with the transformation.  Some thought into why this was happening was brought up, but no conclusion was reached and we decided we would try again.

This collaboration between the BU Hardware Team and the Harvard iGEM team was based around engineering a microfluidic system to culture cell and measure the resulting cell growth.   Each team was responsible for separate parts of the system.  The BU Hardware Team primarily worked on the design, manufacturing, and testing of the microfluidic device. The Harvard iGEM team primarily worked on an optical density sensor which was aimed to measure cell growth. Even though each team focused on individual parts of the system collaboration was imperative to test and develop each teams work.

Our goal is to create an E. coli strain with increased swarming motility on special agar plates. Therefore,  we will perform directed mutagenesis techniques of motile E. coli and enhance their swarming ability. The  fastest E. coli strains will be selected and further improved. At the same time we will then be able to create   an effective motility-selection method. Now you are probably wondering what the benefit of fast E. coli might be? This can be answered by the ability  of bacteria to sense specific compounds in their environments. Chemoreceptors enable these organisms to move  towards or along gradients of such substances. The combination of speed and chemotaxis allows us to identify E.   coli strains which can find interesting compounds. Thereby, an easy method for the detection of pollutants,    toxins or even tumors could be provided.

Results
We combined the loop region with hairpin into the whole aptamer. And we designed varied hairpin sequences and hope that the alternative hairpin sequences with varied free energy, thus, stability profile would influence leaky background gene expression (Figure4) (Table 4).

Manchester,2013,Team:Manchester#FabProteinModel_-_-_TEXT.html," The pressure fluctuations are consistent with the applied isothermal-isobaric ensemble and is suggestive of compatible molecular dynamics conditions for simulations of βHACdH.
Figure 4. Graphs of the Energy Minimisation, Temperature, Pressure and Density equilibration of the βHACdH simulation system prior to simulation.
To His-tag or not to His-tag
Now that βHACdH is ready to undergo simulations, we ran a simulation for 1 ns under the notion that we would be able to visualize motions around the N- and C-Terminals during the course of the simulation and therefore determine, which terminal would be more appropriate to add His-tags to. The conclusion for our simulation was that the N-Terminal is ideal for the addition of His-tags for several reasons. Firstly, the C-terminal is localized in close vicinity to the interaction domain of the βHACdH homodimer, therefore the addition of His-tags could possibly interfere with the dimer interaction[6]. Our model also shows that the C-terminal is more dynamic compared to the N-terminal and there are several times in the simulation that the C-terminal interacts with the dimerization domain and may interfere with the folding and function of the protein[4][5][6]. Therefore we concluded that the N-terminal would be ideal to add the His-tags to, as the N-terminal is less dynamic and will be less likely to interfere with folding and the protein function. With this in mind, our experimental team began to design the His-tagged FabA BioBrick ( BBa_K1027003 ) to express a N-Terminal His-tagged βHACdH to use in the characterisation of βHACdH overexpression.

Images of overlaid from the following respective time points: 0 ps, 250 ps, 500 ps, 750 ps and 1000 ps with the following colours indicating each individual image: Green, Blue, Purple, Orange and Grey, respectively.  Both the N-Terminal and C-Terminal, are specified (Dotted Box), with a zoom in on each respective terminal at an angle appropriate to visualise the positions of the terminals.
Note
All figures of βHACdH were produced by us, using the βHACdH structure (PDB ID: 1MKB found at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1MKB) as obtained by Leesong et al 1996."

What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?
The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.
In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.
As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?
It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.
Identify the level of risk.
Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.
Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.
Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.
Good hygiene of workers.
Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.
Waste disposal protocols, among others.
In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time"

Quercetin degradation assey
Separation in two project
At this point we really started to work on the first approach, and we combined it to the second one.
The goal of the first approachis making a huge library of strains that were isolated from soil sample.
We would like, from a given soil sample, to isolate as much of bacterial diversity as we can.
Then we could test each strain on Quercetin liquid media and report Quercetin degradation.
Thanks to our collaboration with other iGEM team, we got samples from mant places around the world.
At the end we would have a library with some strains that are able to degrade Quercetin and some others that are not.
We could quantify the strength of the degradation and also make a link between the species that are able to degrade the Quercetin to make hypothesis about a common enzyme responsible for this degradation, through the creation of a phylogenetic tree.
To achieve that, here are the step of the protocol:
We plate the soil samples at 10^-2 and 10-3 dilutions (we choose these dilutions thanks to previous experiments) on non-selective agar media (LB, TSA, M9Glucose, M9) but also on selective media (FTO for micrococcus, Agar from Mossel for Bacillus Cereus, M9 Quercetin).
We then incubate for one or two days at 30°C.
When we have some colonies, we streak some that seems differents on LB or TSA plate in order to easy their growth. Once the streak bacteria grew enough, we give them a name to store them in the library.
For instance, FS_M69 stand for Frank&Stain_Microbesgroup n°=69  For a given strain we have the date of the stock, the species once its sequenced, the original agar media from where it was taken, the origin of the strain etc…
Then we make an overnight culture in Tryptic Soy Broth and systematically, we characterise our strain with a 16s rRNA PCR from colonies streaked on non-selective media plates.
When the overnight culture is over, we inoculate 100ul of it directly in a 5ml M9 1g/L Quercetin fal"

Drawing upon interesting points of discussion generated from , #CasAsks, we aim to probe further discussions and generate opinions on these topics. Firstly, stemming from our survey , we discuss extensively about the public’s opinion on the need for public engagement in navigating ethics. Next, we came up with a literature review of the existing guidelines governing the use, research and distribution of genetic engineering, as well as frameworks that are in place to mitigate possible risks in Singapore. This literature review has been adapted into a comparative study, done in collaboration with the 2018 École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (2018 Team EPFL) iGEM team, which aims to point out similarities and differences between Switzerland’s and Singapore’s ethics framework (refer to the document below for the full report). Lastly, we dissected the philosophical framework behind bioethics. This provides a fundamental understanding to the ethical discussion carried out throughout our Human Practices.
Discussion: Public Opinions on the Need for Public Engagement
In #CasAsks, 95% of our respondents feel the need for public engagement to navigate the direction of scientific research. In this post, we will discuss the possible reasons behind some of these opinions and review relevant ethical guidelines in Singapore.
Many respondents have echoed that unawareness and unfamiliarity with the technology may cause fear and anxiety with regards to its application. Referring to our interview with Dr. Ho , “ As far as a topic like gene editing is concerned, we must agree that Science itself is a moral enterprise. It is socially embedded and will be part of the society. In recognition for this aspect, it makes sense to engage with all"

Protocol
Plating of the bacteria onto agar plates containing 100 mM glucose and 34 µg/ml of chloramphenicol.
After 12 hours of incubation at 37°C single colonies were picked and inoculated overnight in 4 ml 2x YT medium (with 200 mM arabinose and 4 µl of 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37°C for 21 hours. For each E. coli with a different plasmid negative controls were inoculated with 200 mM arabinose instead of glucose.
2x YT agar plates with 100 mM glucose and different antibiotics were prepared:
a. 9 plates with streptomycin (50 µg/ml)
b. 9 plates with carbenicillin (50 µg/ml)
c. 9 plates with kanamycin (30 µg/ml)
d. 9 plates with tetracyclin (10 µg/ml)
e. 9 plates without antibiotics for the negative control
50 µl were plated onto the matching plate undiluted, 10x diluted and 100x diluted, all done in triplicates.
The plates were incubated for 21 hours at 37°C and the number of colonies counted.
The protocol was kindly provided by the Heidelberg iGEM 2017 team.
Results
As expected, we could observe that E. coli gained resistances and grew on almost all of our plates. Only on those containing kanamycin, there could not be any or very few E. coli colonies observed.
Due to the fact that most of our plates were overgrown, we could not see any difference between E. coli containing one of the three plasmids (Tab. 1).
To see the final results, check it out on the homepage of Heidelberg .

Libraries often contain a small percentage (less than 1%) of clones containing multiple inserts of the randomized region. Preferential selection and amplification of these clones may occur when panning against targets whose ligand specificity spans a length greater than that specified by the insert. When interpreting sequence data, be sure the sequence outside the restriction sites used for inserting the randomized sequence (Acc65I and EagI) matches the sequence shown in Figure 5. Once the flanking regions of the library insert have been identified, the insert size is easily determined.
Phage ELISA:
Carry out the plaque amplification procedure described previously- After the first centrifugation, save the phage-containing supernatants at 4°C.
For each clone to be characterized,  dilute an overnight culture of ER2738 1:100 in 20 ml of LB.
Add 5 μl of phage stock from Step 1(or a single phage plaque) to a 20 ml culture for each clone and incubate with vigorous aeration for 4.5–5 hours at 37°C.
Transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and spin at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and re-spin (discard the pellet).
Pipette the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube and add 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Allow the phage to precipitate at 4°C for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Spin the PEG precipitation at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Decant and discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a pipette.
Suspend the pellet in 1 ml of TBS. Transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube and spin at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet residual cells.
Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and re-precipitate with 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Incubate 15–60 minutes on ice. Microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, re-spin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a micropipet.

ABSTRACT
In a parallel galaxy, there were two brothers named T1R2 and T1R3, they lived in a galaxy that was under the threat of sweet monsters who wanted to rule the galaxy. Though the brothers were born with the ability to eat these monsters, they were too weak to fight with so many enemies. To be stronger, they asked the battle creatures who lived in planet JB486 for help and sent their genes to a battle king SC84117 in the meantime. Driven by a mysterious force from the depths of the universe, the battle king, after adopting the gene T1R2/T1R3, lost its genes ste2, sst2 and far1. After integration with T1R2/T1R3 perfectly, something magical happened, a spaceship with a red ruler appeared. The battle king transformed into this spaceship which can eat sweet monsters, known as the Sugar Hunter. Since then, he travels all around the galaxy to fight sweet monsters and use the red ruler to measure them, the galaxy stays peaceful ever after.

Heidelberg,2017,Team:Heidelberg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," beginning of our this year’s iGEM project. But how should we do that? While doing our literature research, we came across an exciting method named PACE - phage assisted continuous evolution. This method was invented by Kevin Esvelt and David Liu at Harvard university in 2011 (Esvelt et al, Nature, 2011). The idea behind this method is rather simple: Mimic natural evolution in bioreactor, accelerate it and direct it towards a specific goal. More precisely, PACE implements a fully closed, extremely fast evolution cycle comprising of replication, mutation and selection to enable in vivo directed evolution of proteins. In brief, the protein to be evolved is encoded by an M13 bacteriophage and transferred from one E. coli host cell to the next by means of phage replication and propagation. Importantly, the E. coli hosts express mutator genes (Badran et al, Nature Communictaions, 2015) to increase the phage mutation rate during replication, thereby creating a highly diverse gene pool. Finally, synthetic circuits in the E. coli host cell couple phage propagation efficiency to the fitness (i.e. function) of the protein to be evolved, by controlling the expression of an essential phage gene. Details on the PACE background can be found on the PACE subpage . By chance, we had the opportunity to meet Kevin Esvelt, the PACE co-inventor, who gave a talk in Heidelberg on June 1 st 2017, i.e. before we started our wet lab work. Kevin was kind enough to visit our team and discuss his PACE method in detail. Besides its power for directed protein evolution and conceptual beauty, we identified two major limitations of the current PACE setup:
It requires a complex, custom-made bioreactor (Figure 1) including sophisticated flow control setup, which is challenging to assemble and difficult to run robustly due to multiple failure points (potential phage contamination; risk for phage-washout if flow rates are too high; Host cell biofilm formation proper phage evolution)
PACE is almost entirely limited to improving an already existing protein function. To evolve truly novel functions, evolutionary stepping stones are required, which can be so far created only by slowly adapting selection pressure towards the activity to be evolved
RN158
. In practical terms, this means that evolving novel functions requires an extremely complex experimental setup comprising multiple, fine-tuned synthetic selection circuits applied in sequential order over many days. In most cases, it evolving a novel functionality from scratch remains a practically impossible task to be implemented in PACE.

8/19:  After extracting my cut TetR+pCat DNA, I ligated it with the pTet+_FPc parts.  I made two samples of each, one using the TetR+pCat as the backbone and the other using the pTet+_FPc as the backbone.  I also ligated the TetR gene with another constitutive promoter, J23101.  Both these ligations were then transformed.  The transformations of BFP+Term (CIP) worked well. Today, we also receive a new BFP part, K156026, from the parts registry that we had to request.
8/20: Transformations from yesterday worked.  However, the plates with the pTet+_FPc as a backbone were all glowing.  The addition of the TetR gene to the construct should repress the pTet promoter.  The plates with the TetR+pCat backbone had some colonies that glowed, but most did not.  I also did a restriction digest of BFP+Term, cutting at X,P.
WEEK 12: 8/22-8/26/2011
8/22: This morning I ran a gel of my BFP+Term RD's and pTet+B0034+G/RFP plasmids.  The BFP+Term RD's looked great, having bands exactly where they should be.  The uncut pTet+B0034+G/RFP plasmids looked about right, but I will have to do a restriction mapping of the parts to be sure.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#project_-_-_TEXT.html," can quantifiy the amount of luminescence - and thus, proportionally, the amount of secreted luciferase - by measuring the conversion of luciferin into visible light and integrating it over a timespan of 5 s. Therefore, medium samples were taken every 12 h after transfection of cells and measured via the Promega NanoGlo® luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Figure 3: A) Schematic depiction of the genetic constructs used for signal peptide testing via a secretion luciferase assay. B) Results of the luciferase assay, showing luminescence in relative luminescence units (RLU) as a function of time for the previously described three different signal peptide constructs as well as a control construct containing no signal peptide. C) Detection of secreted luciferases in the medium via a Western Blot, using an anti-Strep-tag II antibody as well as an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody for detection.
Discussion: The choice of signal peptide was nailed down
As would be expected, the EGFR signal peptide construct showed the lowest level of secretion. Although one might think this could also be attributed to a lower functionality of the signal peptide sequence itself after being translated, the lower secretion level is more likely to stem from lower translation initiation levels. Almost completely missing a 5’ UTR as well as a Kozak sequence, slower translation initiation (being a rate-limiting step) is likely to have lowered the level of translated protein in total. The constructs containing the Igκ and the BM40 signal peptide, on the other hand, contain a longer 5’ UTR as well as the Kozak consensus sequence, and thus result in higher secretion levels. Since the BM40 signal peptide hereby showed the highest secretion levels, it was thus incorporated into the receptor constructs.
Other receptor elements: stability and detection
Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.
EGFR transmembrane domain
For anchoring in the membrane, we decided to use a type-I membrane protein, which has a single membrane span with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell, respectively. As the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has already been successfully used in the iGEM project of Freiburg 2008, we decided to base our project on the same trans"

Collaborations
Newcastle
We collaborated with the Newcastle Team to help characterise one of their parts, the deGFP construct , which acts as a reporter in their improved biosensor framework called Sensynova .  We offered to use a flow cytometer to thoroughly quantify the expression of the deGFP construct, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as this method was not accessible for the Newcastle iGEM team.
After the arrival of the DNA, we transformed the deGFP construct into E. coli Top10 cells before we ran the sample through the flow cytometer. This would sort from a stream of bacterial culture individual cells based on their properties, specifically fluorescence. Culture fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and intensity was recorded using a 530/30 nm detector to obtain the mean, median and standard deviation of a sample of 10,000 cells from the original population. We have sent both the raw and analysed data to Newcastle for their further analysis and interpretation.
In return  Newcastle conducted a repeat of our experiment into testing the ability of UV to kill bacteria. By carrying out this experiment it meant that we could determine whether the results we obtained were reproducible, follow this link to see the results.
Cardiff
We also collaborated with the University of Cardiff iGEM team who conducted further experiments into testing the effectiveness of UV for the purpose of destroying bacteria.  Due to time constraints we could not carry out these experiments ourselves. We felt that it was important to extend the experiment to see how the percentage of bacteria that had survived irradiation changed with a greater amount of exposure for instance, 20 minutes or 30 minutes. Additionally by collaborating with another team it meant that we could guarantee the reproducibility our of results.  We sent a plate containing Top 10 E.coli to Cardiff and then using the protocol we had devised they irradiated 1 in 100,000 , 1 in 10,000,000 and 1 in 100,000,000 sample solution for five different exposure times. Most important Cardiff conducted the experiment for the extreme exposure times "
