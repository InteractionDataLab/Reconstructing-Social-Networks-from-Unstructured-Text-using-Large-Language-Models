UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesized IL-2 gene. The gene was modified to be biobrick compatible, however the expression of the IL-2 within a bacterial system is pending characterization. Characterization will be completed through the insertion of the gene into a pET26b expression vector that contains both an inducible T7 lac promoter, and a His(6) tag prior to the termination sequence1. This would allow for inducible expression of the cytokine in compatible bacterial system using Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and verification using an anti-His Western Blot2. The IL-2 gene was synthesized to be compatible with our L.brevis compatible plasmid, pIB184. This would allow for expression of the cytokine in our model bacterium.
Our L.brevis compatible plasmid, pIB184, was obtained through the Mahony Lab located in St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton. The Kim (2005) protocol was used from http://openwetware.org/ to stimulate our L. brevis cells to become electrocompetent, allowing for their transformation with pIB184, which was done through an electroporation protocol3-4.
pIB184 contains a gene that confers erythromycin resistance to an unknown degree5. We assayed several concentrations of erythromycin in testing for the degree of bacterial growth inhibition, whereby we determined that (insert concentration) of erythromycin allowed for growth of pIB184 transformed L. brevis and inhibited the growth of competing bacteria.
Lastly, we designed the gene sequence of a Gram-positive cell wall anchoring protein that was fused with an anti-Her2 DARPin (CWA-Her2-DARPin), which would be expressed at the L. brevis cell surface to allow for binding to Her2 positive cancer cells.
These successes are only the preliminary steps in the grand scheme of our project. We hope to continue with characterizing our IL-2 expression, and Lux and Las quorum sensing systems. These would be transformed into our L. brevis cells along with the gene for CWA-Her2-DARPin. We will finally test our bacterial system in a human cancer tissue culture and assay for T cell recruitment.
Protocols:
PCR Amplification of de novo synthesized genes from IDT
Lux and Las amplification, and IL-2 amplification, modifying to be compatible with both pET26b and pIB184
For the Lux and Las quorum sensing systems, each system was ordered as two gblocks ("

We designed primers for lox Gibson assembly and appended cut sites to genes flanked by lox. We also found a possible viable kill switch in the Holin/Chitinase system. Our second try at transforming pA13AM was successful as shown by the presence of red colonies and we set up LB cultures for subsequent cloning. Sequencing showed that construction of pC13BG was successful and cultures were made for further use. However, sequencing of pC13BF was unsuccessful and we reran the PCR of pC13F in order to append BamHI and KpnI cut sites for ligation with pA13BE. We ran another digest screen for pC13AY but many lanes did not have bands so we will retry it tomorrow. We also amplified GFP from pC13Z and mRFP from pC13AK using primers 23 and 24 in a Q5 PCR. Afterwards, a gel screen on PCR products was run to verify that the correct genes were amplified. The gel image indicated consistent bands with lengths of 0.7 kb, thus the PCR to obtain GFP and mRFP inserts was successful! We made a rough draft of our protoplasting protocol to attempt in the near future, too. We then rummaged through previous notebook entries to figure out the problems with crtB and crtI.
We received sequencing back for pC13BF and pC13BG and only the later was successful, so we restarted construction for pC13BF. We also ran a PCR to amplify GFP and mRFP inserts out of their respective plasmids.

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," improve the safety of our SOD3 idea by, titrating the lycopene system to only express the gene when high levels of oxidative stress are detected. As a result of this interaction, we decided to add the nfkb promotor to our SOD3 biobrick to increase safety of our device. We consider the safety of our devices significantly important, hence why we have spent a lot of time integrating this aspect into our therapies, especially the gene therapy.
Outreach: More than just educating the younger generation
We started outreach with the aim of educating the younger generation about synthetic biology and the importance of healthy ageing. We understood that a lot of the general public do not see ageing as a disease, or yet even as a problem so we wanted to educate them through our interactive workshops. However, we did not expect that we would learn so much from these outreach sessions and that it would shape the execution of our project as much as it did.
We really understand that as ageing is a global problem, we want to incorporate as many perspectives, issues, barriers towards our project as we can in order to fully evaluate the benefits to our therapies. Outreach inspired us to then reach out to as many different people as we could to broaden our network to the wider community and making our project integrated into today’s society.
Public engagement and education
Through talking and interacting with the public, we were able to not only educate them about synthetic biology innovations, but to also learn about what our end users are afraid of with our therapies. Once we listened, and engaged in a 2-way conversation, we then understood that our project can impact nearly everything. From pension schemes to the socio-economic demographic, and that we needed to consider these factors through our project.
With that being said, we also learned that most all of these challenges and long term implications can be worked through with enough consideration, making us comfortable with the notion that our ageing therapies could do a lot of good if it were implemented in the real world.
Public engagement has really developed our ability to communicate our project and ideas to a wide range of audiences and execute our project. We now understand that good communication is important as these therapies will affect them and their lives.

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Engagement.html_-_-_TEXT.html," concerns, as well as how they think the wider public will react on synthetic biology. The concern regarding Synthetic Biology can be summarized into three categories:
Safety
By mutations or combinations of different genes, hazardous microorganisms can be created or formed, for example bioweapons, superorganisms, antibiotic resistant bacteria etc.
Fear of possible dangers of the end-product made via a GMO-production process. Lot of uncertainties and misunderstandings about safety of GMO-products.
Ethics
Ethical issues on modification of organisms and transferring genetic material of one species to another.
Religion-related ethical issues: interfering with God’s creations.
Hard to set boundaries in genetic modification; are we going to modify people in the future?
GMO-products are considered artificial/unnatural.
Biocontainment
The possible negative effect on an ecosystem and lowering biodiversity when GMOs are introduced in nature.
“Synthetic biology has the potential to run out of control, but I believe we have the knowledge to keep it within limits.” - Student NBO 2017
Next, the students were informed about our project; making a modular diagnostic kit against tropical diseases. They were stimulated to think about possible problems this can bring intro a community where it is applied. Their opinions can be summarised into:
Availability of treatments. After diagnosis, sufficient medicines should be available to treat the diagnosed people. If treatment is not available, resources are not sufficient, or financially the people cannot afford treatment, a diagnose will not improve the quality of life for these people.
Overpopulation in those areas. Lower mortality rate by good diagnostics can result in overpopulation, and possibly more hunger and unemployment problems.
A prerequisite that was proposed by several students, was sufficient education about the kit itself and the consequences for one’s life after diagnosis is confirmed.
Finally, the success rate of this diagnostic kit in third-world countries was compared to western countries (the Netherlands).
The use would be more accepted in the Netherlands (50%) because the Dutch population has a higher education and would understand the purpose and the action of this kit and are thus more open to it. Here, people can afford healthcare and are used to novel techniques.
The use would be less accepted in the Netherlands (30%) because people are more aware of the dangers of GMO’s. Moreover, the health care in The Netherlands is satisfactory as it is.
When such a diagnostic kit would be available in the Netherlands, the ideal antigens to be detected according to the students are cancer and STDs. Moreover, Pfeiffer, HIV and Hepatitis B were mentioned, as well as tropical diseases for travellers.

We plot the transfer function as in experiment data processing. Tune the parameters and the model is feasible.
Outlook
Exactly，all of the experiments we have done is to improve the channel capacity and reduce the disturbance from the noise at the same time. Anyway our final target is to make sure that we can transfer more information when the environment is noisy. Our team focuses on comparing performance between two ways to get fluorescent protein (EBFP), namely, to express the protein directly from the gene, or to independently express two proteins and let them assembly afterwards to become the same protein as the one in the first way. Beside analyzing the experimental data by calculating channel capacity of two systems we wanted to know if there are any difference between two circuits in amplifying the inputs or responding to the noise. And we also want to know which frequency of noise makes our circuit worse and which signal-to-noise ratio may have a higher channel capacity?
So we have these simulations first and we will conduct more experiments to collect data and confirm our conclusion.

Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," purine to form penciclovir. This is how the prodrug works in vivo. To get nearer to in vivo conditions in cell culture assays, the diacetyl ester, famciclovir, should be incubated in extracts of liver, previously processed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase or implemented on a cell culture assay with cells that are capable of effectively transforming famciclovir.
To implement a kill switch on famciclovir basis has the clear advantage of using the most actual drug that has higher biocompatibility and bioavailability (41%) in humans. In contrast to some guanosine analogues like aciclovir, the active form of famciclovir, penciclovir, is even phosphorylated much more efficiently. But penciclovir has poor absorbance (1,5%), if it is directly admitted.
Penciclovir is much more efficiently phosphorylated than aciclovir. Nevertheless, in uninfected cells, host cell kinases phosphorylate both guanosine analogues to a small and similar content. Due to its highly preferential metabolism penciclovir is more commonly selected for GMK-TK30 infected cells [18] .
Experimental approach
Our Kill-Switch construct consists of a CMV-promoter, the GMK-TK30 and an additional Poly-A-tail. Conceiving the fusion gene GMK-TK30, additional parts were assembled step by step. In order to test the functionality of our Kill-Switch, we transfected HEK293T cells with the construct. 125 mg of Famciclovir were solubilized in 125 ml DMEM (+10% Fetal Calf Serum, +1% Penicillin-Streptomycin). The drug was further diluted in different concentrations ranging from 0 µg/ml, 62,5 µg/ml, 125 µg/ml, 250 µg/ml, 500 µg/ml to 1000 µg/ml. After 96 h incubation cells were stained with DAPI and calcein-AM.
In order to get a clear answer concerning Poly-A-efficiency (or improvement of mRNA stability), we performed an RT-qPCR twice on mRNA isolated of non-transfected, with Poly-A-sequence transfected and without Poly-A-sequence transfected cells, respectively. Each one of the Poly-A/Non-Poly-A cross-point-values was proportioned to the negative control and house-keeping gene values.

NAWI_Graz,2018,Team:NAWI Graz#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," The world average per capita consumption has also grown each year from 23 kg in 2007 to 29 kg in 2017. The growth in population and income will stimulate the future demand. Additionally, the food and industrial demand will see an increased application in the production of food and non-food [10,13]. The reason for the great demand is that palm oil is the cheapest available vegetable oil and is therefore interesting for many different industry sectors. Figure 2 illustrates how the oils and fats production and consumption has changed over the years and predicts future development. Interestingly, the oils and fats production increases linear in contrast to the consumption, which increases exponentially. This signifies a mismatch of demand and supply in the future years and, as a consequence the price of some commodities is likely to increase.
Figure 2: Global Oils and Fats Production vs. Consumption from 1990-2015 (F) [10]
According to recent report, global human population will grow over 9 billion by 2050 and it is predicted, that the food industry will have to produce about 60% to 70% more food in the next 35 years [10]. The University of Manchester iGEM Team 2013 predicted that large volumes of food crops being transferred to biodiesel production. Since the EU plans to ban palm oil for biofuel production, there will be more land for growing crops for food purposes rather than for biofuel production. Nevertheless, the demand for palm oil and palm oil related products further rise and there are many challenges for the palm oil industry like lack of replanting, labour shortage, below potential yields and acreage limitations. Biosynthetic palm kernel oil will may avoid these challenges and support the supply of palm kernel oil. Further, the commercializing of synthetic palm kernel oil will have positive effects on the price, but may also affect other markets.
Disadvantages
The Commercialization of biosynthetic palm kernel oil has also the ability to evoke negative economic impacts on palm (kernel) oil producing countries. Indeed, the production of palm oil and palm oil related products plays an important role on the economy for these countries.
As mentioned above, palm oil and related products secure a relevant amount of income for producing countries. In 2017, Malaysia achieved export revenues of RM 77.85 billion (18.99 billion USD) of palm oil and its products as well as palm kernel oil [3]. This amount is enormous and represents over 6% of GDP [3]. Indonesia has a similar economic situation with export revenues of 18.90 billion USD. To replace this high quantity of income"

During the project we received an e-mail from iGEM team York . They were performing an investigation on the drinking water across different countries in the world. They wanted to determine the phosphate levels in water in different countries. To help them two different samples of 50ml H2O were taken. One sample was drawn from a kitchen water tap, the other was taken from a water tap outside. The pH of these samples was determined with the use of a pH meter. After the pH was taken they were filtered and send to York. Curious about their results? Check it our here .

Supercritical CO2/ethanol extraction:
Astaxanthin from demineralized crab (Callinectes sapidusj) shell waste was extracted with a mixture of supercritical C2 and ethanol as a cosolvent. Supercritical CO2/ethanol extraction is an effective way to produce high-quality astaxanthin and astaxanthin is not easy to degrade. However, extraction with this technology require a large amount of raw materials and few astaxanthin is produced, resulting in high cost in commercial process.
1.2 Chemical synthesis of astaxanthin
Canthaxanthin can be used as the raw material to produce astaxanthin and in this method, astaxanthin can be synthesized with few steps[4]. However, canthaxanthin is expensive and only 55%～65% astaxanthin can be harvested during the two-step reactions, making this menthod discordant with the large-scale production.
In another chemical synthesis method, 6-oxo-isophorone(C9) is used as the raw material. C9 and the six-carbon alcohol(C6) change into C15- triphenyl phosphonium salt after several steps of reactions,which can react with 2,7-2,4,6-dimethyl octyl leukotriene-1,8-MDA(C10) and turn into astaxanthin in the presence of alkaline[5]. Even though its long procedure and complicated technics, this method is the only way which is applied in commercial process.
1.3 Extract from Haematococcus pluvialis
The unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialis have a capacity to amass ketocarotenoid astaxanthin. The content of astaxanthin in high-quality Haematococcus pluvialis is as high as 90%( of their weights). However, autotrophic stage of Haematococcus pluvialis last for a long period of time and this method require a high level of industrial technology. What's more, the complicated manufacturing technique make large-scale production difficult.
2. The labour cost
Most of the companies which sell astaxanthin extracted from Haematococcus pluvialis are in European and American areas because the productions of astaxanthin require high level of industrial technology. The labour cost in these areas are high (probably take up 15"

Extraction of Bacillus subtilis genomic DNA
Adam Denyer, Tanel Ozdemir    June 13, 2014   Protocols   DNA extraction
Our literature search identified a number of bacterial species that have been proven to degrade azo dye compounds including B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa.  We were able to obtain a B. subtilis strain for use in our project from ?.  We extracted the genomic DNA from this strain using a Promega Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit so that we could subsequently amplify the azo-reducatase gene (AzoR1) and create our first azo-reductase BioBrick.  After completing the genomic DNA extracton we ran a gel to show that we had successfully extracted the B. subtilis genomic DNA.

This 3D structure was subsequently docked with the phAimR and spAimR using the Chimera docking tools [8]. Both apo and ligand bound versions were docked. Figure 4 and 5 show the interactions of spAimR with the pAimX promoters and Figure 6 shows the interaction of phAimR with the pAimX(full) promoter.
Figure 4: Different phage SPbeta AimR forms binding to AimX promoter. The apo form of AimR represented in light brown, the peptide-bound (peptides with a green surface) form in orange. Chain A in both forms is bounded to the AimX promoter (pink and blue). In Figure 4 we can see the side (4.1), front (4.2) view of this binding mechanism.
Figure 5: Different phage SPbeta AimR forms binding to AimX(full) promoter. The apo form of AimR represented in light brown, the peptide-bound form in blue (chain A in dark blue and chain B in light blue) and peptides represented with a green surface. The AimX promoter whole sequence in yellow which contains the short sequence in red bounded to both forms of AimR.
Figure 6: Different phage phi3T AimR forms interaction with AimX promoter. The apo form of AimR represented in light brown, the peptide-bound form in blue and peptide represented with a green surface. The AimX promoter whole sequence in yellow which contains the short sequence in red.
These results show that the docking results do not support experimentally observed binding dynamics for both spAimR and phAimR [2, 3]. The absence of binding by apo-phAimR may be explained by the reported more closed conformation which seals of the DNA binding site for the docking tool, but not in vivo [3]. Next, we attempted to establish the predicted binding sequences (i.e. the DNA that was found inside the binding cleft) in all these conditions. As extra control, we attempted to dock spAimR with its experimentally determined binding region, removed the predicted binding site and reran the docking algorithm to see if it would predict a new binding site. These results are found in Figure 7. The results show that the predicted binding sites are different in every case. Hence, we concluded that the protein-DNA docking tools in our hands were sufficiently sensitive to dock the correct DNA binding domain of AimR to the DNA, but that it was not"

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," there are fitness costs for the mosquitoes that is greater, what we measured. At laboratory conditions, it did spread, so they are clearly fit enough. We modeled this and even when there are 40% extra costs, it still spreads. I can imagine that potentially there are more than 50% costs, or when the temperature is very high or low, what could be a problem. We are investigating how we can improve this and try to push this to its limits. Another problem are resistances. We haven’t seen resistances yet, but that does not mean, that it is not possible. We have to test it in bigger populations. Also we try to make up as much as mutations as we could imagine to see if any of this creates a resistant gene.
iGEM Hamburg: What about the social acceptance of this method?
Dr. Hammond: So a staff scientist of mine asked for this in Africa. They said, that it has quite a big potential and is quite exciting. They support the idea of this method without definitely say “yes” or “no” at this point and see this could have a future role in malaria research. I think, this is the best possible outcome, we could have hoped for, because you don’t want people to say, whatever you make, gene drive, just use it. It is a good thing, that they say “we are not against using this technology in principle”.
iGEM Hamburg: Does your innovation make other precautions or safety measures required?
Dr. Hammond: Effectively, a gene drive could spread uncontrolled into a population. So I guess the question is “What if there are any unforeseen consequences?”. Taking back gene drive would be difficult. So you have to make sure, that there will be no unattended consequences. Therefore, we just started a very big study about the effect of anopheles on the ecosystem. A lot of people have done very small scale studies before, but the question not has been answered. People generally agree in the field, that this species is not present in Africa, but this is not enough to answer this question. So a strong study is much better. A recent review suggest, that it is not the main food source of any particular animal and in not a particularly important pollinator of plants. So it is not obviously important. So the other side is the remedy, which limits the impact of a gene drive. So we are also working on a kind of “antidose” for gene drive or how it could be reverted, or even slowed down.
iGEM Hamburg: That’s in fact very important"

Nowadays, fermentation industry is crucial for a country’s economy. In China, fermentation industry output reached 2,000 billion RMB in 2011, and till 2013, this number has increased to 3,000 billion RMB (Fig.1). Fermentation industry’s output accounts for about 3 percentage of GDP in China, and it’s predicted that the output will reach 10,000 billion at the end of 2015. As a result,the optimization and improvement of fermentation process is important.
However, problems concerning fluctuation of pH in fermentation are usually knotty. Firstly, the activity of enzymes can be tremendously influenced by environmental pH. The activity of enzyme will plummet at an improper pH, and eventually the fermentation effectiveness will decrease. Worse still, a different pH can entirely change the microorganism’s fermentation products. For example, Aspergillus niger can produce citric acid at pH 2.0 ~ 3.0, while the product will be changed to oxalic acid at pH 6.5 ~ 7.5. As for corynebacterium glutamicum, the product is glutamate at pH 7.0 ~ 8.0 while at pH 5.0 ~ 5.8 the products are Glutamine and N-aceglutamide. Therefore, a suitable environmental pH is a key factor for higher fermentation productivity.
Fig.1 Fermentation industry output from 2005 to 2013[1].
To maintain fermentation pH range, people have found some methods to regulate the pH of fermentation liquor, such as probe detection technique combined with computer programs, and adding acid and alkali into fermenters straightly. However, environmental interference can strongly interrupt probe detection, and increase reaction time. What’s more, adding large amount of acid and alkali may cause unbalanced pH in different areas in fermenter. Those problems will decrease fermentation productivity and effectiveness. More importantly, all of these methods which heavily rely on electrical technology will increase factories' costs and energy consumption, but none of them considered the function of"

Dental Researcher
Now that we understood what the public fears regarding the negative health consequences of zero-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to better understand the positive health consequences as well. For this we decided to explore the consequences in an area that is pertinent to all of us; so pertinent in fact that most of us can neither start our day nor end it without tending to it first: our dental health. Numerous well-cited research articles have established an understanding throughout the dental community that high sugar consumption can pose a serious risk to dental health, and therefore zero-calorie sweeteners may have a role to play in caries reduction.
In order to better understand what current research is suggesting, we decided to speak with Dr. Alireza Moshaverinia, a Diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontics and a tenure track assistant professor at the UCLA School of Dentistry. Alireza has published more than 50 papers in peer-reviewed journals serves on the editorial review board for several scientific journals, including the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry. Given his expertise, our interview was focused upon what role sugar plays in dental health, a brief discussion on the scientific underpinnings of sugar’s effect on dental health, and what role zero-calorie sweeteners could play in dental health.
We learned from Dr. Moshaverinia multiple interesting points that influenced our understanding of the health consequences of zero-calorie sweeteners. Firstly, Alireza explained that sugar not only plays an immensely important role in dental health, but interestingly that the most important aspect of sugar consumption on dental health was not the amount of sugar we consumed, but the frequency at which we consume it. Therefore, it was not the large amount of sugar in the average American meal that was taking the greatest toll, rather it was all of the high-sugar snacks we eat or drink in-between. This instilled the team with greater confidence in the positive role zero-calorie sweeteners could play in American health, since it was these high-sugar snacks that are most easily replaced with zero-calorie alternatives. Additionally, Alireza revealed to us that new dental studies were suggesting that zero-calorie sweeteners, more specifically sugar alcohols such as Erythritol, prevent caries not only by reducing sugar intake, but surprisingly by also possessing cavity"

Applications
After travelling a long way of circuit construction, you may wonder what we are going to do with those sparkling bacteria. Of course much thought was given, too, to make our oscillation circuit both showy and substantial as a safety guard in daily life. Here we are going to show you the potential of those shinny soldiers as biosensor, cancer cell killer and gene sinusoidal signal generator.
Biosensor
To date there appears a great number of biosensors that are used for detecting certain factors, such as small organic molecules or metal ions. And we've noticed that each year many iGEM teams relate their projects to biosensors. Biological detection has strength in its low detection limit, high sensitivity and bioaffinity when compared with chemical detection methods. We can use the same gene sensing circuit to detect various metal ions or other determinant via changing different promoters which responds to a specific target molecule.
Compared with traditional single-cell biosensor, our oscillatory system biosensor has three advantages.
1) Synchronized colonies will be more sensitive to concentration changes of the target molecule and the changes in fluorescence strength are easier to observe than single cell biosensors.
2) Single cell biosensor usually works, or ""switches on"" when the concentration of the specific molecules which can be responded by the promoter reaches to the lowest value. Sometimes this kind of detection is limited when we want to narrow the range of detection. Because the oscillation will happen only when concentration of certain molecule is between two value, the maximum and the minimum, it can dwindle the detection range of the determinant.
3) Oscillatory system is more robust and stable when used as a biosensor. These advantages will promote oscillatory gene circuits a better use in biosensing.
1. Arsenic sensing array
Jeff Hasty from UCSD used the same kind of oscillate circuit to engineer two kinds of arsenic-sensing macroscopic biosensors. These circuits are rewired by a native arsenite-responsive promoter, which is repressed by ArsR in the absence of arsenite. Due to the different mechanism, the sensor outputs are not the same. Figure 1 shows two constructed sensing modules and Figure 2 compares the outputs of two sensors[1].

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,", which became the research foundation of TOR pathway. It appears that TORC1 signalling controls the temporal aspects of cell growth in response to the quality of the available nitrogen and carbon sources. On the other hand, TORC2, which is insensitive to rapamycin and is less well characterized in comparison to TORC1, is thought to regulate the spatial aspects of growth, such as the control of actin polarization. Here, we will focus on TORC1, as only this complex modulates nutrient-induced signaling in response to starvations mainly of nitrogen sources and carbon sources triggered by FAP presence.
The TOR protein consists of several distinct domains (illustrated in the image above). The N-terminal half of TOR comprises 20 tandemly HEAT repeats. HEAT repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and are required for localization of TOR to the plasma membrane. The HEAT repeats are accompanied by a so-called FAT domain that possibly serves as a scaffold or protein interaction domain. Following the FAT domain are the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain, the kinase catalytic domain, and a C-terminal FATC domain. Because TOR contains a number of domains that may mediate protein-protein interactions, TOR has been proposed to exist in a multiprotein complex and multi pathways. The most well-characterized TORC1 mediates the rapamycin-sensitive signaling branch that positively regulates anabolic processes such as translation and ribosome biogenesis and negatively regulates catabolic processes such as RNA degradation, autophagy, and other degradative pathways. The precise function of these TOR interacting proteins is not known yet. They might play a role in the binding of the TOR complexes to their substrates, be the receivers of upstream signals and/or determine the localization of the complexes. The TOR complexes are likely dimeric built on a TOR–TOR dimer. Only TORC1 can bind FKBP12-rapamycin while in TORC2, the Tor2 FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain is probably not exposed for binding, explaining why only TORC1 signaling is sensitive to rapamycin treatment. Interestingly, the constitution of TORC1 appears to be unaffected by rapamycin, implying that rapamycin does not inhibit TORC1 signaling by interfering with TORC1 stability. Both TOR complexes are essential for viability, since deletion of TOR2 (inactivation of TORC2) or deletion of both TOR1 and TOR2, or rapamycin treatment (inactivation of TORC1) are lethal to yeast. Deletion of TOR1 alone, however, is not lethal, indicating that Tor1 and"

Results and discussion
This section outlines and discusses the results of the survey for each question individually as well as per subject. Furthermore, a summary of the results of the correlation calculations between questions can be found here. An abstract of the results and discussion as well as conclusions and recommendations can be found in the conclusions section.
Personal
The reason to ask the following rather personal questions is to get an indication of the sample's background. Although we already know they are practically all involved in the 2009 iGEM competition, questions about gender and home country can display the male/female ratio and denotes different cultural backgrounds.
Graph i.
i. How are you involved in iGEM?
A. Participant
B. Supervisor
C. Advisor
D. Other:
Of the 242 survey contributors, there are 60 people with an advisor/supervisor role, which equals 25%. It might be interesting to compare their answers to those of the 168 participants, to see whether a different relation (student vs. instructors) to iGEM and synthetic biology in general has influence on their opinions and perceptions. This will not be analyzed in a later stage.
Graph ii.
ii. What gender are you?
A. Male
B. Female
Although engineering in general mainly attracts male students, the iGEM competition shows a mixture of gender where 36% of our survey-participants is female. Although not discussed, one of the questions that might be interesting: could there be a differences between male and female answers on ethical issues in synthetic biology?
Graph iii.
iii. Which country are you from?
Open question
The colorful pie-graph already indicates the high diversity of backgrounds. There are 22 different nationalities involved in this study, which supports the independence of the overall study results towards cultural differences. Whether people with different nationalities have different perceptions/opinions on the ethical issues will not be discussed here, due to an uneven distribution of geographical backgrounds. The biggest contributors to the survey are expectedly the USA and Canada.

Freiburg_Bioware,2010,Team:Freiburg Bioware#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," II laboratory and within this laboratory work with the AAV was restricted to a separate Laminar flow cabinet type II. Cell culture and storage of the virus was also done in separate Freezers and incubators. All laboratories and epipment that contained viral vectors were specially marked, for example with a Biohazard warning signs.
4) Exposure minimization This aspect of the guiding principles can be sumarized under ""operator protection""18. The Exposure minimization was achieved in our laboratory by wearing special labcoats for the SII laboratory and gloves that were desinfected and changed regualrely. During manipulation of viral vectors attention was payed to avoid droplets and especially aerosoles. A possible diversion of the viral vectors was avoided by cleaning all equipment when inserted or removed from the Laminar flow cabinet and after completion of the work task.
5) Physical containment The requirements for the physical containment were fullfilled by performing all manipulation on the AAV in an BSL II laboratory that guaranted a restriction of persons that entered the laboratory.
6) Hazard minimization For the AAV-2 there are no sugestive activitis because the possible danger that runs out of the AAV is comparably low, vaccination is not avilible and biomonitoring is not necessary.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
Several composite parts that were assembled by our Team this year are alone capable of producing infectious viral particles when transduced together with a vector plasmid and a helper plasmid into AAV-293 cells. These special cells provide the adenoviral gene E1 stabily integrated in trans. These cells are not provided in the Virus Construction Kit nor availible in the Parts Registry and have to purchased from other laboratories or a commercial supplyer. For this reason we estimate the risk of a accidental transformation of AAV-293 cells with all three plasmids for negligible. Nevertheless we considered it useful to mark every BioBrick or Composite Part in the Registry that contributes to the production or is capable of producing viral vectors when transformed under the previously mentioned conditions.

Protocols
1.Bridge PCR
Experimental idea
We plan to put all sites and lines together into the PCR tube, so the free combination is performed on each sites and lines through complementary base pairing, forming all possible DNA fragments (i.e. different pathways). Then add DNA polymerase and dNTP to fill the combination of single-stranded fragments at a suitable temperature.
Set up the following reaction:
The PCR reaction procedure is as follows:
Procedure
1. Place the diluted sites and fragments into the PCR tube (the reaction system is as shown in Table 1)
2. Carry out two groups of experiments
3. Place the samples in the PCR instrument (the PCR procedures are as shown in Figure 1).
2.DNA Ligation
Experimental idea
As the elongation of the newly forming DNA strand is in a 5'-3' direction, there is still no connection between sites and lines, despite the single strand of the free combination pathways have been filled in the DNA polymerization. Therefore, before the PCR, DNA ligase is added to connect them.

That day we did ligations with the robot yet again.  However this time we used different parts.  We used YFPc-pluxR and ligated it with Ptet-RBS-LuxR.  We did a regular ligation but we also did a double volume ligation with BBa_E0240(GFPc) and BBa_R2000.  We did double volume ligation so we wouldn’t run into the issue of the robot not being able to pipet 1ul.  After transforming them, the single ligation gave hundreds of colonies for both the robot and the manual ligations however the double ligation did not grow at all. Thus, it is possible that certain parts ligate better than others. There was a large air bubble in the final sample of the double volume ligation which could have caused the issue.  However, as we hadn’t used this part before we could not determine the reason why it did not work.  Therefore that day I also did restriction digest for BBa_J23100, BBa_J23101, and BBa_R0040.  Due to the distress of the day, I forgot to take out the restriction digest from the incubator and left it overnight.  The extreme cutting of the enzymes could be seen on the gel picture.  However, after combining two 45ul lanes I received really good values for each part. I streaked out plates of the same parts and then did plasmid preps in order to run a restriction digest on the parts.  After doing so I received great values.  I found the concentrations of the ligations and it ended up being almost the same for all of them.  At times the robots concentrations were greater than the"

A Kill Switch
With regard to this CidA-LrgA system and the BNU iGEM 2014 kill switch design, we designed our own kill switch as the figure  shows. When cultured with our IPTG-added medium, these bacteria would live as usual to function as a mini-factory to amplify plasmids or to produce plasmids for our use, whereas they would die due to the cell membrane lysis and release of genomic DNA. Moreover, we put the lrgA gene under the control of a weak and constitutive promoter J23116 to in case of the leaky expression of the CidA to prevent cell lysis.
A device
Our device also contributes to the safety of our project. When it is put indoors, it may be influenced by mega fauna or micro fauna. Mega fauna wouldn't cause any trouble because the device is fixed and the entrance is too small for them to go in. As for micro fauna, even if they get into the device, safety is still not a problem (see Paragraph Two ).
An Instruction Mannual
By writing application scenarios, we have already visualized the intended impact of Termite Terminator and present Techno-moral vignettes (see: Synenergene), focusing on the potential wider impacts of our application. According to these unintended scenes, to reduce future risks, a series of warnings have been added to the Instruction Manual can be proposed (see: Instruction Manual ).

Mr. Teng (52-year-old)      Pancreatic cancer sufferer
It was in May or Apr., 2016, Mr. Teng went for examination due to abdominal pain. At first, he thought it might be a gastrointestinal disease, but later results showed that it was actually pancreatic cancer. He had side effects like skin rash and hair loss, but his mental state is pretty good.
Mr. Teng has been applying chemotherapy since August this year. His treating cycle was 15 days of infusion followed by 8 days of withdraw, and his treatment costs 15k RMB (around 2200$) each time.
Mr. Teng did not take new treatments such as molecular targeted drugs into account because he thought it may not be practicable, and he emphasized the use of chemotherapy to get his situation under control. However, the patient did have a good understanding of new therapy, and he showed us some of the new cancer treatment that he knew before. For example, he mentioned a ‘cancer cell hunger therapy’ discovered in Zhejiang University, and also interference therapy from Japan. Mr. Teng has fundamental information related new therapy, but his understanding of cancer and therapies still left deviation.
Mr. Zheng (72-year-old)  colon cancer sufferer -> liver metastasis sufferer
In Nov. 2014, Mr. Zheng suffered from blood in his stool, and stool was too soft to form normal shapes. Then he went to hospital for colonoscopy. The results showed that there were distinctly 9 polyps in his gut, two of which have red tips. The doctor suggest two treatment options, one of which is to remove these polyps from anus, and the other option is to apply minimally invasive surgery for the removal of polyps. At the same time, metastatic cancer cells were also detected in his liver, forming two lesions of different size.
Now he mainly takes treatment combining chemotherapy and interventional therapy. Chemotherapy has been practiced for more than a year and most commonly, twice in each month. To be more exacted, he goes for 3 days of chemotherapy every 12 days. Previously he used Irinotecan, but recently it started to develop resistance, so he replaced it by Oxaliplatin. In addition, Mr. Teng has been applying interventional treatment for about once a month, but it’s not fixed, depending on his specific circumstances. The drugs enter mainly from the artery to surround the tumor, and block the blood vessel supplying nutrients for cancer cells, commonly known as ""starve cancer cells"

Purification Methods
Since there were still some vegetative cells left after 24 hours of growth in Difco Sporulation Medium, we wanted to purify the Sporobeads. We tried three different methods for this approach: treatment with French Press, sonification and lysozyme. By means of the microscopy results we were able to conclude that lysozyme treatment was the only successful method (see data ). Additionally, this treatment did not harm the crust fusion proteins as green fluorescence was still detectable afterwards (see data for details).
Fig. 1: Phase contrast pictures after different treatments
Next, we tested the fluorescence of Sporobeads after lysozyme treatement. This analysis revealed that lysozyme did not harm the gfp-fusion proteins, since fluorescence was not altered (see Fig. 2).
Fig. 2: Fluorescence of wild type spores and Sporobeads after treatment with lysozyme. Sporobeads still show undiminished fluorescence activity.

Hey, I'm Zak, and I am an iGEMmer. I thought I was almost free of my fascination with genetic technologies when I transferred to the neuroscience program at the U of L in 2011 from biology at the U of R, but I lapsed right back when I learned that iGEM existed. I thought I had refocused when I began doing behavioural experiments with rats, but immediately searched out and executed a synthetic biology project designing a system for reporting gene activity in the brains of live animals. After completing my B.Sc. in neuroscience this summer I will likely continue to design synthetic biology projects in the M.Sc. neuroscience program at the U of L as I am dangerously hooked. So I guess I'll talk to you all next year!

Design of gRNAs after new hypothesis
Halfway through our project (see Notebook for more details), after starting testing our amplicons with Cas12a and the fluorescent reporter (DNase Alert), we realized that the probe itself (more specifically the product of RCA in the absence of miRNA, i.e. with no amplicon) was triggering the Cas system causing a very high fluorescence signal, comparable to the signal obtained for the samples with miRNA (i.e. with probe+amplicon).
We hypothesized that this was due to the fact the our Cas12a was working PAM-independently (more details in ""Promiscuous Cas12a activation: probes as a target"" in Results ). More specifically, our gRNA was meant to target the whole stem (and in addition 7 bases in the small loop) of the amplicon; since the stem is double-stranded, the target sequence for the gRNA is also present in the probe (in the opposite strand).
This would not have been a problem if the Cas had been working, as expected, PAM-dependently, because the PAM is only contained in the amplicon, not in the probe. Nonetheless, if the Cas does not need the PAM sequence, but simple recognizes a target from the sequence of the gRNA, then also the probe itself is recognized as a target. Moreover, since the concentration of the probe in the RCA reaction is higher than the expected concentration of amplicon, the signal from the probe behaves as noise, overcoming the signal of interest (i.e. from the amplicon).
We therefore designed a new guide RNA with the aim of targeting only the amplicon and not the probe. Our idea was to have the gRNA binding not on the stem, but on the large loop of the amplicon instead. Since the loops of the amplicon are single-stranded (and not double-stranded as the stem) this should allow the gRNA to target only the amplicon and not the probe, being the target sequence contained only in the amplicon and not in its reverse-complement: more specifically, we decided to design a guide RNA perfectly complementary to the large loop of the amplicon of Probe 1; in this way Probe 1, having on the contrary exactly the same sequence as the gRNA, should have never been targeted by this new"

Preparation of Electrocompetent Cells
Purpose: One of the techniques used to incorporate new genetic material into a cell is called electroporation. In this process, electrical pulses create holes in the cell membrane so that genetic material, such as plasmids, is able to permeate the plasma membrane. It is most commonly used in bacterial cells because electroporation is highly efficient at incorporating the new DNA into the bacterial cells that will then be used for cloning. There are special cuvettes that are used for this process that enable the cells to be evenly distributed without air bubbles and for media to be directly added immediately after electroporation occurs so that the cells can recover. Electrocompetent cells are different than normal bacterial cells because they have a weaker cell wall so that electroporation will have a high efficiency.
Procedure:
Part 1: Overnight cell growth
1.  5 mL of LB media were added to a test tube.
2. 5 µL of Streptomycin were added to the same test tube.

Figure 1: DNA structure we sent to synthesis
Although the prefix and suffix are not considered part of the device, they were included in DNA structure we the ordered for easy future assembly. Because the entire ORF is contained within the prefix and suffix, no care for in-frame assembly has to be taken. We used the original RFC10 BioBrick standard.
In addition, we included convenient restriction sites (RS) for directional cloning into the yeast expression vectors (RS1 and RS3). RS2 will allow easy removal of the sequence coding for the trojan peptide, by restriction and re-ligation.
Selection of restriction sites
We yet have to choose exactly which restriction enzymes we are going to use, so we can know the final DNA sequence to include in the synthesis request.
Considering Yeast Expression Plasmids
To determine which restriction sites to use for cloning (RS1 and RS3 in Figure 1), we need to know the MCS of the expression plasmids we are going to use.
One of these plasmids will probably of the pCM180-5 series, which are centromeric plasmids with TRP1 marker, and with a doxycycline repressible promoter [Gari et al 1996].
Comparing Figure 3 and Figure 4, BamHI and NotI appear in both MCS in the same order, so they are good candidates for RS1 and RS3 (Figure 1) respectively.
We will probably need to clone the construct in a general purpose plasmid for manipulation. For instance, to remove the trojan we need to clone the construct into a plasmid, cut it with the RE of RS2, precipitate the DNA (to get rid of the trojan fragment), and religate. For this to work we have to make sure that there is no RS2 in the vector. A common vector for this is pBluescript, wich has the MCS  shown in Figure 5.

By interacting with and understanding the problems that affect others in less fortunate locations, we can create more influential projects. Listening to the issues with communication brought forth other useful solutions such as the development of an app to serve as a mediator between the individual and the hospital. It is only by interacting with the community that we are able to understand their needs and devise solutions and projects that benefit the most people. Even a simple change in plan, like the addition of a training guide, could mean a world of difference to those who go through these problems every day.'),     h('p', null, 'It is idealistic to think that simply conducting research will result in the development of a detection kit. Even with our research, there is still much that would need to be tested and implemented. Additionally, in order to implement these kits, we would require the financial backing of individuals. Thereby, even with functioning equipment, the cost and marketability of such products are equally important. When conversing with the NGO official on HIV detection kits, a recurring point that was brought up, was how is this kit different from the market and what is the cost. In this manner, the cost is especially important because our kit was developed to target those in the rural location who have a higher risk of HIV."

Newcastle,2018,Team:Newcastle#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," we constructed a template for both idea                       presentations and allocated team members to each idea.
Day 10/11 - 21/06/18
Following on from the 2 ideas that we chose to take forward, we spent these next 2 days researching further into these proposals.                      During our research, we took a holistic approach when evaluating our ideas and attempted to account for topics such as human practices,                      ethical implications and possible art and design ideas. We incorporated this into our 2 ideas which we then pitched to the instructors                    and Master's students. We also managed to successfully setup the OT-2 robot. The smiles speak for themselves...
Day 12 - 22/06/18
This day was used to carefully consider both ideas that were pitched the previous day before voting on one to take forward.                      We started by summarising each idea in 140 characters which highlighted some discrepancies in individual team members understanding                      of the ideas. After these discrepancies were rectified, the team spent some time considering each idea before voting on one to take                      up as our project. In the end, it was decided that the project involving engineering microbes to colonise plant roots and attract                      nitrogen-fixing bacteria was the best to take forward. We spent some time thinking about the modelling/human practices/lab work that                      may be involved in our project.
Day 13 - 25/06/18
On our first official day of project-specific work, various tasks were allocated to team members for them to research.                      Some background reading was conducted on the topic, the team name was confirmed and some ideas for the team logo were suggested.                      Also, some ideas for a hydroponics system were discussed. With a rare bit of sunshine, we decided to work outdoors.
Week commencing: 25/06/18
On the Monday, members of the team were provided an overview of the plant growth facilities at Newcastle University by                      Vas Andriotis who has shown great interest in our project since its pitch and has given many resources to enhance                      and develop our ideas. The remainder of the group began on the research for the several experiments that will be ran in                      parallel over the Summer.
Tuesday was dedicated to further fleshing out our research by identifying species which would be suitable for our iGEM project.       Some members moved in an artistic direction and produced a handful of potential logos before the entire team voted on our two       favourites. Once these were decided, merchandising began development.
Development on our hydroponics system moved into full swing on the Wednesday, with our 2 engineers beginning work on the general       structure"

LACTOSE-INDUCED PROMOTER
This construction is made up of three parts:
The transcription factor-binding site inside the promoter,
the repressor-binding site outside the promoter and
the coding sequence, which contains a synthetic fluorescent (blue) protein. Our construction uses the well-known lactose operon system [1].          Since there is an operator region that blocks transcription, it is necessary to know it and avoid it.
When is the protein synthesized? In order to obtain the blue fluorescent protein two conditions have to be met.  First condition: there is no glucose in the medium. Second condition: lactose is present in the medium (it also works with other inductors, like IPTG).
The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is as follows: a lack of glucose promotes the formation of CAP (or CRP [2]), which binds to specific sites upstream of sugar-metabolizing genes and activates its transcription. The binding of this molecule depends on the presence of the allosteric effector cAMP  (the concentration of this metabolite changes in response to the presence or absence of different nutrients). Moreover, another condition is needed since LacI repressor, produced constitutively by the lacI gene inside the lactose operon, will bind to the operator region and will block the transcription unless lactose is also present in the medium. Once lactose enters the cell it is converted to allolactose [3], and this molecule binds tightly to the repressor so it can no longer block the transcription. Then, the fluorescent protein can glow in the cytoplasm!
How did we deal with this construction? In our experiments we not only tested the differential expression when glucose is absent + lactose present and vice versa, but we also tested the expression and growth rates when different compounds were added as carbon-enriched sources. For example, we added sodium acetate and galactose as substitutes of glucose. We"

Antibody mimetics also show better accessibility to genetic engineering like construction of fusion proteins or incorporation of modifiable amino acids thus allowing the combination with fluorophores or drugs for targeted drug delivery ( Skerraet al., 2007 ). After deep and thorough investigation we decided to use Monobodies and Nanobodies. Although commonly used antibodies might be more robust, they are outperformed ten times by Mono- and Nanobodies in their smaller size (15 kDa vs. 150 kDa) and stability. This enables to penetrate depth, even in hard tissue ( Ahmadet al., 2012 ). Additionally, Nano- and Monobody binding proteins are rapidly cleared from the blood and have lower retention time in non-target tissues ( Ahmad et al., 2012 ).
Monobodies
Monobodies, also called adnectines, are synthetic antibody mimetics that originate from the tenth human fibronectin type 3 domain. Fibronectin is a rather large protein that is essential in the formation of the extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions ( Koide and Koide, 2007 ). In 1998 the research group of Akiko Koide discovered that the fibronectin scaffold possesses similar binding properties like antibodies ( Koide et al., 1998 ). Since then continuous research lead to appliance in treatment of diseases like glioblastoma multiform ( Bloom et al., 2009 ) or chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( Grebien et al., 2011 ). The structure of Monobodies is similar to immunoglobulin domains ( Lipovsek et al., 2011 ). The original three dimensional structure of the scaffold is a β-sandwich but with seven β-strands instead of nine which are common in the variable domain of the heavy chain domain of regular antibodies and three surface loops on each end ( Koide and Koide, 2007 ).  They have a high stability and due to their small size, 10 kDa, and they penetrate deep into tissue ( Koide and Koide, 2007 ).  Another outstanding feature that they can be functionally expressed in the E. coli cytoplasm and thereby can be produced simple and at low cost in culture. This is due to the absence of disulphide bonds which are unlikely to form in the E. coli cytoplasm. This makes them compatible with virtually any display technologies ( Koide and Koide, 2007 ) and is therefore a suitable canditate for our in vivo system."

NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#NOSensing_-_-_TEXT.html," used to measure NO levels are unable to distinguish between homogenous species, such as nitrates (NO3) and nitrites (NO2), therefore the figure given for NO levels is often inaccurate as other nitrogenous species are taken into account.
The ability to be able to accurately detect NO levels is one with a great deal of potential for the future. Nitric oxide has been noted as a possible cancer therapy due to its physiological use as an apoptosis inducer by macrophages, however NO is also known to be used by cancerous cells to establish a baseline and use it to induce apoptosis and promote proliferation of a tumour; being able to accurately sense nitric oxide and go on to act on that information could be very useful to prevent the NO baseline being established by cancerous cells, but to also use NO for its apoptosis-inducing abilities. There are also other potential applications in the construction business, in 2008 Modern Building Services published an article regarding legislation released by the Building Regulation Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) encouraging construction companies to monitor their NO output as emission of NO can contribute to smog and acid rain levels; the ability to accurately detail levels of NO being released in these circumstances would be highly useful.
Nitric oxide is an extremely physiologically relevant molecule found within both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, where it is utilised by different enzymes and systems for various roles. The aim of the experiment was to devise a hybrid promoter that could be applied to eukaryotes and prokaryotes in order to begin to more accurately sense NO and report on its specific levels.
Figure 2.A graphical representation of the hybrid promoter in its two orientations; the top image shows B-M with the bottom image showing M-B. Also included are the restriction sites and their location within the system, with the elements being read from left to right.
The hybrid promoter was designed to take on both bacterial and mammalian elements in order to be compatible with both bacterial and mammalian cells. After research around the subject and searching the parts registry a promoter known as PyeaR was decided upon as the bacterial element of the hybrid promoter; PyeaR is found in the yeaR/yoaG operon of Escherichia coli and is associated with induction by nitric oxide, nitrates and nitrites (Lin et al., 2007). PyeaR is repressed by two main repressors; Nar, which is regulated by nitrates and nitrites; and NsrR, which is regulated by nitric oxide (Figure 1.). One of the key"

ITC Analysis: Data, Modeling, and Binding Parameters
The results from the ITC experiment to determine binding parameters for peptides 1x-, 2x-, and 3x-HHTC-Re alongside the predicted structure (QUARK Ab Initio program) follows [2]. This program uses Monte Carlo simulations and knowledge of atomic force fields to construct the most probable structural conformation of a protein from just the linear amino acid sequence.
Figure 3: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1. Figure design credits to Jesica Urbina.
The binding affinity values in Figure 3 are largely comparable to one another, and we do see a linear trend between the number of HHTC-Re repeats and injections taken to reach saturation, which means that each peptide can bind a linearly increasing amount of copper proportional to the HHTC-Re repeats. This validates our hypothesis underlying our construct design for our fusion proteins, allowing us to bind multiple metals on the same biomolecule. In Figure 4, we can see how the specific subunits maintain proper folding (predicted by QUARK), supporting the notion that they would retain their original functions.
Figure 4: Quark ab initio model of 2x-HHTC-Re with chitin binding domain. Domains within the fusion protein have been annotated to display the conformation and spatial orientation.
After confirming the copper binding of the individual HHTC-Re x n peptides, we then needed to assess whether our fusion protein could bind copper and chitin, and whether it could do so when already saturated with the other substrate. Figure 5 depicts two experiments a) Raw data and b) isotherm for 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg and Cu. In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for"

They used the culture fluid that E.coli were incubated for 48 hours. After the 48 hour of incubation, the culture fluid contained 183mg/L of Geraniol.
From their simulation, the culture fluid of E.coli should be concentrated 10,000 times in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours. The sufficient amount of culture fluid which they calculated in order to preserve rice in the box was 128L under our model."

-skipping BL21 step, because Esterase showed activity in TOP10 activity plates.
- Another option is to add a T7 Plasmid to induce the gene
- Phosphatase is expressing nicely (blue)
Phosphatase will be sent for sequencing next week.
E3:
Ready for expression plates with Cellulase in BL21
Scaffoldin:
Has not worked yet, probably due to the unspecific binding of the primers (good binding conditions are hard to find). Using a ligase free ligation in     pet101 which is sensitive to temperature and ions
->do a microdialysis to clean ligation from salts and ions before doing transformation.
The second scaffoldin was ordered and should arrive in the next couple of weeks.

Overview
Methods and Results
Conclusions
The        fifth InterLab study has launched and it further attempts to develop        a standard procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP) measurements        to reduce variability across laboratories in the world. This year the        attempt is to normalize fluorescence measurements to colony forming        units (CFU) instead of optical density of the culture since it is a        great source of variability among labs. Two approaches were used to        compute the cell number in the samples:
Converting         absorbance of cells to absorbance of known concentration beads;
Counting         CFU in the samples.
Methods and Results
1. Calibration protocols
At        firstly, we measured absorbance (Abs600)        of weakly scattering LUDOX CL-X to obtain a multiplication factor of        Abs600 to transform absorbance values to the comparable OD600 units.
Following        that, we prepared serial dilutions of monodisperse silica        microspheres and obtained standard particle curve (Fig.        1) which allows to        convert Abs600 measurements to        an estimated number of cells.
Figure        1. Standard particle curve obtained by using microspheres that        are similar size to a cell displayed in (A) a linear scale and        (B) a log scale.
The        final calibration was that of fluorescein concentration. We generated        a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration by,        again, making serial dilutions of fluorescein (Fig.        2). This way we        could convert our cell based readings of fluorescence to an        equivalent fluorescein concentration.  The measurements were taken        with the same setting as those which would be used measuring cell        fluorescence.

While centrifuging, a plasmid mini column was inserted into a 2ml capless wash tube. The supernatant was transferred to the plasmid mini column and centrifuged for 1min.
Wash solution at 5X concentrate was used to add 4 volumes (100ml) of 95-100% ethanol. The plasmid mini column from the wash tube was removed and the filtrate discarded from the tube. The column was replaced into the same wash tube. 750µL of the wash solution was added and centrifuged for 1min. The wash solution was discarded from the tube and the column was replaced into the same wash tube. It was then centrifuged for an additional 1 min to remove the residual wash solution. The plasmid mini column was transferred to a 1.5-2.0ml capped microcentrifuge tube and
50µL of elution solution was added onto the membrane stack at the base of the column and allowed a minute for the solution to saturate the membranes. It was again centrifuged for 1min to elute the plasmid. The mini column was discarded and the eluted DNA was stored in the freezer).
Preparation of the E.coli cell free system
The E.Coli cell free system was constructed via the following method:
Two buffers s30a and s30b were first made (1.725g potassium acetate, 2.944g magnesium sulphate, added 400ml MQ water and set to a pH of 7.8 by adding trisacetate. It was then filtered in to 2X 250ml beakers one being for S30A in which 500µL of 2 mercaptoethanol was added and S30B that did not contain 2 mercaptoehanol). The bacteria cells were thawed on ice and resuspended the pellets by washing out with S30A buffer and all he solution transferred into 2X falcon tubes.
These were then centrifuged at 2000 RCF for 10 minutes. Again, the pellets were resuspended with S30A buffer and centrifuged at 2000 RCF for 10 minutes. This was completed twice as to a total of 3 times. The supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended with S30B buffer and then sonicated for 30 sec on and 30 sec off at 50% for a total of 5 minutes.

The production of PCBs has been banned in the United States because of possible impact on animal and human health, yet the harmful molecules still contaminate our waters today.  Our project involves transferring genes responsible for producing PCB-dechlorinating enzymes from the anaerobic D. mccartyi bacterium, in which they're naturally found, into E.coli, an easier-to-work-with bacterium.
We will be transferring three different genetic variants of the PCB dechlorinating enzyme and will face many challenges in producing the working enzymes.  The enzymes probably use norpseudo-B12 as a cofactor, a compound E. coli doesn't naturally create.  We are currently researching ways to introduce this into the environment of the E.coli expressing the proteins.  The working enzymes also contain iron-sulfer clusters, which will be destroyed upon exposure to oxygen, as the original organism is anaerobic.  We are currently looking into different and easy ways to grow E.coli anaerobically and ways to combat this issue.  D. mccartyi's membrane is also archea-like and dissimilar to E.coli's membrane, which may cause complications with expression and localization.  The enzymes are also transmembrane proteins, which may pose problems.
We will be contacting other labs with higher biosafety levels due to the toxicity of PCBs, to test out our system.  We are currently working in lab to transfer our synthesized genetic circuits to E.coli bacteria while we research ways to solve the potential problems listed above.  We have also included His tags in our genetic circuits and have partnered with the Baker Lab at the University of Washington to analyze our PCB dechlorinating enzymes in the future.

√ Submit 9 new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.See our Parts section.
√ We helped Team BIT with their modeling. See our Collaborations section
√ We held a lot of activities ranging from education to Public engagement, from communicating to surveying. The topics included sustainability, safety and People's opnions on science.See our Human Practices Silver section.
Gold: √ We did a survey on people's knowing and opnions of the yeast prion, meanwhile we introduced the yeast prion to those who didn't know about that. We also collected people's idea around the yeast prion, which help us to determine our applications. We communicated with Dr. Dong Men, an expert on yeast prion, to determine what apllication that our systems may be used for.See our Human Practices Gold section
√ We improved two parts this year, one is part BBa_J63006 and the other is part BBa_K1739000.
√ We verified our ideas on our Pro Priontein system would work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We proved the devices of this system are successful.
√ We demonstrated our work at simulated conditions by designing a model,which is 3D printed, to contain our yeasts of both system. See our Design section and Results section.
Future Work
Finish the work of the Propri-ontein system
Before we started our experiments, we set a goal to finish two system we designed, one of which is a gene-level switch, and the other is a protein-level switch. We constructed our device in the plasmids of Escherichia coli and then integrated to the plasmids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After that, we transformed all the plasmids to the competent yeasts. However, due to the limit time, we only finished the Pro priontein system, leaving the yeast plasmids of our Propri-ontein system untransformed. With sufficient time, we believe that our Propri-ontein system will work succeessfully.
Expand our system to Escherichia coli
This year, we fused the gene of SUP35NM with the activating domain of GAL4, the binding domain of GAL4, and sfGFP11. We verified the fusion of SUP35NM and sfGFP11 worked fine. It was believed that the cure of the prion aggregate might be associated with the generation propagation, however, a generation of the yeast can be very long, which may reduce the usefulness of the"

For our project, she said that we would need to ensure that our PNCs with the toxin would be stable within the water. With this type of project, you need to be conscious of the users of waterways and where the water is distributed. Overall, this interview was helpful in learning more about how the province is currently handling this problem and that our system would need to be safe to ensure no unintended effects would occur.
Shannon Frank, Oldman Watershed Council
More research needs to be conducted on preventative measures for invasive species
We spoke with Shannon Frank, the Executive Director of the Oldman Watershed Council, a local not-for-profit group that works on finding solutions to environmental issues in Southern Alberta. The group has 8 goals and their main focuses are currently enhancing the commitment of the community to taking care of the watershed, to restore headwaters, and to educate recreationists about their impact on the watershed. One of their goals they plan on working on in the future is to prevent and control invasive species. Shannon mentioned that one of the invasive species that is current threat to Alberta waterways is zebra mussels. Current prevention methods include educating the public and boat inspection stations. A potash treatment is also being investigated as a viable treatment option. We are the first biotechnology project that has approached the Oldman Watershed Council. Shannon said that for our project the main considerations would be that it is specific for zebra mussels and would not harm native species and also what the long-term effects would be on the ecosystem. In terms of the implementation of our system, she suggested that it may be more practical for government agencies to implement our system into pipelines. If zebra mussels were to invade Alberta, infestation in city and agriculture pipes would cost millions of dollars to repair this infrastructure. Overall, this interview was helpful in determining what we would need to do to have our system be useful for an environmental application.

UFlorida,2017,Team:UFlorida#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," linking all these bright minds to a common goal, international unification is possible.
Team TecCEM
Florida is often stereotyped as the citrus state, but in truth a majority of the citrus industry here has deteriorated due to the devastating impact of bacterial disease. Oranges especially have been dealt a hard blow from the spread of Huanglongbing commonly referred to as ‘citrus greening’. While our state has certainly suffered, numerous other countries have as well. The TecCEM group from Mexico has recognized and cultivated an inhibition strategy against future outbreaks. Solving a problem requires initial background knowledge and the TecCEM team wanted to learn straight from the source; the citrus farmers that were experiencing the losses. They needed to understand the disease pathology and the possible ecological impact of biological remediation. UFlorida aided by putting the team into direct contact with the Florida Department of Agriculture and the Citrus Health Response to reach out to specific citrus grove owners. With these contacts TecCEM could compile survey data from the producers and analyze their extension portion of human practices.
Team Michigan Software
Creating a biologically-engineered system is an achievement, but such success requires a streamlined series of protocols and experimental knowledge. iGEM doesn’t simply involve the poking and prodding of bacteria; it also relies on foundational projects to provide support to future projects. As such, many teams work in the pursuit of technical/software support or part characterization. Team Michigan Software has developed a protocol database meant to attenuate the problems associated with protocol reliability and replication. Synthetic biology depends on validated methods, but reaching standardization between labs has proven difficult.  ProtoCat 4.0 is designed to allow users to browse, review, edit or even upload dependable protocols of their own. With this collaboration, UFlorida completed a beta-testing survey to constructively critique the available tools. We also uploaded one of our own protocols that has proven to be consistently effective throughout benchwork."

BactaSun
Although melanoma accounts for less than 1% of skin cancer cases, they are responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. More than 80% of melanomas are caused by the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.

Global issue
Over the last years, our exposition to UV rays has increased and scientists noticed an upward trend in the risks of developing skin cancers.
Protection exists
Although we can protect ourselves against this health hazard, we cannot feel the UV rays and when sunburns appear, it is already too late.
Badge design
Hence, we have designed a wearable UV-sensitive badge to help warning people on their level of exposure anytime and anywhere. The badge turns red when exposed to a certain level of sunlight.
Culture design
This badge contains a liquid cell culture. The bacterial cells are engineered o produce a red fluorescent protein, which is only developed when. They only produce it when the badge is exposed to UV rays, thanks to a photocaged amino acid.

Tsinghua-A,2018,Team:Tsinghua-A#TeamBITCHINA_-_-_TEXT.html," we notice that when the amount of probes are far more than the Hydrogen peroxide. The fluorescence intensity is probably proportion to the concentration of Hydrogen peroxide. Thus, we decided to construct a linear regression model based on the data that Team BIT-China provided to validate the potential linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and Hydrogen peroxide. Also, this model can be use as a standard for Hydrogen peroxide testing.
Linear regression analysis
Definition
$H_2O_2$: The concentration of $H_2O_2$, units in $mM$.
FOD: Florescence intensity / OD
Scatter Plot
The Scatter Plot of data are demonstrated below.
From the chart, it is clear that the FOD is in proportion to the $H_2O_2$, when the $H_2O_2$ is between 0-2.5 $mM.$ The data in the points that $H_2O_2$ is 5 are obviously not obey linear model. Thus, we consider to construct a linear model between 0 and 2.5$mM$ of  $H_2O_2$. The new Scatter Plot of this part of data are showed below.
The scatter plot witnessed a significant linearity of between FOD and $H_2O_2$, so we tend to use a linear model to predict and explain the results.
Model Construction
With the criteria of the least square, we construct following linear model
$$FOD_i=β_0+β_1  H_2O_{2i}+ϵ_i  ,ϵ_i~N(0,σ^2)$$
The property of the model are demonstrated below
It is obvious that the data fits linear model well and the parameters are following
$$FOD_i=4752+1214.48 H_2O_{2i}+ϵ_i,ϵ_i~N(0,425.9)$$
The data along with the fitted values of the model and the confidence interval are pictured below.
Residuals Analysis
We also run a residuals analysis to ensure this linear model is proper to fit the data. First, we draw histogram and QQ-plot of standard residuals.
From the histogram, the standard residuals equally drop in the two sides of zero, which means that the residuals are possibly independent. Also, the QQ-plot implies the significant normality of residuals.
Results and inspirations
The linear model we constructed validates the linearity between the concentration of $H_2O_2$ and the"

Introduction to photolithography
The following processes will explain how a mask and a positive/negative resist wafer are made. These two components are essential for the creation of our chips, as they are the master plan, the mold for the chip. This is how it works: a mask is used as a mold to make a wafer, and a wafer is used as a mold to make each of the microfluidic chip's layers (control and flow layers).
Mask
Wafers
Here are defined the two main types of photoresist. A photoresist is a light-sensitive material used in several industrial processes, such as photolithography and photoengraving to form a patterned coating on a surface:
- A negative resist is a type of photoresist in which the portion of the photoresist that is exposed to light crosslinks and thus becomes insoluble to the photoresist developer. The unexposed portion of the photoresist is dissolved by the photoresist developer.
- A positive resist is a type of photoresist in which the portion of the photoresist that is exposed to light becomes soluble to the photoresist developer. The portion of the photoresist that is unexposed remains insoluble to the photoresist developer.
