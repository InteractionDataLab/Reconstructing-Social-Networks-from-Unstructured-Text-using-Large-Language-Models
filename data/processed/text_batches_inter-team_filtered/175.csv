The NRP UEA iGEM Team 2012
The iGEM 2012 team for the Norwich Research Park and University of East Anglia (NRP UEA) are a close knit group of seven biology-based undergraduate students working in the labs within UEA’s BIO building. They are the second iGEM team that the NRP has produced and truly relish the opportunity to compete in a competition that has placed itself in such an innovative and exciting field of biology.
The NRP is one of Europe's largest concentrations of researchers in the life sciences and the environment, the UEA being a core constituent of the park. Known for its abundance of rabbits, its Ziggurats (as seen in various album covers) and its world-leading research. Despite having a olympic sized swimming pool on campus, the team prefer taking leisurely swimming in the river Yare that flows through the campus, a site of special scientific interest. It is frequented by cuckoos, sedge warblers, great crested grebes and, if you're lucky, you will see the odd flock of students too!
The iGEM team really are spoiled by both the natural beauty of their surroundings and the teaching excellence. Despite only having two main official academic advisers, practically everyone in the UEA School of Biology has very kindly imparted some of their wisdom to the student participance, as well as members of the John Innes Centre and the rest of the NRP, making the project a real representation of UEAs best and brightest!

Goal #5 - Have fun and LEARN
The whole iGEM experience should be about learning, enjoying yourself, and giving back. There have been countless opportunities for our student team members to work as a group, learn about Synthetic Biology, teach Synthetic Biology to others, and participate in cutting-edge laboratory research that will benefit us now and into our professional careers. Even before attending the International Jamboree in Boston this year, all of us have taken away lessons and experiences that will greatly improve upon how we conduct research and work with others in the future.

During my 2 years’ journey in the nano world, I got to know iGEM and joined in USTC Software team with great honor. Just as NEW YORK TIMES says, iGEM is a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program. I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine. It is unforgettable to have a brainstorm with talents from different academic background and turn our imagines into reality. Thanks to iGEM, I experienced a new trip in the synthetic biology and benefited a lot from my partners. Also, to compete against more than 1,000 other students from 100 schools, including many top-flight institutions is exciting.
I love traveling and always enjoy trips with my friends. I have a dream that one day I can travel around the world to discover the great scenery make new friends and experience different culture. Sports is also my favorite, I am good at playing football and gifted in table tennis.

ABSTRACT
Cataracts, the clouding of the lens, cause half of the world's blindness. Most cataracts are age-related and arise when crystallin proteins in the lens become oxidized and aggregate over time. Surgery is currently the only recognized treatment to effectively cure cataracts, but this method is expensive and invasive. Therefore, we formulated a natural and non-invasive alternative. In the eye, a natural antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—produced by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GSR)—exists to combat oxidation, but GSH levels decrease with age. Studies have also suggested that another enzyme—25-hydroxylase (CH25H)—can convert cholesterol in the eye into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which reverses crystallin aggregation. We expressed and purified GSR and CH25H for the prevention and treatment of catar"

7/25/08
--------------------------------------------------
This is an example of the calculations involved:
1 ug of plasmid used per SINGLE transformation.  (we could use 0.5 ug of each plasmid for a double transformation).  OD after the incubation period indicates approximately 1x10^8 cells.  We resuspend this in 1 mL and then add 100 uL to each transformation.  Assuming that the cells themselves take up a negligible volume, this means that 1x10^7 cells goes into each transformation.  This assumption is slightly off, seeing as the cells usually take up an additional 100-200uL.  Thus, let's say 8.33x10^6 cells goes into each transformation.  These cells are then diluted into a volume of 460 uL (adding 360 to the 100 already there), heat shocked for 40 mins, and then spun down and resuspended in 1 mL.  Of this 1 mL, let's say that you directly plate out 20 uL or 100 uL (just as we did on 7/23/08).  This ends up being 1.66x10^5 cells or 8.33x10^5 cells, respectively or about 16,000 or 83,000 cells.  Even if the transformation efficiency is 10%, one would still have to count about 1600-8300 colonies on the plates.  This would be impossible and would yield no isolated colonies.
Thus, after resuspending in 1 mL, one can then do two dilutions by 100x.  The first dilution will be 10 uL in 1 mL of water, which will yield 8.33x10^4 cells in 1 mL.  If you plate out 20 uL or 100 uL of this first dilution, you put 1.66x10^3 cells or 8.33x10^3 cells on the plates.  Then, if the transformation efficiency is 10%, you will be able to count 166-833 colonies, which is a lot, but more manageable.  The second dilution"

Experience Sharing of Capturing Bloodsucking Flies in the farm：
Dr. Tzeng told us the livestock farmers used to borrow the Insect light trap from them to capture the Bloodsucking Flies. To our surprise, he said the light trap can capture thousands of insects at just one night. Aditionally, they also had some cooperation program with livestock farmers. At that time, they used many different interesting approaches, like colors & light to test the behavior of Bloodsucking Flies. This experience sharing made us learn some basic methods of testing insects’ behavior.
The Art of Insect Rearing for Them：
Dr. Tzeng told us insect rearing is not only a branch of knowledge, but a kind of art. For example, when malaria was a pandemic disease all over the world, some related research had difficulty in obvious progression, because Anopheles gambiae had not been reared successfully at that time. However, since a researcher from United Kingdom had success in rearing Anopheles gambiae in lab, the malaria disease had been completely researched, and the health life of human had been improved. This concept raised a great inspiration for how to do the research of our project.
Suggestion of Our Harmful Insects--Bactrocera dorsalis：
Dr. Tzeng told us the bactrocera dorsalis is a serious problem for Taiwanese agriculture, which causes 17 billions dollors of loss every year. Our government had used many methods ( like：air drop many non-fertility bactrocera dorsalis to the farm ), trying to solve this problem, but finally failed. Dr. Tzeng suggested Bactrocera dorsalis as the target harmful insect of our project to solve the main problem of Taiwanese agricultural insects damage.
Discussion about Ecological Equilibrium Problem of Our Project：
As for the ecological equilibrium problem of our project, Dr. Tzeng thought foundamentally we human farm in the area, having caused harm to nature. If you persist in the ecological equilibrium problem, then you have to ask yourself why you do farming and cause harm to the environment？Dr. Tzeng gave us a special view point, highlighting in the beginning, we human who do farming to survive have caused harm to the"

The basic conjecture underlying HDMR is that the component functions arising in typical real problems are likely to exhibit only low order l cooperativity among the input variables such that the significant terms in the HDMR expansion are expected to satisfy the relation: l<<n< for n>>1. An HDMR expansion to second order
<math>\begin{align} f(x)=f_{0}+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i})+\sum\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j}), \\ \end{align}\,\!</math>
often provides a satisfactory description of <math>f(x)</math> for many high dimensional systems when the input variables are properly chosen. This is also the formula we use to achieve HDMR expansion. Similarly, reactants of two at most are usually involed in biochemical reactions. Thus, we can simplify the differential equations to the following form:
<math>\begin{align} \frac{dx_{k}}{dt} &=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(x_{i},{\mathbf{p}} _{i})+\sum\limits_{1\leq i<j\leq n}f_{ij}(x_{i},x_{j},{\mathbf{p}} _{ij})-kx_{i}+C_{k}\\ \end{align}\,\!</math>

for <math>k=1,\ldots ,n.</math> The left side term of the equation above represents the changing rate of variable <math>x_{k}.</math>We assume that each term on the right side represents one step biochemical reaction which is equivalent to the rate term defined in SBML. It means that changing rate of one variavle is determined by different rate terms. <math>C_{k}</math> is a constant number. <math>f_{i}(\cdot )</math> and <math>f_{ij}(\cdot )</math> have similar definitions and represent reaction rates that vary according to kinetic laws. <math>{\mathbf{p}}_{i}</math> and <math>{ \mathbf{p}}_{ij}</math> contain the parameter values of the kinetic"

Chen: Experimental workspace can automatically decide whether it is a personal account or a business account of networking and the workspace affords the download link of those relevant software. Can we get those software embedded? How to help our customers find out the software they want quickly? (By searching them?) It is also important to process data and generate lab reports and logs in the workspace.
Future plan: We plan to add software in the software library, optimize the software's functions and landscaping interface. Besides, we want to afford real time data while monitoring on different platforms. And how about syncing to the cloud?
Qiu: Easy Express. The software is designed to save time for users. Then they just need to stay on creating new ideas and putting a possible idea into practice. In addition, unified expressions get researchers to understand other's work easily. Its system's function: drawing, display sequences, dynamic display structure of the plasmid and parts of the experiments, shows the meaning of each graph and table, guiding and help. The challenge for us is that whether we can dynamic display the data? If we standardization of the presentation, the software may be rejected by other teams for its boredom standardization separate kinds of efforts may be impossible. This software told you that you don't need to learn MAYA and other magic software, it can include their functions. Will it be possible? (Perhaps unattainable for now) The idea may be realized by attaching the database to the software and affording individuation information search for our users.

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," (TF) which regulates many different target genes resulting in the expression of various proteins. In most cell types (with the exception of B cells and Dentritic cells) NF-κB is bound to the Inhibitor of κB (IκB) withholding NF-κB from entering the nucleus. When the cell becomes activated by an extra cellular stimluli, IκB is degraded and NF-κB can enter the nucleus. Within the nucleus NF-κB is able to enhance transcription of genes which are involved in immune response, cell proliferation or cell survival, depending on cell type and extra cellular stimuli [11] . In many cells NF-κB regulates anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. TRAF1/2) and therby preventing cell death. Therefore mutations of NF-κB resulting in a constitutively active form are often associated with unregulated cell proliferation and cancer [12] . In macrophages the NF-κB signalling pathway could be activated by binding of bacterial lipopolysacchride (LPS). There NF-κB activation leads to secretion of cytokines which influence other lymphocytes.
p53
P53 is a transcription factor (TF) which is involved in several physiological processes. One major function of P53 is cell cycle regulation. P53 is often activated through DNA damage or other cellular stresses like cell cycle abnormalities, hypoxia and oxidative stress. In normal cells the P53 level is kept low by the protein HDM2, which attaches ubiqutin to P53 (acts as ubiquitin ligase). The ubiquitylation of P53 leads to its degradation by the proteasome. In response to cellular stress P53 is phosphorylated and changes its conformation in a way preventing HDM2(mdm2 is the analog protein in mouse) binding. Conformational changes also result in the exposion of the DNA binding domain. This activation of P53 leads to farreaching alteration of gene expression. The cell cycle is stopped between G1 and S phase and DNA repair systems are switched on. If the cell damage is intense P53 accumaltion can also lead to apoptosis of the cell. Because of its roles in DNA protection and cell cycle regulation P53 mutation is often correlated with cancer [13] .

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
This analytical Method can be used for separation and identification of proteins according to their electrophoretic mobility. The mobility is a function of length of the molecular weight. Proteins that have identical charge per unit mass due to binding of SDS results in an equal electrophoretic mobility.
Pouring the polyacrylamide gel
Make a master mix for the stacking and separating gel without adding ammonium persulfate and TEMED.
Aliquote 6,5 mL for each separating and 2,5 mL for each stacking gel.
Add ammonium persulfate and TEMED to each separating gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into your gel casting form. Leave about 2 centimeters below the bottom of the comb for the stacking gel.
Layer isopropanol on top of the gel.
Leave the separating gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize.
Remove isopropanol and wait until the surface is dry.

Wageningen_UR,2012,Team:Wageningen UR#MethodsDetection_-_-_TEXT.html," of the DLS is similar to the output of the EM. If the results are positive we can use the DLS as a cheap and easy way to detect VLPs.
In order to quantify the DLS, we set up an experiment to compare the size distribution of the VLPs. We produced a large batch of wild-type CCMV monomers and assembled them in vitro into VLPs. After purification we split up the sample. One part is analyzed by the electron microscope and the other part is analyzed by the dynamic light scattering technique. To calculate the size distribution of the VLPs with the EM, we took multiple pictures of the VLPs. We printed out the pictures and measured by hand each particle individually. After these measurements, we calculated the actual radius of each particle and plotted it on a graph. To calculate the size distribution of the VLPs with the DLS, we took the sample and measured it multiple times, so that anomalies were reduced. After measurement we used the CONTIN method to get the size distribution and plotted it in excel.
Figure 5: Up) The EM raw measurements (red) and the fitted normal distribution of the raw data (Blue), Bottom) Multiple size distributions of the wild-type CCMV VLPs using DLS
As seen in figure 5, the size distribution calculated by both methods looks similar. Both the EM and DLS detect particles around 15 nm, precisely what you expect from the literature. The minor differences can be explained by the methods used to calculate the size distribution. With the EM we visualized the particles first and then calculated the size distribution. With the DLS, the raw output was fitted and can be wrong if the sample is not pure or not concentrated enough. We took that into account by measuring multiple times.
Both the EM and DLS can be used to detect VLPs. This means we've confirmed that both techniques combined create a solid and secure method to detect and analyze VLPs. It is possible to discover many characteristics of VLPs. The part BBa_K883001 that represents the wild-type CCMV gene with the IPTG induced promoter has been extendedly tested on the stability.
Stability experiments
CCMV is a virus that can be useful in nanotechnology, because it is a well-studied virus and certain physical properties of the CCMV-VLP are already known. We want to provide additional information about the conditions in which the CCMVs are stable. These conditions are important when it comes to site-specific drug delivery.

What do we desire to realize? In short, just tell us what you want your bio-device to behave, and we will return you with a list of eligible formation strategies for your design, of course, with bio-bricks. Turgidly as the idea might appear to be, this is basically an adoption of the gist of reverse engineering and evolution. By intake the custom-designated behaviors, we search, sometimes traverse, the solution space formed by nearly-inexhaustible combination of Biobricks. In order to make the simulative process applicable and practical, we employed a couple of algorithms widely used in computational sciences like Metropolis method and Dijkstra Algorithm to cut down the time cost and optimize the final result. Analysis on sensitivity and robustness has also been carried out to escort a reliable output of the final list of Biobrick combinations.
Now we have an ABCD for reconstruction of bio-network, or rather, all ODE systems theoretically. But there still exist many more defects and more inspirations on a higher level. Therefore, instead of fixing 'The End' to the last line of our notebook, we'd rather define another 'and...' clause, claiming another start for greater good.

SAFETY
Every member of our team has been trained about general lab safety and project design safety by our                     previous members. For example, the former leader and our advisors taught us how to run the                     experiment correctly and avoid mistakes.
PROJECT DESIGN SAFETY
For the safety of our team members, we designed the project to be as safe as possible. The core                         of our project is to accumulate intracellular ROS by overexpressing the endogenous ndi1 gene of                         Saccharomyces cerevisiae. And in order to improve yeast survival, we use a feedback system to                         maintain intracellular ROS at an appropriate level. The entire project is harmless to the human body. During the implementation of the project, we selected the roGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein as a                         reporter gene, which can be directly detected without adding any harmful reagents.
LAB SAFETY
Our team conducted research in a safety level 1/2 laboratory. The organisms we used, E. coli                         strain DH5α, BL21, Top 10 and S.c strain CEN.PK2-1C are suitable for the S1/2-safety laboratory                         we are working in. Besides, the plasmids we are using for transformation (pRS42K, pESC-Ura,                         pESC-Trp, pESC-His, pESC-Leu, pSB1C3) are not harmful for humans.

Because of the nature of our project, contacting with microorganisms is inevitable. In order to                         avoid any harmful effects to each member of our team, all laboratory work was in accordance                         with the safety requirements for the laboratory. This includes, but is not limited to, the                         following examples:
(1) Eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited in the laboratory.
(2) Don’t deal with the wastes at will.

The Stockholm iGEM team was in many ways integral to the success of the early stages of our iGEM journey. As the first team from Lund participating in the iGEM competition, we found the process of organizing the initial juncture quite the challenge as we were uncertain of what to expect from the competition and how prosperously to structure the team organization. The Stockholm team kindly provided recommendations on these matters and in addition sent us some templates outlining the process of seeking funding.
São Paulo State University School of Pharmacy at Araraquara
As another recently established iGEM team, AQA UNESP were faced with a lot of similar challenges in the wet-lab as we had experienced. This ultimately lead to a rewarding video conference consisting of joint debugging of our protocols. In particular, the InterLab study was discussed at length and we were provided with several practical suggestions that, upon implementation, improved the outcome of our transformations.
University of Amsterdam
Early on in the project we had a dialogue with the University of Amsterdam team in which we  the optimal route to a successful project. As they professed some initial worry regarding the funding of their project, we provided them with the strategies we had used to successfully acquire funding in addition to a brochure we had created to trigger interest in potential sponsors.
Missouri University of Science and Technology
In the later stages of the iGEM project, we exchanged a rewarding video correspondence with the established Missouri S&T team. This provided us with the opportunity to reflect and review the decisions that were made during the course of the project together with a seasoned project group, leaving us with insightful suggestions as how to better organize the project for the years to come.
Video Conferences
During the passing year, we exchanged numerous video conferences with teams from all over the world discussing various facts of the iGEM competition and synthetic biology. Each and every one of the dialogues left us with some advice or suggestion that would prove to play a role in the molding of some aspects of our project. Thus, we would be remiss if we did not mention their impact and thank them accordingly. The teams were Amsterdam, AQA UNESP São Paulo, Chalmers, Chennai, AFCM Egypt, Linköping, Missouri S&T, Stockholm, Uppsala, Utrecht, York.

We transformed out HSP+pACYC184 ligation with DH5α cells. We used 5μL of ligated plsamid and one tube of DH5α. We did this twice, once with the DH5α that we made (I) and once with the ones Dionne made (II). In order to test the two batches of DH5α compotent cells, we also used a control of PUC19 plasmid, so that we would be certain something would grow. The ""transformation"" protocol was followed, except that they were heat shocked for 50 seconds, instead of 40.
We then looked at the five plates that were streaked yesterday: control, UV shocked for 1 second, UV shocked for 5 seconds, UV shocked for 30 seconds, and UV shocked for 60 seconds. Looking on the UV light, it appeared that the 5 second one was significantly greener than the control. We took 500μL of PBS and added some cells for each of the three colonies for each of the five plates. This was vortexed, centrifuged, liquid was taken out, 500μL PBS added, and vortexed. Then, we put 200μL in the plate reader and measured fluorescence and concentration. Normalized fluorescence was calculated. See ""GFP Fluorescence Reading on the co-transformed plates #2"" for results.
We researched BioBrick/iGEM compatible plasmids so we can send these g-blocks in to the competition as our parts. See ""Biobrick Conversion Info for G-Blocks"" to see the plasmids that we can use instead of pBR322 and pACYC184, which can't be used for iGEM.
We also set up more test plates by re-streaking the UV+pACYC184 (chlor 150), GFP+pBR322 (amp 100), UV+pACYC184 and GFP+pBR322 (amp 100/chlor 150), and DH5α (LB). For each we made 2 plates; a control plate that was not hit by UV (and covered in tin foil to assure it does not get UV exposure from the surrounding) and a plate that was hit by UV for 5 seconds. They were left in the incubator at 37 C overnight.

Figure 1: A predicted Peptide Aptamer structure using Phyre2.
Since 1975, where Kohler and Milstein initiated the current era of antibody production by introducing the hybridoma technology, the applications have continuously been extended and mAbs have become an essential part in many aspects of research. Reference: Liu JK1 (2014) The history of monoclonal antibody development - Progress, remaining challenges and future innovations. Sep 11;3(4):113-6.
DOI: 10.1016/j.amsu.2014.09.001. [PubMed] The production is a bio engineered process carried out in mammalian cells. Despite several advantages, some drawbacks of using mammalian cells are often disregarded: they are cumbersome, costly and at the expence of animal lifes. Foremost requirements for a system capable of making mAbs are high growth rate and high production yield. The demand is continuously growing and the production market is exponentially rising. In the end of 2014, 47 mAbs have been approved for treatment in US and Europe and this number is estimated to be ~70 in 2020, with a world"

In cell  signalling, . S will interact with  SqrR, forming a tri- or tetrasulfide cross-links linking C41 and C107 on the  same subunit of SqrR. The change in the structure of SqrR makes it fall off  from the sqr promotor and thus the  expression of sqr turns on.
We model this rate using the Law of Mass Action kinetics. This principle  governs that the rate of a reaction (d/dt) is proportional to the  concentrations of the substrates.
For a particular reaction, for example:
the rate can be written mathematically as:

Transcription
Transcription is a complex procession.  However, it is well established that initiation of transcription is the major  factor in determining overall rate of mRNA production. Transcription initiation  is a process influenced by a number of key steps including: promoter escape,  binding of the RNA Polymerase onto the promoter, isomerization, and formation  of the closed RNA Pol complex from the open complex, and your Escherichia coli strain. In this model,  we will assume that binding of the RNA polymerase is the rate determining step  in transcription initiation.
Thus,  our key assumptions for transcription are:
 1. For the constitutively expressed gene sqrR, we can assume that they are at maximal transcription.
2. transcription rate is determined  primarily by the disassociation of SqrR.
 3. Promoter strength (in Polymerases  per second) is a constant, and represents the rate of transcription at maximal  expression.
We  modeltranscription rate using Mass Action kinetics..

Translation
After transcription,  it must be translated into a functional chromo protein. Translation involves 3  main stages: initiation, elongation of the polypeptide, and termination. The  key molecular machinery driving this process"
Hong_Kong_HKUST,2017,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#Model#Sensing_-_-_TEXT.html," its function as a sensor. Both concentrations increase             when extracellular [AHL] increases above 10−7, which can be attributed to the higher net diﬀusion             of AHL into the cell independent of the activation of the positive feedback loop itself. However, it can also be seen that the addition of asRNA reduces the response of the system at high concentrations of AHL and so its main advantage is in the sharp boundary between on and off concentrations.

Also, our two captains and our PI met Dean Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Roger Trippel, Senior Director of Development and Individual Giving, and Abigail Kaun, Special Assistant to the Dean. We discussed the project to-date, our outreach efforts, and shared ideas for managing both our and future iGEM UCSC team’s funds.
Created first batch of YPD medium and also created 80% glycerol freeze stocks of our Y. lipolytica strain. We attempted to miniprep our pXRL2- and pUC19-containing E. coli but we made a mistake by switching the order of wash buffers used from the Zyppy Miniprep Kit. The Nanodrop curve of the plasmid sample was ragged and thus we will need to attempt this again.

This week, the captains held check-ins with each individual on the team to hear concerns and alleviate worries, since we are now halfway through the summer. While the captains were busy with meetings, the rest of the team was working hard as always. Our modeling team started a growth curve for Yarrowia lipolytica so we can better understand the yeast’s growth rate, our riboswitch team began lab work, our plasmid team started linearizing plasmids, and our outreach team continued to update the wiki page and started creating a presentation for high schoolers.
Four of our team members and our PI took a vacation to Minneapolis that wasn’t much of a vacation at all. The small group toured Medtronic's Operational Headquarters, Physiological Research Laboratories, and the University of Minnesota's Visible Heart Lab. Almost every other second of the trip was spent on the BMES Coulter College Conference, which required teams to come up with a medical solution to a need. Our team focused on hypertension in resource-constrained settings and developed a solution in the form of a blood-pressure-monitoring phone case and app. Even after the conference, the fivesome was hard at work; they met with the University of Minnesota iGEM team, toured their lab, and gave advice about human practices, outreach, and fundraising.
The first step to prepare for Gibson Assembly was to linearize pUC19"

""I am a student in a bachelor’s degree of Life Sciences. I wanted to participate in iGEM to broaden my knowledge in synthetic biology, which is an emergent field that I didn’t knew much about before this year. I had the chance to discover synthetic biology during the 2nd semester of my 3rd year of Bachelor. This combination of Biology and engineering principles, that I allow myself to describe as an art, do not stop surprising me through the utility it brings to different fields. More than deepening my knowledge, I wanted to see what it feels to work within a team on a project and to do more wet-lab work, to have the chance to meet new people that, just like me, like science and to share their knowledge and ideas. Later, I would like to study Oncology and have my own laboratory to devote my life to the Research. ""

By PCR, the two flanking sequences are assembled with the fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene (camR), the OmpR-regulated promoter, and the relE gene. The flanking sequences are homologous to part of the chromosome around the bacterial attachment site (attB), enabling the homologous recombination.
Using this approach, it was attempted to assemble the OmpR-regulated promoter controlling RelE with the flanking regions by PCR. The assembly of the fragment derived from the plasmid with either one of the flanking fragments was achieved.

BYU_Provo,2014,Team:BYU Provo#Notebook#CRISPR#septoct_-_-_TEXT.html," number of different things: We could have designed the T7 spacer region wrong, the T7 phage we used may have a mutation where we chose our spacer, the CRISPR could be non functional.
- My hypothesis to explain these colonies is that they grew up from the cells that managed to create their own spacer for T7. This type II CRISPR is adaptive and a possible explanation for our results is that it did adapt to the phage infection.
- The way for us to tell if this is true is to redo the experiment using E. coli from these colonies and run DH5a with the empty iGEM plasmid pSB1C3 as a control. If we do not get plaques on the first and do not see similar results to our last test then we can be confident that our CRISPR is working!
Week of September 14
Michael Linzey 9/15/2014
-I got the sequencing results back today and I spend an hour or so trying to figure them out
-I consulted with Dr. Grose and we determined that the forward primer didn't work and I needed to redo the experiment
-In order to do this I was going to need more CRISPR plasmids that had their restriction sites mutated. Luckily I had streaked the bacteria onto new plates so I had ample bacteria to use. I then used the Plasmid Purification Kit to extract the purified plasmid.
September 15, Michael Abboud
Ran last sewing PCR on gel, there was a problem with the gel.  No bands were found even from the ladder, so I suspect the gel had no ethidium bromide.
Garrett Jensen - 9-16-2014
- Yesterday the CRISPR would not grow up. I inoculated the LB/Amp/Chloro broth twice but it never grew up. I thought it might be the broth so I tried growing it up in just LB/Chloro broth. Today that had worked. It seems a little weird that the CRISPR would grow up on a Chloro/Amp plate but not in the broth. I think that something is wrong with our broth. So today I made up a new batch and I am trying to grow up our CRISPR again.
- Today I did plate the CRISPR that grew up and tested it. I have spot tested 5 µL of T7 dilutions from 10e-3 -> 10e-10. As a control I have run Dh5a and the empty iGEM plasmid p"

Bidirectional Promoters
Scientists are frequently confounded by wayward promoters; that is, promoters which do not produce   the expected proteins. Some bidirectional promoters are known to exist, but which way they promote   and the degree of expression has not been quantified. This project will test the directionality of   several BioBrick promoters to answer these questions.
Bidirectional Promoters
Sample navigation menu:
Overview | Design | Results
Palindromic Promoter Circuits
The graph above represents the relative fluorescence measured in a TECANM1000 instrument of several constructs containing various promoter inserts. The reporters indicate the directionality of each promoter sequence measured in the construct. The single biobrick ligated into the construct shows almost complete preference for the forward direction, while three palindromic sequences designed and ligated in the construct demonstrate varying amounts of bidirectionality within the DH10B E.coli cell. Bidirectional promoters are possible within the cell, and those designing promoters should be beware of palindromic sequences in their design and their potential effects on the initiation of protein within the cell.
Further Application
Further characterization of both biobrick promoters and palindromic sequences will yield more information of the prevalence of bidirectionality in promoters. To view the sequences we plan to test in this construct, please visit our parts page.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#diary_-_-_TEXT.html,"ize ouselves with various laboratory procedures that we would use over the summer.
For our next meeting we decided to do some research into whether the pump we required existed and what restrictions it would place on the drug's molecular structure.
Meeting 7
We discussed the possibility of modifying our project -""drug delivery to the gut using bacteria"" to make the bacteria produce another drug or a protein which could potentially treat or cure another disease.
We also considered exploring prokaryotic cell death signals because apoptosis, one of our original kill switch ideas, does not occur within prokaryotic cells.
Meeting 8
In our last meeting before summer we explored the possibility of making bacteria secrete other substances in the gut which could enhance immunity – or perhaps create a kill switch in the bacteria which could have various applications in drug delivery. At this point we explored the functions of antimicrobial peptides and how we could use them to create a kill switch.
We did some research into antimicrobial peptides and decided that our project would be to create a ‘kill switch’ where we would insert a gene (protegrin-1) coding for antimicrobial peptides (AMP’s) into E. coli. The idea was to then use different promoters to switch on the expression of these proteins in certain conditions.
Summer
Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11
Week 1 - 11/07/11
Day 1:
On our first day back the team and Dr. Anne Smith had a meeting where we discussed our project idea of creating a kill switch by using antimicrobial peptides. We proceeded to divide the different tasks amongst ourselves and came up with an action plan for the next few weeks. The purpose of this was twofold, to make our team more efficient and have some sort of way of measuring progress.
We made sure that we all knew the iGEM 2011 Judging Criteria and recorded all deadlines posted on the iGEM website on our team board.
The lab team familiarized themselves with the lab where we would be carrying out our experiments over the summer and we did some simple lab chores such as autoclaving various jars and bottles, preparing Luria broth for plating and storage and learning about different lab procedures necessary for our experiments.
Max began work on the St Andrews team wiki, while Christina began creating a list of an assortment of labs and companies that we could contact for sponsorship.

USTC-Software,2014,Team:USTC-Software#biopano.php_-_-_TEXT.html,", Biopano also serves as a cooperative network building platform. When you create a project, you can add new nodes, name new biological parts and link them with respect to your comprehension to build a brand new net gradually. Meanwhile, Biopano provides log in service. You can sign up with Google or Baidu account and upload your network to the main database to make it more plentiful. Biopano also supports data importing in batch. You can even import data of a species and a database.
5. Details and Reference
When you have already got the entire view and want to know more about the details, double-click the nodes and arcs and the details will be shown. More surprisingly, Biopano supports literature reading in the network. You can view literature corresponding to every node and arc along any gene route in the network, and you will understand how the nodes in the net are associated with each other in depth. If you cast doubt on the reliability of our database, you can verify your thought with authoritative literature.
Demo
Next we will demonstrate some common modules of E.coli k-12:
1, Lac Operon: When you input LacZYA, a Transcription Unit(TU) of Lac Operon and Expand the node:
You will see four promoters, acZp1, lacZp2, lacZp3 and lacZp4 as upstream sequences and three structure genes, lacZ, lacY and lacA as  downstream sequences. Meanwhile, you can see the TU belongs to  the Operon lacZYA.
Above the node lacZYA, you also see three Transcription Factors, namely, CRP, H-NS and lacl. They suppress the expression of  lazZYA.
Expand lacZ, lacY and lacA, and we get BgaL, LacY and ThgA respectively, of which Bgal and ThgA are Enzymes. They catalyze corresponding reactions. Expand Lacl and we get the gene lacl which codes it.
Continue to Expand lacZYA and lacl and we find more materials’ connected with them. You can select and drag the nodes to arrange the  network neatly; you can also click Full Screen and the network will be  displayed in full screen.
2, Following the same steps, we can also get the regulation network of the Operon Trp.
Why choose BioPano?

Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Results#unnatural base pair#uptake_-_-_TEXT.html," TAT signal peptide variants around 35 kDa. One very weak can be observed for the fusion protein of the native transporter between 55 and 70 kDa.  All these results show how difficult the isolation of integral membrane proteins can be. A number of reasons can be brought forward to explain why isolation of PtNTT2 from the membrane proved to be so challenging. First of all, PtNTT2 has 10 transmembrane domains, making it a highly hydrophobic protein. To find a correct detergent to solubilize the protein from the isolated membrane fraction also proves challenging. The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) lists dozens of possible detergents on their site (European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Protein Purification). To find a best suited detergent is also a challenge. Another reason why the visualization of membrane proteins on SDS PAGEs and Western Blots is challenging is that membrane proteins tend to aggregate when boiled and that they often exhibit “gel shifting” (Rath et al., 2009). For that reason, another SDS PAGE was run using the isolated membrane fractions of the PtNTT2 constructs without cMyc-GFP tag, but this time the samples were loaded onto the gel without previous boiling.
Figure 25: SDS PAGE of the isolated membrane fraction without previous boiling
No thick bands can be observed around 70 kDa. Slightly above 100 kDa, bands can be observed for all PtNTT2 variants but not for the negative controls. But given that the samples ran quite different on the gel compared to the boiled samples, no definite conclusion can be drawn from this gel.
Based on these findings it can be concluded that PtNTT2 is located in the inner membrane of E. coli and that isolation of the entire protein remains challenging. Since it could be shown that the tags are present in the inner membrane fraction, it is very likely that the entire construct PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP could simply not be solubilized enough. In all Western Blots, the tag of PtNTT2-cMyc-GFP with a TAT signal peptide was far weaker compared to the other samples, indicating that PtNTT2 with a TAT signal peptide is weakly integrated into the membrane. This would also concur with our previous results and would explain the lacking function of this construct.

In terms of binding assays, using aptamers as affinity ligands to recognize specific proteins are better than those using antibodies. Aptamers are short, synthetic single stranded oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) that can bind to target molecules with high affinity and specificity.[6]-[9] They are commonly selected from random sequence libraries, using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) techniques.[10] Advantages of aptamers over antibodies include longer shelflife, improved thermal stability and ease of modification and conjugation.[11]
An interesting binding assay is to use aptamers as the target recognition probes and CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) as the signal amplifier, which is called Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system(ABCD system, Figure 1). We developed this system to detect those biomarkers of protein-type for the purpose of disease detection or staging.
Figure 1. Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system.
Abstract
The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. We immobilize the aptamer-“complementary strand” complex on a solid phase, using a “competitive” approach to free the “complementary strand”; then the “complementary strand” was detected using the trans-cleavage property of the Cpf1 protein, which allows the fluorescence recovery of the static quenched complex whose fluorophore and quencher are linked by a ssDNA. In summary, we initially transform the protein signal to the acid signal, then transform the nucleic acid signal to the fluorescence signal. We use aptamer SYL3C[12] against EpCAM, an epithelial cell adhesion molecule that is highly expressed on the surface of adenocarcinoma cells, to test the feasibility of our system.

USTC,2015,Team:USTC-Software#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," data for all sets of input states. The thick line is for the [111] set of inducers.
Our results
Based on the logical relationship between the output and inputs, we summarize it into a truth table and BioBLESS will design a gene circuit. Stochastic simulation with different parameters, namely the combination of 0/1 of inputs, will be carried out to give predicted performance of different input states. The peak value of concentration-time figures based on different input states will be arrayed in an ascending order coincidently similar to the order shown in Fig. 0(b). When all three inputs are present, the output of the designed gene circuit rises all above other situations. Sets with aTc present but not all present shares similar outputs. These outputs are evidently higher than those sets without aTc whose outputs stay in low levels.
Further analysis
There is no clock that synchronizes the progression of the signal between gates. There are delays at each layer which can lead to transient errors in the output, known as faults. A fault may occur when a signal is divided and  one branch skips a layer (for example, in Fig. 0(a) the pTet input signal skips the first layer). Because the on signal reaches the next layer faster than the other, the gate at the second layer will transiently respond to the wrong state of input signals. One characteristic of the designed three-input AND gate is that the existence of aTc can evidently increase the output. A comparison between set [110] and [001] will shed light on this point. The transmission of aTc signal doesn't have as much layers as IPTG or Ara. Our software presets same parameters for same gates and biologists can employ their experience to fine tune parameters to fit in different situations. The result shows the transient errors.
Especially when we switch the state [111] to [000], a well-behaving gene circuit should ensure that the output will switch off quickly. Thus one protocol of parameter selection is that the decay rate of protein or small RNA, especially those functioning as a medium, should be higher than corresponding transcription and translation rates.
PART 3
In this part, we will design a more complicated logic circuits and show that our simulation fits the original truth table well.

BGU_Israel,2013,Team:BGU Israel#Bricks_-_-_TEXT.html," point of transition between communal and Darwinian evolution paradigms and subsequently sustained by the code’s inertia. Furthermore, in the limited scope of laboratory-directed evolution, which concerns only one or few specific functions over a short time rather than general organismal fitness over thousands or millions of years, one can easily envision a selective advantage conferred by additional amino acids. Because the templated assembly of polypeptides from mRNA on the ribosome establishes a direct link between genes (information) and proteins (phenotype), UAA mutagenesis methodology can easily be adapted to the evolution of proteins with novel or enhanced function.[8]
Conclusion
We hope that by characterizing and adding these important natural parts to the iGEM registry we will open new options for iGEM teams in particular and the SynBio community in general.
Additional natural parts
We added two additional new biobricks: Assembling parts to create a new DNA strand always requires taking into account all the restriction sites that exists on each part. Not always is it possible to assemble specific parts for they may contain overlapping restriction sites which do not enable to ""cut and paste"" between them. In order to overcome this obstacle, there is a need for expanding the selection of options for each part. We contributed to this issue by adding two new parts, though with similar activity to existing ones but with a different sequence. Both parts are a common antibiotic resistance: 1. BBa_K1223003 - kanamycin resistance gene (promoter + CDS) 2. BBa_K1223011 - ampR translational unit (ampicillin resistance CDS + promoter)

For carrying out the                         digestion to check if desired fragment is inside the                         plasmid it is necessary to mix up the followingnext                         components in a 200 ul Eppendorf.

The gel is made                             with agarose powder, TAE buffer 1X and ethidium                             bromide. It is necessary to adjust the amount of                             agarose to get the desired gel concentration. For                             example, with 1g of agarose / 100 mL of TAE 1X, the                             gel concentration will be 1%. The ethidium bromide                             concentration is 1:1000 in TAE Buffer (In the                             previous example, 1 μL is needed).

Newcastle,2013,Team:Newcastle#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," computational tools that utilise Computer Intelligence has the potential to extend the scale of possible designs, providing the framework for genome-scale engineering.  Work on the automated design of simple devices will be the basis for research into the full or partial automation of the full Synthetic Biology process. Important to this will be investigating the role of programming languages in defining high-level design specifications, how they can best abstract the complexity of the underlying biology, and how they can usefully incorporate computer intelligence algorithms and representations of genetic parts.
Sarah Shapiro
Hello! My name is Sarah and I am a 2nd year Ph.D student at Newcastle University. My work focuses on the gram negative Bacteroides class, which are prominent members of the human intestinal flora. I use a traditional biochemistry “bottom up” approach to elucidating how these endogenous bacteria recognise and metabolise complex carbohydrates from the intestinal environment by both characterising target proteins in vitro and through creating strains with genetic mutations. I am acting as an informal advisor to this year’s iGEM team to answer questions about general lab practice and strategies. I competed in iGEM for the University of St Andrews in 2010 and acted as an informal advisor to the subsequent year’s team. iGEM was a fantastic opportunity for me as both a competitor and advisor and it has been very rewarding for me to take part as an advisor for the Newcastle team this year.
Sungshic Park
I am a PhD student in synthetic biology. At crossroads between molecular biology and engineering, synthetic biology is a science trying to crack the code of life by building it. I want to understand how DNA governs many facets of biological life forms from microscopic regulations at the cellular level to such macroscopic phenomena as senescence, cancer, intelligence and self-awareness. I want to pursue research on building cellular machineries that can perform “simple” defined tasks. Ultimately, I want to design a framework genome that would serve as a platform for programming microbes or cellular machines.  In fact, building such a synthetic genome is a reality still far into the future. Currently, I am set out for an interim research goal: given a mathematical model of a synthetic genetic circuit, determine the what and how of in vivo measurements in terms of resolving discrepancies between the model and the world. This research calls for other enabling studies such as microfluidics, molecular quantification and directed evolution. I have background both in computing and biochemistry. I have worked on various projects involving robotics, artificial intelligence, process control, neural cell recording, animal behaviour measurement and molecular biology. Some of the species worked on include UNIX posix, Linux"

Human Practices Overview
To See A Society
Encouraged by the rapid Life Sciences development in Lithuania and our team’s previous achievements, we decided that it was meaningful to share our experience with the younger generation. Visiting schools, inviting pupils to visit Vilnius University Life Sciences Center and introducing SynDrop to them helped us not only to reveal but also clarify our own attitude towards synthetic biology. The discussion that we have organised during the DNA Day’s celebration has become a great inspiration to search for a creative approach to implement our project’s idea and to make it more public-friendly.

Description
Passing on the Knowledge to the Younger Generation
Excited by the possibilities synthetic biology has to offer, our team aimed to involve younger generation in this novel field of science by educating them in schools, during pupil-olympiads, and meetings of other societies.
Our team members continued the tradition of previous Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM teams and held lectures for students in different schools across the country. During these visits scholars had an opportunity to learn the main principles of synthetic biology and laboratory work bearing in mind SynDrop project as an example. Also, high-school students have visited our laboratory in Vilnius University Life Sciences Center and implemented their knowledge into practice, e.g. learning how to balance a centrifuge or using Burker camera in order to calculate cells.
Additionally, we delegated our member Valentas to represent our team in organising the 51st LitBO (Lithuanian Biology Olympiad) and its bootcamp where students were preparing for the International Biology Olympiad. He was responsible for giving lectures about fundamental biological principles and synthetic biology, as well as planning experiments for students.
Our instructor Auksė held a lecture for Turing School students (13-18 yrs. of age) who planned to become future inventors and leaders of the IT sector. She delineated the possibilities of synthetic biology, revealed future applications of CRISPR/Cas system, and most importantly described ways of how IT skills could be applied in bioinformatics and above mentioned fields.
DNA Day's Celebration
Looking for new ideas and methods to educate school children and hear their thoughts on synthetic biology and our project, we found a spectacular occasion in the calendar. Our team organised an event marking the 65th anniversary of the day in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick published paper in

Prospects
Computational modelling has often been sought to solve and predict biological phenomena, and it has notably been applied to bacterial behaviour simulation.   As it is now, almost all iGEM teams use bacteria to engineer their bio-bricks and to make each year even more wonderful projects for the iGEM community. However, we also all have to keep in mind the safety issues, and confine our bacteria properly to avoid letting them spread in the laboratory.
How could we estimate a risk of contamination?
It was while considering this matter that the iGEM Bordeaux Team developed a simulation model aiming to :
estimate the number of bacteria that could proliferate on a lab bench.
see what percentage of these bacteria were able to maintain their plasmid.
This work will be developed in different sections. We will first justify our approach of the simulation, then describe our model and explain bacterial growth and plasmid transmission. We will finally make an assessment of our model, explain our approach to validate it and give our perspectives for this project.
1.  Multi-agent modelling
The definition
In informatics, a multi-agent system aims to represent intelligent agents which interact with one another and with a specific environment. In our case, our agents are bacteria, dispersed randomly on a grid (our environment).                The bacteria are submitted to successive actions such as growth or division, and have specific attributes such as a an individual cell mass, or more importantly a plasmid.               Our model aims to provide friendly users with information about bacterial growth. If you wish to evaluate a risk of contamination, or to experiment with parameters to characterise bacterial plasmid transfer or plasmid maintenance, you are welcome to test it out!
Why have we chosen this model?
As stated before, our modelling choice was to implement a multi-agent systems. Multi-agent modelling is frequently used to model biological phenomena. It stands out against"

It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate CNF in response to an amber stop codon. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .
K2020050
- tRNA synthetase specific for tyrosine and UAG codon in E. coli → Y-RS This is the wild type tyrosyl synthetase derived from Methanococcus janaschii to be used as an orthogonal tRNA synthetase in E. coli. It can be used in combination with the cognate tRNA BBa_K2020042 to incorporate tyrosine in response to an amber stop codon. Incorporation of ncAA with amber codon supression: Photo-cleavable non-canonical amino acids offer the opportunity to control protein function on a non-invasive basis. Working with non-canonical amino acids requires an additional, orthogonal pair of a tRNA and a cognate synthetase i.e. which does not crossreact with the endogenous tRNA/synthetase pairs. The tRNA's anticodon contains was mutated to an amber stop anticodon. Hence, it is possible to incorporate an amino acid at a chosen position in a protein via amber codon suppression. While working with amber codon supression, the Methanococcus wild type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is present even in minimal media. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of (n)cAA: Most synthetases are used in low copy plasmids (e.g. pACYC). The tRNA and the synthetase have to be assembled in a low copy plasmid, each one with its own promoter and only one terminator. Recognition between tRNA and (n)cAA-synthetases derived from Mj: The Methanococcus janaschii wild type tyrosyl tRNA consists of two arms: Firstly, the acceptor-minihelix, where the ncAA will be attached to the 3' end and secondly, the anticodon containg arm. Synthetases interact mainly with the acceptor minihelix of the tRNA. Due to the lack of a recognizing element within the anticodon-containing section, a mutation of an anticodon base has a comparatively small effect on the aminoacylation efficiency and may"

WashU_StLouis,2014,Team:WashU StLouis#Project#light_-_-_TEXT.html,"Meanwhile, once the other half of our iGem team gets nif cluster working in E. coli, we should be able to swap out the fluorescent protein for the nif cluster in our plasmid to regulate the nif cluster in E. coli with light. In dark conditions, the switch will be “off”, namely there should be fluorescence; and in the light, the system should be repressed. We expect to see higher levels of repression with our hybrid promoter and greater dynamic fold change.
Our project goals are to design a hybrid promoter that incorporate the regulatory elements of PcpcG2 with those of Ptrc1O. Then we will transition to the more complex CRISPRi mechanism by creating a plasmid containing the basic trc1O promoter that reversibly blocks transcription of EYFP. The overarching plan is to be able to regulate the nif cluster with light, so nitrogenase is only expressed during the dark, which mimics Cyanothece 51142. If successful, this project would help immensely when eventually integrating nitrogen fixation into plants by improving efficiency. During the day, when photosynthesis occurs (with a lot of oxygen as byproduct) nitrogenase would not be produced, and therefore not wasted; while during the night, nitrogen fixation can occur. This creates a temporal regulatory system complementary to Cyanothece 51142’s native circadian regulation of controlling nitrogen fixation (through metabolic pathways), increasing the overall chance of success.

By integrating the light regulation from S. 6803 into E. coli, we are transitioning to the next step in our big picture, which would be to get the system working in the cyanobacteria S. 6803. Eventually we want our system to be able to work in chloroplasts of plants, so nitrogen fixation will be able to occur in the same location where the most energy is produced without having to worry so much about the oxygen byproduct of photosynthesis.
Summer PROPOSED Work Flow
Week 1: Familiarize self with standard laboratory methods and procedures. Design primers for transcriptional units and plasmid backbone.
Week 2-3: Test light regulation in PBJ003 (driven by basic PcpcG2). Use positive and negative controls as well to ensure system is working as intended with EYFP fluorescence as our gene expression.

As the stability of our design relies heavily on having a balance in transcription/translation rates and inducer/promoter interactions from different components of the construct, it is necessary to understand how each component behaves in order to fine tune the construct for optimal performance. Therefore, we made smaller constructs to characterize each individual component in terms of promoter strengths, cross-talk between repressors and non-target promoters,"

We grew this stool by crating a hexagon mold from recycled cardboard and then stuffing the stool with aspen chips coated with mycelium. Within two weeks we had grown a fully functional stool! Images of us crafting, baking, and testing the tool can be seen below.
Step 1: Grow mycelium on yard waste
Step 2: After ~1 week of growth, transfer mycelium to mold.
Step 3: Let mycelium grow; pictured above is after 1 week.

However, in order to have a holistic approach, we also wanted to understand what were the challenges of introducing this material to the public, something we questioned these pioneers on. They all echoed similar statements regarding some social resistance to the use of fungus in products. And perhaps the even greater challenge is shifting policy to favor the production of more sustainable products over cheaper, more environmentally damaging products. However, as Eben Bayer noted, opinions about mycelium are shifting. What was at first perceived as strange and alien, is now the center of growing excitement and research. People are thrilled by mycelium and all the potential it has to help create a better, more sustainable future.

Both these designers have done work exploring the potential of mycelium in an architectural setting.
Maurer emphasized the sustainable nature of the material, and their relative affordability--he speculated that some of the structures he has designed using mycelium would only cost around $8000 to produce"

Summary
In our dry lab, to improve the binding affinity, we have redesigned 3 receptor binding domains:
1.VEGF-scFv
2.KDR Ig domain 3
3.D-Dimer scFv
Also, we have redesigned the DNA sequence of the tTA promoter, to enhance downstream expression.

Methods
Computational macromolecule design
Figure 1. Computational macromolecule design
Aiming at enhancing the binding affinity of the signal molecule and the receptor by sequence redesigning, we should firstly make it clear:
WHAT DO WE HAVE?
To simulate the macromolecule interaction, the structure information is necessary. At best, the crystal structure of the signal-receptor complex is already tested by experiment. That means the interface of those two molecules is known, the interaction of the two molecules can be calculated, and further protein designing will be carried out. If there is only individual structures of the signal molecule and the receptor, we can use RosettaDock to simulate the binding process of the two molecules. If there are only amino acid sequences of those two molecules, we can still predict the structure by large-scale computations. If there is a homologous structure (for example, antibodies), this operation would be easier. Otherwise, modeling only with sequence is still a tough work.
Next step is to design the sequence with the complex structure. If the receptor is an antibody, or have Immunoglobulins as its binding site, we can use RosettaAntibodyDesign, an automatic application that designs antibodies with Monte Carlo method. Another thing we should remember is that before antibody design"
