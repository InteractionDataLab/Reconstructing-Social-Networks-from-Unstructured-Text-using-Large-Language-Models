Our wet lab team decided to target a few species in each of these groups when choosing the bacteriocins we would use.
Timeline - Ideation
[June - August]
OUR PROGRESS: Just from preliminary interviewing, we realized that there was a dire need for the prevention and detection of bovine mastitis. Our wet lab team started work on a bacteriocin treatment, choosing genes based on Dr. Nydam's advice. Our product development team concentrated on prevention, and narrowed their ideas down to a multi-purpose milking shell with different modules: an automatic post-dip disinfectant, a flow rate sensor, a cold shock, a temperature sensor, and a UV sterilizer. Our CS/ECE subteam focused on the detection of mastitis and created an app with several features including: a resource for symptoms, a somatic cell counter with a microscope attachment, a data analysis section, and a cost calculator. We brought these concepts to experts in the ideation phase to get feedback and constantly improve our designs. QUESTION: What do you like and what would you change about our product? FINDINGS: Experts were receptive to bacteriocins and had no problem with the safety of it. The temperature sensor, UV light, iodine spray, and cold shock were all seen as important modules, but not all farmers wanted all of the modules. The flow sensor was not needed, and the app was most useful on big farms that use traditional milking processes.

Milkrite
Johnson Creek, WI
Milkrite , a division of Avon Rubber and Plastics, is the world’s largest provider of dairy rubber wear. We reached out to Tom Votny. During our conversation, we learned about the current state of the milking machine market, what technologies had already been developed for shells and liners, how products were typically tested, and how large companies conduct their market research. Tom emphasized that farmer feedback is essential to making sure that our project as a whole succeeds in the marketplace. We began contacting as many farms as we could to gather that feedback.

With sketches in hand, we went to the Muranda Cheese Company, a 90-cow farm located in Waterloo, NY.  We talked to Blane Murray, who told us that our idea as a whole was valuable because it includes a preventative measure for bovine mastitis. We showed him our proposed sketches for the milking shell with"

Agroinfiltration protocol consists of:
Centrifuge the cultures 15 min 3000 rpm and discard supernatant.
5 mL of agroinfiltration solution per culture. 100 mL of agroinfiltration solution were composed of 10 mL MES 100mM (pH 5.6), 1 mL MgCl2 1M and 100 μL acetosyringone solution 200 mM (19.62 mg, DMSO 500 μL; prepare freshly). Mix it with the vortex. If the culture is still turbid, add a bit more of agroinfiltration sollution. Put it in the (rodillos) for two hours.
Measure the OD. The optimum OD for agroinfiltration is 0.2. If it is too high adjust the concentration with more agroinfiltration solution.
Mix the cultures, keeping all of them in the same proportions.
Proceed to agroinfiltration.

In order to actually calculate the silencing probability, only the frequency ratios \(q_{x_i^n}^{eff}\) and \(q_{x_i^n}^{inf}\) of the individual nucleotides at positions 1 to 19 are missing. These could be taken from the same publication from Takasaki as the calculations (Takasaki, 2009).
For each nucleotide, the probability of occurrence was determined for each position of the siRNA. Different models were taken into account in the calculation. First of all, the occurrence of the different nucleotides at positions 1 to 19 can be considered as independent of each other. The probabilities for each position are then calculated independently. However, the occurrences of the nucleotides can also be considered as dependent of each other. This means that the occurrence of a nucleotide depends on the nucleotide at the position before. For the calculation of dependent probabilities, the Simple Markow Model was used. It has been found that the resulting silence probability is most accurate when the frequency ratios of the effective siRNAs are calculated dependent and the frequency ratios of the ineffective siRNAs are calculated independent. All frequency ratios can be looked up here . In combination with the frequency ratios it is now possible to calculate the silencing probability for the 19 bp long binding site of siRNAs.
siRNA selection for RNAi and repression of translation
The procedures of siRNA selection for both mechanisms, RNAi and repression of translation, are very similar. Thus the first two modules, RNAi and siRNA, are similar. First the mRNA binding sequence is determined using the rational design and the Ui-Tei rules. In the next step, the silencing probability is determined. At the end, the corresponding overhangs and scaffolds are added to the 19 nt long binding sequence to form the mature siRNA.

Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar, etc., increases the density and survival time of them, as well as reduces the flow of bacteria into natural environment. Our team produces immobilized E. coli by embedding the sensor bacteria in polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads.(UCAS-APPLICATION-DESIGN-1)
We planned to breed our immobilized bacteria in fish pond water, but as our analysis of fish pond water shows, in nutrition in fish pond water is limited and cannot meet the demand of our engineered bacteria. Therefore, we changed our plan and decided to breed bacteria in our nitrogen limited M9 culture medium, mixed with fish pond water. Nevertheless, our technique in immobilization might have further use since we are still seeking for a better solution.
Pumping System
The equipment contains a detection system, a pumping system, a control system and a battery. In order to properly inject water, a peristaltic pump is employed to inject 1.5mL pool water into the detecting cell, and another pump will pump it out once the detection process finishes. The second pump delivers the water to a cup and, considering the potential danger of escaping bacteria, a microporous filter at the top of the cup.
Detection System
Detection part mainly consists of a detecting cell, a LED and a photoresistor. In our first plan, we planned to applied bacterial immobilizing technique. Firstly the polyvinyl alcohol/sodium alginate (PVA/SA) beads with immobilized E. coli soak in the water in the detecting cell for approximately 5 hours. Thus the promoter begins to respond to the concentration of nitrogen, and then RFP gene is expressed if the concentration is below the threshold. A 585nm-595nm LED is applied to excite red fluorescence and a photoresistor are used to detect the fluorescence. The detecting cell is the only consumable item in the whole equipment. In our second plan, we will breed our bacteria in nitrogen limited M9 culture medium for approximately 5 hours, then inject the fish pond water to mix with the culture medium. It will take 2-3 hours before the GFP being expressed and detected.
Control System
To ensure that the hardware perform properly, a control system was designed. We used a small circuit board to control the relays and the Bluetooth module. The relays’ opening or closure makes different parts in the equipment start or stop working at proper time. And the Bluetooth module sends the information of"

Primers were designed for making BioBricks out of the separate genes from  the nisin operon. For this, the sequence of the transposon Tn5307 was used, a transposon that contains the nisin operon, and of  which the sequence is known.1 This sequence is close to the sequence of the transposon Tn5276, the transposon which will form the template for making the new BioBricks. The primers for making a BioBrick out of PNisI with a RBS were based on a sequence found in a research paper that documented the identification of this promoter.2 The list of primersequences can be found in the first table at the bottom of this page. It was decided to combine the genes NisR and NisK as one BioBrick and NisF, NisE and NisG as one BioBrick, because these genes are related in function or work together.
 
There were also primers designed for making a BioBrick out of the sfGFP(Bs), the primersequences can be found at second table at the bottom of this page. This sfGFP was originally optimized for Bacillus subtilis. When it was tested in Lactococcus lactis, the sfGFP(Bs) was shown to perform really well in L. lactis as well.3

A collection of constitutive promoters was also desirable for the toolbox. We decided to use the CP promoter collection and test it in Lactococcus lactis, that was BioBricked by the Uppsala iGEM team of 2013. The CP promoters are registered as CP1 , CP8 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 and CP44 . These parts were ordered from iGEM HQ, except for CP8 as for this promoter the sequencing was inconsistent. The promoters were sent by iGEM HQ using Escherichia coli containing pSB1C3 with the promoter as insert. E. coli was grown and the plasmids with the promoter were isolated.

Penn_State,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," codons will lead to higher expression of proteins is based on the idea that cells have become optimized through evolution to efficiently translate proteins necessary to their survival. Based on this assumption, the most efficient codons will appear more frequently in the overall genome. The fast and slow codon differentiation relies on a very similar analysis. Fast codons are defined as those with a high correlation between frequency and the high TIR regions of the genome, whereas slow codons are those with a high correlation between frequency and the low TIR regions of the genome. This is an extension of the common/rare distinction, but is more specific, as certain parts of the genome with low TIR could possibly code for proteins where high expression (and thus fast translation elongation) is not necessary. By analyzing the codon usage profile of individual regions of the genome with different TIR, it is theorized that the fast and slow codons could be used to artificially control the expression of a particular gene through codon optimization. In some instances, the same codon is used for multiple optimization plans (fast, common, ect) to specify a certain amino acid. Because of this, some genes have instances of similarity, where the same codon is used in the same position.
Result of common/fast optimization is two coding sequences that may be similar, as in some instances a codon may be both common and fast.
The slow insertion time design was based solely on recently designed software which analyzes the biophysical phenomena that underlie translation elongation. Thus, the difference between the slow insertion time GFP and the others is that it is optimized based on the results of biophysical modeling instead of codon usage profile, and thus, on understanding of the physics of translation elongation verses the understanding that evolution optimizes organisms for high efficiency. The overall hypothesis of this research can now be fully understood.
This hypothesis is that the maximum translation rate capacity is due to translation elongation becoming the rate limiting step of protein synthesis, and that it could be controlled by increasing the translation elongation rate, through codon optimization of the CDS. Essentially, the presence of more common or fast codons is hypothesized to raise the maximum translation rate capacity, while the presence of more slow, rare, or slow insertion time codons will lower it.
To test this hypothesis, five variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP), one each of purely fast, slow, rare, and common codons, as well as one with codons having the slowest insertion time, were designed and constructed. The TIR of each variant GFP was then varied by attaching ribosome binding sites"

As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered HNS and HNST108I genes into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final constructs after this cloning are; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNS  and T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-HNST108I. Besides, a constitutive promoter called LacI promoter and LacI protein sequence in front of that, found on peT45-b vector’s another part. It is obvious that this part is IPTG-dependent, so Western Blot can be performed easily with the help of His Tag.
As the mutant version of HNS shows us that change of even a single amino acid can be effecting protein expression, we considered His-tag(6 amino acid long) could effect their expression too. So we planned to clone them into PSB1C3-T7 plasmid, which we designed. By doing this, we will have the proteins synthesized in high amounts with the help of T7 but there won’t be any additional amino acids. We expect to have better results from our experiments.
PotB59/PomA
We aimed to increase motility and torque force of E. Coli flagella when we knock-out its natural rotator system proteins MotA and MotB and replace them with PotB59/PomA systems. As we needed these two proteins together, we combined them on the same biobrick when we ordered the gene sequences. In gene designing, we considered producing onlyone RNA for these two genes but having two different proteins when this RNA translated. In addition to this, to have a controllable system, LacI protein attachable Lac operator was added between this sequence and T7promoter sequence. We searched to find a vector which can lay down all those conditions and found out that peT-45 expression vector is useful. When we ordered our genes, we put RFC10 prefix site on 3’ end of PotB59/PomAgene sequence and also BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning them into peT-45. We added RFC10 suffix site on 5’ end of the same gene sequences and also XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site for cloning to peT-45 vector, again.
As shown above,we planned to clone the ordered PotB59/PomA gene sequence into peT-45 vector by using BamHI and XhoI enzymes. Final construct after this cloning is; respectively T7 promoter-Lac operator(LacO)-HisTag-PotB"

H1-NMR was performed to detect rubber produced by our bacteria in comparison with a commercially purchased polyisoprene standard as the positive control and wild type cells E. coli as the negative control. The results show strong indication that we have indeed made rubber-producing bacteria (Fig. 1). A second round of   H1-NMR stated that the result was reproducible, and therefore we proudly announce that our CPS bacteria produce rubber; Bacteriorganic Rubber! Bacteriorganic Rubber!

Optimization of MEP pathway
We attempted to optimize the MEP pathway by overexpressing the genes (DxsDXS1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase and IspG IspG1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase) which our model predicted to be rate limiting. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in building a construct containing ispG, and therefore we could not test the consequences of overexpressing this particular gene. However, we did successfully build a construct that overexpressed Dxs. In order to verify whether IPP and DMAPP concentrations increased by overexpression of the dxs gene, we performed gas chromatography (GC), though we were unable to prove or disprove the hypothesis. the hypothesis.

Controllable constructs
Figure 2. An important part of the design of our constructs was the capability to control the expression of genes converting the fast growing bacteria to rubber producing bacteria. We therefore placed the expression of Dxs under the control of the lac-promoter and the expression of HRT2 under the control of the ara-promoter. We successfully proved that addition of IPTG induces the expression of Dxs, and addition of arabinose induces the expression of HRT2 (Fig. 2). A cell viability experiment showed that the rubber producing bacteria were not growth impaired or in other ways toxically affected as otherwise expected. This surprising result might be due to the low amounts of rubber produced in the cells. Nevertheless"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html," set up a meeting with the team members working on the biology part of the project to go over every detail in the biological processes in the system. From now on, we will have meetings with Cesar every week. Next time one of the topics to discuss is wetware schematics.
Week 15: August 11th - August 15th
Since the idea of measuring three chambers (3 colours) with one sensor measurement does not seem to be working, we decided it would be better if we measure each chamber individually by sliding the sensor over the three chambers. On Monday, we had a meeting with the machine shop and discussed the change in the design. Measuring one chamber in a time will also allow us to use just one colour (one reporter). On Monday we also had a meeting with John Shelley, a lab technician at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Schulich School of Engineering, regarding our circuits and Arduino code. He recommended we use 0.1 µF capacitors for the sensor and for the LCD display to avoid sudden changes of current that might be causing our sensor and the display to shut down. He also helped us to get a better understanding of how the sensor operates and suggested we spend more time trying to understand the LCD display too because it seems to be the limiting factor in the circuit at this point. We were able to find YouTube tutorials that explained the way LCD operates and explained the code too. We were able to get a better understanding of both the colour sensor and the LCD display codes. This allowed us to optimize the code for the circuit where the sensor and the LCD display are used together.
We also started writing functions that would analyse the red, green, and blue components from the sensor and output what colour is present on the screen rather than just outputting all of the components on the screen. However, we run into a problem with the LCD display as it stopped functioning properly. Most likely it was burned down, so we are looking to get a new display. This week we are also doing another plate reader experiment. After graphing the results of the last plate reader experiment, we saw that the RFP plate count was constant at different concentrations meaning bacteria was present but it did not grow much over night. This time we changed the set up of the experiment: we grew bacteria for about 3 hours before putting it into the plate reader to get it into the log growth phase. This time we are doing the experiment with E. coli culture transformed with RFP, E. coli culture transformed with RFP, B. subtilis culture transformed with RFP. This we are also continuing"

Some of them proposed steps that would make them feel better about trying a new therapy, mainly including Studies to prove its effectiveness, full disclosure, open communication, recommendation by a doctor. Phactory is already working on realizing those steps. We are in contact with phage therapy institutions in Belgium and with doctors from the university hospital, who are actively supporting us in realizing those goals.
Biokitchen Opening
The first time we got in touch with scientists working on bacteriophage therapy was during the opening event of the BioKitchen laboratory in Munich organized by Rüdiger Trojok. This modern lab offers a well-equipped place for students and start-ups with innovative ideas to perform biotechnological experiments. The central topics of the opening event of the BioKitchen covered the emerging antibiotics crisis and the opportunities of bacteriophage therapy as an alternative treatment. Therefore, attending this event was a major opportunity for us to get in touch with experts working in the field of bacteriophages.

Karin Mölling
At the opening event we had the opportunity to demonstrate the assembly of our bacteriophages in a hands-on session with other participants. There we had the pleasure to meet phage experts from the Eliava Institute in Georgia (Europe) and Dr. Jean-Paul Pirnay from the Queen Astrid Military Hospital in Belgium . They gave us helpful insights into the practical application of bacteriophage therapy. After fruitful discussions we refocused our project to manufacture therapeutic phages with our affordable cell-free system.
Conference in Belgium
One highlight on our journey was the meeting with several phage experts in Brussels. The goal of this meeting was the creation of a team of scientists and industrial partners to overcome the most recent problems of bacteriophage therapy.
We were invited to build a scientific consortium with:
Dr. Jean-Paul Pirnay | Queen Astrid Military Hospital Belgium
Dr. Cedric Lood | KU Leuven
Prof. Yves Briers | Ghent University
Dr. Michiel Stock | Ghent University
Dr. An Van den Bossche | Sciensano
During the meeting we convinced the experts that we can contribute substantially to the safety and efficacy of bacteriophage manufacturing. Furthermore, we learned about Good Manufacturing Practice and the magistral preparation of bacteriophages for therapeutic application in Belgium.

Looking at previous projects by other iGem teams, we discovered that there was another iGEM project from the Calgary team that used Quorum sensing extensively for detection and destruction. We informed Dr. Grose and did some more research into possible projects that have already been done that are similar to ours. Since 2008 there has been at least one project every year that has used quorum sensing in some sense. Most used V. fischeri and only one used V. cholerae, but their project wasn’t to the extent that we are aiming for as they simply transferred the quorum sensing system, while we want to not only transfer this signal system, but use it to trigger a new reaction. We decided to look into the other projects more and  decide on Friday whether or not we will continue with our cholera research.
Transformation Protocol:
The following is an overview of the E. coli transformation protocol that we will be using:
Eppendorfs of DH5alpha cells---thaw on ice
Mix 2-5ul of plasmid and keep on ice for 20-30minutes
Heat shock for 1 min @ 42 Degrees Celsius
Cool eppendorf on ice for 2-5 minutes
Add 0.5 mL LB and incubate at 37 Degrees Celsius for 30 minutes (select for AMP)
Plate on selective media (LB-AMP)
Research: Michael also read the following research articles on the quorum sensing system in Vibrio cholerae to gain a better understanding of this system:
Hoch, J. Two-Component and Phosphorelay Signal Transduction. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000, 3, 165–170.

Week 7: June 10 - June 14
This week involved transforming the part BBa_K648013 received by request from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. This part is a GFP reporter that contains the RFC 25 standard prefix and suffix. This prefix and suffix will allow us to create a fusion protein with GFP and the coils to be used in our testing purposes. After successful transformation of the part the plasmid was isolated via miniprep and its presence was confirmed through a restriction digest. The part was also sequence confirmed to indeed verify that there were no unexpected changes to the nucleotide sequence.
Week 8: June 17 - June 21
Research efforts were devoted to the Ferritin system during this week. Flooding in the city of Calgary interrupted the planned lab work for the β-lactamase and coil group.
Week 9: June 24 - June 28
The first BioBrick construction was attempted this week. The goal was to put the RFC25 fusion standard GFP ( BBa_K648013 ) behind the IPTG inducible LacI promoter (with a ribosome binding site) ( BBa_J04500 ). This construction however did not yield any colonies after ligation and transformation were performed. It is recommended the next time this construction be performed that the amount of vector DNA added to the ligation reaction be increased from 5 µL to 7 µL to correct for the dilution of the vector DNA during the Antarctic phosphatase treatment performed. BBa_J04500 in pSB1C3 was transformed this week so that we could have this part available with a chloramphenicol resistant plasmid. The colony PCR for this part was successful (Figure 2) ergo overnight cultures were prepared on the weekend so that a miniprep of the plasmid could be performed the next week.
Figure 2. A colony PCR of potential colonies containing the part J04500. Standard BioBrick primers were used. Bands between 400 and 500-bp indicate the successful amplification of these parts. +C indicates a positive control making use of the RFP coding device J04450 which has an expected size of about 1300-bp when using BioBrick primers. Some non-specific amplification is seen within this control. The gel was 1% agarose and was run at 100 V for an hour.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
The overnight cultures produced on the weekend were successfully miniprepped producing DNA stocks of the LacI promoter BBa_J04500"

OR logic transitions are transitions which require a single input species or multiple input species but do not require all. More complex relations are made between the input species and the input transitions table.
Input transition and species interactions are captured using a separate relationship table. Using this separate input transition species relationship table allows for more flexibility when describing the boolean logic at a given input transition. The same species may interact as a repressor or as activator depending on what input transition it encounters. Therefore, the table attribute repression gives a true or false statement under the repression column describing the role of that species in a given operon activation. All complex logic types, NAND; NOR; XOR; and XNOR, are captured solely by using the atomic logic types, AND; OR; and NOT.  So a NAND input transition would be represented as an AND inside the input transition table with repressor molecules as the interacting species and TRUE values in the repression columns of these species.
Operons also have associated output transitions which describe the events and species produced after operon activation. These transitions unlike input transitions have very simple logic, namely IF. The reason for this is, that once an operon is activated then the production of the protein will inevitably occur. Just like input transitions and species, output transitions and species also have a relationship table with multiple species mapping to a single output transition when applicable. This illustrates the idea that operons are a sequence of genes that when activated, transcribe mRNA and protein species.

So, the promoters are unlocked and the green fluorescence protein is produced.
Genetic route about the detection of antibiotic
Feature of the level: The level asks us to construct the biological detector for detecting antibiotic in the milk we drink every day. The background is beautiful grasslands with clouds as the platforms for jumping. However, in this relaxing environment, more enemies which have more complexed moving routes appear, symbolizing the antibiotic in milk which breaks the quality of nice stuff. Players need to jump in more difficult and complexed platforms to collect the genetic fragments while avoid enemies.
Route design of the forth level
The fifth level: Artemisinin synthesis
The principle of level: Malaria is a disease transmitted by the malaria parasite and it is the parasitic disease which happened most frequently to human, resulting in more than 500 million cases and 1 million deaths per year. Artemisinin is the most effective antimalarial drug, but the artemisinin extracted from plants is few and expensive. However, scientists can make artificial artemisinin according to the knowledge of synthetic biology, and this kind of artemisinin is more cheap and effective to cure the malaria.
Genetic route about Artemisinin synthesis
Features of the level: This is the most difficult level in the game. There is weapon system added in the level. Under the instruction of Lee, players need to avoid a few enemies and then jump to then platform which in the middle of the scene and obtain the weapon. Then players should use the weapon to wipe out enemies without touching them. When the player kills an enemy, the column will introduce the history about how human beings fought against malaria.
Screenshot of the fifth level
The sixth level: Detecting arsenic ions.
Principle of the level: We use the promoters which can sense the function of arsenic ions in the water to design biological sensor. The promoters can change cellular metabolic response when there are arsenic ions existing, and change the PH of the solution in the end. Theoretically, the minimum arsenic detecting limit of this arsenic ion biosensor is 5 ppb.

Overview
Designed specifically for biological research, BioPano is a software platform targeted for visualisation of biological relationships as well as cooperative net-building. You can set up your own network of biological relationship by adding information about genetic regulation and metabolic system to the network we already provided for you. Also, the software allows you to explore the links among the substances by just several clicks, and you can even look into the details of the interaction between the exogenous gene and the host. What is even more exciting is that our software will end your loneliness and frustration in research, since it is providing you with cloud cooperating system so that you can view massive amounts of resources in databases, together with build up groups to share information and set up mutual network with others.
Motivation
In recent years, people has made a lot of remarkable achievements  in synthetic biology. However, scientists are often faced with  many unpredictable problems when carrying out experiments.  Each kind of biological substance is inextricably linked to the  biological environment to which it belongs, so we have to consider  a question: Can we attain the desired goal, if we simply follow the traditional ideas of synthetic biology and avoid the problem merely by engineering?
A synthetic biologist, Chris Voigt, has successfully transferred a Toggle Switch, which usually works in the Bacillus  subtilis, into E. coli. Unfortunately, it did not function properly. In  fact, in experiments, due to the unexpected interactions between  BioBrick and the host, it is very common that the designed path do  not work as anticipated.
In fact, the life system is so complex that there are many sorts of  biological substance to support it with complex interations in it.  In order to understand a phenomenon, we keep using new and  sophisticated methods to refine our research and to explore every  detail of life. However, if we widen our perspective"

It is really fascinating to take a comparison between the past me and the person I am now. Though still frustrated with not-so-ideal results, I am skilled with the operation in our lab and surrounded by the passion about the competition and biochemistry much stronger when I decided to join the team.
Hi, I’m Yifan WEI and I am going to be a 3rd year student majored in Biology next semester. To fight in our team is a great glory to me. Maybe I can be called “Main Tank” in our lab work. I am the one who has been working in the lab for the longest time in our team and the one who obtained the most techniques in our team to aid the process of the experiment. I made my progress and was able to control the experiment independently. In the later period, I was even in charge of the characterization of the part “Bitter Pressure” without other teammates’ help.
Hi, here is Zhenlin ZHAO, I am primarily in charge of human practice. Games and Biochemistry are two of my favorite things in, probably, my whole life. In the middle of a discussion with the team, an idea struck me that computer game themed synthesis biology might be a perfect marriage between them and an efficient way to publicize the idea of iGEM. And then there born our iGEM game for human practice. Along the process of making this game, I have found not only so many interesting ideas and astonishing achievements of the iGEM precursors but also my passion in biochemistry.
Hi, I’m Pengji ZHOU and I am in my 3rd year of studying chemical engineering. What fascinate me most is the boundless possibilities existing in genetic engineering and how iGEM make it possible to gather numerous brilliant ideas all over the world. That is the main reason for my initially applying the team. But soon, I have found that our team is much more than that: the cooperation and encouragement is what keeps me and us holding on to our ultimate goal.
Hi, I am Wenming ZHU majored in chemical engineering. I am going to enjoy my 3rd year in Tshinghua University and how lucky I am to get the chance of being a team member in iGEM!

de novo assembly of the reporter plasmid pLA230
Each sample was prepared as a separate library using specific tags in the adapters for multiplexing. At first, mutations within the initial plasmid were identified. Moreover, we distinguished between sequencing errors and true mutations by including a control.
Library generation, sequencing and initial computation
We used plasmids from one of our reversion experiments as template for this sequencing experiment. Out of each sample a sequencing library was constructed prepared using the Illumina Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit . DNA fragments with a length between 500-1,000 bp were isolated. Subtracting the length of both terminal adapter, the DNA fragments contain 360 to 860 bp fragments derived from our plasmids.
Figure 1: Preperated MiSeq library analyzed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The results show a fragment length between 500 and 1,000 bp.
The sequencing revealed 2x300 nt (paired-end) reads. Reads were analyzed with FastQC showing ~10,000 reads per library with an average read length of 300 nt (Figure).  The average quality distribution of the reads (Figure) was continuously very high  until base 250.
Figure 2: Figure: Distribution of read length of the library and quality distribution of the reads pre trimming analyzed with FastQC.
To obtain only high quality reads we trimmed the reads with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014) by cutting off after four consecutive bases with a quality score lower than 25. The trimmed library was analyzed as well, consisting of X reads with an average length of 220 bp (Figure) and end-to-end quality higher than 25 (Figure). A quality score over 25 means an error probability of 0.0032 (Illumina 2014). The quality score of the whole trimmed library is around 38, resulting in an error probability of 0.00016. Assuming  a library size of 2.5×106 bp this leads to about 400 sequencing errors.
Figure 3: Distribution of read length of the library and quality distribution of the reads after trimming analyzed with FastQC.
The reads were mapped with CLC genomics workbench 9.5 to our plasmid references. The coverage and base distribution per position was calculated. However, it was not possible to assign the reads originating from the origin of replication initiation from the two different plasmids in some samples correctly, because both plasmid contain a very similar sequence.

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," and 4.4 fold higher expression than cell lysis by bead beating and French press respectively. These findings combined with the limited options of optimization for both bead beating and French press lysis as well as restricted potential for scaling up of bead beating, lead to the decision to focus our optimization efforts on sonication as lysis method.
Comparison of different cell lysis methods for cell extract preparation.
Cell lysis by sonication has two main parameters that can be varied: the amplitude, which correlates to the power emitted by the sonication device and cycle number, representing the total time of sonication. Based on Yong-Chan Kwon & Michael C. Jewett 2 we decided to use 10 s pulses with 15 s pause between pulses to prevent excessive heating of the sample.
Screening of different amplitudes and cycle numbers for sonication.
Our screening revealed that increase in amplitude as well as increase in cycle number leads to higher protein content. The TXTL test showed high fluorescence intensity only for settings with low cycle numbers. This indicates that prolonged sonication damages the cellular machinery, reducing its ability for protein expression.
The highest-performing extracts were those obtained by sonication with 4 cycles at 33 % amplitude and 5 cycles at 10 % amplitude. Therefore, we focused our next steps on further optimization of those settings.
Lysozyme
In the last step we made an effort to scale up the sonication step. Preliminary experiments (results not shown) indicated 4 mL as the maximal sample volume that could be lysed efficiently with the device we had at our disposal. As indicated in the publication by Yong-Chan Kwon & Michael C. Jewett the number of sonication cycles was increased in proportion to the increase of sample volume. The presented results shown in the figure below show that this approach was successful: Using higher sample volumes for sonication increased protein content and expression quality of the cell extract. This proves that upscaling of cell extract preparation with cell lysis by sonication is indeed feasible.
Comparison of cell lysis conditions: increase of sample volume and use of lysozyme.
Even though previous attempts by Shresta et al. 3 to use Lysozyme in cell extract preparation have been unsuccessful, we tested the effect of adding the cell-wall degrading enzyme at 1 mM concentration to the cell lysis reaction. Across all our experiments, lysozyme increased the efficiency of cell lysis for all tested settings. Moreover, the expression quality was likewise increased after Lysozyme addition, indicating that the remaining enzyme does not interfere with protein biosynthesis.

After explaining our project, we learned about their experiences with bionic research and their      public engagement. We received great feedback on how we could use what we already know from nature      in our project. Thereby, we i. A. realised that for our chemical approach to achieve muscle like      movement of the tissue, a molecular machine triggered by a voltage – as it is in all animals –      instead of light would be more effective. We also heard how they teach school classes about bionic      and connect with the public on this topic. After this very productive exchange, we explored the      interactive exhibition in the visitor centre, where we learned a lot about mechanisms in nature that      are used in technology. We realized, that the basic idea of bionic – making technology that      resembles nature – is the exact inverse of the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM – making biology      that resembles technology. This is precisely the reason why the combination of both should lead to a      successful implementation, as it combines what already works in nature with individual adjustments.      Our tour through the visitor centre ended with a very enjoyable performance of Nao, the sweetest      robot we have ever seen. Here, we were told that after 15 minutes of performance he had to be      charged for at least two hours to refill its batteries. Thus, we experienced the drawbacks of      currently used robot drives, having a very high energy consumption, that we prior only knew      theoretically.
To sum up, we had a very interesting and good time at the Bionicum. We learned a whole lot of things,     many of which we could integrate into our project. We can very much recommend visiting the Bionicum in     the Nuremberg Zoo to anyone, as it has a very thought-through and fascinating exhibition. Finally, we     again want to thank the Bionicum and its employees for inviting us, talking to us and doing such great     work. We really hope that we can plan a public engagement project together next year with the iGEM 2018     team!

Second control restriction digest of cPCR product of PS pSB1AK3
Date: 09/12
Done by: LC & Maria
Methods: Restriction digest
Protocols: RD1.1 [3]
Since samples A and D fromt he colony PCR gave inadequate results when cut with EcoRI and PstI, we had to repeat the restriction digest with the remaining two samples that were the right length on the cPCR, sample B and C. Samples E, F and G were also cut to confirm that there were no errors in naming the samples that resulted in sample A and D not giving the expected results.

Uncut PCR product was loaded on the gel as a control.
Results: Only sample C showed bands at the correct length (around 2180 BP), where as all other bands were at the length of a double terminator (b0015) without the photosensor insert. All samples were properly cut indicating the presence of biobrick pre- and suffix in these. Sample C will be miniprepped and sent off to sequencing.

Cellulases come in a number of types, and break down cellulose in different ways to different extents. The cellulase we have chosen is endo-b-1,4-glucanase E (CelE) cellulase, which is one of the three major proteins of the cellulosome of Clostridium cellulolyticum. This cellulase is also protease resistant, making it ideal for use with The E.ncapsulator's production and delivery mechanism. CelE mainly catalyses the reactions that changes crystalline cellulose to cellobiose and then finally to glucose. It also catalyses, to a small extent, the break down of carboxymethyl cellulose.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where"

Dimensionless process
In order to make a further analysis on stability of the system, sensitivity of parameters,  feedback factors-we manipulate all the arguments and parameters to make them dimensionless.   Analysis of this part is crucial since parameters in vivo experiment may be different and   even at odds with modeling ones but a proper dimensionless can reveal the mathematical essence   of our model.
Considering the Hill equation in the simplification DDEs, A1c1 and KM1/ρ1 should be the same order of magnitude, thus KM1/ρ1 is a well measurement of quantities of A1c1. We have:
Parameters
Parameters in equations are listed below.

Sensitivity analysis
In order to find out the key parameters which will affect stability of the system at most, we need to make a sensitivity analysis on each. At first, we did brief and instinctive analyses on each parameter as follows. τ1* and τ2* represent time delay in cell 1 and cell 2 respectively, which have been discussed in part 2, have little influence on stability of system but intend to affect the oscillation period merely. Parameters a and b refer to feedback factors indirectly, which have not been discussed before, we will see how a and b affect our system later. We have clarified that parameter u is equivalent to  μ/γ, thus, u is directly decided by the dilution rate of signal molecules 3OC12HSL and 3OC6HSL in environment and will inevitably influence stability of oscillation. As for m and n, they are inseparably connected to the Hill parameters whose sensitivity have been analyzed in part 2, so we can deduce that m and n are both sensitive parameters to our system.
Here we mainly did sensitivity analyses on parameters m, n and u. Parameters were set fundamentally as Table 4 shows.
Simulation results reveal that the system can oscillate stably only when u<5.3(fixed the other two sensitive parameters), 11.9
34.4. In other words, to ensure the stability of oscillation,"

Data
To confirm the distribution of VNP20009 in mouse tissues and to verify the tumor-specific gene induction, we detected GFP expression in tumor, liver, and spleen by fluorescence microscopy. We found the VNPpLacZ-GFP (with constitutive promoter) could induce expression not only in necrotic tumor but also in spleen and liver tissue. However, VNPpNirBeGFP (with tumor specific promoter) could only be induced in hypoxic and necrotic tumor tissue.
Fluorescence microscopy shows the preferential accumulation of VNP20009 pNirBeGFP in necrotic and hypoxic areas inB16F10 tumors. The nirB promoter could be induced specifically in this area but not in liver or spleen. (N, necrotic tumor area; V, vital tumorcells) This experiment was carried out in triplicate.
We designed plasmid constructs expressinggenes of interest for Salmonella- mediated tumor-targeted therapy using the nirB promoter. Our fluorescence microscopy revealed that the nirB promoter could effectively drive theexpression of GFP in S. typhimuriumstrain VNP20009 carryingthe plasmid construct pNirBeGFP under hypoxia,suggesting that the nirB promoter was a potent promoter.
S. typhimurium strain VNP20009 carryingpNirBeGFP or peGFP was grown for 24 h under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. Expression of GFP was examined by fluorescence microscope
Immunoblotting studies further showed that TRAIL was effectivelyexpressed in VNP20009 carrying the plasmid constructpTRAILgrowing under hypoxia.
Bacteriallysates were prepared from VNP20009 carrying construct pTRAIL grown in anaerobic or aerobic jars and were subjected to immunoblottingassays using anti-TRAIL antibodies.
These findings indicated thatgenes of interest for Salmonella- mediated tumor-targeted therapy could be effectively expressed in S. typhimurium strainVNP20009 carrying appropriate expression vectors driven bythe nirB promoter.
Fluorescence intensity was determined. Bar represents the mean ± SD of five independent experiments (n =5;*P<0.001).

On the one hand, when the two types of bacteria are culture separately, each of them cannot survive because the ccdB gene expresses continuously and the toxin would result the death of the bacteria, what’s more, they cannot get the signal molecular from the partener-6HSL and 12HSL, so even though they are let out, they have no safety risk to our environment. On the other hand, when they are cultured together, they cannot survive as well, only when the concentration of the products of the cl gene reach a relative high level would the degree of the toxin ccdB product decease, but this kind of situation only occur in the laboratory circumstance because of human control. In the natural environment, due to the lack of products of the cl genes, the poisonous protein produced by the ccdB cannot disappear, which would lead to the death of the both sides.
Eventually, in order that the target genes we import would not lose efficacy for the sake of the loss of the plasmid by the bacteria. We proposal that all the target genes can be connected to the genome of the bacteria, then the condition would not happen.
Our model have imitated this idea, and there are the figures showing below:

University of Florida
Our primary collaboration was with the University of Florida iGEM team. UF first contacted our team to invite us to a Florida iGEM social they hosted in July. The event was held at the molecular biology building of UF where we presented our projects to each other and further discussed plans for a meaningful collaboration. The event ended with a social gathering of both teams at Lake Wauburg, consisting of team building activities and a picnic lunch. Our team then invited UF's team to a workshop we hosted in September. The workshop was held at the FSU College of Medicine, where we collectively built the design specifications for their system and provided constructive feedback on various facets of our projects. We also mentored UF through the development of their wiki.

The discussions continued throughout the summer as our projects developed, consisting of research literature and experimental methods analysis as well as feedback on our overall projects. Cornell eventually sent us an educational plasmid kit they were using to introduce young students to the field of synthetic biology. We provided feedback on our experience using the educational kit for Cornell to further develop their educational kit.

3. Magnesium sensitive riboswitch (Part:BBa_K911001)
Riboswitch that acts as a regulatory element, truncating transcripts when magnesium is not bound to the RNA. Four Mg2+ binding sites exist, giving this part significantly switch-like behavior. Binding of these sites by Mg2+ results in compaction of the regulatory region of the riboswitch, which in its unbound state acts as an anti-terminator. Loss of this anti-terminator activity results in the activity of a downstream terminator (included in this sequence) which terminates transcription of the gene. May also be affected by other divalent ions, such as manganese.
4. Magnesium sensitive riboswitch (8 codon substitution)(Part:BBa_K911002)
Riboswitch that acts as a regulatory element, truncating transcripts when magnesium is not bound to the RNA. Four Mg2+ binding sites exist, giving this part significantly switch-like behavior. Binding of these sites by Mg2+ results in compaction of the regulatory region of the riboswitch, which in its unbound state acts as an anti-terminator. Loss of this anti-terminator activity results in the activity of a downstream terminator (included in this sequence) which terminates transcription of the gene. May also be affected by other divalent ions, such as manganese. This version also contains the first eight codons of the first downstream gene in the native Bacillus genome, MgtE. Substitution of the first eight codons of a reporter with these may improve reliability of change of reporter expression.
5. Fast Germination (B.subtilis)(Part:BBa_K911008)
This part upregulates an operon responsible for germination rate. Bacillus subtilis spores germinate in the presence of L-Alanine. Up-regulation of the spoVA operon increases germination rate in response to L-Alanine. The promoter for the B.subtilis sspB gene (PsspB) is more active than the endogenous spoVA promoter. It is also active during germination. Expression of the spoVA operon under PsspB increases the germination rate. This construct consists mainly of the sspB promoter followed by the first 354bp of the spoVA operon (first 354bp of the spoVAA gene). Since B.subtilis exhibits accurate and efficient homologous recombination, a single cross-over event between the spoVAA region in the BioBrick and the endogenous spo"

CFU
We measured the  Colony Forming Units using two types of transformation cells.
Transformation
We took the following eight plasmids from the Distribution Kit and introduced them to E.Coli DH5α. Then, we selected two colonies and cultured them for 16 hours.
Calibration
We conducted the following three measurements to get the calibration values as a preparation for the Cell Measurement.
①Measurment of the LUDOX CL-X solution to obtain a conversation factor to transform the  absorbance data into a comparable OD600 measurement.
②ABS600 measument of the dilution series  of silica beads to construct a standard curve of particle concentration which can be used to convert Abs 600 measurements to an estimated number of cells. 
③Fluorescence measurement of the dilution series of Fluorescein to generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. You will be able to use this to convert your cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration. 
Discussion about Calibration
From the Experimental results,Particles / Abs600 = 5.18*10⁸ and MEFL / a.u. = 1.24*10⁹ was found.

The cell sorter is coupled to a droplet                 former, which forms aqueous droplets that host individual cells. The cell-containing droplets are then sorted                 based on fluorescent or colorimetric signals, that are coupled to the metabolic pathway.
Despite the verified design, the fabrication process was error prone and too demanding in skill. Regrettably,                 the channels of the device were too shallow for our final test with living bacterial cells. However, the                 process was thought provoking and further persuaded us a democratisation of microfluidic technology will                 benefit the synthetic biology community.

User Experience
Using SMORE involves the synthesis of target sites, which is an arduous task even for the experienced.
This is because the small length and repetitive sequences make direct chemical synthesis of target sites unfeasible.                 An alternative is the assembly of target sites from oligonucleotides (oligos). However, the design of oligos                 presents several challenges:
The oligos cannot be palindromic.
The oligos must bind to each other in a specific order.
The oligos must be within a reasonable length for synthesis.
The learning curve of oligo design is steep. SMORE needs an easy way to design oligos, to become accessible and                 attractive to more people.
This is why we have devised an automatic oligo designer program. This program requires basic computer skills                 for installation and use, but it allows researcher with no experience to design oligos. This program is unique                 to other primer designers, as it is optimized for recombinase target site assembly.
From our Interdisciplinary study, we understood the importance of a well-defined protocol. This is why we have                 provided a step-by-step user manual, with an additional glossary. The glossary is not intended to teach the                 user from scratch. Instead, it is designed to provide a common terminology that readers can communicate with.                 It is also a useful reminder for those unfamiliar with molecular biology. The font was also set to Times                 News Roman, following the tradition of most scientific literature, and allowing a high readability in both                 print and webpage [11].

We hope that our new birth control method will contribute to the new market of affordable and safe contraceptives. We also want to design our packaging to be more discreet so Esther and other women feel comfortable using it.
Nyakiyumbu Widows Association
When our team reached out to the Nyakiyumbu Widow’s Association, they were quick to reply and were very interested in our contraception method. Muhindo Nyesi, chairperson of the NWA, stopped replying to our emails soon after. Our team wondered if her group lost interest, but we soon learned the reason for her absence; Nyesi’s nephew was hit by a car and, during recovery, was also brutally attacked by a group of boys. He was in the ICU for several weeks and underwent brain surgery, but he finally recovered enough for Nyesi to go to the local library to email us back. She provided us responses to our questionnaire and apologized for her absence. We are so grateful for Nyesi’s dedication to our project, especially in these difficult times for her family. Read More >> The responses we received through Nyesi were different than the others we’ve collected; one woman argued that having more accessible contraception encourages youth to become sexually active at earlier ages. Her viewpoint was similar to that of a woman from India, and our team realized that this was something we must consider if we want to encourage more contraception use. We also discovered another method of contraception in Africa: uterus removal. We weren’t aware that women used uterus removal as a means of birth control, and this news encourages us to pursue our birth control method since it would be much safe for women to use.
Promote Africa Foundation
We discovered the Promote Africa Foundation (PAF) through the Joy Women’s Group. The PAF is a united women’s group that runs programs related to female reproductive health and women’s rights. According to Evelyn Lewsley, the leader of the PAF, they “encourage women to space their children because most children are abandoned by families who fail to provide for their children”. The PAF encourages birth control methods throughout the Kasese District, and are currently encouraging birth control injections; however, they struggle to find users since injections sometimes cause bleeding and therefore deter women from use. The PAF is excited to work with us as they hope our birth control method will be safer for the women in Africa.

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#debate_-_-_TEXT.html," how synthetic biology could be used to treat diseases. Cancer and HIV occupied a prime place in the discussion. Both iGEM teams explained that research in this area is very active, but although some papers have shown some positive outcomes (Ledford, 2011), it is still not clear whether synthetic biology will be the definitive answer to finding any cures in the near future.  The teams mentioned that synthetic biology could be used to facilitate specific treatments, as explained in the St Andrews project.
Students then raised several questions on the impact some of these engineered organisms could have on the environment. The questions were aimed at situations where accidental release of the organism could cause a great impact on the environment, or species within that environment, and on the so called Butterfly effect. As there is no correct answer to these kind of questions, the students of both the University of St Andrews and University of Dundee explained that, for the time being, policy is the best way to prevent such issues from arising in the first place. Safety policies were organisms are contained in labs with strict codes of conduct for scientists will be crucial in preventing organism release of any kind, accidental or otherwise. If such organisms are to be test outside the laboratory for any specific purpose, then this would be done under controlled conditions to ensure they are not allowed to escape.  The reason explained regarding the use of policies was that it is practically impossible to know how an organism could impact a complex ecosystem. As such, these organisms should only be used under controlled circumstances in contained areas.  Finally the university students brought up the fact that genetically engineered organisms are normally weaker and less well-adapted to their ecological niche than wild-type organisms.  This decreases their chance of survival, and subsequently decreases their chance of interfering with any population or environment on a grand scale.
The discussion then focused on the ownership of such organisms, specifically if some organisms are eventually synthesized to treat diseases or to be used for helping the community in any way, how patents or laws owning the synthesized DNA would work, and what impact that would have on the field of synthetic biology. This was a difficult topic to discuss as not much legislation exits yet, however it was pointed out that so far several initiatives working on synthetic biology (such as iGEM) use the GNU GPL license for all the research they produce. Anything under the GNU GPL license is free and open; any work derived from it has to remain under the same license guaranteeing that it never becomes propietary. This ensures that the knowledge gained from synthetic biology endeavors remains in the public domain and is used for the benefit of the community without any business barriers.

iGEM Meetups
Meetups: NCHU-Taichung, NCTU-Formosa, NTHU-Taiwan, NTHU-Formosa, Baltimore_BioCrew, CCU-Taiwan Date: through iGEM 2018 season Location: Mingdao High School or National Chiao Tung University Sharing: motivation, iGEM experience, etc.
Team: NCHU-Taichung
Date: Apr. 3, 2018 Location: Mingdao High School
Why: To exchange concerns and questions relating to each of our project
How: Give presentation and discuss via Q&A What:
We talked about the idea of GE mosquitoes and the aplication in blood testing. And they shared their project concerning clean environmental pollutants by GE plants. After a brief understanding of both of our project, we shared our future plans, difficulties and suggestions in a mutual way. We all knew that promoting GMO to the public is not easy and limited by law regulation. Although there’s still many controversial problem, we are encouraged by several GE crops that are widely available. And we discussed these problems in Taiwan. Before NCHU left Mingdao, they visited our Biolab and amazed at what we can do as a high school students and in the campus of a high school. Reflection:
We all learned a lot from this meeting. For instance, their human practice is made up of integrated human practice and education. One is related to experiment and the other promotes social education. Also, the attributions of their team is organized. Some of them are in charge of botany, others are in charge of microbiology, and the others are responsible for human practices. All of them have a clear vision of what they are doing. That’s what we need to learn from them.
Team:"
Amsterdam,2015,Team:Amsterdam#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," not supported by a single study, but, as AAAS reports, by a “a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed studies, and public statements issued by virtually every membership organization of experts in this field.”
We’re making fast progress to “pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts.” The earth’s average temperature is increasing to a level beyond anything that has been experienced over the past millions of years. Although this means that there is massive uncertainty regarding the exact consequences this increase will have, the fact that there will be consequences is certain. It is a real possibility that as temperatures rise, critical elements of the earth’s ecosystem will experience sudden and irreversible change with massively disruptive consequences to societies and natural systems.
The sooner we act to prevent further climate change, the lower the risk and costs. Fortunately, there are still many things we can do to change the path we’re on. Yet sitting idle will only increase risk and decrease the range of options. Carbon dioxide accumulate in our atmosphere for decades or centuries, which means the effects of CO2 emission cannot be fixed unless there is some large-scale, cost-effective way to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.
This last note prevents a shimmer of hope: if preventive action is taken now, the worst consequences of climate change might be averted. Indeed, with the recent verdict by the Dutch court of justice, obligating the state government to reduce its CO2 output with 25% by 2020, fighting climate change has become not only a moral and humanitarian necessity, but even a legal imperative. What is needed now are the tools to actually do so. Enter the bioeconomy.
Bioeconomy 1.0
The use of biomass to produce products isn’t new: as far back as the first world war, Germany, searching for alternative ways to sustain its war efforts, attempted to convert sugars to fuels. Ever since, technology has modernised, but not changed, the underlying premise: to convert microbial or plant-based biomass to useful products. Corn has been a prime example of this. It can be used, through a process of fermentation, to produce bio-ethanol, which can be added to gasoline to create more carbon-neutral fuels for vehicles. There is one major downside: production that depends directly on plant-based biomass competes with arable land. Mexico experienced the consequences of such competition firsthand when, in 2008, subsidy-fueled US ethanol production from mexican corn pushed up prices, which in turn led to an increase in prices for staple foods like"

Introduction
We are an interdisciplinary team fortunate enough to be able to borrow the Jens Martin Mars Chamber at the Niels Bohr Institute for Astrophysics, University of Copenhagen. This opportunity has created some pretty interesting setups characterizing our organisms for bioprocessing in outer space - which we of course had to find a way to measure.
 
Additionally, we used HPLC to characterize and validate sucrose export from cscB transformed PCC7942 exists as a BioBrick in the iGEM registry made by Stanford-Brown 2011 ( Bba_K65011 ).

Measuring sucrose with HPAEC-PAD
Sucrose is a disaccharide made from up of a unit of glucose and fructose with a glycosyl bond between them. To accurately measure it, we have applied Dionex- High-performance anion exchange chromatography - pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The amount of sucrose secreted in the media was determined using Dionex- High-performance anion exchange chromatography - pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) by using CarboPac SA10 (Thermo Scientific) column for fast separation of sugars.  HPAEC-PAD is an analytical device to detect and characterise simple to complex carbohydrates in the sample based on their electrocatalytic activity at high pH-level using NaOH. 200 µL of inoculated spinned media containing secreted sucrose was collected twice a day from the first day of induction for 7 days. The spent media was transferred to a HPAEC-PAD Vial (and septra) and the running program was consisted by a constant flow rate of 0,35 mL/min with the injection volume of 20 µL. More information can be found here , on the dedicated results page."

In this figure, an unexprected peak present in the leaf infiltrated with TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos (black) can be observed. Comparing its spectrum with the one provided from the database seems to be (z)-11-hexadecenal, a desired pheromone,  which is being produced by the plant itself using an endogenous alcohol oxidase. Nevertheless as it is produced with a low yield, the FAO1 of C. tropicalis search is still in progress.
The rest of the samples were prepared for the GC-MS analysis.
The samples were weighted, introduced in the vial and added with EDTA and CaCl2.
94,0 mg of P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 2)

92,0 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf(replica 2)
Results of the replicae analysis are shown below:
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos construction shows a huge production of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol.
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos shows a higher abundance of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate.
In order to verify that the analysed compounds are the desired pheromones, we acquired standards for (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate and (z)-11-hexadecenal, and indeed, the analysed compunds were the right ones.
Our happiness reached a peak!! A PEAK!

Degree course: B.Sc. Life Science
Task: Sponsorship
“Working in a team, having to organise the complete project ourselves and the high degree of specialist competence required are my main reasons for participating in the iGEM competition. I’m looking forward to all the challenges we will meet in the course of the project and I can’t wait to see where we will be in terms of our discipline and also on the personal level at the end!”
Frederik-Matti Bartels
Degree course: M.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Detection methods for heavy metals and biological safety
“I became interested in this form of international exchange of teams of future natural scientists through a report on the German team of students from the University of Bielefeld that participated in iGEM 2012. When I then heard that Leibniz Universität Hannover wanted to enter a team in iGEM for the first time, I was eager to be a member of the participating team. Since my primary field of study is not in genetics or molecular biology, I hope this project will help me to gain more detailed insights into these interesting and innovative research disciplines. Having to organise ourselves as a team, acquiring new knowledge and skills and learning new techniques together is the most important part of the competition for me. Getting to grips with the project tasks as a team creates a dynamism which does not arise when an individual works alone.”
Melanie Barth
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Photo documentation, transformations and chairing meetings
“For me, the exciting feature of the iGEM competition is that the complete responsibility is almost exclusively in the hands of our team. This means each student can use their individual talents and interests to contribute to the success of the group as a whole and thus gain valuable experience in planning and executing a scientific project.”
Andreas Buchbender
Degree course: B.Sc. Plant Biotechnology
Task: Web admin and proteins
“The “iGEM Team Hannover” project inspired me from the very first second. The key reason for my participation is the opportunity to gain experience that transcends the degree syllabus. In addition to the practical application, the main focus is on the division of the work and the organisation of the group. I am looking forward to the forthcoming challenges and hope for an intensive and instructive time.”

Abstract

Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate"

Team UCLA in 2015 iGEM used honeybee silk protein 3 (part number: BBa_K1763000 ) in their project, which can serve the purpose of being the substitution of spider thread and natural silk. Although it is not as strong as other kinds of silk proteins, the honeybee silk protein has some advantages compared to spider thread and natural silk: the gene of honeybee silk protein is smaller, with no duplicated sequences, and easier to be synthesized and modified by molecular biology technology.
However, the silk protein produced from UCLA has no colors, thus with less aesthetic characteristic and uneasy to be observed directly. In order to observe the produced honeybee silk protein more directly, we add a blue chromoprotein, amilCP (part number: BBa_K592009 ) , to the end of the silk protein. amilCP is a blue chromoprotein comes from coral, which has a strong blue after expressing. The color has the highest absorption peak at around 588nm, which can be observed by naked eyes directly without any equipment.
We designed 2 pairs of primers for the genes of honeybee silk protein and blue chromoprotein by molecular biology technology. (There is a GGGGS linker in the middle of two fragments. ) Then we use infusion technology to insert two fragments after T7 promoter of pET21a(+) vector. The verification by PCR is showed in Figure 1. After then we introduced the recombinant plasmid into E.coli BL21(DE3). In 48 hours, there is blue chromoproteins expressed in bacterium solution, which can be observed by naked eyes (Figure 2). Therefore, the improvement of honeybee silk protein is practical and valid.
(Figure 1  verification of recombinant plasmid by PCR)
(Figure 2  the bacterium solution of expression group and control group)
The result of the experiment is showed in the following figures. Figure 3 showed the different colors of E.coli DL21 with different expression levels after centrifugation. There are largely expression group, slightly expression group and control group from left to right. The samples are investigated by SDS-PAGE after crushing the bacteria of three groups by high temperature. As it is shown in Figure 4 , after dy"

It was a question whether R9 peptides work properly and introduce FT protein into plant cells. Although endocytosis is often observed in animal cells, there are few examples of plant cell’s endocytosis. We, therefore, needed to verify the function of R9 peptides. For this reason, we performed the following experiment(Fig3-6).
First, we removed the cuticles from Arabidopsis thaliana's leaves by scratching them. Second, we devided the leaves into two groups, and soaked one into a solution of only GFP, and the other into that of GFP and R9. After 5 minutes we washed cells by PBS in order to wash away GFP and R9 peptides from around the leaves. After that, we contrasted leaves having soaked into the only GFP solution with ones having soaked into the solution of R9 and GFP mixture. Then we succeeded in getting the figure of GFP fluorescence (Fig3-7).
The control groups on the left were soaked in only GFP, and the experimental group on the right were soaked in GFP and R9. These fluorescence indicated that R9 peptides properly kept GFP in or on the plant cells."

1. Do the biological materials used in the lab work pose any risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
In the project, we used Escherichia. coli K-12 strains MG1655, NEB 10 beta, NEB 5 alpha and TOP10 (similar to E. coli K-12 DH 10 beta. E. coli K-12 strains fall under Risk Group 1, matching our BL1 (Biosafety Level 1) laboratory. Before using the strain, the team has researched risks relating to usage of this strain.
E. coli K-12 strains have commensal lifestyles, i.e. they consumes carbon compounds from food in host gut without harming the host. Risk assessments of E. coli K-12 strains indicate that they are poor colonisers of human and animal gut, due to lack of three cell wall components, glycocalyx, liposaccharide core and capsular antigens, that are responsible for recognition and adhesion of gut cells [1] . Experiments have shown that E. coli K-12 strains cannot colonise human intestinal tracts, where wild type E. coli resides, unless normal gut flora are substantially reduced [2] [3] . Meanwhile, E. coli K-12 strains are unable to produce significant amount of toxin to cause diseases [4] .
Most of the enzymes produced by the engineered E. coli K-12 strains are unable to interact with human proteins. Although proteinase K has can potentially degrade human protein beta amyloid plaques [5]"

To  order to be simplified, we firstly considered  the one dimension problem again. We assumed the  cell density at point x was ρ(x) at time t. In a very short time τ, there would be two groups of cell at x moving into its nearby points x-δ, x+δ, due to the random walk. And the amount of cell in each group  were proportional to the product of D(ρ(x)) and ρ(x). Therefore,
And the function Dρ(ρ)  was a decrease  function. For a simplest case, we considered a Heaviside Function
Fig. 4 Heaviside Function Dρ(ρ)
The numerical simulations gave us the results  shown in Fig.5. The cell density showed a periodical-narrow-peak structure.  These peaks were what we wanted, as they produced some regions of low cell density,  though the whole pattern was not quite similar with that of experiments.

Full  Model of Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 6 The entire designed genetic circuit
Actually, in our genetic circuit, we transformed a  plasmid which can secrete AHL to environment (Fig.6). When the AHL density h of  environment was high, the AHL came into the cell. Then AHL combining with LuxR repressed the expression level of cheZ which controled the motility of E.coli. So it was necessary to take  account of the AHL effect.
First,  the AHL was synthesized by the E.coli cell at the rate λ. And the  degradation rate β of AHL whose half life is normally about 15 to 30 minutes. Considering the diffusion of AHL, we obtained
Fig. 7 The growth rate relates to nutrient concentration
For the nutrient, we made an assumption that  the amount of nutrient consumed were proportional to the amount of cell increasing.  Taking account of the nutrient diffusion, we had
where k was the ratio that nutrient converts to  cell mass.
We used several possible forms of function Dρ(h)(see Results Section2 ). The  results showed that if the cell diffusion coefficient decreases fast near the AHL  density threshold, the pattern came out as a multiple-ring one( Results Section2 (a),(e) ). On the contrary, there was only one-ring pattern.
Therefore, in order to to make this curve Dρ(h) decreasing sharply near the threshold, it followed a prediction that we can get a"

pH Sensors
During the kombucha brewing process, the beverage becomes more acidic.  Additionally, it is unclear if or how the microbial community changes within the beverage over time.  Thus, our team decided to find pH sensitive promoters  that could be used to track not only the pH of the maturing beverage, but also the presence of the various microbes within the kombucha over time.  We successfully created a neutral range reporter, attempted to create acidic and basic range reporters, and found three putative acidic range reporters that are endogenous to one of our kombucha bacteria, Gluconobacter oxydans
Though an acidic sensor was what was required for our kombucha analysis, the identification of sensors in other areas of the pH spectrum were explored as well. Three sequences were identified, the CadC operon for the acidic range, CpxA-CpxR complex for the neutral range, and the P-atp2 promoter from the BioBrick Registry ( BBa_K1675021 ) for the basic range. Each sequence was paired with a unique corresponding reporter sequence so that if each pH sensitive plasmid were in the same environment, the specific pH of the system could be seen. The reporters used were, BBa_E1010 for the CadC construct, BBa_K1033916 for the CpxA-CpxR complex, and BBa_K592009 for the P-atp2 promoter.

Whereas the difference in cfDNA measurement by using the Qubit would suggest an extraction efficiency of circa 37%. But the three spiked samples were too different from eachother in values, probably due to using a too high concentration of sample for spiking.3

The first concentration of the antibiotics like ampicillin(2) leads to the first struggling bacteria, who have not enough beta-lactamase transcription to fight against it(3). Every increase of the antibiotica concentration (4) would kill morer and more bacteria, until the one bacterium with the best transcriptional activation rate of the reporter gene is the only one alive(5)
The native lacZ pomoter was modified to achieve a ten times greater expression rate when bound by a cI-RpoZ fusion protein ( Badran et al 2016 ). Moreover, the distance of the 434 cI binding site to the transcription start site was optimized by the working group ( Badran et al 2016 ). The optimal distance of the binding site is exactly 61 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site ( Badran et al. 2016 ).
The final design of our promoter is given in figure (9).

METU_Turkey_Software,2010,Team:METU Turkey Software_-_-_TEXT.html,"EM 2010 and present a new version of the BioGuide in     iGEM 2011, which will provide optimum design of constructs for predetermined     parameters.
Most of the parts are composed of functional and nonfunctional constructs     which are formed by atomic parts. And every part should carry the information     for all of its atomic parts within itself. The “input” heading actually     stands for promoters. Parts with one or more promoters can be found     at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Along with the information on which and how     many promoters a part might have, the activity level of promoters are     also important to distinguish between a constitutively active promoter     or a promoter activated by specific physiological processes or states     etc. This information was crucial for us to dissect in order to run     our algorithm as it directly affects which inputs can activate the devices     or the systems.
Throughout our investigations on the Parts Registry, we found out     that much of the terminology was being used ambiguously. Although this     might not be vital for synthetic biologists, it is still endeavoring     to understand the function of certain regulatory elements which also     becomes a time consuming task for the researcher. Thus, we recommend     that the explanations of certain regulatory elements should be redefined     and fixed especially for synthetic biology for easy communication, sharing     and searching of information.
Common misuses of the terminology can guide us to figure out how     to construct a standard nomenclature for synthetic biology. We claim     that a standard nomenclature is urgently needed for synthetic biology     for the following reasons. First of all, synthetic biology is an emerging     research discipline and an industrial application area which is highly     promising. Secondly, redefinition of the terminology to build a standard     nomenclature is needed as some of the terms are prone to be used instead     of another causing problems related to misuse for the global communication     about synthetic biology. Lastly, the nomenclature has major importance     for the construction of a persistent and trustworthy database for synthetic     biology which serves for the information exhibition and exchange globally.     For instance, there are obvious misunderstandings about the words which     are predominantly used for regulation process. We have noticed that,     the terms “inhibitor” and “repressor” are being used as equivocally     in the part information pages. Like the lactose inhibitor protein, a     widely used DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, that have been labeled     both as “inhibitor” and “repressor” at iGEM’s Parts Registry. Similar     problems resulting from ambiguous use of terminology also observed with     regulatory"

5. As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?
The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within the food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labeling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.
In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labeling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India, and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labeling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.
6. What are the most important documents related to GMMs?
The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.
When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.
For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea, there is no"
TU_Delft,2015,Team:TU Delft#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," CsgA to a nanowire. Presumably, depending on the level of expression of these membrane proteins we can influence the amount of connections per cell. In this manner, we imagined to manipulate biofilm strengths according to the situation at hand. In order to investigate this effect, we designed the biobrick containing CsgB with a constitutive Anderson promoter of low, medium and high inducer strength. Since we wanted to investigate the interactions between CsgA and different levels of CsgB, we designed this biobrick in the pSB4K5 backbone to avoid problems with incompatibility groups. The proteins CsgC, CsgE, CsgF and CsgG are involved in the maturation, correct folding and export of CsgA. For this reason we imagined overexpression of these proteins to have a positive effect on the total extracellular amount of available, functional CsgA. By increasing this amount, we hoped to increase the rate of biofilm formation.
Using amyloid nanowires to connect the cells, the question arises how long these nanowires can grow. Unfortunately, no exact number can be assigned to usual length of these nanowires. While their thickness has been characterized to be 100 to 350 nm, their length is of several micrometers (Pitkänen, M., et al., 2010). From this data, we created a model using the measures of a bacterial cell and different cell densities (OD600) to calculate the mean distance between each cell either head on or sideways (since E.coli has a worm-like appearance) assuming homogeneous orientation. From this, different required cell densities can be derived depending on the level of crosslinking desired. Two cutoff lines of 10 µm and 5 µm distance are plotted for easy orientation.
Corresponding to this, molecular sizes of the CsgA protein monomer were used to calculate the amount of protein monomers required for connecting two cells at a certain density. This can be used as an orientation for the time it takes to crosslink two cells assuming constant protein production and no differences by diffusion.

XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#wetlabjournal_-_-_TEXT.html," only test its fluorescence but its protein electrophoresis. Two  level of the aTc concentration were used. Results show this circuit working  well. Besides, fluorescence measurements about PBADRETPcIRLT, one  with induction and another without, showed no difference between them.
The  experiment started from the evening and lasted to the next day. We stayed up  late to get samples. Other team members prepared the coming presentation to  Mrs. Wu and Mr. Fang.

Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Goal: To  measure the immobilizing capability of the beads/ intra-hollow capsules
Used a  microplate reader to measure the OD value of the culture medium of the  immobilized beads/ intra-hollow capsules.
From the  result, we can find the OD value of the culture medium of beads grown up faster  and higher, indicating that cells immobilized in them leak easier than those  embedded in capsules.
Presentation:
Sophia,  Daniel, Alex and Moson delivered the speech. Mrs. Wu, Mr. Fang, as well as  other graduates have given some valuable advices.
