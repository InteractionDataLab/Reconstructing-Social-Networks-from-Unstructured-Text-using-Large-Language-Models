2.3 Improved model
2.3.1  Competitive effects of two substrates on the same enzyme
Although we used the relationship between the Michaelis-Menten equation and the chain reaction to obtain the expression of butanol, the model only considered the case of single enzyme reaction. However, bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase was used twice in the reaction, and different substrates competed for the enzyme. In this process, we assume that the substrate has no inhibition during the reaction.
As shown in the figure above, the two substrates combined to share the same enzyme can be approximated as a competitive inhibition kinetic equation:
\[\left[ {{E_f}} \right] = \left[ E \right] - \left"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Sensor_-_-_TEXT.html,"M CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Introducing new students to synthetic biology
To approach the next generation of chemical biologists, we presented about iGEM on the matchings-days of the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e). Therefore we prepared a talk about first of all synthetic biology, but also about what the iGEM-competition encompasses. We presented several projects that have been done in the iGEM-competition the last couple of years (Groningen 2012, Münich 2013 and Wageningen 2014). Also we introduced them to last year’s project of the TU/e and described to them how we will take this project as a starting point for our own project.
Ethics forms an important aspect of our project and therefore we encouraged the students to take part in a discussion about the use of GMOs in the human body. Therefore we posed them several questions, for example: ‘Should it be possible to tamper life, with the help of synthetic biology?’, ‘Would you like to have a GMO in your body, if it’s for a good purpose?’ and ‘Would you mind if a GMO gets into the environment?’. The students had to respond to these questions with red or green cards. After every question we asked if they could argue their choice and discussed these arguments with each other.
The days were successful and it was nice to hear the ideas and arguments from future students."

Preparation for T-Domain exchanges
We assemble pRB14, which is a version of pRB3, in which the T-Domain is exchanged by the whole insert of the pDONR vector. Since pRB13 grew on DH5alpha and TOP10 we hope that pRB14 won't. This vector will be used to exchange T-Domains and will be modified to get a version without the PPTase sfp and the cutting sites EcoRI and SpeI in indC. To check whether a successfully exchanged T-Domain can be activated by a defined PPTase, we build pSB2K3-derived plasmids with a single PPTase (sfp, svp, entD or delC) under control of the lac-Promotor and the RBS BBa_B0029.

The final module in our construct is the Recombination module. In this module, we use Cre recombinase to separate the origin of replication from the rest of the plasmid, in which the gene of interest to be knocked out is contained. This would prevent plasmids which have recombined from being replicated, and would eventually lead to the dilution of the gene of interest in the population.
Fig. 2 The Effect of Recombination module
To control the expression in a cell population, it is essential that the action of quorum sensing is fast and sensitive enough!
This aims to control the time for an inserted gene of interest to function before being knocked out by Cre recombinase.
The function of the Recombination module is to knockout the gene of interest from the plasmid.
Our project can be applied to various application in the future.

Virtual Conference
We reached out to various iGEM teams around the world with the invitation to join us for a virtual conference where we all exchange ideas and gain feedback to better our respective projects as well as our human practices.
A proposal was sent to all the various teams we had interacted with throughout our project
The conference began with 15 minutes of opening remarks, and introductions of all the various team members. After that, each team was given 5 minutes to present the main aspects of their project.This was done by sharing a powerpoint presentation that each team was asked to prepare prior to the conference. The screen-sharing feature was used to share the presentation with the conference participants. Each presentation was followed by 10 minutes of questions, feedback and advice from other teams to the presenting team.
Six teams, including our team ended up participating in the conference on September 15th, which took place over a google hangouts call for approximately 2 hours. The main challenge we encountered when planning and organizing the event, was arranging a time that was reasonable for all the teams participating taken into account the time difference especially as we were joined with teams from Turkey, Australia, China and India.
The points that the teams have discussed including but are not limited to the following:
1) Tell us more about your project and why you chose the idea. Are you participating in any special track?
2) What kind of experiments will you be doing?
3) What are some challenges that you are currently facing or you anticipate to face?
4) How will you incorporate integrated human practices into your project? Are you looking for contacts with experts in the field?
If your institution has participated in iGEM before, what are some winning project tips that you can give to the other teams?
Great appreciation to Team HKUST from Hong Kong, REC Chennai, VIT Vellore from India, Saint Joseph Istanbul from Turkey, iGEM Macquarie from Australia for the fruitful conversation. We look forward to meeting you in person in Boston!

In addition, bacteria are responsive to their environment which enables the potential to create ""smarter"" therapeutics that would enable precise controls even after delivery, and eventually ensure long-term success of the treatment. These controls can be achieved through creating circuits that are responsive to their environment using various promoter strategies. Finally, bacteria are very easily externally detectable through various techniques that include the use of light, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. This will enable scientists to measure the state of the tumor and therefore the success and efficacy of treatment.
Current State of Bacterial Therapy
However despite all these advantages, bacterial therapies have a low presence in the market, and engineered bacterial therapies are practically non-existent. One reason is that bacterial therapies often have trouble obtaining venture capital since many people still remain uncomfortable with putting genetically-modified organisms in their bodies. As a result, this essentially inhibits the commercialization of these products. But even before that, these therapies encounter additional resistance from the governmental agencies like the FDA and they can't even enter the market to begin with. Just this year, 2012, has Artemisinin, which comes from both genetically engineered bacteria and yeast become FDA-approved and ready to come in to the market soon. What's interesting is that these types of bacterial therapeutics, or at least probiotics widely used in Europe and Asia, but only recently has the market been rising in the United States [12]. Several companies such as Osel and Oragenics are companies that exclusively focus on developing bacterial therapeutics. Osel focuses primarily on harnessing the microbiomes already present in the human body. Although they have several probiotics in clinical trials none of their actual engineered probiotics have been able to go past the pre-clinical stage [13]. Oragenics focuses more on oral delivery of probiotics and has managed to bring a few products into the market.
Thus, by understanding these the various advantages bacterial therapies have, we hope to create two systems: a light-activated bacterial therapeutic and antimicrobial biofilm. However, also being aware that many of these bacterial therapeutic never make it into the clinic we hope to analyze why from a scientific, governmental, and social perspective to better understand the issue. Then based on this analysis offer some solutions that can streamline the process of eventually bringing these engineered bacterial systems into the clinic.
Challenges Bacterial Therapy Faces
Although bacterial present themselves as ideal vehicles for drug delivery for various types of diseases there are several hurdles that need to be overcome before they become clinically viable. One major issue is the control of"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html,"Synthetic Biology is an innovative, exciting scientific field with applications in a wide variety of areas including therapeutics, the environment and energy. As an interdisciplinary subject, combining Biology, Chemistry and Physics, with Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, it uses the talents of the best academics working in each of these individual fields. There is much interest at both university and high school level in learning and working in Synthetic Biology, as shown by the ever growing iGEM competition. However, despite this, there is a severe lack of Synthetic Biology education, especially in the UK. Currently, there is no Synthetic Biology education available prior to university level, and no intention to introduce Synthetic Biology into the GCSE or A Level curriculum in the immediate future.
We targeted high school education with our board game BioMech, however we also wanted to look at the impact we could make with the students, who will most immediately work and study further Synthetic Biology. We spoke to academics at the University of Exeter about the possibility of introducing a second year module into the syllabus teaching students the fundamentals of Synthetic Biology as well as an introduction to the applications to the field. We received good interest from both Bioscience and Natural Science departments. Dr Nicky King worked closely with us initially, liaising with us about the possibility of this module being available to Natural Science students and Bioscience students. We spoke to the Director of Education Dr Mark Ramsdale and he informed us of the logistical problems with creating a module for Natural Scientists and Bioscientists and after further communications with our supervisors and other academics, we began to focus on the Synthetic Biology module being a sole Bioscience module.
Other than the iGEM competition, there is no education in Synthetic Biology at the University of Exeter and the fact that each year, the iGEM competition was getting more and more competitive, showed us there was a gap in the market. Upon communications with and advice from various academics in the Bioscience department, we have come up with this second year Synthetic Biology module:
BIO20XX - Synthetic Biology
Module Overview:
Synthetic Biology is a new and exciting scientific field, with applications within medicine, the environment and energy. It is an interdisciplinary subject, combining Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Maths, Engineering and Computer Science. In this module you will learn about the creation of new biological systems and how they can be used to advance current technologies, with a focus on biosafety and kill switches.

According to the World Health Organization, there were 859 confirmed human cases since 2003 which killed 453 people with a mortality rate of 52% (5). The disease not only create tremendous economic burden to the health care system, it also greatly impacted the poultry industry. During the outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong, 3.5 million chickens were slaughtered. About $10 billion US dollars was lost due to the H5N1 outbreak (6). Although the risk of H5N1 pandemic outbreak in human population is considered to be low recently, it is still considered as an endemic in poultry in six countries (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam) (7).
H7N9: The next H5N1?
H7 virus was thought to be only circulating among avian hosts but human infection was recently reported. The first case of human infection was recorded in China in 2013 (8). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1533 human infection cases were reported, with a mortality rate of 39% (9). In Hong Kong, 4 confirmed human cases have been reported so far. H7N9 caused economic loss of about $6.5 billion in China (10). Among all the avian influenza viruses, H7N9 virus was found to have the highest ability to infect humans and circulate in birds (11). WHO warned that the human infections are unusual and need to be carefully monitored. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States (12), H7N9 is the subtype that has the greatest potential to cause a pandemic in recent year compared with other subtypes. It is worried that H7N9 may cause the next pandemic since the virus is evolving for human-to-human transmission (13).
The need for a new subtyping method
To avoid possible epidemic and pandemic outbreak, World Health Organization (WHO) has a well-established Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) (3). With combined effort of more than 120 national laboratories, the potential epidemic strain of influenza A virus will be selected to make vaccine to prevent possible outbreak (3). To effectively monitor the spread of avian influenza, a simple and rapid on-site method is needed for detecting the virus in both human and poultry. However, on-site diagnostic methods, such as Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests (RIDTs), can only identify influenza A viruses but cannot subtype it (14). Traditional influenza A subtyping method rely on qRT-PCR (15)."

Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

We continued to collect Clark electrode data. With fresh cultures, and no cross contamination, we now had good analog data accumulating.
We had to abandon the digital setup which limited us to one Clark electrode. With limited time we needed to collect our data across all four cultures in synchrony.
Another exciting milestone: we prepared and shipped off our four biobricks- Omega Ω, Fer/Hyd, HydEFG and HydG. Omega Ω is given the official bio-brick name – Hydrogen Gas Producing Gene Cluster (HGPGC).
Continuing our collaboration work for NTU Singapore we grew up the cells in liquid culture, sonically lysed them then isolated proteins using a histidine column. We did a PCR clean up of a ferrochelatase gene in readiness to test their dCAS9 mutant.

Our primary focus has been judging forms and updating our wiki before the deadline. So far so good! Go TEAM!
A meeting was set with Michael Ramp from the Macquarie Incubator who helped in creating a 3D model for our prototype.
Wet Lab
This week marked the end of the Clark electrode era.  The last of the data was collected and it was time to crunch the numbers and show that data graphically.
Adrianna did an amazing job turning all those analog scrolls into easily understood graphs.
Furthering work for the NTU Singapore collaboration, more large scale cultures were made with ZYM-5052 media. This week we did an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) testing the commercial Cas9 ready for comparison next week with an EMSA of NTU’s Cas9.
We did further replicates of the gas measuring apparatus as well as weighing gas and reacting samples with barium hydroxide.
Our MS results for Fer were ready for interpretation.

Judging forms were completed at our student meeting! Go us!
All our wiki entries were drafted and double checked and corrections and edits are being processed.
Second team member shirts were ordered.
In the meeting with Michael Rampe, we were offered the opportunity for our prototype to be featured in the Pedestal website, and we sent them updated logo files, the design branding that we wanted for the prototype to ensure we can get as much as we can done prior to wiki freeze.

6. Funding
Milestones
Our key milestones until the launch of the alpha version of our product focus on an initial proof-of-concept prototype for α-testing. Feedback and further development of our business model through customer interviews will shape our understanding and ability to prepare for our first round of investment fundraising. Our β version will be ready for launch in April 2017 while the launch of our first commercial version which will generate a revenue stream is set to launch by the end of June 2017.
Cost Analysis
We presented Alphabrick to investors, VCs, startup founders and academics at the 2016 Technology Ventures Conference before being selected as the winners of the UK’s biggest biohackathon and recipients of the £1500 first prize to develop our product further. We were then fast-tracked to the Judge Business School’s prestigious Accelerator programme to bring Alphabrick to market by 2017.
Using the award money from the CUTEC Biohackathon, our cash flow projection for the first 7 months indicates that we will have sufficient resources to fund development of our product. In the 6th month we will be poised for applying our first round of pre-seed investor funding for subsequent progression to the release of our alpha and beta versions.
Funding Strategy
Our funding strategy for the next 6 months after January of 2017 focuses on obtaining non-dilutive grants and awards. Our £1500 award as the winning team of the CUTEC 2016 Biohackathon will burn out by February 2017, as will the resources of our founders to maintain themselves while working on this startup. We are exploring further funding opportunities through the Accelerate Cambridge programme.  This will predominantly fund product development, and administrative fees for IP protection.
As the bulk of the cost of product development, after the launch in January 2017, is composed of the salaries of full time staff, we aim to raise pre-seed angel investment to take Alphabrick through its alpha and beta testing phases. By the beginning of February 2017 will aim to have raised £20,000. Should we obtain sufficient funds, we will be looking for our first round of seed investor funding to scale up and roll out our marketing strategy for June of 2017. As our current business model centres on a subscription model for premium features, we envisage that later stage product development will come"

I am Lucía. I am one final project away from getting the degree in Biotechnology.
I love meeting people, learning and having new experiences.
For me, enter iGEM was primarily a learning opportunity. I wanted to learn how to develop a science project from the beginning      to the end, from the idea to the results. I also liked the idea of meeting people and spend a different summer.
Sub-teams: Yeast, Modeling, Wiki and Poster.

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

For example, if the oligo specification sheet states that 20.3 nmoles of oligo were delivered, add 203 µL TE buffer to obtain a 100 µM stock solution. This stock solution can be diluted as needed into appropriate working solutions.
Resuspension Difficulties. While most oligonucleotides will readily go into solution at concentrations <10 µM, some oligos (with certain fluorophore modifications and some hydrophobic modifications such as cholesterol) can be more difficult to resuspend. For oligos that are harder to resuspend, and for which one might observe residual precipitate present following resuspension, we recommend that the oligo be heated at 55°C for 1–5 minutes, vortexed thoroughly, and then briefly centrifuged. Occasionally, residual by-products of the synthesis reactions remain in the tube and are visible after resuspension. These include Trityl (appears flakey) and CpG (which forms a pellet at the bottom of the tube). Neither of these reagents should negatively impact the performance of an oligonucleotide; however, both can be easily removed by passing the resuspended oligo over a Sephadex G50 column.
Storage Optimal Conditions for Standard DNA Oligonucleotides. IDT has tested the stability of oligonucleotides following various storage conditions (Table 1). The results of these studies indicate that the most stable temperature at which to store a standard DNA oligonucleotide is  20°C. An oligo stored at –20°C is stable for at least 24 months when either dried down, or resuspended in TE buffer or nuclease-free water. Standard DNA oligos dried down or stored at 5°C in TE buffer or water were found to be stable for long periods; however, better stability is achieved by freezing if the oligos are to be stored for extended periods. Standard DNA oligos stored at 37°C are stable for at least 6 weeks in water, or 25 weeks dried down or in TE. Storage at higher temperatures is not recommended; however, accidents can happen, such as oligos being left on the bench top overnight or freezers failing at the weekend, and it is important to understand that the stability of the oligo should not be affected. Regardless of the storage temperature, TE buffer, rather than water or dried down, is optimal for long-term storage. Storing Oligos with Fluorophores. Typically, fluorophore labeled oligos show a reduction in signal of about 20% after"

UCL,2016,Team:UCL#Human Practices#Elderly_-_-_TEXT.html," insight into the pharma side of things.
It has been two years since my work at Roche and I’ve spent my other summers either working in an office or now on iGEM. Although our project is about ageing, I haven’t been thrown into the deep end of dementia research and care for a while. Precisely until I was back at the dementia home in Hamburg this past week, this time with the purpose of getting the opinions of the elderly about our project and their life in general. I got to speak to a few people individually and then also two groups of people, everyone with varying forms of dementia: from very light Alzheimer’s, which you wouldn't be able to tell, to the late stages, which are almost incomprehensible. Overall these experiences were enlightening, inspiring and motivating to do more research and help but simultaneously the potential realities of the future are distressing.
Over the next few weeks we will be publishing the stories of the people I got to speak to and the impressions and experiences I gained from the group sessions.

As I added some sugar and milk to Monikas tea her eyes lit up. She asked me what I was doing with my life and I proceeded to tell her I was studying in London. At this point her eyes grew even brighter as a grin crept across her face “I once went to a tea party in London!” she exclaimed happily as she stirred her tea. I inquired further about her time in London and she happily told me all about her holiday there back in the 60s and how she sees how things have changed now on the news. I told her a bit about my experience there, then followed up with a quick very simple explanation of why I was coming all the way to Hamburg from London and what our “ageing” project really tries to achieve. She was intrigued and told me that it is very nice “that such brilliant young people care about us old folks.”
Over the next 10 or so minutes she engulfed me with stories of her upbringing, her life in post-war Germany, her job as a Kindergarten teacher, her children and their children and how things changed after her husband died and she moved to a home for the elderly. She told me about how she used to always be independent and saw herself as a modern woman, taking fate into her own hands. Even at her nearly 90 years of age, the strength, resilience and power of her personality she was describing of her youth, shone through. It was difficult for me to change the topic from the positive and empowering aspects of her impressive life, to the potential"
TU-Munich,2013,Team:TU-Munich#HumanPractice#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," Johanna and Andreas from iGEM TU Munich team with Dr. Kuschk (left) and Dr. Müller (right)
When we visited the Helmholtz Zentrum of Leipzig UFZ on the 26 th of June 2013, we had three objectives. We wanted to present our project, get another impartial opinion concerning our project idea and project implementation and lastly acquire general information about practical phytoremediation. Dr. Kuschk and Dr. Müller are chair members of the environmental biotechnology section and attend to phytoremediation or rather bioremediation (see figure 6). Their research focus lies in the area of zoonosis that means the interplay between plants and microorganisms. The plant acts with the root system as a carrier to quantify the microorganisms which dispose nitrate, sulfur or toluol. According to Dr. Kuschk genetic engineering work isn’t possible at the UFZ, because of  the few personnel at the moment.
Dr. Müller gave us a guided tour through the laboratories. (see Figure 7) Later on we had two conversations with experts on different issues concerning our project. Dr. Müller gave us very helpful annotations about our effectors. We were explained the sense of amplifying the resistance gene EreB in environment in relation to the biotechnological benefit. He informed us about the costs of blue light. Furthermore he alluded that we had to consider the enzyme specification in order to find the benefit of extincting erythromycin to clean water. Another point was the use of cathecholdioxygenase. According to Dr. Müller, depletion of catechol through microorganisms is a very effective process. So our next step was to show the efficiency of the depleting catechol through moss.
Figure 10: Visit of the UFZ: Dr. Müller leads two iGEM TU Munich team members through the laboratories.
The main topic we discussed with Dr. Kuschk was the application of our project idea in practice, outside the competition framework. Dr. Kuschk was in doubt about the practical implementation. His assessment was based on his comprehensive experiences with concepts and conversions he developed. In his opinion the costs, the low concentration of polluting substances and the small contact surface have negative effects on the projects application. When it comes to the immobilization of substances, he prefers biofilms to membrane bounds. He also criticized our choice of degraded substances. In his opinion fecal substances are the cause of the high death and diseases rate in less developed countries. We explained that we chose harmful substances, according"

Introduction
So, we set up this page specially describe the improved Part, BBa_K2765043 , which can produce redox-sensitive                         green fluorescent protein roGFP2-Orp1 and display intracellular ROS content by its fluorescence                         ratio.
Source
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part: BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence of orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR, which enhanced the specificity and                         sensitivity of roGFP2 to H2O2.
Codon Optimization
As shown, we mutated the cysteine at position 82 of the Orp1 protein to serine, which made our signal output                         more responsive and increased the protein expression of roGFP2-Orp1.
Promoter Optimization
According to this measurement principle, the concentration of roGFP2-Orp1 protein can influence                         the final signal output strength. So, 4 promoters, FBA1p, TEF2p, TEF1p, ENO2p, with different                         expression intensity were screened, because we wish this BioBrick Part can output signal with                         suitable intensity in different situation.
Modeling Optimization
Beyond these, we also did some dry-lab for this Part. Considering that fluorescence intensity                         of roGFP2-Orp1 can only characterize the relative level of intracellular ROS qualitatively, but                         can’t give the absolute content of intracellular ROS quantitatively, we established the model                         based on Michaelis equation and some assumptions, which can convert fluorescence intensity of                         roGFP2-Orp1 into the intracellular H2O2"
Calgary,2010,Team:Calgary#Community#Podcasts#Transcripts_-_-_TEXT.html," that contain more than 1% GM content have to be labeled. In April 2000, the new UK Food Safety Agency extended that provision to all GM foods, additives, and flavorings, including those on the market before 1998. The UK also requires that all restaurant meals with GM foods be labeled.
Dev: Synthetic biology may have the potential to help make these products, and even help relieve some of the controversy surrounding the use of genetically modified foods. The use of transgenes, which is DNA from another organism introduced in a crop causes a lot of concerns because of fears that it could be leaked.
Alex: Yeah, but new technology is already helping this field become less controversial. Marker assisted selection is an example of this. This allows us to use genetic markers to locate genes affecting traits such as meat quality, or disease resistance. Because this involves the use of existing DNA within the organism, and not transgenic DNA, there is the possibility that this will created modified food that will be less controversial. The public's acceptance or rejection of new technologies that could determine future food supplies will be crucial for the direction of synthetic biology.

Kyle, Alberto and I met with Jenhan and Rishi to discuss the Wet Lab needs for Batterboard. We discussed creating a different ""template"" for saving tubes instead of saving data in 96-well plates. We recommended creating an 81-grid box or rack in lieu of the 96-well plate since our current work has been done in 1.5mL tubes and not plates. With this 81-grid rack in mind, we want three ""types"" of these racks to choose from - a Plasmid rack, a Gel Extraction rack and a Frozen Stock rack to store our various types of samples.

Requirement 2: Collaborations with other teams
The UMN collaborated with Wisconsin Lutheran to facilitate a week’s worth of synthetic biology curriculum by sending detailed lesson plans developed by our iGEM team, along with strains of microorganisms used to facilitate trainings. In addition, we participated in Columbia iGEM's low-budget lab exercise, who in turn provided UMN iGEM with an interview with a local environmental health specialist who has extensive knowledge of the mercury contamination problem within Columbia.
Requirement 3: Describing and evaluating questions beyond the bench
The primary goal of UMN iGEM 2014 has been to design a project in line with the major safety, ethics, and intellectual property concerns of both scientists and the public. We took the following steps to address each of these issues:
Safety: Our project gives detailed attention to the prevention of releasing genetically modified bacteria into the environment via encapsulation and the development of several killswitch proposals. The device also includes an activated carbon filter to both collect mercury and prevent release of the bacteria. During an outreach event at 3M we also discussed this filtration element of our device with one of their filtration experts to further inform our safety measures.
Ethics: We have been committed to establishing an open and productive dialogue between UMN iGEM and the public. Our surveying at the State Fair of public opinion on safety and implementation concerns of our device helped to inform our design. We believe there is great ethical importance to involving the community in the design of a device that could potentially be used on their waters. We also developed an interactive game show at the fair to actively engage the public in synthetic biology knowledge. Our dialogue with the public has also included our outreach program at local schools, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and various STEM fairs allowing us to develop a dynamic dialogue with both children and their parents. The program focuses on the understanding of DNA in order to demystify the basic principles behind synthetic biology. It is our hope that a more solid understanding of these principles may help to familiarize children with biotechnological tools and decrease misconceptions about the nature of DNA manipulation. We hope this may help to develop an informed future community of consumers and constituents to facilitate open dialogues between scientists and the public. Finally, we interviewed various experts in bioethics and scientific fields related to our project to help further inform ourselves and give essential background to those unfamiliar with the global issue of mercury contamination.

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#labblog_-_-_TEXT.html," plasmids with alternative constitutive promoters (piG0046 and piG0047)
The promoter site of the luxR regulator plasmid piG0041 was mutated by QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis to produce promoters of different strength. The primers oiG0031 and oiG0032 were used to establish piG0047, a plasmid with a promoter of intermediate strength (J23111). Analoguos the primers oiG0033 and oiG0034 were used to construct piG0046,  a plasmid with a weak promoter (J23109). Competent cells were transformed with piG0046 and piG0047 and selected on ampicillin-LB-plates. The sequence was verified by Microsynth using the primers oig0035 and oiG0036.

Week 6: Project planning, Gibson assemblies planning, First Matlab simulations
Wednesday, July 2nd
We have a clear organization of the different experiments we would like to perform.
We want to optimize quorum sensing to have non-leaky non-cross-talking constructs. We want to prevent cross-talk between integrases and check their dynamics with different quorum sensing promoters. Then we will test the XOR gate without production of LuxI, to check how it works without the loop, and we will finally test our final construct with the loop, hoping that the delay between GFP production and the possible second switching due to AHL production is long enough to have enough fluorescence.
The red line is our critical timeline. Numbers of days are very optimistic,therefore we multiply the whole timeline by 2. The stars stand for modeling inputs.
Tasks organization with critical timeline in red.
We have also clear plans for the Gibson assemblies to perform. As an example, here is the plan for regulator plasmids :

Week 5: Assembly strategy and steady states derivation
Wednesday, June 25th
We will use Gibson assembly to assemble our constructs, and have now a construct assembly strategy. We know the list of experiments we want to carry (cross-talk between quorum sensing molecules, quorum sensing leakiness with or without riboswitch, cross-talk between integrases, integrase activity and logic gate behaviour) and the exact sequences of base units we will assemble (lux, rhl, las promoter and repressor units, reporter units, logic units with "

We adopt promoter activity to describe the production of mRNA and sRNA so that we can relate the transcription rate with the concentration of inducers. We use Hill equation to imitate the process when inducers binds with promoters.All the equations and descriptions is from a reference[2].
Hill equation:
where fTL serves as the fraction of transcription factor (TF) bound to inducers, L is the concentration of inducers, KD is the dissociation constant, and n is the cooperativity. By mass balance, the fraction of TF without inducers bound fT is
Each promoter activity we used in our model is given by the following equations[2]:
The parameters for promoter activity equations is given by Table S2 (the parameters are from references[2,4-6] :
The output promoter activity is given by this equation:
And the parameters are described in the following table (the parameters are from reference) [2]:

Similarly, for line 2, when IPTG is put into the system, we write another four equations for the materials of line 2:
But the first inducer, arabinose, still exists in the system, so the first three equations are also work at this time. However, because sRNA[ipgC] will bind with mRNA[ipgC], we modified the equaitons for mRNA[ipgC] and sRNA[ipgC]. In other words, we used the sRNA model which we finished before to change these equations. Besides, when the first (Ara) and second (IPTG) inducers exist at the same time, protein[ipgC] and
protein[mxiE] will bind together to form mxiE-ipgC complex so that the transcription from the pipaH* promoter can be activated. So we also wrote two equations to describe the dynamic change of mRNA[sicA] and
protein[sicA] and one equation for mxiE-ipgC complex (px1):
Then we combined these equations to simulate the situation after the IPTG was added. Because ipgC proteins must form a dimmer when binding with mxiE to form the mxiE-ipgC complex, according to mass balance, we minus double px1 in the equations for proteins[ipg"

In the same time, through communication and discussion, we were given advice on other methods that can be used to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of hyaluronidase in our project. Also through these communications, we came to establish cooperative relationships with Shenzhen University, Dalian University of Technology and South China University of Technology. The way that we were able to help other teams and form meaningful collaborating relationships made us feel a sense of achievement.
The 1st Southern China AfteriGEM Reception
At the end of August, SSTi-SZGD and Bluepha co-organized the 1st Southern China AfteriGEM Reception, in Shenzhen, under the leadership of the iGEM Asian Ambassador Rebekah Chen, who was the leader of the 2017 SSTi iGEM team. We took control in the meeting managements, including venue preparation, logistic control, on-site support and photography. We were thrilled to be part of a successful meet-up that gathered over 30 outstanding past iGEMers from Shenzhen and a handful of current iGEM team members. We also got to participate in the round table discussion, where we brainstormed a series of inspiring afteriGEM activities, such as academic development, entrepreneurship opportunity, global cooperation, and so on. What interested us the most was the proposed educational project that aims at promoting biology to Chinese middle school students. Communication with past iGEMers, business leaders and officials from iGEM HQ brought us a deeper understanding of iGEM and its values.
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
In order to improve our projects, as well as promoting our project and concept to the general public, and to seek start-up funding opportunities. We participated in a series of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competitions organized by Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee. We began our competition journey in June by participating in “Inspiration Cup” competition organized by local government of Shenzhen Longgang district, in August we participated in Shenzhen Nanshan “Entrepreneur Star” competition, and early September the “China Shenzhen Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition”. By participating in these competitions, we received expert advice from different fields in terms of commercialization and application, which helps greatly pushing our project forward!
Above all, our unremitting efforts have been well rewarded. We won the 5th place in the Shenzhen Longgang district “Inspiration Cup” competition, the 7th place in the Sh"
KULeuven,2011,Team:KULeuven#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html,"i into the environment, so as solution to biological containment we have inserted a cell death mechanism. We cannot control mutations in the genes coded for cell death, but we can ensure that E.D. Frosti dies by taking additional safety measures.  One of the measures can be deleting genes that code for the production of several vitamins. The bacteria would only be able to survive when we add those vitamins to the medium. This way, even if the ceaB mechanism fails, the probability of E.D. Frosti surviving in the environment is heavily reduced.
Adding more safety mechanisms equals reducing the probability of survival of E.D. Frosti in nature. Reducing the probability to zero is impossible. So the question remains: how safe is ‘safe enough’?

MazEF modeling
Overview
This year modeling plays a great role on our project because we used it to predict the precise time in which our systems start functioning. We showed two essential part modeling below, one is E. coli DH5α and the other one is B. subtilis B. subtilis strain 168(ATCC ® 23857). The showing data will demonstrate our project working result.
Part description pBAD
pBAD is the promoter regulated by both arabinose and the araC gene product. Since that araC gene protein regulates expression is also activated by arabinose, pBAD promoter is enormously effected by arabinose. We modeling the relationship between pBAD activity and arabinose concentration for finding out how to let pBAD reach it maximal activity.
We assumed that our system reacts as the following chemical system:
Assume that AraC is always in large concentration, the binding reaction between AraC and arabinose is very fast. Thus, we don’t have to consider the concentration of arabinose and AraC. We only need to focus on concentration of Arabinose AraC. To describe the transcription of mRNA, we used Michaelis- Mentin kinetics and get the follow differential equation.

INSA-UPS_France,2017,Team:INSA-UPS France#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," an expected decrease of CFU in both milk and water (approximatively 35% of decrease after one day of freezing). In the following days, CFU counts from milk have stabilized to approximatively 4.109 CFU/ml while CFU counts from water have stabilized to 3.109 CFU/ml. Despite there were more CFU counted from the milk Eppendorfs we can’t conclude milk is a better way to maintain Lactobacillus spp than water because bacteria quantities were not the same at J0.
But we made an interesting observation about Lactobacillus colonies. Indeed we noticed that after a while (approximatively 10 days), half of the colonies coming from the sterilized water conditions were significantly smaller than the ones which were maintained in milk.
Our conclusion is that the freezing induces a loss of approximatively 35% of bacteria and that both water and milk are good choices to maintain Lactobacillus spp at -20°C. It’s interesting to add that it looks like this bacterial strain could have been keep longer in the fridge and that the milk solution seems to offer better maintaining conditions because colonies were bigger on petri dishes.
Cloning
From : BOKU-Vienna
During our 3 months of experiments we did several genomic integrations in Pichia pastoris. But a part remained non-integrated despite all our efforts. We sent to the BOKU-Vienna Team our yeast strain and the construction below. They succeeded the genomic integration and thanks to them we did a fluorescence experiment to characterize the GAP promoter activity.
Thanks to their work we obtained results showing that the GAP promoter we were working with is functional. As you can see on the figure, the Pichia pastoris strain they engineered shows a higher fluorescence than the wild type, proving the functionality of pGAP. The functionality of pGAP has been further demonstrated later with an halo assay.
Creation of mazes
Done for : NAWI-Graz Team
Their project:
The aim is to create a robot-bacteria interface in which information processing is done by a bacterial culture that exhibits a feedback loop with a mobile robot. In this concrete case changes in pH and a corresponding change in fluorescence of the bacterial culture are the means by which communication is achieved. Additionally, one of the fluorescence proteins used is under control of an acid inducible promoter, which they aim to further develop and characterize.
Their tool:
To test their algorithm they created a tool that iGEMers can use. The idea is to let people draw different mazes so they can test"
Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Continuity_-_-_TEXT.html," genes involved in vitamin production are replaced with fluorescent proteins, allowing for easy monitoring of their production. Our construct contains mCherry as a reporter gene, and two other fluorescent proteins to mimick pathways operons. It also has a phage PhiC31 integration site for subsequent addition of new genes.
In theory, the cells with this cassette integrated in the chromosome are expected to emit a red fluorescence. Upon induction of the CRE-recombinase, they should lose the red fluorescence and start to express either mCerualean (a cyan fluorescent protein) or mVenus (a yellow fluorescent protein). Each cell should express only one of those two proteins at the same time.
Map of the DNA sequence we constructed. The promoter BBaJ23199 is constitutive. mCherry, mCerulean, mVenus are fluorescent proteins of different colours.
Chromosomal integration
This cassette was constructed by gene synthesis and Gibson assembly and assembled in a self-integrating plasmid vector (Saint-Pierre, 2013). This vector uses the integrase of the phage HK022 to integrate itself in E. coli's chromosome. This plasmid was electroporated in the bacteria and the HK022 integrase was induced.
To check that the cassette has correctly been integrated in the right locus, we performed an analytical PCR on the whole genome of the transformants, with a set of four primers which allows for amplification of the junction between the vector and the chromosome.
Here is presented the result of this PCR using the genome of six clones of transformants as a template.
It tells us that the vector was succesfully integrated at the right locus. It also shows that there have been only one integration and no tandem integrations, which would have resulted in an additional band.
Gel electrophoresis after PCR for checking the integration. We amplified the junctions between the artificial cassette and E. coli 's chromosome. For every screened clone, the two bands have the expected sizes, which proves that the cassette is integrated in the correct locus.
Gel electrophoresis after PCR for checking the presence of the three fluorescent proteins. For the clone shown here, it means that all three proteins ORFs are present on the chromosome, even though only the first one is actually expressed.
Integrity of the cassette
We then performed three other PCRs with pairs of primers binding on the ORF of the three fluorescent proteins. As a positive control, we performed the same PCR on the pure fragment that have been used for the assembly.
This way we ensured that the cassette was present in its entirety"

These particular rubber plantations only account for a very small fraction of the worlds total rubber production, so one can imagine the global deforestation due to the creation of rubber plantations. Source: Li, H., et al: Demand for rubber is causing the loss of high diversity rain forest in SW China. Biodivers Conserv (2007) 16:1731–1745 (Link)
Another issue is the growing need for agriculture. Even when plantations are established in areas with no rainforest, they constitute a problem.

Synthetic rubber is mostly made from scarce fossil fuel resources, which increases the pollution of our planet. Furthermore, synthetic rubber does not always degrade well in nature. On the other hand, being a natural compound, natural rubber is biodegradable.

We went over a realistic embedment of our project in the context of acceptance and side effects. Additionally, we evaluated possibilities to optimize the manufacturing process of CAR T cells with the aim to contribute to a therapy, which is affordable and versatile in its use for many cancer patients.
Improve a previous part or project
Improving a previous part was done by sending in BBa_K2295003 . With this BioBrick we improved BBa_K1720002 and BBa_K1456004 . The insertion of the pTal promoter, as well as the usage of multiple enhancer elements offer a wide range of new functionalities. Now, hypoxia dependent gene expression can be achieved with a single cloning step. Furthermore, multiple enhancer elements allow fine tuning of the required expression levels to different cell types.
Model your project
Modeling was an important part of our project with which we could determine whether our understanding of the system has a good substantiation.  Combining the hypoxia response element, cAMP response element and CTLA4 promoter in our CARTELTM AND gate to boost the specificity of the CAR expression, was challenging. After modeling different possibilities and comparing the results we designed an AND gate were HIF1A is knocked out and reintroduced under the control of either the cAMP response element promoter or the CTLA4 promoter. By this usage of modeling, we aim to improve the safety and specificity of emerging synthetic CAR therapies.
Demonstrate your work
We could demonstrate that all parts of our AND gate are functional. In the course of summer we generated stable HIF1A knockdown Jurkat and HEK293T cell lines, transfected them with an artificially overexpressed HIF1A and could show that it is still functional. We characterized the CRE, CTLA4 and the HRE promoter in newly generated stable cell lines and implemented a kill switch for additional safety of our CARTELTM AND gate.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Since we are also working with hydrogels, this connected us easily. We told them that we were aiming at making a living material using a combination of E. coli and dextran hydrogels. iGEM Hamburg was interested in implementing our system in their trap and this started our collaboration.
Our dextran hydrogel was designed to be very stable, as it contains anchored bacteria. Any rupture within the hydrogel could increase the risk of bacteria escaping. However this also brought along a problem. As the hydrogel was very stable, this caused difficulties dissolving our hydrogel. This was important as it would be very interesting to test the bacteria witin the hydrogel for viability and other characteristics. When we told iGEM Hamburg about this problem, they told us they wanted to help us as they had a lot of scientists on their team, and would like to do some experiments on the hydrogels. Therefore, we sent them some of our cubic hydrogels.
They incubated our hydrogels (190 mg) in 1 mL of aqueous solutions of NaOH, HCl, lactic acid and the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit Binding Buffer for 2 hours, and then checked for decomposition. Afterwards they checked again for decomposition after 24 hours.
Only the acqueous NaOH solution seemed to work as a dissolving solution, as after 2 hours the mass decreased to 165 mg. In acqueous HCl solution and in lactic acid solution, there was no change in mass. Interestingly in the Thermofischer GelEx-Kit binding buffer the hydrogel seems to take in the solution as the mass increased to 215 mg after 2 hours.
After 24 hours they measured again. In NaOH solution, the mass had decreased further to 150 mg. In HCl and lactic acid solution the hydrogel also seemed to start dissolving as the mass was 170 mg and 157 mg respectively. The mass of the hydrogel that was immerged in Thermofischer GelEx-Kit binding buffer increased even further to 235 mg.

iGEM Leiden BBQ meetup
On the 17th of August iGEM Leiden organized a Dutch Meet-Up including a BBQ and drinks. On top of that there was a pubquiz which consisted of questions about every team and their respective projects. We got to know in detail what every project was about and it was a great evening to connect and share with each other.

We have improved the function of RecA by codon optimization for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fused with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for in vivo DNA repair. Also fused with a His-tag, allowing nickel based purification prior in vitro DNA repair.We have also improved the already existing Biobrick pSUC2 with our two fused promotors pTEF1-pSUC2 : the part is still regulated the same way, but has a higher expression level when induced.
pTEF1-pSUC2 also improves the function of pTEF1 by adding repression at high levels of ATP and induction at low levels of ATP."

Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk
From our first contact with processing silk, our group became enamored with the look and feel of our silk, and the different forms it could take. We began to get involved with not just the scientific value, but the aesthetic of our silk products, and we knew there must be some application to it outside our laboratory.
Also from the onset of our project, we knew we wanted to share our fascination with silk to the outside community, and explore what potential uses our project could have. We dreamed big: we wanted our project to reach world of biomedical devices, optics and fashion. But we were also interested in what potential others saw in our project, and after reaching out to the community, our human practices was born.
Titled ""Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk,"" our project is a collaboration with the UCLA Art | Sci Center dedicated to bridge the gap between art and science through an open exhibition. On display is work from artist Jason Fahrion, who grows silkworms and creates mosaics out of their naturally fluorescent coccoons, as well as our own iGEM wall, where we lay out an interactive web-like diagram breaking down how we process our silk into different materials like fibers, gels and dust, with samples for guests to see and feel and experience the silk the same way we get to in our lab. Also along the walls are other forms of silk art, including a glass display of live silkworms feeding on mulberry leaves, Jason's mosaics and a display of the historical uses of silkworms and their silk. Through this, we hope to have the community explore with us the art and beauty behind our science, and the science behind what we see as art.
The exhibition is open to the pubic, and here is a look inside ""Seres: Inhabitants of the Land of Silk.""

The LabPats met at UES to begin discussing and planning Human Practices.
Lab 2
The students started on Friday by attending a chemical safety training course presented at the RX building.  After this hour and a half safety presentation, they once again met with Chia.  Chia gave them a task list of research to do for the day:   Research the ice nucleation fusion protein for the chitinase,   Narrow down which two chitinase genes to use,   and look into the sequences for all of the genes. Chia also introduced the students to the genome sequence planner named APE.  The students planned to use the three separate components for the formation of the cinnamaldehyde along with two RBS and the promoter (an improvement of an old part) and to use the ice fusion protein with the two forms of chitinase (two new parts to the iGEM part registry)
Week 3
Monday(06/18/18)
Lab 1
The students began bright and early with their first presentation to the lab. The lab meeting included many prominent scientists from around the department excited to hear about the summer intern’s development with a new iGEM project. The team heard a stellar presentation by USAFA iGEM before giving their own and receiving praise as well. The LabPats are still currently waiting for their sequenced parts and primers to arrive before proceding with further lab work. Thus, they took this opportunity to learn more about wiki development and modelling, with Annie deciding to implement bootstrap into their wiki design.
Lab 2
On the Monday starting the week, the RX team started their day on base with an RX branch meeting.  They then met with Chia and went into further detail of DNA sequencing.  After the meeting with Chia, the students went to UES and researched and found and planned the DNA sequencing for both forms of chitinase and the cinnamaldehyde.

Early on the workday, the students took the overnight cultures of the “RhlR” plasmid and tested the fluorescence level to ensure the GFP still worked and that the plasmid wasn’t corrupted. It worked exactly as intended, and the students were able to obtain great fluorescence and pictures. They wanted to have a backup for later just in case, and created a glycerol stock of their “RhlR” plasmid. They then performed a genomic sequence protocol to extract the DNA from the RhlR plasmid so that they can amplify the Che"

We had difficulties in drawing a picture of Asia, because of the diversity of strategy in different states.  As an example, we looked a China, where the focus has been placed on new buildings, given the fact that there is a very high rate of construction. The Chinese government is promoting a voluntary program similar to Energy Star in the US for the label of house as well as appliances [9] .
Household appliances: there's a lot out there
In Europe many everyday products such as washing machines, refrigerators and other appliances need to carry energy labels and have been designed to meet minimum energy efficiency standards, identified by a letter code. Some of the European countries are trying to promote the substitution of old appliances with new high efficiency ones. For example, in Italy since the tax year 2012 for every house been refurbished, you can deduct 50% of the cost of the appliances as long as they meet the A+ standard.
In Japan, there is a similar approach being developed, that is not yet mandatory (Energy Saving Labelling program for appliances and lighting) [11] .
In the US the Environmental Protection Agency has developed a voluntary program named Energy Star to label kitchen appliances, computers, and materials used to build homes that save more energy than standard models [12] . This program is now being used also in Europe.
Energy labels of appliances in different countriesIllustration of some labels used in Europe, America and Asia.
Synthetic Biology: an alternative enrergy source?
Alternative Energy Sources
Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight, wind, rain, geothermal, biomass, water.
The top countries for investment in this field are China, Germany, Spain, the United States, Italy, and Brazil. In 2014 China invested more in renewable energy than the whole Europe.
The European Community has drawn a Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) that has as a major concern to stimulate the renewable energy growth, by imposing on member countries certain levels of alternative energy use [13] . For example, Italy has to reach the 17% of the total energy production by 2020.
The New Energy for America [14] plan calls for a federal investment of 150 billion to rise renewable energy supplies to 25% of the total amount of energy. Financial incentives are available in many states. For example the cost of a domestic photovoltaic panel system can be decreased by half with federal and tax credits.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#html5_-_-_TEXT.html,"such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It can also describe the species constructed by these parts, and reactions happen with the species, such as binding of species, dilution of species, degradation of proteins, amplification of cells, multi-compartment reactions, and so on.
Many traditional methods fail to consider structure of species when trying to markup reactions with only reactants, modifiers, products and kinetic laws. The best part of MoDeL is that it can preserve detailed structure in species and reactions using Chain-Node Model. Based on the model, MoDeL is able to markup almost all kinds of reactions in a detailed and clear way.
Overview of MoDeL
Figure 5 above is an example of a simple network of biochemical reactions(pTetR + TetR2 = pTetR*:TetR2) that can be automatically constructed using MoDeL:
MoDeL supports automatic construction of such network with only the input of its initial conditions and environmental parameters. In order to do this, obviously the data of parts, species, reactions, compartment, units and so on is needed. Besides, relationships between these components are also needed, so we can link to a reaction when we find a species. Data of relationship is stored as references and exists in most MoDeL components.
To define all the needed components in a systematic way, MoDeL organizes them in five component containers at the top level:
:: System: This container contains definitions of units, functions, rules and global parameters. These are all basic elements for other components of MoDeL, and many are mathematical concepts without direct synthetic biology meanings. The name of the container, System, separates this container from others which contains components of biological significance, and indicates this container includes the basic parameters of the whole system.
:: Compartment: This container contains definitions of compartments. Compartment here is considered as a holder of substance with certain volume, so it only stores related data such as units and volume. It also stores a list of compartments that are permitted to be placed inside. For compartments like E.coli that can multiply, a corresponding compartment with the same id will be created"

DESCRIPTION
Conclusion
We successfully developed a shuttle vector that allows the user to harvest the efficiency and accessibility of cloning in E. coli, while still allowing for replication in Y. lipolytica. We extensively tested the plasmid, and showed that it allows for replication, selection in E. coli and replication, selection and even counterselection in Y. lipolytica. The plasmid was shown to be compatible with BioBricks which, to our knowledge, makes it the first tool that allows for the use BioBricks in Y. lipolytica. It is our hope that other actors in the iGEM community will use this tool in order harvest the great potentials of Y. lipolytica as a chassis for biorefineries of the future.
As a proof-of-concept, we have shown that we can integrate a gene of interest into Y. lipolytica and also disrupt a native gene of interest. These proof-of-concept experiments validate the use of Y. lipolytica for future cell factory engineering purposes.
Here, we have focused on the integration of an auxotrophic marker gene. However, the CRISPR-Cas9 system is ideally suited for markerless gene integrations 13 . Markerless genetic modifications are advantageous as they do not affect host cell physiology and allow for iterative genetic modification cycles of the production organism of interest. In addition, this iterative process can be sped up as the modular nature of the CRISPR-Cas9 system makes it ideally suited for simultaneous multiplex genome editing 13,15 .

Tuesday: First day of work at the HCI lab and I'm already starting to work through background readings. I was assigned to the Eugene DeSyne project, and the background readings address first-order logic, a topic that I know nothing about. I'm struggling to understand the symbols involved in logic, but I'm sure I'll come to understand it in time. There's also readings about visual languages, which is quite intriguing for someone coming from a linguistics background.
Thursday: The Wellesley iGEM team visited MIT for a BioBuilder workshop with Natalie Kuldell. Unfortunately, as a graduating senior, I had other activities to attend to and I was unable to stay for the afternoon wet lab workshops. In any case, the morning lectures were helpful at providing an introduction to synthetic biology, especially the goals that people in the field strive to achieve through experiments and research.
Friday: Graduation at Wellesley! I received my diploma with a B.A. in Linguistics, but I'm not quite leaving Wellesley yet. I'm excited to spend the summer working at the Wellesley HCI lab before moving on to the next chapter of my life.

Logic gates
The input of logic gates are Target and Clock signals(Fig.3 a). It is obvious that Target signal is the one we want to record. Although Clock signal seems unrelated, it is helpful to provide the circuit with time information. It serves as a time license. When Clock signal is on for the first time, the following parts start to work and record the present information of Target signal. After that, Clock signal turns off, stopping recording and beginning to prepare for the second record in the next time period.
Figure 3 | Logic gates. a, logic scheme of logic gates. Reltionship between inputs and transformed information received by promoters is shown; b, overview of the logic gates circuit design. TF, Transcriptional facters.
Logic gates(Fig.3 b) are employed in this project to process the raw signal from Target and Clock, and control three promoters, PC, P-C and PC&T. As a result, this part is like a bridge between the signals and sequential memory structures, which makes both signals can be highly customized to record various targets of interest with appropriate clocks.
Sequential memory structures
The key step in recording the changing process of a signal is the distinguishing between the signals recorded at different time point. We accomplished the distinguishing work with our sequential memory structure. The structure is consists of segments of orthogonal memory modules, each one is capable of responding to the target signal and executing the memory process alone. The structure is under the strict control of the clock signal and logic gates mentioned above, so that only one memory module is activated during one recording period. The structure is delicately designed in a way that different memory modules are turned on and off in a sequential order corresponding to their spatial relations on the plasmid. By answering to the same signal at different time point with different memory modules, the circuit can distinguish these signals and finally put them in the proper sequential order. The structure is the most important part of our sequential memory device. And it is the only difference between Two-signal system and Multi-signal system.
The main idea of this part is to make the memory modules follow the order from the Clock signal. Here we made an interactive animation below to help you to better understand these important structures.
Try to move your mouse slowly from the left time zone to the right one.
This animation will show you how our system works when it meets the Target Signal below.

Groningen,2012,Team:Groningen#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," order to observe the effect of NH4 uptake on the TnrA, it was necessary to have a concise behavioral diagram.     Unfortunately, no such diagram existed. The diagram for nitrogen metabolism on the KEGG database identified most    of what was involved, but did so in an unclear manner.
Results
The figure below used the behavioral information from literature to highlight the active and inactive pathways during     ammonium uptake. In terms of the project, the creation of this diagram brought to light a critical problem for using     TnrA to sense extracellular NH4/NH3+; TnrA is only active when glutamine synthetase (GS) is actively converting NH4 to     glutamine. This in turn is regulated by cell growth, not the amount of NH4/NH3+ present. However, in one article it was    observed that GS is also active under conditions of nitrogen limitation. If the medium contained the precise amount of    glutamine necessary to support the initial growth phase, then the glutamine would be depleted at the sensing phase.    GS would activate to try and create more glutamine. GS would only deactivate when the amount of extracellular NH4/NH3+     reached a level to remove the lack of nitrogen as factor limiting further growth.
The real result? If this sensing pathway was selected, then the wetwork team would have to find the necessary levels of     glutamine to exploit the edge of nitrogen limitation. Possible, but not exactly the easiest mechanism to implement for the consumer market.

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

TU_Delft,2016,Team:TU Delft#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," for the first 4 years of the startup is equal to about €1.200.000. In the first phase we want to apply on grants and government loans such as STW: Take off 1 for feasibility studies (€40k subsidy) and Take off 2 for early stage financing (up to €250k loan). There are multiple funds that provide loans for promising startups. For example, funds such as UNIIQ,  a proof of concept fund that can offer up to €300k in convertible debt financing, and which is partially set up by TU Delft, Erasmus Medical Centre, the University of Leiden and the regional development agency. With these we hope to obtain a capital of €500.000 with an average interest rate of 8%. Furthermore, we hope to receive in total €150.000 of grants from for example the governmental “Demonstratie energie-innovatie” fund that gives grands to companies that do research into green energy innovation. Finally, we are searching investors that are prepared to invest for a total of €550.000 in our company. The TU Delft will be an investor and could also be a contribute in kind. Furthermore, also Shift Invest is a potential investor. We estimate that with these funds we can come to a stage where regular commercial financing becomes a possibility, or that we reach a point where a large solar panel manufacturer is willing to take over our business.
Profitability
Based on the market size analysis, the potential market size is estimated to be equal to 187,5 MW. Currently the average power of a solar panel is equal to 0,0000137 MW/m2. Based on these data there is an estimated market of almost 1.500.000 m2 in the next 4 years. As described in the customer analysis, the total added valued of the microlens arrays is equal to at least 897 euro/m2. We estimate to sell the microlens arrays for 30% of this profit. This means that the selling price is equal to €270.
Figure 8: Profitability of BioLens
Based on this conservative estimate it appears that the costs are already covered at a much lower sales volume than the estimated potential market in the first four years. We are well aware of the many uncertainties in these calculations. However, since there is still a large margin between the breakeven point and the expected sales, we dare to say that the BioLens microlens array is profitable.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," Cornell startup which led us to them. In order to combat pythium, a form of fungal infection, they use lower water temperatures in their growth tanks. We encountered and talked to Serdar, CEO of PureSpinach, who gave us insight on farming and monitoring of his products. He was especially concerned with the temperature of his system, which needs to be carefully regulated in order to keep the spinach growing. He also emphasized the necessity for large-scale testing to ensure the validity of our findings.
Businesses
Overview
We contacted vendors and distributors of hydroponic supplies who gave us insight into the viability and practicality of our device. They informed us on how large-scale hydroponic farms are laid-out and operated on a daily basis. These “big picture” contacts inspired the software integration of our biological and hardware parts of our project. Their insight helped us design a sleek, streamlined and consumer friendly-product adapted for all hydroponic growing conditions.
Key Takeaways
Businesses put an emphasis on minimizing and reducing waste in hydroponic growing.
Growers would invest in better equipment if there is a large return value even with high upfront costs.
Data is key. Businesses and growers would like to see live data from their hydroponic tanks not only for growth monitoring, but to streamline expensive documentation and certification processes. The interface should be easy to use, interactive, and informative. We responded to this feedback by developing a user-friendly software to integrate with OxyPonics hardware and and biological components.The dashboard features real-time analytics of key environmental markers such as pH, conductivity, and of course oxidative stress levels. More information on the user interface can be found in our applied design section.

Vertical Harvest Hydroponics, based in Alaska, is a veteran-owned agricultural technology company aimed at providing innovative farming solutions around the world. Vertical Harvest recently rolled out the 4th generation of their product, a hydroponic farm in a box, geared towards northern climates. We spoke to Cameron Willingham, the founder of Vertical Harvest, who provided us with insight on the business aspect of hydroponics and the technical aspect of building a reliable, low maintenance hydroponics system. Specifically, they wanted to make their designs simple, hardy, and robust to ensure self sufficiency and versatility of their hydroponic systems.Their products and comments reminded us that our product needed a sleek and hassle-free profile. This was a big emphasis as we designed our user interface, where we incorporated graphs and visually uncluttered representations of the analytics from the hydroponic farm, but"

UPTAKE OF FLUORESCENT LABELED FLAGELLIN
 
Cells were seeded into 8-well μ-slides and after 24 h transfected with TLR5 receptor or kept untransfected for blank control. Proteins were directly administered to HEK293 cells 24 h post-transfection. As a negative control, Alexa Fluor 555 was diluted in 1x PBS buffer with its absorbance matching that of the chimeric protein. Simultaneously, Alexa Fluor 633-labeled human transferrin (Invitrogen - Molecular Probes) was added to label early endosomes. The samples were incubated for 1h at 37°C, washed with PBS and imaged using a Leica TCS SP6 confocal microscope with a 543 nm and a 633 nm laser beam.
 
 
SURFACE EXPRESSION OF CHIMERIC FLAGELLIN
To evaluate whether chimeric proteins are expressed on the bacterial surface, bacteria were transformed with several chimeric flagellin-coding plasmids and grown in liquid meida. 5 h after IPTG induction they were harvested and incubated with mouse anti-His antibodies (Qiagen) for 1h at room temperature. After that they were washed 3 times with PBS buffer and incubated for another 1h with goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Imgenex) at room temperature in the dark. Stained bacteria were visualized using a Leica TCS SP6 confocal microscope.

To start the game and acquire special skills, player must touch the virtual promoter and             terminator, respectively. If players touch the wrong gene, the gene chains will be overloaded, which means they             are cleared and regenerated. Players are provided with four special skills: explosion (reduce the blood volume             of all enemies), blood supplement (return to full-blood status), no-enemy status and shooting speed acceleration. What's more, players will get extra rewards when they find symbols of ""BioDesigner Dolphin"".
After players complete the game, their duration time and scores acquired will be ranked on the leaderboard in             the main UI interface. What’s more, to make the game more interesting, there is also a rewarding mechanism.

PCR Protocols
PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction)
1. Amplifying from a plasmid or isolated sample of DNA
You have a tube of linear or plasmid DNA like that from the registry directly and don’t want to wait for the the transformation and miniprep. (note: you should go through the time-intensive transformation in parallel regardless).
In this case, you need first to know the concentration of your sample. If you don’t know it or it was not provided, you can learn the concentration for your sample by using the nanodrop machine located in room 347. It depends on the size of your template, but as a general rule, you need on the order of 25-50 ng template minimum for a successful PCR, so adjust the volume of your template in your PCR accordingly.
2. Colony PCR You can also amplify plasmid or genomic DNA straight from live cultures of organisms containing your desired sequence. You will usually have cultures in one of two forms: either in liquid culture, or spread on an agar plate. If you are amplifying from liquid culture, grow it up as much as you can and add 1μL of the culture to the PCR mix. If you're amplifying from the plate, there is no need to add a volume; instead, simply take a pipette with a pipette tip from the green box, gently touch the pipette tip to the desired colony on the plate (try to take as little from the plate as possible; agar can screw up PCRs), and then insert your pipette tip into the PCR mixture and pipette up and down to mix.

Q5 Polymerase
Q5 is a fast, high-fidelity polymerase that even beats Phusion. Unlike Taq, Q5 produces blunt-end amplicons. It’s also very expensive so treat it carefully.

Traditional way of delivering a lecture is necessary in building a fundamental knowledge about synthetic biology and IGEM; however, it can hardly leave a deep impression to others, especially to those who have never heard the concept. Thus, we conducted a series of activities to lead ordinary students first to perceive, to try, and then to hear and to know.
