Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.
Fengzhi LI

TU_Delft-Leiden,2014,Team:TU Delft-Leiden#Human Practices#Appendix_-_-_TEXT.html," making cluster munitions is prohibited. In our view, investment is also assistance, but this is not explicitly stated in the CCM. We try to create a norm that investment in such companies is not-done, which might result in countries banning cluster munitions investments.”
Since the PAX campaign against cluster munitions is a very good example of how such organizations work, we discussed it in further detail. “It all started in 2007 with a controversial Zembla documentary ‘Het Clusterbom Gevoel’ (the cluster bomb feeling) on which we collaborated. This  caused widespread civil unrest. Since then, we have provided MPs with input for anti-cluster munitions motions and did lobbying efforts at various ministries. We also publish a yearly report, Worldwide Investments in Cluster Munitions: A Shared Responsibility, in which we present a survey of financial institutions which invest in companies who make cluster munitions, or, on the other side, financials who have very good practices concerning cluster munitions; you could call it a naming-and-shaming approach.” In the end, the campaign resulted in the Netherlands becoming one of the first countries to prohibit investments in companies making cluster munitions.
The Stop Explosive Investments campaign is not only important as a means to create a cluster munitions-free world: “We try to establish a precedent in international humanitarian law that investments are seen as assistance, so that when for example a treaty against nuclear weapons comes along, signees are forced to ban investments in nuclear weapons.”
We were wondering why the ICBL and the CMC, involved in what appear to be the quite distinct subject of respectively landmines and cluster munitions, joined forces. Ms. Oosterwijk explains: “You should realize that the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT) is very unique. It’s a great case of civil diplomacy, since it was instigated not by the UN but by a group of benevolent countries in cooperation with civil society, international organizations, military experts, etc. . The goal is to end humanitarian suffering. The CCM is based on the LMT. The humanitarian imperative is the same and the texts are largely identical. Both treaties include provisions to end use and production of the weapons and also for the destruction of stockpiles of those weapons. Besides that, both landmines and cluster munitions are weapons adhering to the no distinction principle, which means that they are not aimed at a specific target, but kill people, soldiers and civilians alike, at random. Also, when sub munitions of a cluster bomb do not explode, they turn into de facto landmines. Because of that"

We stained inoculated biofilms and performed the Crystal Violet assay. Left in 37 C for 36 hours. We did 4 trials 100uL, 4 trials 200uL, and 4 trials 300uL. Biofilm formation was successful, with varying band thickness. We also replicated this with two 5mL LB petri dish inoculated with 20uL E.coli. We added 5mL of crystal violet each to the petri dishes to cover the whole plate.
We also performed an oxalic acid gradient with 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 2.0% oxalic acid to give a final volume of 6mL. We added 20uL of E.coli to each 6mL tube. Left in 37 C.
We did a 1/100 dilution of E.coli into LB media, and left it in 37 C for (hopefully) 24 hours. We did 4 trials 100uL, 4 trials "

Future Work
Future work mostly revolves around bringing darwin from a standalone diff-producing executable to an integrated system with a GUI usable by novices. The major challenge with that is parsing the plethora of different file types used to represent DNA although the implementation of other formats such as SBOL, ApE, etc., could be done easily by extracting the actual genetic sequence from the file.
In addition, the current algorithms are unable to deal with introns of any sort in the input DNA sequence, and will attempt to split the file into ORFs regardless. The ability to correctly identify non-coding regions like this would create a far more valuable piece of software, able to deal with prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," the development of new antimicrobial drugs; agriculture, outlining how the use of synthetic biology to assist in screening plant lines for desirable traits could significantly streamline the breeding process; and economy, warning that if Scotland ignores the opportunities that SynBio has to offer then the country may lose business to others who do not.
Professor Richard Cogdell followed with a rousing talk on the future of SynBio in general, giving the example of an experiment whereby Geobacter sp. had been kept alive solely by electricity generated from solar panels via electrodes which contact extracelluar nanowires. Prof Cogdell suggested that this phenomenon might be exploited for large-scale storage of surplus energy from wind-farms (which currently must be shut down when over-producing electricity) in the form of chemical bonds. Prof Cogdell was emphatic in his espousal of the iGEM competition as a driving force for the future of SynBio, citing our team’s efforts to engage with the people who would benefit from the technology as an example of how to create a more trusting and transparent relationship between science and society. This was a great honour for the team!
A stimulating discussion on public relations, intellectual property and global considerations followed the talks which we hope foreshadows the Giant Jamboree in exploring the issues at the heat of SynBio.
We were joined by the Edinburgh and Aberdeen iGEM teams in giving a poster session after the talks and discussion, this was an excellent opportunity to discuss our projects and network with members and fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
Special regards and thanks to our own Dave Burrell for working hard to organise the involvement of the iGEM teams in this event – to the benefit of all in attendance.
Sharing our resources
We provided bacterial strains and plasmids to team Berlin to aid them in their magnetic bacteria project. Constructs from Dundee iGEM 2011 team’s Sphereactor were sent to Oxford iGEM for the creation of their chlorinated waste disposal system.
Completing Surveys
We answered surveys for Linköping University, Sweden on peanut allergies; Warwick University, UK on the public’s opinion on synthetic biology; ETH Zürich, Switzerland on complexity in everyday life and for University of São Paulo, Brazil on ethics in biology.
We also discussed division of labor within our team with the Edinburgh iGEM team.

Yale,2014,Team:Yale#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," and isolation of our construct and that can be readily cleaved. The  LL-37 antimicrobial peptide, which is short enough to be inserted via primer overhang, is linked via a 36 residue linker, which we believe is long enough not to engender any unforeseen structural interaction between our domains. On the other side of the foot protein, we included an sfGFP connected by a shorter linker, which will be used to assay presence and yield of construct. Using targeted primers, the construct can be amplified in its entirety, or only with the anti-microbial or GFP segment. Note that the entire construct was designed so that a variety of functional peptide domains can be substituted for LL-37 if desired. A diagram of our entire construct is presented below:
Figure 2. A diagram illustrating the components in our final construct. The black domain is our anti-microbial peptide, LL-37, while the blue domain represents the recombinant mussel foot protein adhesive component. All other components are labeled accordingly and restriction sites are highlighted to emphasize the modularity of each separate region.
Characterize peptide's adhesion and anti-microbial properties:
We intend to perform a number of assays to test the erosion resistance of our adhesive coating using an original apparatus designed to introduce erosion by laminar flow through a liquid bath. The specific tests that we investigated for adhesion testing are detailed in the Materials and Methods section.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Integrated Practices#ED_-_-_TEXT.html," it is unrealistic to believe that there is one individual for all, who can act as a multi-purpose role model. Another area where both Dr Dixon and Professor Ryan agreed was in the fact that the mentor could be at any level including direct peers
we need to make sure we’ve got a variety of visible role models
. Over the process of these interviews, the idea of a good role model has changed from being someone who just inspires an individual to do something, to a necessary part of every student and academics life. For improving equality and diversity, having a ‘diverse’ range of role models surrounding every individual already promotes diversity on the small scale, and could affect people’s preconceptions about gender equality up the levels in science. Professor Ryan highlighted:
(You can’t) just (say) this woman has been successful in science isn't she great, you really want to say anyone can be successful
As a society, we need to make sure that when it comes to role models, we are not just highlighting individuals who are successful in science, we want to people who are relatable, successful, interesting and engaging. Furthermore, this affects how we approach maternity and paternity leave in science. There is already a bias among men and women, that women take time off to have the child and men continue to be the breadwinner. Dr Dixon talked about the pressures men were under to provide for the family so soon after childbirth and the conflict this might cause in the family. This is especially shown if both partners were scientists as the male would pull ahead in terms of numbers of publications and academic impact and the female partner may be left feeling like an add-on to the career of the male partner. Professor Ryan stressed that
It's important not just to show women who have children as being good role models
we also need
male professors or males that are successful who talk about having their children
. Because of this, we may be able to inspire male partners to consider taking time off to be with the baby in a parental leave. Professor Ryan highlight the inherent bias with many male attitudes to parental leave saying:
When you ask men in areas where there is parental leave available to them they said they won't take it as it will harm their career
Whether changing this attitude is possible by give men more of the right kind of role models, or if there is another answer, what is clear, is that this attitude needs to change. If men are uncomfortable with taking time away from their career, preventing their career progression, but are comfortable with allowing their female partner to take time off, or leave their career altogether, then we need"

Good Afternoon, my name is Eric Wong and i am a graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School class of 2009.  I am current pursuing my education in CCSF hoping to transfer into the UC system with the intended major of Molecular Cell Development. I was apart of the iGem team last year and in the time span of 4 months i have learned so many various things from running Assays, Cloning, Troubleshooting and analyzing Experiments and Data. I enjoyed the experience so much so that i decided to come back this year as a mentor for this year's team. I view this and last years iGem experience as something more than just a competition, I has given me the necessary education experience to prepare me for this field of study and allow me to learn about different project from various teams.

This is my second year of involvement and the second year the Cell Propulsion Lab has hosted the team. It was quite an experience to set up the program this year, especially since this is a subject area that we had not begun working on in the Cell Propulsion Lab. The immune response to cancer is a challenging topic to take on (especially coupled with synthetic biology) and required an intensive two week bootcamp to teach the students basic concepts and endogenous systems/parts that they should be aware of. We challenged the students to come up with designs for synthetic cytotoxicity logic gates and increasing the cytotoxic response. It was quite rewarding to see them propose various devices during their team challenge and to see them take charge of getting them prioritized, made , and tested. Things did not always go smoothly, after all this goes with the territory. They had to learn to be organized, think on their feet, and be problem solvers.......quite a growth opportunity that I’m sure will stay with them for the rest of their lives.

As Q5 PCR seemed to fail, both chitinases were digested with EcoRI and PstI and cloned into pSB1C3 with heat shock transformation. Both the PCR products were used as well as the synthetic genes as supplied by IDT. The transformation worked well. Colony PCR to confirm insert size failed, so a plasmid purification was done for 5 colonies from each transformation. These were analysed with a OneTaq PCR with VF2 and VR primers. The same program was used as in Table 2, except the annealing temperature was 51 degrees Celsius and the extension time was 210 seconds.

My future plans include entering into a Masters program in Medical Genetics or Human Genetics, and pursuing this discipline towards a PhD.  I enjoy reading books about the human genome and advancements in stem cell research.  In my spare time I like to play a variety of sports that I am not necessarily good at: soccer, softball, and dodge ball.  I see iGEM as an extraordinary opportunity for me to be exposed to real life research, in which my knowledge of molecular genetics will be challenged, and will help me further my  understanding of Synthetic Biology.

Biological Sciences and Chemistry
I am interested in a research career after I finish my degree.  I am leaning towards the field of Microbiology to study the many micro-organisms that have not yet been discovered.  However, I may enroll in graduate studies after my undergraduate degree to expand my knowledge and gain more experience in the laboratory.  Being in a competitive team and atmosphere is a motivating and exciting opportunity that I do not want to miss out on.  By creating the smallest artificial E. coli genome we can extend future research.  We are attempting to understand and standardize the E. coli genome so that this methodology can be applied to more complex model organisms.

Stategy for the Classic Prisoners' Dilemma.
Abstract
So, how do we emulate this prisoner’s dilemma using genetically engineered E coli?
The reason to use mathematic modeling
the model
What's the difference?
Numerical experiments

2.2.Solitary confinement with environmental AHL to help neutralize detox Zeocin
3.3. The classic prisoner’s dilemma
Oscillation and crush
Abstract
Our model is to simulate an E coli cell-cell mutual help system that we are implementing to study the class game theory problem of prisoner's dilemma. Speciafically we designed two types of E coli cells to act as the two “prisoners” in a single enclosed environment with toxic chemical . The behavior of each “prisoner” under isolated interrogation is designed with constitutive promoter of different strength, with the weaker promoter mimic defect and the stronger promoter mimics cooperates. The results of such promoter is to detox the other cell while poison itself. The fate of one “prisoner” is related to the growth rate or density of one particular cell. We used mathematic modeling to quantitatively explore the consequence of each strategy of the classic prisoner’s dilemma.
So, how do we emulate this prisoner’s dilemma using genetically engineered E coli?
The toxic chemical is antibiotics Zeocin, which can be detox with the expression an antidote gene (zeo-resistent gene) to neutralized Zeocin. Without the antidote, the cell will either grow slower or die, with the antidote, it would grow happily. If “prisoner A” is collaborative to “prisoner B’, it would have a strong promoter to express an enzyme LasI to produce 12-carbon AHL (3OC12-HSL), a quorum sensing molecule to help B’s survive and grow in the environment. In the mean time, A itself makes sacrifice by also express an toxic protein that only worked on itself. The beneficial cell B utilizes the 3OC12-HSL to turn on an antidote gene (zeo-resistent gene) to protect the cell from the toxic chemical. If A cell is the traitor, it would not produce"

Camp Simcha's NYC Wetware Science Lab Workshop
Camp Simcha is a camp for children with physical challenges. In summer 2010 Yossi Steinberger joined the Camp Simcha staff as the instructor for an Origami Workshop. Based on the campers’ response to an ingenious analogy between origami and protein folding, Yossi realized that many campers would love to do some science at camp. Most of the workshops at camp are geared toward arts-and-crafts, but the campers comprise a rather brainy group, and were excited at the prospect of thinking and learning about the world. Yossi pitched the idea for a new science workshop to the camp directors - the Camp Simcha Science Laboratory. They responded enthusiastically. Over the course of the year, Yossi recruited friends to help think of exciting projects and even to run the new science workshop. Many people joined a collaborative Google doc, that quickly reached dizzying lenghs. The NYC iGEM Wetware team pooled its efforts to plan the final curriculum for the summer; Yossi and David joined the campers at Simcha to run the Laboratory, and they even recruited Yossi’s cousin Shlomo, an outsider who was inspired at the prospect of showing kids in need a great time through science.
The Camp Simcha Lab aimed to provide young scientist campers with interesting projects and activities, and especially with sound scientific explanations. But a major goal of the Lab was to engage the scientific imaginations of all the campers through a series of fun and enlightening experiments. Some of our experiments appealed only to the particularly science-inclined campers, but we made sure there was something for everybody - who doesn’t enjoy Coke-and-Mentos explosions or an egg drop competition (we did both).
As first attempts go, we consider our Simcha Lab a success. See our blog"

Kinetic Modeling
Enzyme kinetics is the study of the chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. The reaction rate is measured under different environmental conditions to determine the overall functionality of the protein. By studying an enzyme’s kinetics, one can determine the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or agonist might inhibit the function of the enzyme. Our team looked at the kinetic modeling to help determine if the activity of our model protein of ACC deaminase, PDB 1TYZ, was efficient.

Figure 5: K dissociation constants for each selected step in the ACC pathway.
Following the Michaelis-Menten hypothesis and plotting the experimental values for dissociation constants shown below in Table 1, a graphical representation, Figure 6, of the ACC deaminase reaction was created.

Figure 6: The graph above shows the relationship between substrate/enzyme concentration and time it takes for the reaction to reach completion. This information is important to determine efficiency and activity.
1TYZ Structural Modeling Using PYMOL
To probe the possibilities of mutating some of the residues surrounding the active site, specifically Tyr294, several observations of this protein structure were noted by manipulating the 3D model of ACC deaminase, 1TYZ. A gem-diamine intermediate is trapped in the enzyme complex with ACC, and Tyr294 is in close proximity to the pro-S methylene carbon of ACC in the gem-diamine complexes. This indicates a direct role of this residue in the ring-opening reaction and also suggesting that Tyr294 may also be responsible for the abstraction of the alpha-proton from D-amino acids, a precursor to the subsequent deamination reaction. These structural data provide evidence favoring a"

Joint expression of SOD and yCCS from pEX
Me and Mimmi were discussing the upcoming expression of SOD and its helper chaperone yCCS. Based on an article by Ahl, Lindberg and Tibell (2004) , we decided that the two proteins should be expressed in equal amounts (1:1) from the same vector. Since we only have one expression vector (pEX) available, this requires some modifications.
Our idea is to construct a SOD/yCCS operon from which the two genes can be co-transcribed. This will require a new Shine-Dalgarno (RBS) sequence for translation of the second gene in the operon.

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"D1 for help. In Tianjin University 2010, pYD1 is used for surface display. But this year we need the yeast elements instead.
In the very beginning, we intended to use circular PCR to modify pYD1, keep pGAL1, PUC Origin, ampicillin resistance gene, CEN6/ARS4, TRP1 orf and terminator regions, and use specific primers to add the restriction sites for tor2 gene insertion. With time went by, we found that the circular PCR is not so accurate and stable when come across large fragment. Therefore we changed the strategy that only CEN4/ARS6, TRP1 orf and terminator regions in pYD1 are amplified and inserted into pSB1A11 by a single restriction sites. On the other hand, tor2 gene is already inserted before. The promoter and ampicillin resistance gene already exist in the vector, and consequently an E. coli vector is successfully transformed to a recombinant yeast vector named pYD11. What’s more, with CEN element, pYD11 could convey target gene into the yeast nucleus, functioning like another yeast chrosome. Our engineered tor2 gene was eventually electrotransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 strain.
With the planning mutagenesis, our experiment still needs to be continued. Now that we intend to release the allergic symptom and increase the tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to FAP, the module should work under a detecting and self-controlled mechanism. That is to say, trigger the Mut-tor2 when FAP has disrupted the normal intracellular physiology and phosphrylation, and terminate the process when environment is recovered. Our goal is to reach a steady state in a relatively short period that the yeast cell growth and ethanol productivity is not inhibited by FAP. In fact, we may not eliminate the inhibition thoroughly with the feedback system, but at least the allergy is released and tolerance is improved to a certain degree.
To reach the goal, a detecting and delivering part is essential. We picked up four inducible promoters regulated by transcription factors, whose entry into nucleus are stimulated by FAP generating dephosphorylation. Insert these promoters into the vector before Mut-tor2 gene and reporter gene of EGFP. The production of Mut-TOR2 would form Mut-TORC1 resistant to FAP. The rising quantities of active mTORC1 could help recover the cell growth and intracellular phosphorylation, leading to more RTG1/3 being excluded out of the nucleus,"

V Analysis
    Fig. 2 tells us that when Peasants and Civilians coexist in the medium, Civilians grow more than the group in which Civilians live alone. Also, the number of Civilians becomes larger than the negative control group if the primitive fraction of peasant is larger. Contrarily, the number of Civilians does not become larger if the primitive quantity of Peasants is too big while the original number of Civilians is too small. And this is considered acceptable. Besides, as is revealed, Civilians grows fastest when the primitive ratio of Peasants and Civilians is 1.
    The results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 are also in line with expectation. Fig. 1 demonstrates that when the concentration of Arabinose is 40μM, Civilians cannot live without Peasants, which means the cells in the medium mainly live on sucrose instead of arabinose. However, Civilians can grow alone if the concentration of arabinose is up to 100 μM, which may provide extra carbon sources. This comparison tells that 40μM is an appropriate concentration which is able to ask cells to live on sucrose but not arabinose.

Our initial ideas
Looking into Epigenetic modifications and how these could influence gene expression over time.
Long term genetic stability of the population or individual parts – Biobrick stability
A device which could activate a lytic cycle of bacteriophage, their DNA incorporated into our bacteria
A method of interfering with quorum sensing e.g. the absence of TNT terminates QS. A second signal then initiates killing of the cells.
Using our synthetic Promoter (indirectly sensitive to TNT) to activate the kill switch device when the levels of TNT are low enough
RNA aptamers to TNT
Then having a timer so that it would continue to degrade the explosives even below the low triggering concentration
Timer using small cis/trans acting RNA molecules
Initial Research
It was decided that we would be investigating the retention of function of the kill switch over time. The notion that kill switches are inherently unstable was discussed as bacteria containing a device designed to kill it are at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to those without or those acquiring even a small mutation if it were enough to render the device functionally less active or completely inactive therefore allowing the cells to live.
In order to test the kill switch part over time, research was done into the E. coli long term evolution experiments in which the separate populations of E. coli are kept growing and each day 1% of the culture is transferred to the next container of minimal media. This set up would have been possible in our lab though may have required a lot of space in the shaking incubators and unfortunately there were also serious issues with contamination.
Another source of inspiration for the work came from the Jove set up of multiplex chemostat arrays . The idea that it would not be necessary to physically move cultures by hand was appealing although it proved difficult to source all of the necessary equipment.
It was decided instead to monitor the cells as they grow under different conditions in a high throughput manner. Using a 96 well microplate and plate reader it was possible to obtain a lot of data about how growth is affected.  The online registry was searched and many different parts used in previous kill switch designs were found including toxin-antitoxin systems for example, holin/antiholin or MazF/E in Bacillus, there were also RNA exonucleases and mechanisms of inhibiting of DNA gyrase on the registry. After assessing multiple parts it was decided that part BBa_K628806 was to be selected for testing.

Penn,2014,Team:Penn State#CodonOptimization_-_-_TEXT.html," thought of as an extra dial that can be tuned to rationally control output of genetic systems.
Background
Codon optimization refers to the idea that the individual codons of a gene in a specific organism can be changed in order to alter the behavior of that organism. This relies on an understanding of the central dogma of biology, which states that any organism produces proteins by first transcribing genetic material in the form of DNA to RNA, which is then “read” by ribosomes which produce proteins based on the sequence of amino acids in that RNA. The reading of the RNA is done three nucleotides at a time, and these three letter series of nucleotides are called codons. Codons specify to the ribosome which amino acid to add to a growing amino acid chain.
There are 4 nucleotides, thus 43, or 64 codons are possible.  Since there are only 20 amino acids, there is redundancy in the codons, that is, some amino acids are specified by multiple codons. There is no ambiguity, however, meaning that each codon specifies only one amino acid.  Codons that code for the same amino acid are called degenerate codons, and even though these degenerate codons code for the same amino acid, they do not necessarily lead to the same expression levels of that amino acid.
Degenerate codons do not necessarily lead to equally efficient expression of an amino acid.
Our Objectives
1) Find Criteria for Optimizing Genes in E. coli
All coding sequences were designed so that there would be no difference between the amino acid profile of the variant GFP and the original superfolder GFP. This ensured that each gene led to the expression of the same protein.
Previous researchers have determined through a statistical analysis of the entire genome that some degenerate codons occur more often in protein coding sequences and some are more infrequent. These are referred to as common and rare codons. The importance of this is that protein expression in cells is limited either by either translation initiation rate (TIR) or translation elongation rate, and it is theorized that commonly occurring codons will have faster elongation rates than degenerate rare codons. Translation initiation rate can be artificially controlled by varying the strength of the ribosome binding site (RBS), which consists of the genetic sequence that precedes the protein coding sequences (CDS) of a gene. This is accomplished through the use of the RBS calculator, and in previous research was used to steadily increase the RBS strength of a gene, GFP mut3b, the expression of which was then characterized.

Week 1 --- 04.08.14 - 08.08.14
In the first week we successfully transformed the E.coli strain XL-10-Gold with all our received parts. pUC57-aGal and pUC57-NAGA, containing two of our Enzymes came in a shipping from Genscript.  pRSH10.1-SNAP, containing the SNAP-Tag was a donation from a working group at our own institute. We also recieved pEX-A2-Intein, containing our N-split-intein from Eurofins. We minipreped the constructs and controlled them by restriction. We also transformed XL-10-Gold with pSB1C3- SpyCatcher , which we got from the registry, but got a lawn on the plate. It turned out that the used XL-10-Gold did already have a resistance against chloramphenicol, which is selected for in pSB1C3.  Besides that, we ran tests with several lab devices, including the gel documentation system where we also tested out our DNA ladder and our DNA-Stain-G, which we were not confident in and decided to switch to Midori Green instead.
Week 2 --- 11.08.14 - 15.08.14

During our time in their lab, we helped each other go through protocols and compared results of experiments. For instance, for two of the calibrations, they aided us in using the equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence and for cell measurement, we shared our results to help them find errors that had led the rejection upon their first submission. The photos below demonstrate how we closely collaborated each step of the way. We had frequent discussion through the whole process about the protocols, the experiments, data processing, etc. We also set up a WeChat group for further discussion after the experiment. Our collaboration eventually led to both of our successes in completing InterLab. The following demonstrates in details how we have collaborated during and out of InterLab.
How they helped us?
-----Laboratory and equipment: They kindly shared with us their lab and equipment to measure absorbance and fluorescence for the InterLab study, due to our lack of a suitable equipment. In the photo below, they were helping us prepare the 96-well plate for measurement of absorbance and fluorescence.
-----Transformation: They helped us perform transformation and amplification of plasmid pSB1C3-vHB from well 16E of Kit Plate 5. This is a key part of our experiment, we really appreciate their help, which made our experiment possible.
How we helped them?

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#HumanPractices#IntegratedHumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," the experience of Sanquin helped a lot in optimizing our DNA extraction method. In addition, they pointed at the delay in red blood cell development, which gave us the idea to extend our model to include the whole process of gene doping and its effect.
Targeted Sequencing
Professor on Therapeutic Gene Modulation Hidde Haisma gave us insight in the most attractive methods for athletes for gene doping. Also, he gave us information on the detection possibilities for gene doping, for example the presence of exon-exon junctions due to the removal of introns, a distinct promotor for increased expression and viral vectors to penetrate into the human cells. Furthermore, he inspired us with his research in whole genome sequencing for gene doping detection and his limitations concerning data analysis. Reducing our data output for less complicated data analysis became one of our requirements for our gene doping detection method.
“I expect athletes that would be using gene doping now to use either plasmids or adenoviruses as vectors.”
Alina Ham, Gerard Coyne and Angelica Vittori from Oxford Nanopore Technologies inspired us to adapt our initial idea, which would involve detection of target sequences based on dCas9-affinity and subsequent nanopore blocking. The forces exerted by the motor protein were suggested to overcome dCas9 affinity, and were most likely to push off the DNA-binding protein. This important advice made us change our project from a detection method based on signal absence towards a methodology striving for targeted sequencing.
Fusion Protein for Targeted Sequencing and Library Preparation
The idea for our fusion protein came through several phases. We read about Zinc finger and Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), but wanted to improve on the versatility to anticipate the plethora of changes that could be made to the genes used as gene doping. Therefore, we came up with a Cas9 based protein with a flexible guide RNA library after elaborate discussions with amongst others prof. Stan Brouns. Later, during a presentation at the Delft Health Initiative, CRISPR experts challenged our approach because of the on and off target effects of dxCas9, but praised our idea for its versatility and thereby its probably functionality.
Prof. Chirlmin Joo and Viktoria Globyte advised us on this functionality of our fusion protein in its early stages, providing us with a confident start of the wet lab fusion protein production.
“Cas9 scanning and kicking off from non-target DNA is faster than transposase cutting.”

NAIT_Edmonton,2015,Team:NAIT Edmonton#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," you are raring to go! But before you hit the labs, you need an idea for a project, so how do you actually get an idea?  Through interviewing some of the teams we found that there was a few methods you can use to come up with an idea to pursue for the competition.
Let’s take a look at some of these Teams:
The University of KU Leuven is a long time participant in the iGEM competition, having competed for the last five years. Every year, however, there is a new group of students, and this year their team chose not to build on the previous year’s work, but to create their own.
So how did they design their project?
Team KU Leuven’s approach was, starting from the month of January to do weekly meetings to discuss potential project ideas in small groups and then narrow the ideas down so that the team collectively decide on one topic for the focus of their research.  Once the project was decided on, when the summer started they were able to focus on their lab work to bring their vision to life.
We believe that this was a successful method to approach the project design, because of their time management. By starting in January, they gave themselves the freedom to really explore what problem they can address using synthetic biology and to properly plan what resources they would need for the summer.
However it is important to note that this was done during their winter semester and while participating in the iGEM competition is an extremely good learning opportunity and experience, we must remember that we should not let it distract us while in the classroom. Interestingly enough, some universities actually have courses that can prepare you for the competition! For example at the University of Alberta, through the department of biochemistry in the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry they offer BIOCH 482: Design and Construction of Synthetic Biological Systems. This course is designed to prepare students for participation in the iGEM Competition through team-based problem solving.
So if you choose to use Team KU Leuven’s approach to project design, be sure to check your course listings at your institution to see if you can make the make the experience work doubly for you!
We’ve taken a look at a team that designed before the summer now let’s take a look at a team that designed at the beginning of summer…
The Eindhoven Institute of Technology is no stranger to iGEM. Their institution has competed multiple times, and they have a new team each year with a unique project. So how did they choose to design their project for this year’s competition circuit?
In the first month they began searching for problems and"

2.5g yeast extract
5g NaCl
7.5g agar (Only necessary if making LB agar plates)
500mL of dH2O (distilled water)
Materials
1L pyrex bottle
1L graduated cylinder
filter paper and scupula
Stack of sterile plates (this protocol makes approximately 25)
Bunsen Burner/Ethanol burner
70% EtOH wash bottle
Paper towels/wipes
Procedure
Part 1: Making the LB broth
This step can be carried out at a regular lab bench.
Obtain a clean 1L pyrex bottle
Obtain a graduated cylinder with 500mL of dH2O and add to the bottle. Record the amount added
Using filter paper, separately measure out 5g of NaCl, 5 g of Tryptone, and 2.5g of yeast extract on a scale and add them to the bottle. Swirl the bottle in a circular motion to mix. Remember to recalibrate your scales in between measurements.
If you are making LB agar plates, weigh and add 7.5g of agar and swirl to mix. Record the amount added.
Note the contents do not necessarily need to be completely in solution before autoclaving
Part 2: Autoclaving ***ONLY DONE BY MANAGERS AND LEADS***
Lightly seal the top of the beaker with aluminium foil, and label the beaker with autoclave tape. Include LB (agar)- your name- date- media number- IGEM.
** Unless you have been trained to use the autoclave, you will not be conducting the following steps 6-9.
Use appropriate transportation protocols to bring the LB bottle into the autoclave room. Remember to store the beaker in an autoclavable basin, in case of spills.
Check the water level on the autoclave, if necessary. Autoclave on the liquid setting for approximately 20 min.
** The contents of the beaker will be hot after autoclaving, therefore take the necessary measures to prevent burns. **
After auoclaving, allow the LB media to cool to 55oC before handling
Use lazer thermometer to check the temperature of the glass.
The LB broth can be stored in sterile conditions at room temperature, and should be good for 3-4 months. Flame the lip of the bottle each time the LB is used. If the LB contains antibiotics: store in a -4oC freezer.
However it is not recommended to store LB with antibiotics as the"

Outlook
A Fluorescence Answer Faster than Expression
Biosensor systems are usually based on a reporter gene under the control of a promoter directly induced by the biomolecule of interest. In the case of our 2D biosensor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the expression of our fluorescing reporter protein is directly induced by the activity of the bacterium's quorum sensing molecules. However, transcription, translation, folding and post-translational modifications take their time. Since our goal is to detect the pathogen as fast as possible, we aimed to develop a system that provides a fluorescent answer faster than just expressing the fluorescent protein GFP.
Schematic model of a traditional biosensor
In this model, the expression of GFP is directly controlled by a promoter whose activator binds to a molecule secreted by the pathogen.
As an alternative to the traditional approach, we constitutively express our reporter gene in a quenched form. By fusing GFP to REACh, a mutated variant of EYFP, its original fluorescence is thoroughly suppressed. Thereby, a huge stock of temporary inactivated fluorescence proteins is already available prior to first contact with the pathogen. As a conseqence to the uptake of homoserine lactones of P. aeruginosa and binding to the LasI promoter in front of the protease gene, these autoinducers activate the expression of the TEV protease.

Introdution:  An experimental growth period using PCquad Y will be done today.
Procedures:
Colonies successfully grew on the plate that was streaked yesterday.  25mL of LB was added to a culture tube, and 25uL of 100mg/mL carbenicillin was added for a total concentration of 100ug/mL.  Using that same tip that aliquotted the antibiotic, a single colony was picked and the entire tip was injected into the tube (tip was a filter tip, but sterility is questionable).  The culture tube and plate was then walked over to boelter lab, and incubated in the 37C shake incubator at 10:20AM.
IPTG induction: OD600 was checked periodically.  At ~0.6 (0.56 in this case at 4:40PM), 1mM IPTG was added to the culture tube.  The culture was grown for another 3 hours before harvesting by centrifugation.  Centrifugation was done at 4,500g for 20 minutes.  The pellet was resuspended in 1mL of sterile water and centrifuged at max speed for 10 minutes.  The total weight of the cell pellet was 0.095g.
Conclusions:  Protein purification will be done next week in order to determine if this growth protocol was sufficient."

We can also test various PUF binding sites: before the RBS, after the YFP, try using multiple PUF binding sites before the RBS  Suggestion: put the endonuclease site inbetween the RBS and YFP so that when PUF binds we separate the RBS from the reading frame.  Controls: In the positive control, put a PUF binding site, but don’t express PUF. That way we can see that the PUF binding site doesn’t disrupt the YFP expression on it’s own.  Recommendation: This is the immediate and primary focus.  Path 2: PUF between RBS and LacI. If PUF binds then LacI is repressed. The LacI is controlling the YFP, so we now see a modular response to PUF binding. We can also test the different locations of the PUF binding site within this model.  Path 3: UNC has an incomplete project working with a PUF library that recognizes certain genes. We would use the PUF with the endonuclease domain to cut the designated genes. The genes from this library can get made into biobricks.  Details and illustrations of this plan are included in the handout (attached to the meeting minutes).  How are we selling the PUF project? Why are we doing this? Why do people care?  We are creating a research toolkit that uses PUF and linked proteins for translational repression.  This is another technique used to make a gene circuit, but can also be further used in therapeutics, such as treating HIV of myotonic dystrophy"
SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour41_-_-_TEXT.html,"Tet. The LVA tag destabilizes TetR thus lovering the number of TetR proteins. This could explain the better response from induction of TetR with LVA. It can be seen from the coomassie stain below that there is less TetR repressor with LVA than without, supporting this hypothesis.
By using a strain, constitutively expressing tetR with pTet on a low copy plasmid UNIPV-Pavia iGEM 2011 shows here: BBa_R0040:Experience that pTet can be induced by aTc. Thus less TetR repressors in comparison to pTet sites increases the response to inducer, futher supporting the hypothesis.
To analyse the amount of TetR with and without LVA tag present in the cell, coomassie stainging was made on a SDS-page with E. coli K12 (induced by 0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL,  1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL doxycycline) expressing pTet-GFP, pTet-TetR (no LVA)-GFP and pTet-TetR  (+LVA)-GFP, respectively.
Figure 2: Coomassie staining on with E. coli K12 (induced by 0 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 500 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL doxycycline) expressing pTet-GFP, pTet-TetR (no LVA)-GFP and pTet-TetR (+LVA)-GFP, respectively.
The coomassie staining shows that the construct expressing TetR(+LVA) expresses more GFP than the construct expressing TetR(no LVA). In addition to this, the staining shows a higher amount of TetR(no LVA)  in the cell than of TetR(+LVA). This is consistent with the FACS results that illustrates that pTet-TetR(+LVA)  expresses more GFP than pTet-TetR(no LVA). The coomassie staining indicates that the reason for the  higher expression of GFP by pTet-TetR (+ LVA) is because the cell contains less inhibitor. This must be due  to the LVA tag making TetR unstable and tagging it for degradation.
Because pTet is leaky, all cells express GFP"

Nannan Jiang
Nannan Jiang initially developed an interest in global sustainability at the undergraduate level while working with Clifford F. Weil at Purdue University. In pursuing this interest, he was awarded a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) internship to work in the laboratory of Louis A. Sherman with mentor Vilas B. Shukla to investigate polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis in the photosynthetic cyanobacteria. During this time, Nannan realized the power of harnessing microbes to produce compounds such as PHAs, which can be processed into biodegradable plastics. Following his B.S. in Biological Sciences, Nannan pursued his M.S. in Microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, he worked under the direction of William W. Metcalf to study gene regulation in the strictly anaerobic, methanogenic archaea, which produce the clean and renewable energy source methane. With an interest in bioenergy, Nannan then took a post-master’s metabolic engineering position at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. There, he applied molecular genetics to engineer microbial strains as candidates for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) in the BioEnergy Science Center (BESC). Additionally, Nannan has mentored students in ORNL’s SULI and ARC internship programs. Nannan currently works with Frank E. Löffler in discovering the genetic basis for chlorinated solvent degradation in anoxic environments. Nannan is impressed with the University of Tennessee iGEM team and is proud to serve as one of their graduate advisers.

Not only whole clock device, but also the parts we made for this project constitutive of it, such as amilGFP and UV sensor, could be applied to different purposes. amilGFP with LVA degradation tag gives out strong yellow light under natural light and degrades rapidly. Using these features enables us to measure visually, depending on the flow of time. Also, UV sensor can express any gene in any time by only irradiating UV.
As stated above, the clock device and its parts can be used for various purposes and these applications would also give synthesis biology great progress.
RNA Silencing
Background
Introduction
It is needless to say that gene knockout is important in the study of biology. Genomic knockout by making the target gene mutate requires much labor and time. In eucaryotes, RNAi has contributed to the functional analysis of genes. E. coli, which belongs to procaryotes, does not have the mechanism needed for RNAi and this method is not usually used for E. coli.
But in recent years it has been becoming clear that E. coli has the mechanism of gene silencing by small regulatory RNAs (sRNA) which have complementary sequences with their target mRNAs [1].We used the mechanism for gene knockout by designing synthetic sRNAs and inducing plasmids coding them into bacterial cells. This method can be done by gene introduction and enables us to knock down genes by combining our new BioBrick parts ""micC scaffold"" and complementary sequences with the target gene [2].
We tested using our BioBrick parts by applying them for the following objectives.
Acceleration of Biosynthesis of L-DOPA, a substance utilized for treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Improvement of H2 Productive Capacity of E. coli
Suppressor of Multi-Negative Feedback System of Clock Device
System
Mechanism of RNA silencing in Escherichia coli
Escherichia coli have several trans-acting sRNA molecules repressing the expressions of their target genes, such as micC and sgrS and so on. Their mechanism has been becoming clear in recent years. (Fig.1) These sRNA molecules consist of complementary sequences to their target mRNAs and a scaffold sequence that recruites the Hfq protein. Hfq protein, one of the RNA chaperones, facilitates the hybridization of sRNAs to mRNA by their complementary sequences and"
Paris_Bettencourt,2013,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Project#Infiltrate_-_-_TEXT.html,"acteria mixed with uninduced E.coli (blue line) were stable.
Figure 3 Dose-dependence in killing of mycobacteria by E. coli.
We mixed M. smegmatis at a density of 107 cells/ml with E. coli at densities of 105 cells/ml (blue line) 106 cells/ml (green line) or 107 cells/ml to produce the ratios above. Even low densities of E. coli produced significant killing. Uninduced E. coli produced no significant killing.
  We investigated further the mechanism of TDMH-mediated cell killing. The TDMH enzyme in our system does not carry a secretion tag. Therefore, lysis of the E. coli membrane is probably required for the protein to reach (and lyse) M. smegmatis. We used plating assays to investigate the effect of TDMH induction on E. coli viability and Bradford assays to measure released protein. The results are presented in figure 4.
Figure 4A shows that inducing TDMH-expressing E. coli with IPTG rapidly kills the E. coli. In figure 4B, we show that inducing TDMH expression increases the concentration of free protein in the media. In our model, TDMH induction leads to spontaneous lysis of TDMH-expressing E. coli. This could be simply due to the extremely high protein expression levels driven by the T7 promoter, or it may be partially due to the esterase activities of the TDMH enzyme. Once the TDMH is released from the E. coli it is free to act on mycobacterial membranes, causing lysis and the release of additional proteins.
Figure 4 Induction of TDMH kills E. coli and releases protein to the media.
A)Plating assays were used to determine E. coli viability in LB media after the indicated times. TDMH-induced E. coli rapidly lost viability (red line) Uninduced E. coli grew normally following a lag phase (black line).B)Bradford assays were used to measure free protein concentrations in mixed and induced bacterial cultures. When E. coli and mycobacteria are mixed and TDMH-expression is induced, free protein concentrations increase. This is consistent with a model in which TDMH induction leads to the lysis of the E. coli membrane. Action of TDMH on mycobacteria leads to further lysis and protein release.

The transformation were performed for pSB3K1 because unexpectdely the liquid cultures for pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR (positive with colony-PCR) were red. On the registry the pSB3K1 backbone hasn't been documented to have RFP so the question why this cells were red is open. This new assembly has to be sequenced.
Monday, 08 August 2011
Lilia went on Saturday to miniprep the TetR mutants, and the concentrations are really high: from 150 ng/ul to 238 ng/ul.
Nadine made new Gibson reactions for the Reporter and Lysis plasmids: once with equimolar ratios and once with about 2x more parts than the backbone, plus a negative control containing only the backbone.
Alessandro prepared SOC medium and started liquid culture of pSB3K1 and pSB3K1-Pconst-TetR to make glycerol stocks. The cells transformed with pSB3K1 are red therefore that plasmid has RFP though not documented on the registry. A lot of colonies grew on the co-transformation plate; Alessandro will start a liquid culture the following day to test them in the plate-reader.
Vincent used the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis (SDM) Kit to try to produce TetR mutants. The pWhitescript 4.5-kb control plasmid provided by the Kit was used. The plasmid contains a stop codon (TAA) rather than a glutamine codon (CAA) in the beta-galactosidase gene of the pBluescript II SK(-) phagemid. When we transform the plasmid into XL10-gold ultracompetent cells, the resulting cells should look white on LB-ampicillin plates that have been treated with IPTG and X-gal, since the beta-galactosidase is no longer functional. However, if the mutagenesis works, there should be a point mutation that reverts the T into a C (TAA into CAA), meaning that the cells should appear blue on plates that contain IPTG and X-gal.
The protocol for Mutant Strand Synthesis (provided with the Kit) was followed meticulously. Vincent made a master mix for 5 mutants and made a separate control mixture. The DNA template concentration was 130 ng/uL (after being diluted from 160 ng/uL as used by Douglas) so we used .5 uL to get around "

SBML
The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a computer-readable format for representing models of biological processes. It's applicable to simulations of metabolism, cell-signaling, and many other topics. SBML has been evolving since mid-2000 thanks to an international community of software developers and users. SBML does not represent an attempt to define a universal language for representing quantitative models. It would be impossible to achieve a one-size-fits-all universal language. A more realistic alternative is to acknowledge the diversity of approaches and methods being explored in systems biology, and seek a common intermediate format—a lingua franca—enabling communication of the most essential aspects of the models.
Why SBML?
The adoption of SBML offers many benefits, including:
enabling the use of multiple tools without rewriting models for each tool.
enabling models to be shared and published in a form other researchers can use even in a different software environment.
ensuring the survival of models (and the intellectual effort put into them) beyond the lifetime of the software used to create them.
SBML is neutral with respect to programming languages and software encoding; however, it's oriented towards allowing models to be encoded using XML. By supporting SBML as a format for reading and writing models, different software tools (including programs for building and editing models, simulation programs, databases, and other systems) can directly communicate and store the same computable representation of those models. This removes an impediment to sharing results and permits other researchers to start with an unambiguous representation of the model, examine it carefully, propose precise corrections and extensions, and apply new techniques and approaches—in short, to do better science.
Software support
As the matter of fact, there has been lots of softwares known to us to provide some degree of support for reading, writing, or otherwise working with SBML. Thus, we make SBML to access our software, which makes it more compatible to other biological softwares. Users can output SBML file from our software, which means you can get a standard expression of biological system. It is facilitate for you to analyse the model in other SBML-related softwares.
To access the requirement, there must be a tool helps us to fetch the list of data from a SBML file. Fortunately, LibSBML assists us for all the SBML related staff. LibSBML"

Communication Conference at Nanjing University
Participants: Nanjing University, Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University,                         Fudan University, Tianjin University, Sun Yet Sun University.
On May 20th, our members attended the iGEM communication conference,                        which was held by nanjing-china and nju-china, in School of Life Science, Nanjing University.
We shared the experience of Giant Jamboree and discussed how to establish a team,                         bring up new ideas and assign works. We also introduced our projects, gave our suggestions and shared fresh ideas.                         Through the communication we learned from each other, which was a great help to our 2017 iGEM projects. Besides,                         realizing the fact that present alignment CCIC, which is Central China iGEM Consortium,                         could not meet the trend of Synthetic Biology’s development, we introduced our last year’s project, iMAP,                         which can be used to construct a bridge between different iGEM teams. Finally, the meeting was a complete success.
5th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference in National Chiao Tung University
The 5th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference was held in at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan from 2017/07/30 to 2017/08/04.
There were more than 20 teams from different universities in Asia and America attending this conference.                         Through the presentation and poster exhibition, we exchanged information and experience with one another,                         which benefited us a lot. Besides, communicating with professors and other software teams helped to simulate                         our creativity and bring about more ideals. After the conference, we kept in touch with USTC-Software,                         who also focused on developing software, and the communications between us helped us to deal with tough problems together.
Through these colorful and meaningful human practice activities, we harvested not only the                         communications and friendships among iGEM teams, but also the tight collaborations rooted in these                         friendships. We managed to understand how innovative ideas in synthetic biotechnology sprouted and                         how these ideas going to influence the subject, and even the world.

UMaryland,2016,Team:UMaryland#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," methane gas in their metabolism and manure produces methane as it decomposes. In attempt to control the amount of methane produced by the latter, farms can implement anaerobic digesters that use the biogases produced by anaerobic digestion and decomposition of manure to create an alternative energy or heat source3. These regulations, however, do not stop the problem. Flaring is not 100% effective4 and can produce air pollutants, and machines that are able to use methane as an energy or heat source can be expensive and difficult to maintain (Peter Karasik, personal communication, June 17, 2016). Despite these efforts, a lot of methane still escapes into the atmosphere.
Landfill electricity generator system using methane as seen in Gude Landfill, MD
In order to create a more foolproof method to tackle the issue of methane pollution, we selected a biological approach. Using genes from several organisms that have evolved to metabolize methane, we plan to create strains of bacteria that are capable of breaking down methanol. These bacteria would generate metabolites during the process, and will either accumulate biomass or release CO2.
Design
Our design combines the work of several previous iGEM teams, creating an integrative start to finish approach of tackling this immense global issue. To sequester methane, we will engineer E. coli to be able to metabolize methane. We have designed two metabolic pathways that involve three different plasmids, each converting methane into CO2 and energy, or biomass. Methane is not only removed in the process, but the cell gains metabolic advantages through these pathways. Energy can also be eventually harvested from the resulting generated biomass.
Both pathways start with the conversion of methane to methanol using the sMMO gene. This gene has been characterized by Team Braunschweig 2014, who assembled the gene into a polycistronic six subunit plasmid. sMMO oxidizes methane, converting it to methanol.
The sMMO gene used in our plasmid is extracted from Methylococcus capsulatus. This organism is an obligate methanotrophic bacteria, requiring methane as its carbon source5. M. capsulatus grows optimally at 45 C6 in environments with high methane concentrations, such as soils and inside live-animals as symbionts. Naturally, this strain of bacteria and many other methanotrophs are actively reducing methane emissions by metabolizing atmospheric methane.  M. capsulatus is the most extensively studied methanotroph and its genome has been sequenced7.

2.Visit Hua Qi environmental protection company
On the afternoon of September 12, 2018, our team AHUT_China visited Ma'anshan Hua Qi Environmental Protection Technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as HuaQi Environmental Protection Company).
We know that environmental pollution is mainly air pollution, water pollution and soil pollution. Our project is to deal with greenhouse gas CO2 in air pollution. How to deal with greenhouse gas CO2 efficiently is particularly critical as the increasing greenhouse effect has a serious impact on the global environment. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the current environmental pollution in China, we visited HuaQi Environmental Protection Company HuaQi Environmental Protection Company, is a company specializing in sewage treatment. After Ms. Zhang Qi introduced the company, we visited the intelligent water transportation management system and laboratory.
Fig.1 Technical staff Liu Shanshan led us to visit the laboratory
Liu Shanshan, the company's technical staff, led us to visit the laboratory. During the visit, we learned that water pollution is currently harmful to the environment and people's health. So, water pollution treatment is very important. We introduced our project to computerize the protein molecules expressed by carbonic anhydrase gene mutations to obtain carbonic anhydrase (CA-2) with high thermal stability and import it into E. coli cells in order to achieve efficient collection of CO2. The project is currently in the theoretical stage. She is interested in our project. If the CO2 emission can be effectively controlled at the source, the problems such as the continued destruction of ozone layer, the melting of two-stage glaciers and the rapid extinction of a large number of species can be effectively solved. And she is more concerned about how this project can be applied in practice, and puts forward some suggestions for our project. At present, the CO2 gas capture technology mainly includes chemical absorption, pressure swing adsorption and membrane separation. She suggested that firstly transgenic E. coli be cultured in solution environment with chemical absorption to achieve CO2 collection, and that secondly CO2 be treated with biological rotating disc.

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#Basic Part_-_-_TEXT.html," site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation between the pro-peptide and the subtilisin E gene was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis. The codon TAT of tyrosine77 was substituted with TGG, which codes for tryptophan, so tyrosine was exchanged against tryptophan at the connection site of pro-peptide and subtilisin E gene. Caused by the mutation in the pro-peptide and not in the direct subtilisin E gene, the actual position of the modified tyrosine was counted from the beginning of the pro-peptide compared to common annotations counted from the N-terminus of the actual enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.
Figure 7: Skim milk plates assay. Cells producing the native protease (picture A-C, left) in comparison to either cells containing the empty backbone (picture A, right) or cells carrying the SDM 3-modified (picture B, right) and the SDM 1-modified expression system (picture C, right) after incubation for 3 days at 30°C.
The empty backbone didn't cause a proteolytic activity. A clearance and therefore a proteolytic activity could be observed for the native protease (as demonstrated in the section of BioBrick K2020002 ) but also for the SDM 3 modified expression system. As SDM 3 had been executed to exchange tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site against tryptophan, a proteolytic activity could be assumed caused by the clearance observed. Contrary to our former beliefs, it could now be deduced that exchanging tyrosine doesn’t result in a change of activity. Consequently, tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site is not essential for the activity of subtilisin E. Unfortunately, we were not able to prove the principle of our project regarding tyrosine in the pro-peptide cleavage site, as it seems to be not essential for the proteolytic activity. Thus, exchanging tyrosine against a photo-labile, non-canonical amino acid more precisely ONB-tyrosine will not influence the activity of the enzyme. All details about this part can be seen on its Registry page .

To find the expected infected population, the Poisson distribution is used based on the MOI (multiplicity of infection - defined as the ratio of phage-to-bacteria), with a term for efficiency of viral attachment $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$  (in fact the efficiency has been found to be a function of certain proteins) [4,5].

Substrate Utilization
Bacteria require a substrate for growth, and the depletion of this substrate is proportional to the growth rate of the uninfected bacteria and the amount of bacteria. Although the infected bacteria do not multiply when infected, the infected cells may consume substrate to generate energy needed to replicate the phage. Although it may be the case that the bacteria simply recycle intracellular material, a substrate utilization term ($\gamma$) for the infected cells is added (if the bacteria do in fact recycle intracellular material, it follows that this value will be 0). Moreover, when cells lyse, the re-solubilized cytoplasmic contents can be metabolized by other bacteria and will add to the amount of nutrients available. Thus, the equation for substrate utilization rate is:
\begin{align} \frac{dS}{dt} = - \big[ \frac{\mu_u}{Y_u}X_u + \frac{\gamma}{Y_i}X_i \big] + \phi \delta \end{align} Where $Y_u$ and $Y_i$ are yield constants and $\phi$ is the average amount of substrate released per infected cell during lysis, $\delta$ has as described above.
Model Validation
Although, only limited amounts of growth curves have been able to be analyzed, the quantitative results appear promising and the qualitative results have been found to contain information whether or not the quantitative results align.The model is shown to have powerful predictive capabilities when it comes to a bacteria growth curve not under phage predation.The model also appears to have powerful qualitative predictions for culture collapse under phage predation. However, consistent quantitative predictions for bacteria growing under phage predation has not yet been shown.  Note: as time progresses OD measurements will pick up cellular debris (also referred to as ""bacterial bones"") which will artificially inflate the concentration of bacteria after lysis - by plating we confirm"

1. EDUCATION
Starting our iGEM team was no easy feat. We overcame many obstacles from financing our team to a lack of interest amongst peers, perhaps stemming from a lack of understanding of the power of science and engineering to bring social good. Our age group lead very busy lives with many heavily involved in sports, volunteer work, working part-time, or just keeping up with school. Synthetic biology and iGEM were unknown within our school community. Our earliest efforts through multiple information meetings, direct appeals to science teachers, did not bring in the students we needed. Also, with competing interests for the summer, we ran into problems of retaining students to do lab research in the summer months. We persisted despite these problems, and eventually assembled our geographically diverse, but passionate team seeking to explore synthetic biology as a potential means to solve world problems. Given our own experience with the lack of understanding of synthetic biology in particular, and the application of science and engineering in general, in our community, we placed a high priority to educate and inspire students at our school and also at the feeder middle school. Here is what we did.
A. Farmwell Station Middle School
We emailed the principle of Farmwell Station Middle school and was contacted by Mrs Collins who wanted us to present to her 8th grade Physical Science classes that were just beginning to think about their research projects and who would be high school freshman next year. we made presentations to 4 classes and spoke to the minds of 84 students. Mrs. Collins wrote back to us regarding our time with her students, and here is what she said;
""I loved hearing your research!  It is so important for the high school level students to come and show the middle school level students the amazing things that they can do in the future.  This opened the eyes of many students of the important real world contributions which they can make even at their age.  The most important take away of the presentation to them was...to just have interest is enough! ~ Mrs. Collins, September 18""

As first attempts go, we consider our Simcha Lab a success. See our blog Camp Simcha Laboratory to learn about many of our exciting activities. Whether the campers were figuring out that they could use a plasma globe together with current-conducting play-dough and LEDs to create a mesmerizing circuit of flashing lights, or going bird-watching, bird whistles in hand, all the great moments amounted to an exciting first run for the Science Laboratory. We also passed the biggest test of success: The camp invited us back for the second session! Unfortunately the NYC iGEMers needed to return to the Cornell lab, but Shlomo stayed on, and is being assisted by two great staff volunteers. Going in we knew there would be an avalanche of interest in science. Thankfully, we had a great group running the workshop and dozen of projects, product of much scheming back home.
So much scientific research is being done to discover new therapies for children and adults suffering from disease. We were glad to be able to use laboratory science itself as a therapy for these children and young adults. We were so pleased that the campers really seized the opportunity to think scientifically and have a great deal of much-needed fun.
In future sessions of the Science Lab, we plan to increase the number of projects on hand, because, unfortunately, for the trial-run our supply far outstripped the demand. All the projects deserved more thorough explanations for all demonstrations and activities. Kids choosing projects before camp begins would enable us to individualize each campers experience. Together, improvements like these assure our workshop accelerates in excitement from the great trial-run. Because of the campers’ burgeoning interest, the Science Lab will ultimately become a smash-hit for the ages.

Hong_Kong_HKUST,2013,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#hp#article#compare_-_-_TEXT.html," that took part from East Asia to make a comparison and ultimately infer the trend of synthetic biology in these countries. Using such statistics is a common way to infer the current status of synthetic biology. In fact, lots of academic reviews of synthetic biology mention the iGEM competition to infer the current trend of synthetic biology in a particular country.
The number of participants in the iGEM competition has been increasing steadily every year. This trend holds true for some of the 5 Asian countries that we have investigated. For example, among the 5 countries, China has the most significant increase in the iGEM competition participation. In 2007, it only had 4 teams, but in 2012, there were 26 Chinese teams in the competition. The number of participants from Japan generally increased from 2006 to 2012, but this increase is not as great as that of China. For Hong Kong and Korea, the numbers of participants are nearly steady. For instance, from 2010 to 2012, Hong Kong steadily had 3 participants that had join the iGEM competition. In comparison with the number of participants from the United States, the number of participants from East Asian countries is still relatively small.
East Asian countries first participated in the iGEM competition in 2006. Korea and Japan were the first ones to join the competition. Ever since, the majority of the participants from Asia were from East Asia. For example, in 2011, out of 46 participants from Asia, only 5 were non-East Asian teams. The number of participants, however, from other regions is increasing, creating more diversity in the competition. Bogor Agricultural University has joined from Indonesia in 2012. In 2013, two teams from Indonesia have registered for the iGEM competition.  To do comparison between different countries it is necessary to get relative values of participation because the number of universities in each of these countries is different. The total number of universities in each of the countries were searched online and compared as a percentage of the ratio of number of teams in the iGEM competition over total number of universities in that country.
The relative values calculated show very different result. If the ratio of number of iGEM teams over the total number of universities is considered, four of the countries/regions (Korea, Hong Kong, China, and Japan) actually have higher percentage of participation than that of the United States.
With this data we can understand why the recent increase in number of participants from Hong Kong and Korea was steady. It is because these two countries already have relatively higher percentage of participation"

Optimization of
Fermentation Conditions
Optimal pH
During the fermentation process, problems like low efficiency of gene expression and low yield always occur. The formula of culture media and the condition of culturing in fermentation have direct or indirect relations with these issues. Particularly, pH can affect the dissociation of some certain components and intermediate metabolites ，which can influence the capacity utilizing these materials of bacteria. Meanwhile, the fluctuant environmental pH  have certain impact on the pH level in the cells in the form of weak acid and alkali influencing the metabolic reaction of the cell. Therefore, an appropriate control of pH is crucial to the effective gene expression. That is the reason why  we need to  discover the optimal pH for the fermentation of G.xylinus.                                 The scope of pH variation in the culture media during fermentation process is wide. In order to study the optimal pH for G.xylinus fermentation, we use acetic acid with 200 ionic strength to maintain the pH in the outside environment.

Collaborations
UK iGEM Meetup
On 12th and 13th July, we helped host the UK-wide iGEM meetup at Worcester College, Oxford in partnership with SynBio UK. Teams travelled from across the country to attend this two-day event that promoted collaboration, offered project advice and gave an insight into what lies beyond the iGEM competition. Discussing our projects with other team members, and attending a collaboration workshop helped us to identify many opportunities for collaboration. It was here that we met the Imperial team and learnt of their intention to use the SoxR/SoxS promoter system, leading to a joint effort to characterise the strength of a range of promoters. We also arranged Skype meetings with the Warwick team to guide them on the modelling aspect of their project. These collaborations are discussed in more detail below.
Imperial College London iGEM - Wet Lab
Imperial constructed a promoter library using a BLAST search for the SoxS promoter which they characterised in response to an applied electrical current. To assist them, we characterised their parts in response to chemically induced oxidative stress. In return, they provided us with a range of constructs which we could match to the promoter strength, predicted in our model to give the highest sensitivity to NO.
While in our device, SoxR is used to respond to NO, the short half-life prevents isolation for fluorescence assays. SoxR is not only activated by NO but any chemical which induces oxidative stress. Initially aiming to characterise the promoter in response to the superoxide-generating herbicide, paraquat, we found that due to its toxicity, it was prohibited in the EU and required specialist clearance for research purposes. Hydrogen peroxide was chosen as a safer alternative which still produces reactive oxygen species in the cells, and thus activates SoxR.
Characterisation was two-fold. A plate reader assay was performed which measured fluorescence of the GFP from the promoter construct in response to 100uM hydrogen peroxide. In addition to this A600 ("
Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#HumanPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," counted after each round.
The point of this activity was to show the students that bacteria communicate with certain types of molecules, ones only certain bacteria can receive. When these bacteria that can communicate get together in large groups, they have an advantage over the single bacteria because express new genes and alter their phenotypes. The rounds were to simulate the time lapse of bacterial communication in a large population. At first, everyone was mixed up and no one was in pairs. It took several rounds for the students to form a “quorum”, enough to express new phenotypes. However, after being given the ability to broadcast their shape and color, groups quickly found all their potential partners, winning the game.
After the activity, we explained the phenomena of quorum sensing and showed them a portion of the TED Talk by Bonnie Bassler, a professor at Princeton University and a driving force within the quorum sensing field, which can be found below.
Experiment
To give the students a real example of quorum sensing and give them experience with culturing techniques, we led them through an experiment with Vibrio harveyi, a marine bacterium that creates light at high cell density. In order to demonstrate quorum sensing in V. harveyi, we used one wild type and two mutant strains of bacteria.
The wild type strain has the ability to make the signal and receive the signal. One mutant strain will not be able to make the signal, but it will be able to receive the signal. The other mutant strain will not be able to receive the autoinducer, but will be able to make it. We had the students plate these strains side by side in different combinations to see if they luminesced. On the wild type plate, the whole plate luminesced. On the two control plates of sender/sender and receiver/receiver, there was no luminescence. However, on the sender/receiver plate, the receiver strain luminesced strongly in the center and faded toward the edges of the plate.
You can see the full experiment write-up here: File:QSExperiment.pdf
We had prepared plates the day before in order to show them how their plates should look in a few days. In small groups, one group member would take them into a very dark room and have the students explain what they were seeing. Some of the questions we asked were the following: Why is only the receiver luminescing? How does the autoinducer move across the plate? Why does the luminescence fade? What should the plate look like tomorrow?

The Brown iGEM Lab is entirely student-run and consists of nine Brown University undergraduates. We began our training last spring with a lab course in Synthetic Biology. Under the gracious support of the Brown Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award (UTRA) Program and funding from various other academic departments, we were able to work throughout the summer on our project. Though the project's generation and implementation was an entirely student-directed process, the team owes much of its academic and research support to the faculty and graduate student advisers that helped make everything possible. Here at Brown, we pride ourselves in upholding the ideals set out by the iGEM competition, namely that the project we have set out to create is fully our own (from creation to completion) and that each student involved in the program be afforded his/her full opportunity to both learn and contribute in the lab. Therefore, in the true spirit of Synthetic Biology, our team's project this year works hard to reflect the many different research backgrounds contributed by its nine individual members; elements of electrical engineering, electrochemistry, genetics, and microbiology are incorporated.

(2013) flexible linkers are usually used to provide a degree of movement and thus allow a better interaction between the linked peptide sequences. This linker has already been used in iGEM to fuse proteins and is part of the repository.
Design
We designed the insertions as gBlocks. Both of them are flanked with BbsI recognition sequences that generate an overhang complementary to the insertion spots in the dCas9. Also, the insertions contain the sequences around the hotspots that the dCas9 lacks.
The first insertion consists on an Ssp DnaB C-intein flanked by a 2x (GGGS) linker, the sequences were obtained from the following Bio-Bricks: BBa_K1362251 and BBa_K1486003. The second insertion contains two 2x (GGS) that flank a Ssp DnaB N-intein followed by a N-Terminal split TEV, a Histag, a Npu DnaE N-intein and another Ssp DnaB N-intein. The sequences were based on the undermentioned Bio-Bricks: Bba_ K1486003, Bba_ K1362408, BBa_K1159101, BBa_K844000 and BBa_K1362400.
Also, we designed two BioBricks to test the cleavage activity of the split inteins we used in the insertions. The first Biobrick consists of a histag followed by a red fluorescent protein (RFP), an Ssp DnaB N-intein and a double terminator. The sequences were obtained from the following BioBricks: BBa_K844000, BBa_E1010, and BBa_B0010. This first BioBrick we designed was then assembled with an IPTG inducible promoter (Bba_R0010) and a RBS Elowitz.
The second BioBrick contains the complementary Ssp DnaB C-intein with a histag and a double terminator. For this design we used the following BioBricks from the iGEM repository: BBa_K1362251, BBa_K844000 and BBa_B0010. We assembled this BioBrick with an Anderson Promoter J23100 and a RBS Elowitz. Both assembled complete devices were also registered as BioBricks.
