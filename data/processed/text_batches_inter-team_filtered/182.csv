Another modelling meeting
Carol, Chinee and I came up with a list of what we will need from our lab/modelling teams to collect data for our characterisation/simulation efforts; when we need this done; and who will be responsible for each part of the project. Carol has the hand-written version and will be typing it up and circulating it shortly.
Finding specific examples of where characterisation would be useful
This part was difficult, and after talking to Sonja, we decided a simple explanation of how we need to know how our circuit behaves in the lab so that we can better predict its behaviour out of the lab will suffice for presentation purposes. From the transfer function/static performance, we get a sense of the equilibrium behaviour at different input AI-2 concentrations. From the dynamic performance, we can figure out the response time and compare it to that of an entire system where our part in question is being used as a component.
We also talked about how to account for the effects of cell division, which could confound our plate readings. First, we decided it was best to characterise in the mid-exponential phase (as opposed to plateau), as dead cells would cause unknown effects that could be very difficult to explain. To account for cell division, we plan to take baseline measurements of the mutant + reporter circuits, as well as a baseline of signalling + reporter, over a long period of time. This will give us a sense of how important cell division is in the interpretation of our results.

Overview
In this country profile, all the information was obtained from reliable government and official websites. This profile includes information of perception, regulations, researches, funding, market, events, people and organizations about synthetic biology and biotechnology.
In general, synthetic biology and other fields of science are considered less significant in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government does not provide much support to the field of science compared to other fields such as business. Moreover, the awareness of bio-safety issues in Hong Kong is not high among the general public.  We hope that this country profile will provide readers information about synthetic biology and biotechnology so that more people understand and review the situation of scientific development in Hong Kong
Synbio Map
SynBio Map identifies and locates companies, universities, research institutions, laboratories and other centers across the globe that are active in the synthetic biology research (""Synthetic biology project,"" ). It is a good tool to compare the development of synthetic biology all around the world. This map was created by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.   In this map, 5 entries are located in Hong Kong. Two of them are in the University of Hong Kong and two are in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, while the remaining one is a private company.
Participation in the iGEM Competition
Universities in Hong Kong have been actively participating in the iGEM competition. Since 2008, out of 9 universities in Hong Kong, 4 took part in the competition.
The four universities are Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), University of Hong Kong (HKU) and Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)."

Lethbridge,2011,Team:Lethbridge#Notebook#Lab Work#Justin_-_-_TEXT.html," overnight culture
Thursday
Express BamH1 and show that growth is hindered; Minipreped cell cultures that were grown overnight to determine quality/quantity/size of DNA of certain parts; Assebled pLacI-RBS with lumazine-dT. Also a growth curved of a induced (arabinose) and un-induced culture were generated from optical density measurements.
After 8 hours dilutions were made from the induced and un-induced cultures and plated.
Results
Friday
Mini-prep cell cultures that were grown overnight, by Nathan, to determine the quality/quaintly/ size of DNA of parts:
1) J04500
2) pBAD-B0034
3) K346007
Mini-preped samples were restricted then ran on a 1% agarose gel. We were unable to detect DNA for pBAD-B0034 on the agarose gel. All other parts were visible and had an acceptable size.
Saturday
Continue assembly on our lumazine BioBrick, which I'm really excited about. I think we will be able to construct our whole massive construct with lumazine synthase and the fluorescent proteins. It will be so cool if we can show that the construct will express the proteins and work as a true interchangeable part!!!
Assembly of pLacI-rbs (J04500) with lumazine.
Sunday
Transformation of yesterdays work! Transformed lumazine construct into  E. coli DH5α.
Week 12 (July 17-24)
Wednesday
Determine if xyl transformations were successful and if K346007 was successfully transferred from pSB1C3 to pSB1K3. This was done by restricting the mini-preps and running a 1% agarose gel. It looks like we might have successfully assembled for the gel:
pSB1A3 promotor-rbs-xylJ-dt
pSB1A3 promoter-rbs-xylE-dt
pSB1A3 promoter-rbs-xylF

This level of networking with international professionals was enlightening and interested to gather a range of perspectives on both the synthetic biology industry and our project.  Our representatives got the opportunity to view the discussion of current policy in place - and the process of forming this policy.  Our group was invited meetings at the Canadian mission and took part in discussions that we may never have the opportunity to partake in again.  This was a great opportunity to also expand our own professional development and perspective among the great opportunity to promote iGEM and our 2014 iGEM Calgary research.
This week we received a reply from Health Policy Project . They answered all of our questions in great details and provided useful documents that we can study. The documents included Biosafety Law in Ethiopia, and National Strategic Plan in regards to malaria. They also provided us with detailed information on what is the procedure to getting the device on market. The first step is get registered with Food, Medicine, Health Services Administration and Control Authority by submitting an application with required technical documentation and specifications details of the product. If the product is already registered with the World Health Organization (WHO) then FMHSACA usually registers the device provided all of the required documentation is submitted. Otherwise, FMHSACA might choose to run its’ own safety and quality control tests with the help from Ethiopian Public Health Institute. It is also recommended that the device has Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice to ensure successful implementation. Upon completion of the registration process, the device might be included in health care workers’ trainings. The device would also have to be listed in National Guidelines in order for health care professionals to use the product. A representative from Health Policy Project also agreed that misdiagnosis of malaria is a problem, so a multidiagnostic device that would improve the diagnosis of malaria and diseases with similar symptoms is needed in developing countries such as Ethiopia. From Health Policy Project we also provided information on the level of government involvement in health care and reflected on the possible mindset of the government in regards to diagnostic tests like ours. Since FIND and WHO are located at Geneva, we also contacted both of these organizations to arrange an in-person meeting while the 4 representatives from the team are in Geneva for the conference.
Week 14: August 5th - August 8th
The week all of the representatives that attended the Biological Weapons Convention in Geneva Switzerland took time to reflect and review all of the information they were able to learn over the entirety of the experience."

NTU-Singapore,2009,Team:NTU-Singapore#HPA#Essay_-_-_TEXT.html," Biological Parts was set up, to build up a public domain database of standardised Biobricks. New sequences are contributed annually by undergraduate teams working on the iGEM competition.
After working with iGEM for a while, Mackenzie Cowell, an MIT graduate of biology, felt that the biotechnological skills & knowledge used by iGEM undergraduates could also be shared with the greater public. He started DIYbio with other biology enthusiasts who shared his vision regarding hobbyist biology. They set up a website, DIYbio.org, to share information and know-how to anyone interested to learn. The community has responded well, and grown quickly.
The DIYbio Agenda
As Mac Cowell puts it, “[DIYbio] shows you how much science can be about duct tape and having a few screws at the right place. It shatters the clinical image.” By bringing biotechnology to amateurs, DIYbio aims to groom a new generation of biologists, many of whom are not biologists by training. This is what Cowell refers to as cross-pollination of expertise, which he argues can bring new insights to the biotechnology as a whole. In fact, the un-instituitionalized aspect of DIYbio could be a feature by itself, not a bug. Cowell argues that unrestricted creativity could produce breakthroughs.
Essentially, the biggest supporters of DIYbio, are drawing parallels to other success stories where amateurs have actually advanced science in some way. Amateur stargazers do make significant observations, contributing to astronomy. Citizen tree-huggers are some of the most prolific flora and fauna cataloguers, and instrumental to conducting wildlife census. Apple and Google were born in suburban garages. DIYbio's ardent supporters ask, what if the next Bill Gates of biotech could be found in the DIYbio community?
Since passionate DIYbiologists are not motivated by the same factors as traditional researchers (e.g. funding, patents etc.), their approach and efforts can effect fundamentally different, most practical, more realizable goals. So, it is possible that DIYbiologists can complement official research work.
And finally, DIYbio can be a better interface between scientists and the public, compared to traditional institutions. This is because citizen scientists will have more sway among their immediate friends and family than the combined might of the mass media. A viral effect of support can be expected if more people hear about DIYbio through positive word-of-mouth.
Rise of the biohackers
The success of the DIYBio phenomenon can be attributed to two main reasons:
the Open Science concept that allows transparent and remote information & skills transfer.

In the end of August, we attended the Fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community held by ShanghaiTech. We were inspired by the wonderful lectures delivered by professors and scholars. The presentation session gave us an opportunity to express ourselves before Giant Jamboree as well as learning from other teams in China. During the poster session, we had face-to-face conversations with other iGEMers, some of whom offered suggestions on promotion.  After the conference, we began to work on developing new and thoughtful ways of Human Practices, establishing a more systematic model, and making modifications on designing of our poster and wiki. We were lucky to communicate with iGEM HQ, Meagan Lizarazo, and took photos with her.
NJU-China
They shared A549 cells, which could verify the demo of our system. In return, we offered suggestions on their project and helped them carry out the cell viability experiment. It was proven that their manipulation did no harm to cells, which set up a good start of their project. Their acknowledgement can be found on their wiki page ( https://2018.igem.org/Team:NJU-China/Collaborations ).
OUC-China
We distributed brochures named SPACESHIP E.coli made by team OUC-China, hoping to increase publicity of synthetic biology. The brochure is a comic book and fun to look through and discuss with other readers. It really worked in intriguing students’ enthusiasm for synthetic biology. (see more on Education Page )"

Basic Parts
The pieces needed to make a Super Cell
We created three basic parts:
BBa_K2135001 - petF
BBa_K2135000 - pck
BBa_K2135002 - TetR-pTet
Best Basic Part
The petF biobrick corresponds to the petF gene from Synechocystis. It codes for ferredoxin, an electron donor that is a reducing agent in many cellular reactions. We used this part to create an E. coli strain with increased reduced electron donors. petF was our best performing part and is our candidate for best Basic Part. Click on the parts link above to see why!
Additional BioBricks
The pck biobrick corresponds to the pck gene from E. coli MG1655. It codes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a kinase that works under gluconeogenic conditions to produce ATP. We used this part to create an E. coli strain with increased intracellular ATP.
The TetR-pTet biobrick is an inducible promoter. pTet is the promoter that is inhibited by TetR. When anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is added, TetR is removed and promoter activity ensues. We used this inducible promoter to fine tune our reduced electron donor activity.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#Main_-_-_TEXT.html," they know little about synthetic biology and deep green means they are very interested of the coming tutor games. The outer circle, however, stands for their major;light green for biology major and light orange for other majors. As the graph shows, synthetic biology is still new to them as the majority have little idea of it, for which is what we will continue our project in the future. However, we are delighted to see that their interests of tutor game are fairly strong.
Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

1 Abstract
Norovirus (NoV) accounts for 18% of the diarrheal disease in the world, with more than 200 thousand people dying each year from NoV infection [1]. Despite this overwhelming damage caused by NoV infection, the world has yet to develop a direct approach to combat them. Here we, iGEMKyoto, propose 'Noro-catcher', a new biodevice that binds to and ultimately expels NoV from human intestine. This biodevice consists of two types of functional handles that are each fused to surface expressing domains, both expressed in the outer membrane of E. coli.
The first handle is the anti-NoV scFv (single-chain variable fragment). With this handle, we aim our Noro-catcher to bind to NoV within various environments, e.g. sewage, water supplies, test tubes in virus detection assay, and small intestines in our body.
The second handle is the cellulose binding domain (CBD). With this handle, we aim our Noro-catcher to be ""leashed"" to cellulose as opposed to it being ""free roaming"" within human digestive tracts. We ultimately aim to use our Noro-catcher for therapeutic purposes, removing E. coli-bound NoV from human intestine with our sterilized Noro-catcher. The CBD handle can aid in swift removal of our biodevice by linking them to cellulose, as cellulose passes human intestine undigested.

Repetition of small-Scale Yeast Transformation of 4CL, CHS, OMT, PAL and APT in pTUM104
Investigator: Mary
Aim of the experiment:Transformation of P193 - P198, P200, P236, P263 and GFP (as a positive control - from simon) in Yeast
The protocol on page 13 of the pYES2 manual was used.
Only modifications are noted:
step 1: inoculate in 4 ml YPD medium
step 2: OD600 = 9 -> to determine a OD600 of 0.4 in 50 ml, 2.2 ml yeast suspension and 42.5 ml YPD medium were used, 5ml 20% Glucose was added (wrong information about the YPD-medium: we suggested that Glucose caramelizes when autoclaved together with medium - but it is not the case! Only agar and glucose will caramelize).
steps 3 and 4: centrifugation for 5 min, 4 °C
step 6:
1 µg plasmid DNA
P193: c = 110 ng/µl -> 9.1 µl
P194: c = 342 ng/µl -> 2.9 µl
P195: c = 423 ng/µl -> 2.4 µl
P196: c = 92 ng/µl -> 10.8 µl
P197: c = 394 ng/µl -> 2.5 µl
P198: c = 183 ng/µl -> 5.5 µl
P200: c = 464 ng/µl -> 2.2 µl
P236: c = 291 ng/µl -> 3.4 µl
P263: c = 158 ng/µl -> 6.3 µl
Positive control: 2.19/4 (pYES2+EGFP) c = 200 ng/µl -> 5µl
100 µg denatured sheared salmon sperm: the one from Simon was used -> 10 µl

TU_Munich,2010,Team:TU Munich#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to the same type of molecule and share a common design. However, each transmitter molecule can only interact and activate a certain subset of logic gates. In other words, logic gates have to recognize as well as bind the corresponding transmitter molecules and are capable of producing a new output transmitter molecule. Depending on the type of the logic gate (AND, OR or NOT [6] ), an output transmitter is only created if both input transmitter molecules are present (AND), at least one of two input transmitters is present (OR) or if no input transmitter is present at all (NOT). Once a logic gate has produced a new output transmitter, these transmitters can in turn address another subset (""layer"") of logic gates. In theory many layers of logic gates can be connected this way allowing the creation of large networks. Until this step, various transmitter molecules might have been produced. But in order to create a Biobrick output, the last layer of logic gates finally generates transmitter molecules that will not active logic gates, but will rather interact with the cell metabolism to produce a BioBrick response. In other words, the last layer of transmitter molecules is capable of regulating BioBrick formation.
Summarizing, the network establishes a connection between input BioBricks and output BioBricks in a functional manner. Having addressed the basic layout of the molecular network, the next step is to determine what type of molecules can perform the required functions. We decided to use RNA, both as transmitter molecules and for constructing logic gates. Several advantages result from the utilization of RNA as the central element:
During the last years, many Biobricks were designed that are sensitive to various chemicals and substances. These BioBricks often function as a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA sequence and consequently would be capable to produce a specific transmitter RNA molecule. Thus, in principle each BioBrick which involves transcription can be integrated in our network.
Since all logic gates are capable of producing transmitter RNA, they can also produce functional mRNA encoding any protein. This means, each BioBrick consisting of protein or RNA can be produced as an output of our network.
If RNA forms both, the transmitter molecule and the logic gates, they can specifically interact by RNA-RNA interaction, which is highly predictable compared to protein interactions. This allows to generate a library of transmitters and gates in silico. Such a library is essential for the creation of large networks.
RNA production is fast and energy saving for a cell. Consequently, operating a network that only produces RNA rather than proteins will also be faster and more efficient for the host cell. Since our logic gates are based on transcription,"

Discussion: Future Plans
Our team achieved our objectives and successfully managed to demonstrate PETase enzymatic activity in a laboratory setting. In the future, our team envisions our enzyme degrading plastic collected directly from the ocean. To this end, we reached out to Parley for the Oceans, an organization dedicated to tackling threats to our oceans. After contacting Parley, we were redirected to their Junior Project Manager, Lisa Gran, who sent us 10g of “mixed raw plastic” from the organization’s most recent beach cleanup. Future directions of our project would include characterizing degradation of the acquired mixed plastic to simulate a real-world situation and work towards optimizing our system.

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
Bonn,2012,Team:Bonn#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"-BioBrick LOV with two PstI sites instead of using the distribution. Our work with the other parts could be resumed and we finished the final ligation for the LOV-ccdB and Lov-LacZalpha fusion constructs. But we could not remove the two PstI restriction sites. Additionally we removed one PstI restriction site from the single LOV domain for the fusion system.
LOVTAP
We used 2 month for the troubleshooting of our LOVTAP sample from the distribution plate. The first experiments with our LOVTAP plasmid were misinterpreted. We thought our problems lay in the restrictions, PCR or our transformation. In fact, restriction and transformation worked well with all the other plasmids. We also sent out the plasmid for sequencing. We could not get sequencing results matching any part of the LOVTAP plasmid at all but had a contamination with another sequence. Finally we asked two other German iGEM teams (LMU Munich and Darmstadt) for a sample of their distribution plate LOVTAP. This samples did not lead to good sequencing results either and showed the same pattern of degeneration. In the end we used LOVTAP-pCal-n (modified) instead of the Biobrick.

SYSU-Software,2015,Team:SYSU-Software#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," on Synbio, it is very easy to play!
After Yi Shi finished her introduction to the game, Q & A session began. The questions raised by the freshmen were so professional. They were interested in 3A assembly, and asked us why the 3A assembly would work for standard parts. Also, they asked us many questions on our project or the project of last year. One of the questions, concerning the project of last year FLAME, is:
Yi Shi is introducing our project in the mini lecture to freshmen of life sciences.
“Why a fixed framework would help?
It does not provide enough flexibility. ”
We believe that, flexibility and user-friendliness are not contradictory. For advanced users, we should provide more flexibility to them; but for amateurs, we should provide them with a user-friendly user interface, and try our best to cut down the unnecessary steps that users are not familiar with.
5. Poker on Safety
Through human practice, we realize the importance of propagating biosafety. Many people are very concerned about biosafety, but they are not familiar with what is biosafety; they lack knowledge on biology. Therefore, as a prelude to the release of our software, we want to promote the knowledge of biological safety to the public.
We decided to design a pack of poker, which has both practicability and general significance.
The design of text (which will be printed on the poker) is not easy, because the biosafety problems usually cannot be explained clearly in a few words, but space in poker is limited. So we designed the text as elaborate and concise as possible, to solve this contradiction. According to the suit of cards we design four parts, including the potential dangers brought by the development of biotechnology, the impact of biosafety on human beings, biosafety in agriculture, animal husbandry and food industry, laboratory biosafety guide. The poker not only aims to the promotion of science, but also introduction to biosafety in lab.
We hope that when people are playing poker, they are able to pick up some knowledge on biosafety. Hopefully scientists and non-scientists alike can learn something from the poker.
Here shows some of the poker.
Qianhui Wan and Zhilu He are playing card as well as leaning biosafety.

BIT,2016,Team:BIT-China#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," they talked about whether we can give an                                 artificial signal to indicate the plasmid lost and kill the bacteria.                                 In this way, they can reduce the cost of heat treatment to eliminate the                                 bacteria before the emission to the environment. Besides, they raised a                                 question about the distribution of inhibitor proteins as well as the plasmids.                                 The random distribution may also lead to the signal delay, which inspire hot                                 discussion among our team members. These considerations give us                                 more possibilities to perfect our project and expand our project into industry production.
The company’s manager said that plasmid instability was really a troublesome problem and encouraged us to polish our project. The staff also complained about the complex processing of pollutions containing antibiotics. All those words came to expand our                                 background and reminded us of the emergencies of unlimited use of antibiotics.
Questionnaires
To further investigate the issues of antibiotic-use and the public                                 acceptance, we chose Internet survey method among scientists,                                 researchers, common students of BIT and general public to collect information of theirs opinions to iGEM,  our project,  plasmid losing problem and antibiotics. We finally gathered 324 valid questionnaires in the end.
Part of the results and questions are shown in fig.7.
From the results, we can say:
a) Over 96.11% of people think iGEM is of help to every iGEMer, 54.77% of them think this competition can improve students’ ability widely;
b) Over 92.72% of people have ever noticed the plasmid-losing problem, 54.27% has been affected by it seriously;
c) Over 95.76% of people is concerned about the use of antibiotics, 69.01% of them think antibiotics are very harmful, and should be treated cautiously;
d) Over 92.93% of people show interests in our project, 54.77% of them would like to try our plasmid-free system in their experiments.

The enneagram: Discover your type (5th of June)
We had a whole days course on “The enneagram”, which is a tool to identify types of personalities. We did this to strengthen the personal bonds inside the group, to become aware of our own up- and downsides and to gain awareness of how to use this knowledge in favor of our team and project.

Ethics workshop at KU (21st of August)
Ethics workshop at KU. Three girls from our team participated in the Ethics Workshop in Copenhagen organized by the UNIK-Denmark team. Our project encourages many ethical issues and the workshop was therefore very suitable and beneficial. We learned a lot about dealing with ethical issues in synthetic biology and got many good inputs to an ethics-related discussion about our project. In addition to this we also got in touch with relevant people and organizations that have been able to help us continue with our human practices.  We would like to thank the UNIK-Denmark team for the invitation and their work - it was a very nice workshop.

Our team was very lucky and extremely pleased to be able to participate in the UK iGEM Meet-up organized by YSB (Young Synthetic Biologists) in collaboration with the UCL-team. The event was an excellent preparation for the Giant Jamboree because we could rehearse our presentation and make a first try to design a poster. In addition, we got the opportunity to hear about other teams' projects. We also participated in 6 different workshops: Intellectual Property, Human Practices, Characterization, Public Engagement, Citizen Science and BioArt. The other iGEM teams were very helpful in giving us constructive criticism and many good ideas for future work. Our team gained very much by attending the event - It was both fun and educational. We would like to thank YSB (Young Synthetic Biologists) and the UCL-team for two fantastic days in London.

Poor Driver In a Strange Car
The car is strange because it can only run forward or tumble. The probability of the two states is controlled through a handle in it. Even worth, there are no windows on this car but a barometer showing local altitude. How should the driver do to reach the top of the hill and stay at there? ... If you think about the design of bacterial chemotaxis pathway, you will find that this pathway just plays the role of the driver in the story above. Interestingly, we find E. coli chemotaxis pathway realizes this delicate dicision-making process through the interactions amount handful molecules. Our project will show how we learn the design principles from native pathway to complete our device.

TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," by the patch must only be active against the specific strains of bacteria causing wound infections.
Preferences:
Modularity: Ideally our patch can target different bacterial strains by simply changing the bacteriocin encoding gene.
Longevity: Our patch should be able to perform its function for approximately 3 to 4 days, reducing the number of wound dressing changes patients experience.
Storability: The patch should have a long shelf-life and should be straightforward to store to compete with already existing                           treatments and to avoid availability issues.
Approval: The base material of the patch (the hydrogel) should ideally be already approved by the U.S. Food and                           Drug Administration (FDA) and  European Medicines Agency such that only the polymerisation and integration of living organisms requires                           investigation and approval by regulatory institutions to accelerate implementation.
Constraints:
The bacteriocins secreted by the patch must not be toxic to E. coli
Our dextran hydrogel is very suitable for wound healing. Our hydrogel is stable at                         physiological conditions for months and can be stored in a dried state and re-swollen prior                         to use, avoiding availability problems (9) . Dextran is already approved by the FDA for                         clinical use for plasma volume expansion, antithrombotic agent and peripheral flow promotion (10) . Furthermore, the hydrogel can be easily sterilized using radiation (11) .

To target Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram positive bacteria,                          we use lysostaphin. Lysostaphin is a zinc endopeptidase that cleaves the pentaglycine                         cross-bridges present in the bacterial cell wall of S. aureus. Lysostaphin exhibits its                         lytic effect not only against regular S. aureus, but also against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Recently, it was                         demonstrated that hydrogels delivering lysostaphin outperform prophylactic antibiotic                         treatment and soluble lysostaphin treatment in murine femur fracture models (12) . The                         iGEM teams HIT-Harbin 2012 and Stockholm 2016 have used lysostaphin before in their                         projects to target S. aureus. However, both teams relied on cell lysis to free the                         lysostaphin. For our application, this approach is not"

Freiburg,2014,Team:Freiburg#Content#PolicyAndPractices#artificialcell_-_-_TEXT.html," genome can indeed provide the desired functionality, but might also have not foreseeable effects. A feature of living cells is the interaction with the environment. It is difficult to assess the impact such interaction for the environment is as expected.
Furthermore, it has to be noted that currently it is possible to manipulate and utilize unicellular organisms, however in the future it is also conceivable to engineer higher organisms. The designation of ""living machines"" then abates these creatures to their pure function.
The concept of ""living"" and ""non-living"" organisms create a hybrid of both and does not answer which properties apply to these exactly. This might implicate associations about properties and facts which do not match the actual conditions in these organisms. Furthermore, the linguistic imprecision could have an effect on future ethical debates since it can open up possibilities for interpretation.
This has, under the assumption of a future ""minimal cell"" the result of changing perspective on life itself. The clear distinction between animate and inanimate is repealed, life as a laboratory adjustable process is demystified.
Artificial or artificially generated - The „artificial cell“
An often used term in synthetic biology besides ""living machines"" is ""artificial cell"" or ""synthetic cell"". Both terms mean artificial, constructed, pseudo and pose as the opposite of ""natural"" (Oxford dictionary).
It should be noted what is exactly characterize as an ""artificial"" cell, as the term has no clear semantic boundaries. The laboratory-designed organisms are made as well as natural cells of organic material and have cellular structures. “Natural"" cell carry the DNA or RNA necessary for reproduction, evolution, and metabolism information as well as the “artificial cell”.
The artificiality of the cells lies precisely in the laboratory completed synthetic production method, which is why they can be labeled as ""genetic artificiality"" (Birnbacher 2006).
The ambiguous and imprecise formulation can lead, as much as the phrase ""living machine"" to ethical problems. It is indicated that the synthetic modified organisms differentiate from ""natural"" organisms and are in contrast ""unnatural"". Splitting organisms in these two groups leads to an apparent dissection of the concept of life, even though both are ""natural.""
Again, as with the distinction between ""living"" and ""non-living"" this leads the division between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" to an altered prospect on life and a problematic classification and grading of the unit life (Boldt / Müller 2009).

Economic Aspects towards Synthetic Biology (NUS)
For some, genetic engineering is akin to playing God. However, to many synthetic biologists and life science researchers, genetic engineering is a key pathway to exploring a plethora of new applications and technologies. Unfortunately, few of such technologies have been successfully commercialised. Yet, for these select few, they are largely disruptive in their own fields.
To illustrate this point is the development of the antimalarial drug, artemisinin. Artemisinin was first extracted from Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, in the 1970s [6]. Since then, global demand for artemisinin has only increased, especially after 2001, when the World Health Organisation identified artemisinin-combination therapies as the recommended first-line treatment for malaria [7]. Yet, the supply of artemisinin remained variable due to the limited cultivation of sweet wormwood, which in turn translated to fluctuating and volatile costs of artemisinin-combination therapies. The vagaries of the artemisinin supply inspired several companies and researchers to set about developing novel alternative methods for the synthetic production of artemisinin to complement plant-derived sources. Sanofi, a Paris-based pharmaceutical company, for example, employed the use of a genetically-engineered yeast that used glucose as a feedstock, to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin [8]. This genetically-engineered yeast was also simultaneously “engineered” by Jay Keasling, a researcher at the University of California (Berkeley), who also developed the chemical pathways necessary for the successful bioproduction of artemisinic acid [9].
The advantage a synthetic biology-approach of artemisinin production provides, such as cheaper and more stable source of artemisinin, is clear. However, the concerns arising over synthetically-produced artemisinin (which manifests as market resistance), such as the monopolistic behaviour of pharmaceutical companies, and the loss of livelihood of the Artemisia farmers, must not be ignored. The balance between novel technologies, and its social and ethical implications must be carefully considered - is synthetic artemisinin really cheaper? How can synthetic biology help the farmers whose livelihoods have been disrupted by a decrease in demand for sweet wormwood? How can synthetic artemisinin be responsibly produced and consumed? Without giving due thought and consideration to the existing methods of artemisinin production, it would be a travesty and tragedy to brashly impose synthetic artemisinin on all its consumers.

Aspartate
Also called aspartic acid, it is synthesize in a transamination reaction between oxalacetate and glutamate, thanks to the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, in the Krebs cycle. Aspartate can also be produce from fumarate, using the enzyme aspartate ammonia lyase. In microorganisms, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including methionine, threonine, lysine, isoleucine and asparagine. It is involve in others biological cycles ase in inosine synthesis (precursor of purine bases).
Triggering aspartate biosynthesis will be possible thanks to a new device, that will contain an specific promoter (PprhJ or PfecA) and an ORF which encodes for aspartate ammonia lyase. Over-expression of this enzyme will increase the amount of aspartate produced by E. coli. It is suppose that its concentration reach such levels that aspartate will spread through bacteria membranes. This construction would be made in a high copy plasmid.
Glutamate
It is a non-essential amino acid, that is denominated glutamic acid and play a key role in cellular metabolism, because its implication in some transamination reactions and its role as transporter of ammonia. Glutamate is produced in TCA, from 2-oxoglutarate, in the reaction catalyzed by glutamate deshidrogenase. However, this is not the only production route, because can also be synthesized from glutamine, in the reaction catalyzed by glutamate synthase, that generate two molecules of glutamate.
The procedure that will be employed to regulate and increase glutamate production will lie in overexpression of the two subunits that make up the enzyme glutamate synthase, called GltD and GltB, both under control of the promoter PprhJ/PfecA. This way, it is expected a higher flux in this route, that would produce an important amount of glutamate from glutamine, and that will be subordinated to activation by PrhI/PfecA. It is suppose that its concentration reach such levels that aspartate will spread through bacteria membranes, because there is no"
UMaryland,2018,Team:UMaryland#BCmodel_-_-_TEXT.html," mM of product when fed high-crystalline PET and 0.3 mM of product when fed thin-sheet PET.
Using above data we can determine the rate constants.
Results
Therefore, with the calculated local concentration of our enzyme and our enzyme kinetic parameter we were able to predict the rate of degradation of a plastic water bottle. If we desire 4 grams of PET to completely degrade to its subsequent product MHET, using the molecular weight of MHET (Mw = 210.185 g mol-1), we determine that the final concentration of MHET in a 1 L container would be 0.019 M. Since PET is not an aqueous substance, it is difficult to assign it a “concentration” value for our equation. Therefore we would determine the creation time of MHET rather than the degradation time of PET.
Using our equation:
With the following parameters:
-  [PETase] = 3.41 µM
-  k = 0.00463 s-1 for high crystalline PET
-  [MHET] = 0.019 M
Solving for time, we predict that complete degradation of one PET bottle sandwiched between two bacterial cellulose sheets with 50% saturation of our PETase-CBD fusion protein will occur in 1.2 x 106 seconds, or approximately 14 days.
As degradation progresses, the appropriateness of our zero-order enzyme kinetics model will decrease as the surface area of PET available to our enzyme will become more significant.

If developed into a commercial product, engineered yeast could be released into the environment, with unknown consequences. Although we expect that our yeast would pose no health threat, environmental risk could be minimized by the addition of a genetic killswitch into our system.
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks?
A. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Using E.coli poses a potential risk to the health and safety of our team members working in the lab if it is handled improperly or consumed. It may cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and may adversely affect kidneys.
Using Sybr Safe and Ethidium Bromide to make gels poses health risks because both chemicals are mutagens.
B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
The risks to the safety and health of the general public are the same as those for individuals directly working with these biological materials.
C. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
Sybr Safe and Ethidium Bromide both cause risks to the environment because they are both mutagens.
D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
There is slight concern for the misuse of our systems, since any gene could be substituted in place of the existing outputs.
What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution's safety training requirements, if available.
All student members of our team have been trained by student advisers about proper lab techniques, lab etiquette, and biohazard waste disposal. All team members have completed the University of Washington's online training in biosafety, fume hood use, managing lab chemicals, electrical safety, asbestos awareness, and fire extinguisher. Advisers have been trained by their respective labs in accordance with the University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety Committee's regulations. Regular EH&S inspections ensure that the lab is up to university lab standards.
Under what biosafety provisions will/do you work?
A. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.
Environmental Health and Safety at the University of Washington
B. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them?
The University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety (UW EHS) committee determines biosafety regulations and guidelines for all labs associated with our campus. We have not discussed this specific iGEM project with members of the EHS committee;"

What did we add?
Indeed, only by conducting a complete cost-effectiveness analysis can we evaluate whether the project would be cost-effective.  It also would allow us to have a deeper understanding of the current situation of liver cancer treatment.  Therefore, we decided to establish a mathematical model to summarize several existing liver cancer drugs and to set up a reasonable price range for our project.

According to Professor Liu's suggestion, it is critical to improve the project towards the market’s demand.  Only projects that are accepted by the market are worthwhile for further development.  Therefore, we needed to systematically identify our own strengths through the comparison with existing drugs.

Step 2 Write a business plan
Interviewing the entrepreneurial tutor Pengbo Shang
In the process of writing a business plan, we interviewed the entrepreneurial tutor Pengbo Shang.  Pengbo Shang is the deputy secretary of the China Education Innovation School-Enterprise Alliance (Production Alliance).  He’s also a career coach of Tsinghua University and a Distinguished Research Fellow of London Business School.  He himself has been engaged in health care and medical device industry for more than ten years.

Since currently no genetic drug is available for the treatment of liver cancer, we found it difficult to make a reference when analyzing the market.  In the interview, Professor Shang told us that we should instead focus on the existing chemotherapies and make comparison with them.  We can also analyze the general situation of genetic drugs, from which we can learn about patients receiving such drugs (their feedback, etc.) and the general market.  By summarizing the information, we would still be able to somehow predict our products’ development in the market.

At the same time, he emphasizes that timing is the key when it comes to medical products.  We need to carefully consider the time required for every step (research, clinical trials, marketing, etc.) and include them in the scheme.  The consequential timetable then becomes an important item for investors to evaluate the efficiency of our team.  To attract great market share, we would also want to make the development cycle as short as possible.

Furthermore, iGEM Team TU Darmstadt was working with this tRNA and the OMeY-synthetase. Our Team is using the tRNA in this project to incorporate the canonical amino acid tyrosine with tyrosyl synthetase in response to an amber stop codon as well as an ONBY with an ONBY-synthetase in E. coli. Furthermore, DMNBS synthetase variants undergo screening for incorporation efficiency and fidelity, which are done by using this BioBrick. These variants are proven to work with the tRNA and are all listed in the section Parts Collection . Incorporation of ncAA: The tRNA contains an amber anticodon for incorporating the ncAA in response to a recoded amber termination codon. It has been used previously in an amberless E. coli strain C321.∆A.expb as well as in BL21 DE3 gold. When working with a recoded amber codon in BL21 DE3, the tRNA is competing with the release factor1 at the amber stop codon. As amber stop codons add up to only about 7% of total stop codons, amber suppression still works appropriately. An application of the tRNA is either the incorporation of the ncAA into a protein or usage with a reporter plasmid (for example pFRY ) for probing ncAA tRNA/synthetase pair variants regarding efficiency and fidelity. Assembly in a synthetase plasmid for incorporation of ncAA:

It could be a possibility to cover the silk with, for example, Ibumetin (NSAID-preparate), so you could kill the pain locally and avoid the side effects which Ibumetin can have (such as increased stomach acid production, blood thinner effect and much more), or could expand the movement and not prevent limitation of movement under rehabilitation of, for example, fingers. If the patient is hospitalized, the bandage will be washed off with lukewarm water mixed with NaCl (commonly known as salt). This can not be done in the ambulance or elsewhere due to the time and the space that is needed for this kind of treatment. When the wound is kept moist it increases the movement and the flexibility of the surrounding skin/new skin. The pain is minimized because the skin is not as tight and the bandage will not grab skin.”

**Fibrin: is created in the body under the healing process of a wound. Fibrin and granulation has to be present for an effective healing of the wound. If there is only fibrin when healing, the healing process stops. It is therefore important to ensure that the excess of fibrin is scratched off (often made by a nurse or a doctor).
Interviewing Hans Jørn Kolmos
From your point of view, how big is the resistance problem?
He believes that it is an increasing problem, but it should not be the cause of any panic yet. New strategies should be devolved in the use of antibiotics so the increase in antibiotic resistance becomes limited. Antibiotics should not be used to treat infections that we do not know the cause of. Instead a more careful approach in the distribution should be taken. He suggested a simple approach to this issue: three simple steps should undertaken before giving an antibiotic treatment to an infection. First step is to isolate the bacteria. This can be done by evaluating the microorganisms species, its concentration and the origin of isolation. The second step is to conclude whether the isolated microorganism is the cause of  infection. This can be done in association with e.g. a prosthesis where an infection has occurred. The third step is to evaluate whether antibiotics can be used against the infection. If the infection occurred in a prosthesis, the bacteria would most likely develop a biofilm. If treated with antibiotics, the infectious bacteria will only be exposed to small concentrations of antibiotics and this will provide time to develop resistance"

Week 16 : choosing an AHL pair, improving diffusion
Monday 8th September
We have enough crosstalk results to decide which pair of quorum sensing systems we will use : Las and Lux. See this article for more details.
Diffusion experiment (trying to have a correlation between channel length and time of fluorescence, having cells at the end of a channel and adding pure HSL at the other end of the channel, see this article for more details on the setup) : We tried lower concentrations of pure HSL and the wells start shining at different moments, but we still don't have any correlation between channel length and starting time of fluorescence, because our chip seems to be leaky and some wells dried completely. However, this experiment enables us to check that fluorescence appears after a reasonable time and that channel length probably doesn't influence this time too much.
On the modeling side, we are not able to retrieve diffusion coefficient of HSL from this diffusion experiment but we can use a parameter from literature.

Magnetic Nanoparticles Parts
One of the sub-projects for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds is to reduce heavy metals to create magnetic nanoparticles that can then be removed from the pond.  To do this we need to be able to produce Mms6 (the iron reducing protein) and show that it can successfully produce the nanoparticles within the Escherichia coli cell.  He is the work we have accomplished so far to characterize Mms6.
Characterization of Mms6
Characterized Parts
BBa_K249019
Hypothesis
Induction of Mms6 protein overexpression in Escherichia coli DH5α cells will cause a change in growth.
Introduction
A parallel project we are undertaking in oilsands remediation is in the clean-up of heavy metal contaminants utilizing the Mms6 protein expressed by Magnetiospirilum magneticum1. The Mms6 protein is capable of reducing aqueous iron into magnetite nanoparticles . The magnetite nanoparticles can be removed with much greater ease than aqueous iron.
We chose to investigate how the presence of the Mms6 protein affected Escherichia coli DH5α, its bacterial host cell.
Method
In order to characterize the effect of Mms6 production on Escherichia coli DH5α cells, we utilized BioBrick BBa_K249019 , a part submitted by the 2009 Lethbridge iGEM team. BBa_K249019 is the Mms6 coding region ( BBa_K249016 ) with a ribosomal binding side ( BBa_B0030 ) and a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) under the control of a lactose inducible promoter ( BBa_R0010 ).
We inoculated two 500 mL cultures of LB media with Escherichia coli DH5α cells containing BBa_K249019 and grew the cells until they reached approximately 0.6 OD600 units. At this point, expression of the Mms6 protein was induced in one of the 500 mL cultures by the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl β"

Poster：
With carrying the experiment forward , we completed our poster step by step. We considered thoroughly and checked quite a lot of times . after a prolonged endeavor, we finished our poster perfectly.
Parts：
With hard work from May to September, we accomplished and  submitted the parts we designed to the iGEM Registry. All six parts (ctcbm cbm accoh acdoc bccoh bcdoc rtcoh rtdoc) achieved the standards of both bronze and silver medal.
Hunman practice:
1、In our summer vacation, we took part in National Youth Science Camp and advertise for IGEM.  2、We visited a pharmaceutical factory around our city to propagandize our project last term.  3、In august, we signed up for the meeting holed by Peking University. This time we not only have a practice for the comptation, but spent a good four-day's holiday as well. 4、We did some experiment in the Company Origin and learned many skills there. All of them gave us a large amount of help when we proceeded our project.
Conclusion：
We will pesent a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. And we matched the condition of both Bronze and silver medal. Thank you for the effort of all team members, thank you for IGEM that each of us have an opportunity to improve ourselves.

“So where’s she?”
“What’s wrong with you, my Rose?” Little prince asked with great anxiety after seeing Rose drooped her head and lost her previous brightness.
“Finally you’re back…Eh-hem…” Rose said in a hoarse voice, “I have been in trouble breathing smoothly since a wind with yellow powder arrived two days ago.”
“I have a friend who can cure of your ill, and I will bring you to her home.”
“That’s kind of you.”
Little Dot, the driver of firefly, returned to Ecoli carrying Little Prince and Rose.
“Is this Rose? Hello Rose, I’m Summer! Welcome to visiting Ecoli! Haha…”
“Hello…Eh-hem…”
“Summer, she’s ill with the same disease in you star, could you please take treatment on her as soon as possible?”
“Sure, it’s my pleasure to help you. By the way, I feel so lucky to prepare for more victims of the yellow powder in advance.”
“What’s that weird stuff?! If it will stain my beautiful petals, I’d better give up the remedy. ”
“Be quiet, or I will show you something more weird…”
“It’s amazing that I feel relaxed a lot at once!” “Prince, Can you hear my resumptive wonderful voice?”
“Yes, it’s so graceful.” Said little prince with cheerful smile.
Rose was vigorous after recovering from her illness, and she began her single dance. Her four sharp claws were no more tools to protect herself but hands and feet which can produce exquisite dancing posture. Look, she was inviting Prince to dance together! That scene was so fantastic that we nearly couldn’t believe that it had once appeared in Little Prince's dream. The four little fellows could’t help themselves but accompanying the two dancers with their own instruments. Moved by the sweetness before her eyes, Summer strengthened her ideal to protect the universe, and enhanced her confidence as Emissary of Flame Angel.

Health Effects from Water Contaminated with Arsenic and Naphthalene
Our Project and Your Health
Arsenic and naphthalene are known human health and environmental hazards. Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is linked to several types of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and numerous other health problems worldwide (Abernathy et al., 1999). Naphthalene ingestion is linked to hemolytic anemia, cataracts, and liver and kidney damage (National Pesticide Information Center, 2008). Oil sands production is a rapidly growing enterprise,so monitoring arsenic and naphthalene in affected waterways is increasingly important (Environmental Health Perspectives, 2009).
Health studies have begun on local residents in close proximity to oil sands sites who may be ingesting fresh water, fish, or wildlife with high levels of arsenic or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including naphthalene. In the case of Fort Chipewyan, CA, a small town along the Athabasca River, the local population was shown to have a much higher rate of rare forms of life-threatening cancer than expected. A contributing factor may have been “levels of arsenic, mercury and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are higher than would be considered safe"" according to Kevin Timoney a researcher part of the  study of the Chipewyan First Nation. At the moment there is a clear lack of information, or method to accurately and continuously monitor major water sources for contamination or leaks of potentially harmful toxins. This has serious implications for local populations in affected areas. Such a tool would undoubtably have uses globally to monitor our water supply and keep populations safe from water poisoned with arsenic or poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Local residents near heavy oil sands extraction are growing increasingly concerned about their water becoming contaminated"

UIOWA,2018,Team:UIOWA#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," a mummy given a time limit.
We moved forward into giving presentations about our various projects.                         We received feedback from other teams, as well as professors and mentors.                         Our own Midwest iGEM representative,  John Girgis, made an appearance and                         gave us some helpful insight on what could make our projects better.
We were then treated to a Michigan State tradition; samples of their ice                         cream. Michigan State has their own ice cream store where the students make                         and sell a variety of flavors. Everything from peanut butter flavored to                         blueberry. After filling our stomachs, we got to go on a tour of the labs that the MSU iGEM team works in. We even got to see all of their plant                         and moss collections.
The day finished with a big board-game party. The iGEM team set up a variety                         of board games and all of the teams got to experience a little friendly                         competition in a new form. But we didn’t want to end the trip there.                         We had such a great time with the MSU team that we decided to hang out                         for a little while longer. We made some great friends, ate some good                         food and bonded over everyone’s favorite topic: science.
TRIO Escape Room for High School Students
University of Iowa’s iGEM team collaborated with Trio Upward Bound Projects to create a hands-on escape room revolved around synthetic biology.                         The escape room took place at North Liberty Highschool in North Liberty Iowa. A group of 52 students ranging from the ages 14-17 attended the                         after-school workshop. To begin, a lecture was given to provide students with the information they would need to be able to complete the escape room.                         The basic idea of synthetic biology was explained along with topics such as protein synthesis, bioethics, biobricks, careers in synthetic biology, and mutations.                         The main goal of this workshop was to introduce high school students to the field of synthetic biology and persuade them to pursue the field in the future.
One of the main topics of the escape room was bioethics. The concept of the escape room was revolved around a lab that was working on genetically modifying                         mosquitos to eradicate malaria. The students were told that these mosquitos escaped and risked being released into the environment where they could cause                         potential harm.  Students had to utilize concepts like translation and transcription to decipher clues and left around the room.
To begin, a sequence of template DNA was provided. The students had to transcribe this template DNA into mRNA to find a code to unlock a briefcase"
Tsinghua-A,2015,Team:Tsinghua-A_-_-_TEXT.html," found in your body fluid). Don’t worry, it doesn’t necessarily mean you got the cancer. Because the amount of those three mi-RNA has to satisfy this equation：
So, we have to turn the GFP brightness information into the possibility of patient being afflicted with cancer. And we use the CV technology to help us achieve that goal.
For example, we now have the photo of the test paper(The color of test paper itself might be light yellow due to the ambient light or the paper quality).
We use Matlab to read this file and we can get an array of the RGB value of this image.Then,we can use this function to calculate the Brightness of each pixel:Y=0.299*R+0.587*G+0.114*B
Then we have to normalize these data to eliminate the effect of the ambient light.We pick an pixel in the “white” area and calculate its brightness/255, set this as constant C, and use it to multiply every pixel’s brightness.
After that, we will get a new array of the normalized brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We assume that there is a linear relationship between the brightness of the system and the amount of GFP in the system. Now we can get a relative stoichiometric relation of three mi-RNA. We use the function mentioned above to sum the data proportionately. We set B2P(Brightness to Possibility) as the symbol of this value.
Finally we use this data to calculate the possibility of having cancer.(Of course we have to get the threshold of B2P value. But that can be easily calculated through a machine learning or a basic statistical method if we can get enough samples.)
HUMAN PRACTICE
We try to ""go beyond the lab"" to imagine our projects in a social context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of our technologies.

Esophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) is occurred in esophageal epithelial tissue malignant tumor, is one of the diseases having serious threat to people's health and life. The early symptoms of Esophageal Cancer is hidden and subtle so that there is rare clinical early esophageal cancer patients. While the patients who found that the symptoms, is late more, and lose the chance of early treatment.

I might just be a typical Long Island kid who loves relaxing at the beach. Most summers I can be found in Montauk, Fire Island, Cupsogue, and some of the Babylon beaches. Just call me a beach aficionado. But this summer I can definitely say that my time has shifted from being a beach bum to being a pedant. Worry not, you didn’t misread. That means someone who pays attention to minor details.  To be honest, I do love science. I’m amazed that the very atoms that compose our cells are the products of a dying star. When a star explodes, the hydrogen and helium fuse into heavier elements, like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen—the ingredients of life. And those products govern the behavior of our cellular processes. I think that’s incredible.  In the future, I aspire to be a pediatric oncologist and also conduct cancer research. I guess you can say I’m pre-MD/PhD, if that exists. Until then, I can be found hanging out on campus, or maybe sneaking in a beach day.

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"10 bacteria with gate 1 on LB agar plate which was covered by a soft agar containing the indicator strain
In a different assay a soft agar with the indicator strain was spread on the plates. 100µl of the supernatant from the TOP10 growth medium were spread on top of the soft agar. After incubation, a color change didn't appear. This time the low expression of AHL caused by the leakiness of the Ptet promoter wasn't sufficient in the supernatant in order to change the color of the indicator strain. The reason for the results is that the induction of gate 1 by aTc was missing.

Gate 2
Characterization of Gate 2 of the alpha system
Objective
The goal is to characterize the second gate (Plac-LuxR) of the alpha system, using a reporter gene (GFP) under the Plux promoter and varying concentrations of AHL.
Description
In this experiment, varying concentrations of 3o6c-AHL (3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone) are to be added to a culture of E. coli K-12 Top 10 containing two different plasmids: pSB1C3-Plac-LuxR and pSB1A2-Plux-GFP.
When adding the inducer IPTG to the bacteria we expect to get the protein LuxR in excess and by adding AHL to the bacteria, the complex LuxR-AHL supposed to form. If the complex forms properly it will bind to the Plux promoter and GFP will be expressed. We expect higher GFP fluorescence when higher AHL concentration is administered, until the system will be saturated.
The GFP fluorescence of the bacteria (emission peak: 511nm) can be measured using a plate-reader.
To test the leakiness of the Plac promoter, we used the same bacteria without IPTG induction.
for full protocol follow the link
Results
As can be seen from the graph, there was a rise in the GFP fluorescence according to the rise in AHL concentrations until 0.1 µM AHL. At higher concentrations of AHL, saturation in the GFP expression can be seen.
The experiment results showed that a relative"

Next, the list of the AA rates of each protein was ranked by the (1) serine rate, (2) arginine rate, and (3) serine plus arginine rate.
Finally, a manual curation was performed to remove the unknown, predicted or similar proteins.
The results of top 15 list of serine rate and arginine rate were shown below.
1.Top serine % of proteins in Uniprot database
Protein TPRXL is the highest serine rate by 67% and Protamine-B is the highest arginine rate by 70%. According to the unique roles and significant fire retardant effects played by phosphorus (serine) and nitrogen (arginine), serine plus arginine rate was calculated for our needs.
 
Top 10 of serine plus arginine rates of proteins in Uniprot was shown below.
Top 10 list of serine plus arginine rate showed that Protamine P3 and TPI6 are the top 2 proteins which are rich in arginine but short of serine. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 is more ideal for our criteria, which contains 33% of arginine and 40% of serine, matching our goal of finding a protein both rich in serine and arginine.
 
Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 is a member belonging to SR protein family, which is a group of proteins conserved in serine/arginine-rich domain.
 
In our following experiments, we decided to use proteins in SR family as our target for bio-fire-retardant material.

SR protein family
Reference:  Genome Biol. 2009 , Biochem J. 2009
The SR protein family comprises a group of structurally related proteins with a conserved domain rich in serine (S) and arginine (R), which is so-called SR domain. They are involved in various mRNA metabolism and play essential roles in diverse cell functions such as constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA nuclear export, nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA translation, etc. SR proteins are important in regulation of gene expression and developmental processes. SR domains are characterized by their ability to interact with other proteins and involved in nuclear translocation.
Which SR protein should we take?

Taking integrals on both sides
\[ \int_0^t \mu \,dt = \int\dfrac{1}{X}\,dX  \]   \[\      \ln X = \mu t + C \qquad \text{where}\qquad C = \ln {X_0}    \]   \[\ \ln \frac{X}{X_0} = \mu t \] and \[\ X = X_0 e^{\mu t}\]
where \(X_0\) is the initial cell concentration. It follows from the above equation that a graph of \( \ln \frac{X}{X_0}\)plotted against time will display \(\mu\) in its instantaneous slope. When growth is exponential, \(\frac{dX}{dt} = \mu_g X \) and the graph is linear with a slope of \( \mu_g\). At steady state conditions, \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 \), and cell growth approaches cell loss, so that \(\mu_g X = K_d X\). During this stationary phase, the graph plateaus with horizontal slope.
In the cell death or decline phase where \(K_dX >> \mu_g X\), the graph decreases with negative slope. With first-order kinetics for cell decline,
\[\ \dfrac{1}{X} \dfrac{dX}{dt} = -K_d\qquad \text{      }\qquad \ln \frac{X}{X_0} = -K_d t    \]
and
\[\ X = X_0 e^{-k_d t}\]
Substrate Utilization
Substrate is utilized for producing new cells and for maintaining cells. If the cell maintenance coefficient is \(m\) and the dimensionless yield factor \(Y_{X / S}\) is the ratio of new cells mass to substrate consumed, that is
\[\ Y_{X / S} = \dfrac {\Delta X}{\Delta S}\]
then similar to the cell growth rate expression of equation (?), the rate of substrate utilization can be expressed as
\[\dfrac {dS}{dt} = -\mu_g \frac {1}{Y_{X / S}} X - mX \]
Product Formation
Similar to cell growth and substrate utilization, products formed can be expressed by a first-order differential equation. The specific rate of product formation, \(\frac{1}{X}\frac {dP}{dt}\) is proportional to the specific rate of"

The use of GMOs is restricted by newly set up regulations, listing the requirements that are to be met to prevent release of modified bacteria into the environment. Additionally, people accept that a complete shift towards renewable resources might only be possible by applying new techniques. Especially people that are annoyed by wind mills and earthquakes due to drilling for fossil fuels agree that keeping your mind open to other options is desirable. Interest in research increases, as the public starts to show more interest in sciences and wants to have a say in where their electricity comes from. More energy is available from renewable resources, as blue energy provides for the energy demand of 200,000 households in the Netherlands alone already. This is a development that causes a positive atmosphere. People are proud of Dutch research and industry, which initiated this type of water generated electricity.
Economics + Energy markets
The growing application of blue energy in the Netherlands results in media attention from all over the world. Tourists and companies from a wide range of countries come to visit the blue energy installation at the Afsluitdijk. The Dutch expertise on water management is seen to become an increasingly better export product, due to its link with synthetic biology. Investors see the rising potential of blue energy and start to invest in it. The number of blue energy setups increases steadily and their constant supply of energy facilitates the organisation of electricity management. The result of this is economic growth and a more prominent position worldwide for the Netherlands on the energy and technology market. Several other countries start specialising in research and development of blue energy membranes, which leads to competition as companies work to create the most efficient and affordable membranes. Such competition, together with upscaling of production, leads to a drop in prices. For consumers, blue energy is not much more expensive than other types of energy; even though investments must be paid back at first. On the world energy market, it is seen that oil prices are also falling. The increased interest in renewable energy lessens the demand for fossil fuels, resulting in somewhat lower prices. On the other hand, the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum has long been passed, and it eventually becomes clear that the profits for extraction of oil fail to weigh up against the costs. By the year 2050, fossil resources are not yet depleted, but only remain profitable where no renewable alternatives exist. The implementation of blue energy setups does however not only have a positive effect on the Dutch economy. The pumping system of the blue energy setup conflicts with the trade in mussel growing.

OUR TEAM
We are the team of China Agricultural University, CAU-China. For iGEM 2014, there are more than 20 members in our family and they spread from freshmen to juniors in CAU. It is the interest of synthetic biology and the ambition to propagate it that gathers us together. Though it is the second time for our team to ta ke part in this amazing internati onal competition, for most of us, it is the first chance to directly join in the big event. This year, our idea creat or, Mengni Wang, comes up with an idea named frozen by E.coli, intended to realize a dynamic pattern of snow flake with red flu orescence growing up from a point automatically with E.coli.
Story of Your Team :
This year, our idea creator, Mengni Wang, comes up with an idea named frozen by E.coli, intended to realize a dynamic pattern of snow flake with red fluorescence growing up from a point automatically with E.coli. Since last year, we have accomplished a series of tasks, such as Human Practice, Journal Club every week, e-book edition, team construction and so on. As members of our team, we get great pleasure from the process, especially from the activity of brainstorm. To be a better team, there is still a long way to go, but luckily, we are all adamant about and enthusiastic at that.
OUR PROJECT

What are we facing?
Biosafety has always been a major concern to the public, to the companies and to the researchers. Doubts and worries were raised just as genetic technology was invented. With the rapid growth of synthetic biology and the iGEM community, and more and more synthetic biology products being built with widely distributed DNA toolkits or the inexpensive DNA synthesis service(Synthetic and Will); we are facing the unprecedented biosafety issue of unwanted leakage of synthetic biology products to the environment that may cause unexpected but likely disastrous problems.
Predecessors
For decades, researchers were striving to build biosafety devices through auxotrophy or external inducive kill switches(Lee et al.); of the latter holins and restriction enzymes are most commonly used. Most failures of the previous devices were due to mutations and evolution of immunity(Moe-Behrens et al.) .
The two major threats of engineered microbes’ leakage are the possible horizontal gene transfer which will lead to the spread of recombinant DNA to the ecosystem, or the fact that engineered bacteria could contaminate or overrun the natural habitat.(Wright et al.))
Project Xscape
Under this circumstance, this year we decided to be a fundamentalist to synthetic biology, using genetic circuits and logic gates to establish biosafety devices which can apply to real-world situations.
Since cell death and lysis mean there is a continual presence of free DNA in the environment, holins, which are most widely used are excluded from our choices, and colicin E2 nucleases (Darmstadt iGEM2016) came into our site. We choose site non-specific nucleases since the entire genome and plasmids needed to be entirely digested to prevent the spread, and we use nucleases from a different family to prevent the possible evolution of nuclease inhibitors. Artificial DNA, RNA, and amino acids are a good solution, but due to its high cost so far, it is not applicable to most of the user.
For fermentation
The first device we build is for the fermentation; we want to execute any escaped engineered bacteria from the fermenter, whether the"
