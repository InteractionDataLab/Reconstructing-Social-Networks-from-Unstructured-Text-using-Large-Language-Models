TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," identify gene doping in blood samples with our method ADOPE.
ADOPE
We designed ADOPE to detect gene doping in blood samples by targeting the most striking difference between the natural and gene doping DNA, namely the exon-exon junctions that only exist in doping DNA ( Beiter et al., 2011 ). ADOPE consists of four main steps: sample preparation , prescreening , library preparation and sequencing .
Figure 2. A flow diagram of our detection method ADOPE. With the four steps sample preparation, prescreening, library preparation and sequencing.
1. Sample preparation
Blood samples are commonly taken from athletes during regular doping tests. We used these blood samples to extract DNA from serum or the buffycoat (serum and white blood cells) required for testing ( Ni et al., 2011 ). We built an extensive gene doping kinetics model to predict the amount of gene doping fragments in blood over time based an input concentration of gene doping vectors and an injection frequency. We used this model to determine the appropriate time window for gene doping testing based on the measured sensitivity of DNA extraction.
Figure 3. Concentration of doping DNA in the blood over time after a single intramuscular injection of 141 billion viral vectors. The detection limit of 1000 copies per mL of blood is estimated based on the loss of DNA that occurs during sample preparation and targeted sequencing preparation.
2. Prescreening
Figure 4. Colorimetric gold nanoparticle assay. Positive samples result in a red color, whereas negative samples result in a purple color.
We incorporated a prescreening step in our method based on the  advice of Dr. Oliver de Hon of the Dutch Doping Authorities. He emphasised the importance of a high throughput assay that could screen thousands of athletes simultaneously. Therefore, we developed a colorimetric assay based on the extent of gold nanoparticle aggregation ( Baetsen-Young et al., 2018 ). When target doping DNA is absent, the nanoparticle completely aggregates, resulting in a purple color. When target doping DNA is present, it forms a secondary structure with a targeting DNA probe,  which stabilizes the nanoparticle from aggregating, resulting in a red color .
3.Targeted library preparation
Positive prescreened samples proceed to our novel rapid targeted next generation sequencing. Targeted library preparation relies on our innovative fusion protein consisting of a Tn5 transposase and a dxCas9 . The fusion of these two proteins resulted in a target specific transposition. As a proof of concept, we showed that our fusion protein is target specific with an in vitro targeted"

For constructing BioGuide 2.0 we have some plans.
Short Term plan:
Next year we are planning to generate BioGuide 2.0 by using all parts     data but inorder to do this we will update our part database but easyway     is standardization and reorganizing all parts in partsregistrty.org     according to our suggestion because re-organizing and normalization     are crucial. We are planning to add new tools to improve graphs.Our     ultimate aim is finding best pathway based on automated construction     and input-output relation. BioGuide 2.0 will be more faster because     we are planning to use OODBMS and all all platform will support BioGuide     2.0.
Long term plan:
We want to improve our algoritm and add more parameter to make graphs     more effective. Our dream is embeding our software into partsregistry.org     so no mere iGEMers will choose parts in real time by using our software.
Suggestions based on PartsRegistry Survey Results
First suggesiton is offering fartnership with Google for easy search     and founding a committe to enforce a standardized nomenclature for terminology     and parts registry entries.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should assume the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would beeven better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately. We suggest excluding the parts not-working, low rated or     with negative feedbacks from the annual distribution plates but still     archive them and make their data available through the parts registry.     So the while the individuals labs are receiving plates with higher rated,     fully working parts for their projects, anyone who wants to work on     a more exotic part can search through the achieves and re-vitalize the     parts stored there. The challenge of re-vitalization of parts can be     encouraged as an collaborative effort. We are sure, all of us would     like to see gene-protein and pathway information if these information     was integrated into the database and offered automatically for each     entry in the database. We are planning to provide"

MIT,2016,Team:MIT#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," due to a patent on ccdB and negative selection tools in Gateway, iGEM had to remove all ccdB-containing parts from their registry.  Our screening tool, pDEST mCherry, uses red fluorescence to pick successfully transformed cultures.  With this, we hope that iGEM will be able to distribute the parts that were discontinued, and mammalian work that relies on Gateway reactions will be significantly easier for future teams.  While we used the pDEST mCherry successfully in our lab, we needed to test the clarity of the protocol we had written, and whether they would work in other labs.
Collaboration
We were thrilled to work with the Tufts University iGEM team in order to test our protocol, and our construct.
Results
The ligation reaction was successful.  As can be seen on the plate that Tufts sent us, there are white colonies, and small red colonies.
Recombinases' sequences
Collaboration
At the begining of the summer, we had a discussion with the BU Wetlab Team to learn more about recombinases because some of their members and especially their graduate mentor - Ben Weinberg - had substantial experience working with recombinases. They specifically emphasized the issue of leaky expression of recombinase, resulting in high basal expression of output gene. Thus, during the conversation, we jotted down ideas for potential repressing systems, one of which were degradation tag and repressible promoters. However, the majority of their work with recombinase has been with tyrosine (Cre or FLP) family and done on E. coli. Thus, performing recombinase experiments in mammalian cell lines were unpredictable. Additionally, the BU Wetlab Team also helped us to obtain sequences for the recombinases and their equivalent recognition sites from Dr. Wilson Wong's lab.

Week 12: Monday 27th September- Sunday 3rd October
Monday
We had begun to collaborate with the UNAM-Genomics_Mexico team, they have catalogued our communications in detail .  We had given them advice on protocols but they were not having any more success so at their request Peter sent them DNA for 5 constructs, luxCDABE and Luciferase and LREs from both Luciola cruciata and Photinus pyralis with and without promoters.
Paul's plate reader experiments continued to give somewhat unexpected results, with an increase in light emission which seemed to be correlated with entry into stationary phase.  We wanted to know if this was some strange promoter effect or a feature of the luciferase pathway.  For these purposes Emily and Bill attempted to assemble fluorescent proteins both under pBAD alone and under pBAD with the rest of the operon. Paul set up another plate reader experiment with a wide range of arabinose concentrations used for induction. Will performed further site-directed mutagenesis of LC luciferase, in case Ben's failed.
Tuesday
Emily and Bill continued trying to assembly the fluorescent proteins with pBAD and PP luciferase. The process proved more difficult than we had hoped, but we got there eventually.
Theo also continued experimenting with his electrical engineering skills with the E.glometer: trying to build a DIY light measurement"

Say Hello to Aliens !
The "" Arecibo code""
From: http://www.goroadachi.com/etemenanki/sc2012-2.htm
We are the first iGEM team trying to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM idea to the  aliens. In this part, we guys fellow the "" Arecibo code"" encode  system and establish a special code for the aliens. According to the "" Arecibo code"" from NASA and appeared on the raw field, we logically  hypothesize that the aliens understand the encode system we used.
By translating the information, we can easily transfer our ideas to the aliens.  We not only try to demonstrate the topic, but the experiments we guys going to  do. This spectacular code is composed of the number we use, the element we  dominate, several important chemical formula related to the artificial  creature, the genome of human beings and the cyanobacteria, and finally, the  planet we live- Earth and Venus( what we guys pursue!!) and the location of our  iGEM team, NYMU-Taipei.
What we have encoded:
1. number one-ten
2. elements dominated inside the creature we made
3. nucleotide chemistry formula , A,T,C,G
4. phosphate, sulfur, nitrate molecule inside this artificial microbe
5. sulfur metabolism and nitrate metabolism we created
6. genome of this new creature
7. the body shape and the population of the creature
8. the planet we live( Earth) and the planet we want to immigrate( Venus )

Chart zoom: Fatty acid methyl ester analysis
Chart 3: ""Lipid extraction analysis""
All of the cellular lipids were extracted and their fatty acid methyl esters produced. These were analysed by mass spec. In the control cells no C18:2 is present. When Δ6 is expressed, a peak indicative of C18:2 is present. However, the primary fatty acid is still C18:1 - with the bouble bond present at position 9. With the expression of Δ12 and the addition of exogenous C18:1(Δ9) we get great abundance of C18:2 and negligible abundance of C18:1 indicating that the C18:1 is being processed successfully. The lowest graph shows that Δ12 expressed with Δ15 acts in a complementary fashion and the expected C18:3 - an Omega 3 - is produced.

Put the tubes into the incubator overnight (37c, 150rpm) to grow up the cultures.
Protocol 2: Generate chemically competent E. Coli
Materials and Equipment
LB broth, starter culture, P1000, P200, pipette tips, incubator, cuvettes, spectrophotometer, Virkon, falcon tubes, ice, weighing scales, centrifuge, CaCl2, 20% glycerol, stripette, eppendorf tubes and -80°C freezer.
Time
Prep: 40 minutes
Run: 5 hours
Procedure
Grow cells
Take 1ml starter culture and add to 100ml LB broth.
Incubate at 37°C, 150rpm.
Check every hour by testing the optical density at 600nm (OD) using a spectrophotometer to determine whether enough cells are present in the culture.
0.600 OD is ideal, this is the point at which the cells are in the exponential growth phase.
Take 1ml of culture into a cuvette to measure; dispose of this after use in Virkon.
Remove cells
Pour 30ml aliquots from the flasks into falcon tubes; 3 tubes per flask.
Put tubes on ice for approx 10mins; all equipment used from this point on must be cold e.g. pipette tips.
Weigh the falcon tubes and pair together similar weight tubes for balance in the centrifuge; tubes paired together must weigh within 0.5g of each other.
Spin at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After the tubes have all been spun, pour off the supernatant to remove the LB broth, leaving cells in a pellet. Put tubes back on the ice.
Make cells competent
Add 1ml of CaCl2 to the cells, use the pipette to pull the liquid and cells up and down to resuspend.
Once resuspended, add another 14ml of CaCl2; 15ml total volume.
Put back on ice for approx. 10mins to allow cells to acclimatise at the temperature with the CaCl2.
Re-weigh and pairs tubes again for balance.
Spin again at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After tubes have been spun, leave on ice for 5mins. Pour off the supernatant?

Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks
The template ST block contains 3 ANY parts. If the first ANY part is matched A and B, the task is reduced to match the next 2 ANY parts to C, D, E, F, and G. All matchings could be found by recursively performing this algorithm.
Removing unmatched chains and associated trees of the species. It should have same structure with template species after replacing ST part with matchings if it has the same structural pattern with the template one.
The basic idea is simple. We first consider the structural pattern matching between one chain and a chain template. There are two kind of parts on a chain template: substituent-type part (ST) and non-substituent-type part (NST). The whole template chain could be separated into blocks of ST parts and NST parts. Then we could break down the task to the matching of each small block. For each NST type block, we find all its matching regions on the chain to be matched and there may be more than one regions. Each of the combinations of all NST blocks forms a NST frame and restricts the matching regions of ST blocks. Therefore, the task is reduced to find matchings of each ST part block within a restricted region on the chain to be matched. At the present version of MoDeL, there are 6 ST part: ANY, ANYUB, NZ, NZUB, ONE and ONEUB. A general algorithm for all 6 type part is designed and we will illustrate this via an example. Consider a ST block with all ANY type parts (we use X to indicate ANY type part in the figures). We find matchings of the first part of the block. There may be many possible matchings because part of type ANY implies arbitrary matching of parts on one chain in MoDeL definitions. For each matching found, we deal with the next, and do the same thing recursively until the end of the template or matching fails. An easy example is shown in the figure to illustrate this simple idea.
After all possible matchings for each chain in the template have been found, we could choose any one from each to form a combination. In each combination, matchings of different chains should not be the same. For example, there are two chains in the template, T1 and T2, and three chains, C1, C2 and C3 in the species. If T1 has one matching to C1 and one to C2 and T2 has one to"

After filtering, 50 reads of every group were randomly selected in order to be used for evaluating the performance of the linear discriminant models with iCG predict. The results of this evaluation are summarized in Figure 16.
Figure 16: Evaluation of the linear discriminant analysis models. Evaluation results of the linear discriminant analysis models for the forward and reverse strand. (A) Linear discriminants of the test data colored in accordance with their respective base prediction. (B) Distribution of predicted bases. Based on the assumption that every read in the test data set was correctly assigned with the barcoding approach, equal portions of 20 % for each base would be ideal, corresponding to 50 reads per test data group. (C) Fidelity of base prediction, revealing which base predictions were made for the reads of each group individually.
The results in Figure 16 indicate that the linear discriminant model for the reverse strand orientation is performing better than the model for the sense strand. The base prediction fidelity is especially high for reads containing an adenine, a cytosine or an isoguanine at the position of interest. Due to the hydrolysis of isoCm to T and the tautomerisation of isoG, leading to mispairing with T, the most common mutation that leading to a loss of the unnatural base pair between isoG and isoCm is the mutation from isoG to A (Bande et al., 2015). Considering the fidelity of base prediction for both A and isoG with the reverse strand model, we conclude that this linear discriminant analysis model is well suited for the discrimination between isoG and all natural bases in the sequence context 5'-ggNct-3'. Therefore, we could show that the software package iCG is applicable for the analysis of experiments with unnatural bases.
Orthogonal Analysis with M.A.X and iCG
In order to test the orthogonality of both methods we developed for the analysis of DNA containing unnatural bases, we performed an further PCR reaction with a template containing isoG and isoCm and analyzed the amplified DNA with both M.A.X. and iCG. The experimental setup was identical to those of our previous PCR experiments, except for the choice of primers and the reaction volume. A GoTaq PCR reaction with the template containing the unnatural bases was prepared with a total reaction volume of 250 μL. As primers, the standard"

Dynamic circuit
Living systems are problem-solving systems. Multidisciplinary field of Synthetic Biology is trying to develop scalable platforms to engineer biological systems enabling sophisticated sense-and-respond behaviors vastly more efficient, safe, understandable, and predictable. Due to the deep similarities between living cellular modules and electronic parts, biological electronic-like circuits have been developed during the past ten years as main tool in order to design novel biological parts and process information in living cells [1] .  Practical applications of biological electronic-like circuits include biosensors for pollutant detection and degradation, biosensors for medical diagnostic, smart therapeutics enabling sensing and regulation of drug delivery, and dynamic regulation in metabolic engineering.
Information processing in living cells involves integrating multiple input signals, performing computations on these signals, storing information in memory, and actuating outputs, as how electrical circuits accomplish. Most circuits take as input small molecules, which are used to activate or inhibit genes expression via riboswitches or transcription factors. Just considering progress made in the last two years, signal processing in biological systems can now rely on elements such as logic gates, load drivers, memory systems, amplifiers, coupling systems or bow-tie architectures, to name a few.
At the cellular level, biochemical pathways can be modeled as electrical circuits where signals are produced, propagated and consumed with the following equivalents [2] : (i) mass flux as electric current, (ii) concentration as voltage, (iii) stoichiometric conservation as Kirchhoff’s voltage law, and (iv) mass conservation as Kirchhoff’s current law. Additionally, the deep similarity between the Boltzmann thermodynamic equations that describe noisy electronic current flow in sub-threshold"

Assembling a construct for recombinant expression of Lys
To generate a construct that can be expressed in E. coli which consists of a T7 promoter and the coding sequence of Lys. The construct is made through a 3A Assembly method which allows for two or more BioBricks to be ligated into one vector. Here, the T7 Promoter BBa_K525998 and the Lys encoding sequence BBa_K748002 was initially ligated into pSB1K3. In order to identify whether the ligation was a success, the ligation product was transformed into E. coli TOP10 or BL21(DE3) cells.
Digestion: First attempt [❌]
In the initial attempt to assemble the pSB1C3-T7-Lys construct, the lysostaphin BioBrick was first amplified using VF2 and VR primers. The PCR product was then digested with XbaI and PstI. To optimise the digestion procedure we tried single and double digestions of the lysostaphin PCR product. In this first attempt, the digestions were unsuccessful and the sizes of the single and double digested were not consistent."

iGEM wiki
Ok, I’m going to think about a really witty title for the next entry, but you’ll have to bear with me one more time.  So once again our iGEM team had a little meeting, but this time around it was only the students meeting up. No instructors, just us 14 (Alright, we were actually only 13!).  We decided on a lot of dates for future events, like a laboratory course, brainstorms, when the lab work is going to start in the summer holidays and when we want to have decided on a project. On top of that our BMB students (Louise, Marie, Maria and Pernille) agreed to hold a little lesson about basic cellular biology some time next week, so there won’t be any excuses for not knowing about the mechanisms behind DNA, RNA processing and translation and all the other fun stuff for the rest of the team  !  Arto (our computer science student) is also at some point in the future going to give the team a little lesson about algorithms and how a program makes decisions based on the outcome of these. This will probably be something many of us have never heard about, so it’ll be really interesting.  Besides the more serious stuff, we are also going to have some purely social arrangements, so we can get to know each other a little better. These are most certainly going to feature wine and pizza (or cake!) - it’s probably safe to say that everyone is looking forward to these  ! On the subject of cake, thanks to Arto for the cake today, it was great!  Sorry, but we don’t have any pictures today.  That’s all for today, please continue to visit our blog and follow our soon-to-come adventures in synthetic biology!  Lars Christian

Mysql or any other relational database can be connected to our system, storing user data and synthetic biology database which can be updated whenever you want.
Plugin System
We have implemented a plugin system which is very easy to use. Any developers can fork our example plugin to write their own plugins, even if they only know little about Python. You can write a plugin for your lab or modify an existing plugin. Plugins can be easily enabled or disabled by editing the plugin list file. Even our official tools are running as plugins, so that you can enable and disable any of them whenever you want to fit the special requirements of your lab.
Continuous Integration & Deployment
Our development is based on Git version control with multiple branches. All pushed commits will be automatically tested on our test server at once and we can see the testing result soon. Besides unit tests, our test server will also process code analyzing to prevent fault codes and ensure that all classes and functions are well composed. When all is done, the new docker image will be generated automatically on DockerHub so that anyone can install and run our program with only one command.

Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CI"

Personal notes
The ethical side of scientific discoveries is very interesting. Are we ready to do things we plan to do? Is the majority of people voting for or against, sufficient enough to accept or decline real life application of scientific discoveries? In the movie, ""I-Robot"", the huge dilemma of the main character is of the most important for me. Not only in terms of science but even in terms of everyday decisions. ""Does believing you're the last sane man on the planet make you crazy? 'Cause if it does, maybe I am."" [(c) I,Robot].
Can we accept something if only one person is against it? Why are we so sure that he is not the only one who sees all the truth? But at the same time, maybe he is just insane... Maybe ethical issues for him are just the methods for solving his personal ambitions? Or something else even more pragmatic. Where is the truth?
During my iGEM project I didn't get any answers to those questions. I just confirmed for myself that those questions are there.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Medicine (BNI) where we conducted experiments on mosquitoes to test our hydrogel as well as the bait and toxin. Before we started working in the lab we talked to Dr. Thomas Jacobs of the BNI to gain knowledge about the malaria-transmitting vectors and to discuss some safety concerns raised during discussion with Dr. Mirko Himmel.
He gave us more detailed information on the seasonality of the mosquitoes and talked about successes and difficulties of vector control both in Africa and Germany.
He was able to diffuse our concerns that different pathogens might grow in our trap and could thereby be distributed by mosquitoes.  
“No, I think this is for me very unlikely […] I would not expect that you have living pathogens on the trap’s surfaces for a very long time.”
Another major concern of ours was the occurrence of resistances to the insecticide we are using.
“Well, I think the toxin should be effective. I would not expect any development of resistance because normally they should not see this kind of toxin.”
He stressed the importance of a dose high enough to swiftly kill the mosquitoes so there would be no sufficient time for them develop and pass on a resistance.

Full Interview with Thomas Jacobs
iGEM Hamburg:  Thank you very much, for taking the time to talk to us. Could you briefly introduce yourself and tell us what you do here at the BNI (Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine)
Dr. Jacobs: My name is Thomas Jacobs. I am a group leader here at the BNI. We are working in the field of immunology. I am working on how the immune system is regulated, for example how it reacts to malaria. [...] Our major research quest is to find out why children on the one hand can suffer from severe malaria and die and [...][on the other hand] somehow develop a kind of clinical immunity. Over time the situation or the disease is attenuated and eventually they are protected.
iGEM Hamburg: Can you tell us why the science of malaria research has gained importance in the last years?
Dr. Jacobs: I think it was actually important all the time. It is a major bottleneck for the development in [...] Sub-Saharan Africa because of the very high disease spread. The problem is, that over time when you develop new medications you develop resistances. This is increasing over time, so there is a lot of pressure to get hands on new measures to [...] stop the disease or stop the transmission of the disease. That is the problem we are facing now and I think therefore there are major efforts to design new vaccines strategies. We know that normal"

GvpA is a small 70AA long protein which forms a linear crystalline array of ribs to form the cylindrical shell and conical ends. GvpC is usually on the outside of the gas vesicle to make it stronger and stabilizes the structure.
In B. megaterium a gas vesicle gene-cluster was found, which contained 14 gvp genes (gas vescicle polycitonic genes) which were functionally expressed in E. coli by Ning Li and Maura Cannon (Li and Cannon, 1995). The best bouyant fenotype was found when  gvpA, gvpP, gvpQ and ORF-1 were excluded. It was suggested that gvpB on the gvp-cluster of B. megaterium is an homolog of gvpA. 900px
Gas vesicles in iGEM
In iGEM 2007, Melbourne created a biobrick for gas vesicle formation. In iGEM 2008 Kyoto had the idea to lift the titanic from the bottom of the sea with the help of bouyant bacteria.
Melbourne iGEM 2007 team constructed a bouyant E. coli and also they added a BioBrick of the short version of the gvp-cluster (without gvpA,P,Q, ORF-1 and AraC). This BioBrick is available and also in the microtiter plate send by HQ to us, so we can use this. Melbourne changed the gvp-cluster by cleaning it from 3 EcoRI sites and 1 PstI site, this leaded to a accidental addition of a 10x repeat of ""TCTGCAAATTA"". They mention that they added the BioBrick prefix and suffix to the BioBrick, though the restriction sites of these additions cannot be found by CloneManager in the sequence available on the Partregistry. Hopefully the part is available on a standard vector, which has the pre- and suffix for BioBricks. For cloning this part we can use the optimized protocol (restriction on part with XbaI and SpeI, on the vector with SpeI) for ligation of the gvp-cluster and a vector BBa_J61035 (3539bp, copy nr??), this unluckaly leads to ligation of the gvp-cluster in an unspecific direction. This can of course be tested by restriction, PCR or sequencing, but it takes more time as another step will be introduced. The vector has two selection markers"

Ethanol can be produced from pyruvate through Pyruvate Decarboxylase (PDC) and Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) .
Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies) and nematodes.
When insects ingest toxin crystals, the alkaline pH of their digestive tract denatures the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus amenable to being cut with proteases found in the insect gut, which liberate the cry toxin from the crystal. The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore. The insect stops eating and starves to death.
Methods and Circuit design
Methods
The infected honeybee can go back to their hive, contact other bees, and spread the pathogen in a very short time. To prevent the whole bees in hive from infected,we come up with a way to prohibit Nosema from speading. The method is composed of two parts.
1. How to post-sensing if Bee. coli could not successfully kill the Nosema.
We use the ROS promoter from the previous circuit. What difference between our circuit and previous circuit is we directly put two terminators after the ROS promoter to construct threshold. In case our circuit will be easily activated to cause unnecessary toll.
2. How to suppress the spreading of Nosema if Bee. coli failed
Inhibit the extrusion of the polar filament or let it germinate at the wrong place, and thus the spores cannot get into the intestine cell. Since the mechanism that triggers the polar filament’s extrusion is hydrostatic pressure, ethanol is our potential candidate for it is able to reduce water permeation across cell membrane and phospholipid layers, also caused a powerful inhibition of spore germination. (In this way, Nosema senses much lower hydrostatic pressure).
In addition, in order to prevent CCD from deteriorating, the another way is to sacrifice the infected bee for the good of the majority. That is, Bee. coli would secret lethal protein to kill the bee if  the bee cannot be cured. We introduced Cry toxin as another"

Results:
Separation of linear DNA from circular DNA:
Figure 1 shows the image of the gel where the linearized DNA was separated from the circular DNA. The linearized DNA is approximately 2 kb. The linearized DNA fragment was then cut out from the gel and stored in eppendorf tube.
Note! Due to UV-light exposure, the DNA may mutate. In this case, this may affect the later steps of our project. The worse scenario, mutation of anti-luxS. Hence our CSRPRi system may not recognize luxS in the bacteria. Biofilm production will not be inhibited…
Determine the DNA concentration and purity:
Table 1 shows the results of the linear pgRNA (2) from PCR (probably with anti-luxS gene).

From the 260/230 ratio, the sample has a relatively a small amount of nucleic acids. Probably, it is contaminated by the agarose from the gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, the 260/280 ratio is ok, indicating that the sample contains a relatively larger amount of RNA than DNA. InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:

Procedure:
InterLab – transformation of plasmids to competent cells:
No visible cell colonies were formed on the agar plates that were incubated on day 9 - 02. Junly. 2018. Only the positive and negative control cells formed colonies.
Therefore, the remaining plasmids (6 μL) were transformed to the competent cells and plated on agar based on the same protocol from day 2. Jul. 2018. During the incubation at 37℃ with shaker, the incubation time was extended to 2 h. The cell cultures were centrifuged, and 700 μL supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended with the remaining supernatant. The cell cultures were then plated on agar plated with CM, and incubated overnight at 37℃.

The two plasmids were linearized by XhoI cutting out the cmR from the pSB1C3 backbone. Using natural competence the two linearized plasmids were transformed into B. subtilis 168. Inserts were verified by cPCR. Resulting in the last two strains:
∆mutS::beta-neoR
∆mutS::GP35-neoR
 
Growth Experiment
The protocol was followed for creation of MAGE competent Bacillus. The growth of the wild type B. subtilis 168 and all mutants was measured using OD600 measurements. 
 
Results and Conclusion
Construction of MAGE competent strains
For results on the construction of the four MAGE competent strains take a look in our lab-notebook .
 
Figure 3. Generation time of the different mutants measure in minutes.
The different mutants were compared to the wild type. From figure 3 it is clear that the generation time of the mutS::GP35 and the amyE mutants showed to be faster growing than the wild type. The mutS::beta was shown to be slower growing than the wild type, this mutant is the one that is best at recombineering. It is possible that the problem is the high constitutive expression of the beta protein in the cell that interferes with the growth of the cell. This could be solved by using an inducible promoter.
 
Proof of concept of MAGE in B. subtilis
Overview
To establish proof-the-concept of MAGE in B. subtilis 168 several methods were tested, but only one method turned out to be useable. The methods used for proofing MAGE in B. subtilis were as following:
Knockout of upp
Knockout of amyE
Introducing streptomycin resistance
The ideal method was established to be the introduction of streptomycin resistance, allowing indication of successful oligo induced changes in the genome of B. subtilis.
 
Achievements
Indications suggest a successful introduction of MAGE in B. subtilis.

Set the flask aside for cooling. Occasionally swirl to make the cooling even.
Set up the gel tray and make sure that there is no leak by testing it with dH20 and kimwipes.
When the flask is cool enough for you to handle easily, pour the solution into the tray.
Wait until the gel solidifies.
Part 2: Loading the gel
Make a note of what is going into each well and put that in your lab notebook.
Determine the DNA concentrations via Nanodrop. (Approximately 100ng DNA per band is required.)
Cut a piece of parafilm to use as a mixing surface. Alternatively can use PCR tubes.
Mix DNA with loading dye in a 1:1 ratio directly on the parafilm or in the PCR tubes using a pipette tip and gently aspirating. (i.e. 10uL of DNA with 2uL of 6x loading buffer) Mix by pipetting up and down. Avoid bubbles.
Carefully remove the comb of the gel.
Place the gel into the gel electrophoresis apparatus with its tray.
Add more 1X TAE buffer to cover the gel completely. Buffer should be 1-2mm above the gel. Make sure that all the wells are submerged.
Load 10uL of DNA ladder to the first well. Add 10uL of your sample DNA to corresponding wells. (Remember record which wells you load)
Put the lid on. The negative (-/black) electrode should be closer to the DNA wells as DNA migrates towards the positive (+/red) electrode. 10.Set the rig to 100V & 60 min. Hit start. 11.Make sure that your DNA does not run off the gel. The loading buffer enables you to track the DNA. 12.The gel apparatus will stop on its own when the time is up. Proceed to imaging the gel. It can sit in the rig overnight if need be.

Objectif
Nous avons décidé de modéliser l’efficacité de notre traitement face à ce type de tumeur. Pour cela, nous avons modélisé l’évolution de la tumeur, l’évolution de notre traitement et son efficacité. L’objectif de la modélisation est de vérifier si notre traitement est capable d’éliminer la tumeur dans son intégralité.
Haut de page
Segmentation du modèle
Pour commencer, il a fallu retracer le schéma d’action complet du DVS et l’évolution de la tumeur. Ensuite, pour chaque étape du traitement, nous avons identifié l'ensemble des paramètres qui entrent en jeu, leurs actions et leurs interactions, afin de déterminer les équations du modèle.
Pour simplifier l’équation, tout en dressant un modèle réaliste, il nous a fallu découper chaque étape et les modéliser séparément.
Evolution de la tumeur et du DVS en fonction du temps
Première étape : le développement de la tumeur en fonction du temps
On considère la tumeur non métastasique et sa croissance exponentielle.
Soit une tumeur de volume V1 en cm3 à un instant t1.
Soit la même tumeur, à un instant t2, avec un volume V2.
La tumeur est considérée en phase de croissance exponentielle et sans métastase donc l’équation qui régit son développement, le Tumor Growth Rate (TGR), est égal à :
Ainsi, le Volume de la tumeur en fonction du temps (V(t)) est égal à :
Enfin, connaissant le Volume moyen d’une Cellule Cancéreuse (Vcc) (obtenu expérimentalement), on peut déterminer, si l’on considère la tumeur comme pleine (c'est-à-dire sans cavité ou vaisseau sanguin), que le Nombre de cellules cancéreuses en fonction du temps (Nc(t)), sans action du traitement, est égal à :

The value 1.5x1021 was chosen as the number of cells because this was the order of magnitude that would give the reasonable amount of enzyme for degradation.  Other parameters such as those involved in gene expression were the closest we could get them to and the enzyme kinetics data were taken from the our own enzyme assay experiment.  Therefore, we were left with the number of cells and the unknown secretion rate to modify.  After several runs of simulation, we decided to increase the number of cells to 1.5x1021, instead of the 1.5x1012 assumed in the synthesis model.
(i)P(3HB) and 3HB levels over time (units: mM)
(ii)P(3HB) level over time (units: g/L)
Graphs (i) to (ii) unit conversion
To convert from mM to g/L:
Molecular weight(Mw) of P(3HB) = 1.8x1012g/mol [14]
(Please note that this value was taken from a paper about the ""Production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) in recombinant Escherichia coli grown on glucose"" instead of the production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate).  However, this is the closest we managed to get as far as species, substrate and type of plastic are concerned.
Also, it was noticed that the molecular weight would change depending on the cultivation time (as conditions such as growth and pH can also affect it) and it was hard to find a paper that contains the exact same conditions and the range of cultivation times for our simulations.  Furthermore, in reality there wouldn't be a single value of molecular weight obtained, but a range of values (known as polydispersity). [15] Therefore, it was assumed that the molecular weight would remain constant during the time course of the simulation and that the value should be considered as an average.)
∴P(3HB)concentration in mM x 10-3 x 1.8x1012g/mol = concentration in g/L
Future work
With a more complete characterisation of the promoter under the experimental conditions used for this system, more accurate gene expression parameter values can be plugged into the model.  Also, the secretion rate was hard to determine and would be an important value to obtain experimentally because it is the only rate that controls how much of the enzyme is released to the extracellular space.

We decided to sequence the unpurified PCR products instead. In order to do this we had to re-do the PCRs for Zif268, FH bottom (78), CB top (79), Myc 981 (82). Below are our 1% e-gel results, verifying that we had appropriately sized bands:

Making more cultures and plates of our expression plasmids
We picked two more colonies from plate 85 today and made 5 ml cultures from them. We also made 2 fresh cultures from the old 85 cultures, by taking 50 ul of old culture and 5 ml LB+spec. We will leave them overnight in the 37* shaker and perform minipreps and PCRs on them tomorrow.
We made positive control cultures from 81.1, 81.4, 80.1, and 80.2, in order to test our minipreps tomorrow. They reactions have a wide range of concentrations post-miniprep, and we are curious to see if the same will happen after performing a miniprep a second time.
Another way to figure out if our expression plasmids contain the appropriate insert is by using a restriction enzyme to cut it and then performing a PCR on the linear DNA. We had previously inserted 2 cutsites on our plasmids, Bsa1 (for insertion of finger 1) and Xba1."

Public Engagement
We hosted a workshop on synbio and its application, and hold an exhibition of our project in the international Maker Faire. We discussed with audiences including artists, students, investors and engineers who inquired about the safety and potential of synbio eagerly. And engineers and artists established long-term collaboration with us on applied design. We closely engaged with neighborhood, urban management agencies and animal welfare groups, presenting how microbial factory can integrate with cat shelter we built to solve the problem of feral cats. Through direct interviews, in-depth conversations, presentations or polls, we learnt their concerns and how synbio-related design can be better accepted by the public. Innovatively, we connect with people in art field by holding activities which allow the public to draw and design the cat shelter. Moreover, we filmed a series of documentaries to reach even further, by uploading them on popular media platforms.

SynBio, Cats and ChangeMakers
(Download a pdf version of our presentation powerpoint here .)
We gave a bilingual talk named ‘SynBio, Cats and ChangeMakers’ at
x.factory
on synthetic biology and its application, introducing our iGEM project in specific as one example of what synbio was capable of doing. Then we discussed our ultimate scheme of building a street cat shelter with biosynthesized nepetalactone as attractant that could aid volunteers in helping feral cats. (See Applied Design for the development of our design.)
Our audiences include students, neighborhood committee members, engineers, designers, artists and investors, who demonstrated great curiosity at the field of synthetic biology and engaged enthusiastically in discussions concerning synbio and our project after the talk. We had audiences who inquire about the possibility of initiating their own synbio project at the maker space or at home, so we gladly filled in knowledge about biosafety lab requirements we had, shamefully, missed out a bit on during the talk. Some asked in details how we found the desire pathway of biosynthesizing nepetalactol and whether computer simulation could aid the design, and we offered several databases that might be of help.

Chemotherapy treatment costs 5-6k RMB (around 890$) each time, and interventional treatment charges the same. Medicare reimbursement for cancer patients covers about 50% of the expense, including repayment for about 90% of drugs costs, but this does not include imported drugs or molecular targeted drugs.
Mr. Zheng also had a good knowledge of gene therapy and other new therapies. From the perspective of patient and his family, gene therapy in Japan is currently more advanced and developed, including a relatively well-known therapy called AK therapy. The patient told us that, molecular targeted therapy treatment can cost hundreds of thousands RMB per years. Molecular targeted drug costs as high as 20 thousands RMB (30,000$) per month. Added with fees of chemotherapy and infusion of nutritional supplement, the monthly treatment will be costing at least 30 thousand (4,500$) RMB. Therefore, Mr. Zheng cannot afford the treating charges, although he believes that treatment consisting of chemotherapy controling the disease and targeted drugs is ideal.
At present, the unaffordable price of molecular targeted drugs still block the way towards actual clinical use.
Ms. Meng (30-year-old)      Gastric cancer sufferer
Several months ago, Ms. Meng felt stomach pain very occasionally, but she thought it was just a small stomach problem. Until an examination in May 23rd, 2016, Ms. Meng was told that it was gastric cancer. So far she has been treated for nearly half a year.
Now Ms. Meng mainly takes the treatment of chemotherapy combined with medicine taken orally. Her treatment period is 3 days chemical injection every 24 days and her temporary treatment cost is about 20k RMB (3,000$) as she has just started chemotherapy. Ms. Meng quitted her own work, and her husband frequently ask for time off work to take care of her. Currently the treatment cost has became a massive burden for her family. At present, the main side effects of chemotherapy on Ms. Meng is nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite etc..
Since Ms. Meng hasn’t been treated for a long time, she did not know much about the updating treatment method specifically. As for the molecular targeted therapy, she has only heard of it. Ms. Meng decided to follow the doctor's suggestions. If the doctor considers her suitable for molecular targeted therapy, Ms. Meng will be really willing to try the new drug.

It is trying to compete with physical, chemical or computational methods with its unique features of living cell: it can proliferate and self-evolve. And iGEM are the son of synthetic biology but it is growing up. This is not a simple competition but also a stage where gifted and creative students try to answer synthetic biology questions, raise interest in science and make friends who sing the same songs. We share and communicate with our experiences, ideas and even lifestyles and cultures. It helps students step into scientific world and shape their future.
So what iGEM brings to us are somewhat depends on what we think of it and treat it. Every team may have its own character, it could be relaxing, passionate or somewhat. It is just for fun but we should work hard, so that we can feel the happiness from within, during the process of the competition.
And only with this kind of attitude, iGEMers could get down to doing some big issues that really make sense to synthetic biology or are able to solve real-world problems.
So the products are not all of iGEM, iGEM is far from that. It has been a culture that students from different background chase for.
3. Is plant synthetic biology possible ?
Click to know our conclusion
Many difficulties can occur in plant research, such as long experimental cycle, low transformation efficiency, limitation of experimental conditions and so on. But with the development of synthetic biology, we are facing more and more complex systems. Some features like the ability of photosynthesis highlight the advantage of plant in research. So balancing the two aspects, is plant iGEM really possible?
Firstly, its long growing time and higher standards for living environment make it conflict with annually held iGEM as we are always rushing in our preparation of the competition. We should consider extending the participation cycle.
Secondly, whether iGEM is suitable for the fundamental research in plants remains a question. Screening the mutants in plant is a process which needs relatively low techniques but high throughput. The valuable concepts in the research depend more on the capability of the professional faculties instead of students’ scientific skills.
Thirdly, at present, the experimental techniques in plants are behind those in other organisms. It seems that people are more concerned about scientific hotspots like medicine or healthcare, thus animal research gets more attention. The techniques in plants are almost derived from those in animals and many researchers rely more on the traditional experimental methods.
Moreover, as an important aspect in the biological research, the"

To fulfill the gold medal requirement, the UT Austin team mentored the first year Texas Tech team. The Texas Tech Collaboration page can be found here.
In the collaborative spirit of iGEM, the UT Austin iGEM team reached out to several other teams. Through this outreach, we began communicating with the Texas Tech team. As a new iGEM team participating in the competition for the first time, Texas Tech had several questions about the competition that we attempted to answer during the summer and fall.
Team member Zach Martinez of UT Austin and Marilyn Mathew of Texas Tech taking a photo at UT Austin after receiving the UT Austin team's fluorescent bacteria.
During this time, members of the Texas Tech team has visited Austin three times. An initial meeting took place between two team representatives to discuss the teams’ projects during the summer. Brandon Palomo of Texas Tech agreed to attempt to replicate Jenna McGuffey’s and Erum Dhanji's results with gellan gum plates. At this same meeting, Katelyn Corley of UT Austin helped to answer many of Tech’s questions regarding language in the iGEM rules and classification for iGEM medals. Corley and Palomo exchanged contact information so the teams could continue to collaborate electronically.  In the second meeting, Marilyn Mathew of Texas Tech, originally from Austin, visited our undergraduate research lab to pick up fluorescent bacteria that Texas Tech wished to use for a public workshop relating to community awareness of synthetic biology.  These bacteria were originally created by members of the UT Austin iGEM 2015 team and have been in continual use by the UT Austin iGEM teams since then.  Members of each team met for a third time at the Texas iGEM meetup at UT Austin in September.  This meetup occurred as part of the University of Texas at Austin Undergraduate Research Symposium. During the third meetup, we provided Texas Tech with the Sphingomonas paucimobilis bacteria required to make gellan gum plates and answered additional questions about the competition, deadlines, trip details, and"

The importance of the mRNA sequence is described in the previous section
The protein of interest
Proteins are a very wide group of molecules, different in amino acid composition, 3D-structure and physicochemical properties. Because of the individuality of proteins, it is necessary to optimize the cell-free synthesis reaction in every case ( Spirin and Swartz, 2008 ) A recent approach based on bioinformatics was made to better estimate how one can improve CFPS for a certain protein ( Tokmakov et al., 2014 ). Generally, the production is more successful when the transcript is short and the protein folds fast and is soluble ( Lentini et al., 2013 ; Chizzolini et al., 2014 ). Aspects like the formation of disulfide bonds or a chromophore have to be considered as well as intrinsic disorder of the protein ( Tokmakov et al., 2015 ).
CFPS can be used to produce proteins whose production is limited in vivo due to toxicity or membrane association, and also to incorporate unnatural or labeled amino acids ( Kigawa et al., 2004 ; Xu et al., 2005 ; Bundy and Swartz, 2010 ; Quast et al., 2015b ). It has to be considered that production of complex proteins that are further processed after translation, for example membrane-bound proteins, is in general more feasible in eukaryotic cell extracts ( Quast et al., 2015a ).
Additives
There are lots of possible additives that are known to contribute to a more efficient in vitro protein production, as well small substances like DTT as enzymes (a good overview in Spirin and Swartz, 2008 and Airen, 2011 ). Although some cofactors, for example coenzyme A, NAD and folinic acid, seem more important than others, the effects often differ depending on conditions like cell extract, scale, protein of interest and so on.
Cost considerations
In vitro transcription and translation has been an expensive issue. Commercial systems composed of purified single components, like the PURE system ( Shimizu and Ueda, 2010 ) or E. coli (T7) S30 Extract, work efficiently, but are often more than ten times more expensive than in-house generated reactions. A milestone for lowering the costs of selfmade extracts was the finding of Kim and coworkers that after lysis, highly active cell extracts can be produced with a single centrifugation step and a subsequent run-off reaction at 37"

Based on the results above, we could confirm that α-tubulin, β-tubulin, α-tubulin-YNE, YNE-α-tubulin,                     α-tubulin-YCE, YCE-α-tubulin, β-tubulin-YCE, YCE-β-tubulin, cluc-α-tubulin fusion protein were                     successfully expressed in rossatta cell.
Particularly, according to figure 7B, the target proteins (β-tubulin and β-tubulin-YCE) can be tested                     out in the supernatant, indicating that they are soluble when expressed in rossatta strain.
We collaborated with Fujian Agriculture and Forest University and asked them to test the interaction                     between α and β-tubulin. Thus verified the activity of tubulin monomers.
Fluorescence detection
Protein functional test
In order to make sure the protein expressed from prokaryotic cells had their functions. We did a                     functional test at first. Concentrated supernatant of α-tubulin-YNE and α-tubulin-YCE were mixed                     equally and treated with twice as much as the supernatant of β-tubulin. 50μM GTP and 200μM taxol                     were also added for helping aggregation. After incubated in 37℃ for 1 hour，the mixture was tested by                     the absolute recording spectrofluorometer. The result(Fig.14) showed there was a significant                     emission peak in 525nm with the excitation in near 512nm wave length, indicating that YCE and YNE                     protein fragments were combined as a whole YFP and thus verifying their biological functions in                         vitro.

Our team also consulted synthetic biologists such as Natalie Kuldell, founder of BioBuilder, and other iGEM team to understand basic synthetic biology concepts how to incorporate accurate scientific procedures into our design.
 We began the decision process knowing that we wanted users to have a space to go through an abstracted and simplified synthetic biology procedure, and a separate environment where they could deploy their engineered bacteria.  Our first prototype featured single-person stations, the option to “test” your bacteria in the workspace before sending it to the environment, and a “friend” who displayed instructions and feedback (see image).  We also had a “Challenge Button” where the friend would ask users to create specific combinations (see image).  Users were given a clipboard with information about their particular environment to give users hints about what kind of combinations would be beneficial to the environment, as well as a separate scanner where users could place tangibles and learn more about that particular BioBrick.
Fig. 1 An early prototype draft
 On June 18th, we presented this initial prototype to two young boys aged six and nine.  Both were engaged and interested in the prototype, but it was clear that the premise was too broad and not intriguing enough.  The testers suggested making the “Challenges” more difficult, as well as possibly incorporating video clips into the exhibit.  Our team also decided to shift the focus from helping the friend to how the users’ bacteria changed the environment.  To highlight the impact the bacteria had, we added status bars which displayed the amount of resources in the environment.  We also wanted to optimize the number of users per screen and increase collaboration between multiple users, so we began to brainstorm ideas on designs that would allow multiple users to work at once.
Fig. 2 An early prototype draft
 One month later, we met up with the BU and MIT iGEM teams where we presented a newly updated prototype featuring four work stations and a focused goal of seeing how users’ bacteria affected the environment. The users all responded positively, stating that they could definitely imagine the exhibit as an official installment in a museum.  This evaluation was extremely helpful, as we observed and received feedback on many possible ways that the exhibit could grow.

CPU_CHINA,2018,Team:CPU CHINA#Application_-_-_TEXT.html," (lncRNA) genes as switches of cancer gene therapy.Recently there have been explosive discoveries of new lncRNAs, obtained by progress in second-generation sequencing. These transcripts have been found to be major participants in various physiologic processes and diseases. In human cancers, lncRNAs have been found to function as novel types of oncogenes and tumor suppressors through various mechanisms, which endow them with the potential of serving as reliable biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for cancers. Few efforts have been put into utilizing these in genetic engineering. Our AND-system should be one starting example.
Similar to HULC in HCC, H19 has been found to be specific for gastric cancer[8], PTCSC3 for papillary thyroid carcinoma[9] and PCAT-1 for prostate cancer[10]. We recommend further research into these tissue- and/or tumor-specific lncRNAs as applicable in cancer gene therapy. If proven to be up/down-regulated in the corresponding cancer cell lines at transcription level, each of them could likewise serve as a “key” (or in combination as “keys”) to various logic gates for delivery of suicide genes.
For cancer therapy targets, there are even more options. We can develop strategies to inhibit overexpressed mRNAs (oncogenic mRNAs) or, to induce the biogenesis of under-expressed miRNAs (tumor suppressor miRNAs) in tumor cells. For relevancy, we discuss the anti‐apoptotic protein B‐cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‐2). Inhibition of the activity of Bcl-2 restores apoptotic processes in tumor cells and can trigger cell death. Zhang et al. successfully designed a similar RNAi-regulatory device with pri-miRNA analogue targeting Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells but with an embedded theophylline aptamer as a sensor domain[11]. However, we have to point out the fact that there is inconsistency between the amount of pri-miRNA and the mature miRNA in certain cases[12][13]. You may want to look at specific literature to find out whether your engineered pri-miRNA analogue would indeed not be hampered somewhere in the post-transcriptional gene silencing pathway.

This year we managed to collaborate with several iGEM teams:
Wetlab: we collaborate with UANL_Mty-Mexico team in the Interlab Study. We characterized its D3-GFP device.
Customs regulation: we collaborate with four teams from Mexico (Virtus-Parva_Mexico, ITESM-Guadalajara, BIOSINT_Mexico, ITESM-CEM) to make a law proposal to improve the current customs regulation. You can find more information here.
Human practice: we participated in the “Low-budget” human practice of Colombia team.
Surveys: we filled a lot of surveys for different iGEM teams including Linkoping_Sweden, BGU_Israel, ETH_Zurich, Warwick, among others.       The biobrick BBa_K1366109 encodes for a peptide called pep42. This peptide allows the internalization of any molecule linked to it into cancerous cells. This basic part is promising for its use in targeted anti-cancer therapies. More information about this part can be found in our registry page.

The biobricks BBa_K1366101 and BBa_K1366102 were experimentally validated. Both of the biobricks were integrated into the E. coli’s genome using the lambda-red recombination system. These genes contained two different antibiotic resistances to screen the colonies that were successfully modified. We observed growth in the selection plates of the single and double replacements. And also we confirmed the integration of BBa_K1366102 with PCR.  This documentation is shown in the “Main page” section of our registry page.
We submitted our parts and device to the Registry in time.

Stony Brook iGEM E. coli buddies activity
Previous Next
This year, Stony Brook iGEM created a new activity to help teach kids about synthetic biology - E. coli buddies! Through this activity, children learned about transformation and the fundamental basis of synthetic biology through an interactive means. The main goal of synthetic biology is taking DNA with genes of interest and inserting them into microorganisms such as E. coli, so that they can produce the proteins that the genes code for. Before the activity, we attached velcro to the E. coli we received from Giant Microbes, as well as to cardstock. This would stand as a base for the proteins that the kids would make. At the start of the activity, we explained to the kids the structure of DNA, namely that it is double stranded and has a double helix. Then, we asked them to pick two different colored strings which they twisted together to form the helix. Then, this string was tied to the E. coli in a ring to represent transforming the organism with a recombinant plasmid. Next, we explained that the DNA encodes for proteins. The kids were able to design the proteins that their DNA coded for using pom poms, glitter, googly eyes, pipe cleaners, and beads onto the base we precut for them. In the process of this activity, the kids were able to see how synthetic biology actually works and imitate what scientists do. We were successful in educating while entertaining, ultimately allowing us to create other activities. To help future iGEM teams make activities like this, we have made our activity video publically available on YouTube in addition to posting it on our wiki. One key feature of the video is that it is searchable by a number of tags, and that our team has added closed captions allowing for greater accessibility.

3. Triclosan Inhibition Screening:
We were down to the ""Fab 5"". Since Chalew et al showed the levels of triclosan leaving Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) was up to 9 nanomolar [18], so we wanted to measure enzyme inhibition using a nanomolar level of triclosan. Under our conditions, however, not all of the fab 5 had measurable activity with a nanomolar amount of enzyme, and in order to see inhibition using a nanomolar amount of triclosan we needed to use a nanomolar amount of enzyme.
Triclosan inhibition was measured by running our standard enzyme activity assay with no triclosan and 1 nM triclosan. Negative control was 100 uM NADH, 100 uM crotonyl CoA, no enzyme, no triclosan. Observed enzyme activities were subtracted from negative control activities. Percent inhibition was calculated by:
( (uninhibited activity - inhibited activity) / uninhibited activity ) * 100
The enzyme concentrations ranged from 1.9 - 3.3 nM using two biological replicates of each enzyme. Nanomolar inhibition from P. falciparum has been previously reported [8], but we are the first to show triclosan inhibition using A. protothecoides Fabi! Interestingly, with P. tricornutum, a marine diatom, which have been shown to be sensitive towards triclosan [29] we were unable to see triclosan inhibition, which suggests there is a different biological mechanism of action for triclosan inhibition. However, nanomolar inhibition was also not observed with H. influenza, and E.coli, even though previously reported [6][7][10]. Therefore more detailed studies on conditional dependencies of inhibition are needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of action. However, the A. protothecoides inhibition data clearly indicates that triclosan effects FabI from algae and that this could be the biological mechanism of toxicity.
For our biosensor, P. falciparum FabI, being the enzyme most inhibited by triclosan, appears to be the best enzyme to use for our biosensor!  Additionally, we further characterized the previously submitted E. coli FabI biobrick Bba_K771303 . We have added our characterization"

Oxford,2014,Team:Oxford#how much can we degrade_-_-_TEXT.html," model to predict the effect on the system if you simply increase the amount of water in the aqueous layer.  This shows how much water is necessary to prevent the pH from dropping too much. It demonstrates why addition of a buffer is the more reasonable choice to control the pH of the system.
The graph here is for non specific inputs and is for demonstration purposes only. It shows well how the model responds to changing the input values.
Buffers?
How does the kcat of the system affect the output?
How does the kcat of the system affect the output?
The apparent uni-molecular rate constant kcat, also called the turnover number, denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.
We used our model to predict the response of the system to a change in the kcat value of the DCM degradation enzyme, dcmA.  Increasing the value of kcat by a significant amount is unrealistic in the length of our project. However, in future work, the kcat could potentially be substantially improved.
In the graph shown here, the total volume degraded doesn't change. This is because the amount of HCl that the system requires to reach a toxic pH level is constant, as we are not varying the volume of the aqueous layer. To increase the total amount of DCM degraded, we simply need to add more water or a pH buffer to the system. However, increasing the kcat value dramatically increases the rate of the degradation. This hints towards a valid future area of research.
The graph here is for non specific inputs and is for demonstration purposes only. It shows well how the model responds to changing the input values.
Potential benefits?
Potential benefits?
Increasing the kcat of the enzyme greatly improve our system, as you can see in the models shown above.
By simple adjustment of input parameters, our model could be adapted to simulate the degradation of other types of toxic compounds in other bacteria with different enzymes. This modelling technique is therefore particularly powerful, because if you know certain parameters about the system, you can simulate how much of a particular product can be produced by a bacterial system.
More broadly, the potential benefit of months of synthetic biology research could be analysed within a few hours using this model, as long as the relevant parameters are roughly known.
To demonstrate what we mean by this, here are some other processes with different kcat values[1]:
As you can see, using systems with the parameters shown above would increase the amount of product obtained from the same number of bacteria by orders of magnitude and would therefore be highly beneficial to a bioremediation system. Future work could definitely"

As ITB_Indonesia project involved with EOR, the human practice team investigated and did a brief study about EOR to provide an educational tool. Hopefully, this brief study could provide the fellow iGEM teams or other teams in the future a brief and general knowledge about EOR in Indonesia and the world.
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Study
Fig. 1 Typical injection oil wells[4]
One of the main source of energy in the world is the utilization of oil and gas. Thus, many efforts have been taken to increase the production of oil and gas by many companies. There are three phases in oil recovery, primary, secondary, and tertiary (enhanced) recovery. Firstly, the companies would use the primary and secondary recovery the oil field. However, the utilization of tertiary recovery is inevitable in the future[1]. In the US, however, producers have attempted several Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques to increase the production of oil, from 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir’s original oil in place, higher than primary and secondary recovery[2]. EOR technologies could be grouped into the following categories[3]
Thermal EOR (TEOR)
This method utilizes cyclis steam and hot water injection, steam and hot water flooding, and (rarely) the in-situ combustion of hydrocarbons. The principle of TEOR is to reduces the viscosity of the oil sufficiently by heat to enable it to be recovered.
CO2-EOR
This method was more recently applied compared to the TEOR and is also the fastest growing EOR application.
Other gas EOR
The other gas used for this method is the hydrocarbon and nitrogen. Generally, this method is not cost-effective in the U.S. and is expected to continue to decline over the next decade.
Chemical/Microbial EOR

Exams Done
With our exams and assignments from semester 2 complete we set about outlining the details of the team's project and identifying a dissertation subject for each team member.
The team met with Jane Calvert to discuss the stakeholders in the project, including industry, research teams, other iGEM team and the public. The consideration of safety issues surrounding the use of heterologous parts in uncharacterised hosts and potentially unseen hazardous consequences sprang from this meeting and was expanded on throughout our project.

First Weeks In The Lab
Our first day in the lab, where we found our beloved starter kit. The following 2 weeks were focused on literature research, ordering of reagents and kits, lab preparation and finding sponsors for our project. The team also received an introduction to MoClo and training in Benchling, which we relied on heavily over the next few months.
After receiving our safety forms the rhodococcus team started growing Rhodoccocus jostii on plates. The synechocystis team received the pPMQAK1 plasmid to be used for cloning in E. coli before transformation into Synechocystis.

There were lots and lots of colonies on the hns-mutant plates, so many to make us doubt our SOC, so Peter plated some out and left the bottle on the bench, but nothing grew over night, so we're probably fine. The K28 plate was grown over quite densely, so it was put in the fridge yesterday. Peter checked both plates for glowth yesterday and couldn't see anything, but today the R28 plate (a hns knockout) glowed quite well, so yay!
everything is in the fridge now.
Tuesday 12th October
Peter went into the Plants lab and looked at the results of the plate reader. All the strains seem to be growing fine, with quite consistent ODs, Luminescence has fallen off in all of them by now and seems to have leveled out. Three wells, however gave a massive spike at the start, much brighter than all the others. 'Which one?', I hear you ask, 'is it K, the master of quiescence, R, the loveable knockout, or G, the old champion?' For now, imagine the plate reader hanging off a cliff...
Can our cells overcome the repression and shine brighter than they ever shone before? Will science happen? Are hns-mutants shite? Tune in to watch the exciting conclusion of Plate Reader: The Reckoning!

IPTG Induction and lacI Dosage
>>>>Design
In order to investigate how lacI dosage affects IPTG induction, we used Anderson promotor J23100, J23110 and J23114 to design three constitutive lacI generators of different intensities. The three lacI generators were then ligated with Ptac driven reporter sfGFP to make three IPTG induction devices ( BBa_K2558203 , BBa_K2558204 , BBa_K2558205 ). By measuring sfGFP fluorescence we tested how these devices react to IPTG.

iv) Divide each plate into 6 sections, labeled 0-5. Spot 5μL of liquid from each vial onto different sections of the plate. Vial and section should correspond in number. On section 0, 5μL taken from phage liquid stock where spotted directly (performed for both BL21 and W3110 individually).
v) Set up one E coli control plate by taking 5mL of the combined solution from the centrifuge tube (2-i step) and plated it on an LB plate (performed for both BL21 and W3110 individually).

i)  BL21 test tube: add 20 μL of stock phage solution, 0.5mL E coli BL21 overnight liquid culture
ii) W3110: add 20 μL of stock phage solution, 1mL E coli W3110 overnight liquid culture
iii) Let both test tube sit for 20min
iv)In a 50mL centrifuge tube, combine 6mL of warm ×2 top agar and 6mL of LB to produce ×1 top agar
v) Add 5mL of ×1 top agar to each test tube, pipet up and down several times before plating 5mL unto LB plates
4) Check up on phage + bacteria viability in 24 hours.

ETH_Zurich,2012,Team:ETH Zurich#Interview1_-_-_TEXT.html," irregeleitete Idealisten, die nicht wirklich etwas von der Sache verstehen. Trotzdem sind ihre Aktionen ungesetzlich und sollten bestraft werden. Feldzerstörungen können die jahrelange Arbeit von Doktoranden vernichten und deren Abschluss gefährden.
Q: Sagt das Moratorium mit anderen Worten: ‚Gentechnik ist sicher aber nicht hier, weil in der Schweiz der Nutzen nicht die Ressentiments der Bevölkerung übersteigt‘?
A: So ungefähr ja.
Q: Welche Konsequenzen hat das Moratorium für die Forschung an GVP in der Schweiz?
A: Die Serie von Moratorien hat entscheidend dazu beigetragen, dass Forschung mit GVP in der Schweiz keinen Sinn mehr macht, mit allen Konsequenzen. Die Schweiz verabschiedet sich von der Entwicklung einer Technologie, die in vielen Ländern als „strategische Zukunftstechnologie“ gewertet wird. Die Schweiz hatte einmal eine Spitzenstellung (siehe Golden Rice).
Q: Sollte man nach den Ergebnissen des Moratoriums nicht als Vorreiter auftreten, um die Akzeptanz anderswo zu erhöhen? Wie könnte man die Schweizer überzeugen?
A: Man sollte die Schweizer ihren Fehler ausbaden lassen. Sie werden aufwachen, wenn es zu spät ist. Dafür gibt es Präzedenzfälle.
Q: Trotz der staatsfinanzierten Forschung mit durchaus positivem Fazit: Ändert sich letztendlich nichts aus Forschersicht? Bleiben einige wenige wissenschaftlich fundiert informiert, die Mehrheit jedoch sieht Ihre Angst oder Vorurteile gegenüber GVP durch das Moratorium bestärkt?
A: Natürlich. Das ist auch Schuld der Medien.
Q: Wie erklären Sie sich den Erfolg von gentechnisch gewonnener Medizin in Industrieländern bei gleichzeitiger Skepsis gegenüber gentechnisch veränderten Nahrungsmitteln?
A: Alle Menschen in reichen Ländern wissen, dass sie irgendwann den Fortschritt in der Pharmazie benötigen werden. Da sie satt sind und sich sogar den Luxus von „Bio“-Lebensmitteln leisten können, sehen sie keinen Grund, die Anti-GVP Propaganda von NGO Aktivisten zu hinterfr"

Location: UTokyo, Hongo Campus
Techno Edge: an event for primary and senior school students to experience engineering.
We explained the basic concept of genetic engineering, using simple examples to make every participant, including primary school students, understand.
What’s more, we explained BioBrick, iGEM, and our activities as well.
Result: We were able to deepen participants’ understanding of genetics and molecular biology, since most of them were unfamiliar with heredity, DNA or E. coli, let alone genetic engineering.

The Genetic Society of Japan: an academic meeting which researchers from all over Japan gather to, presenting and listening to each others' research.
Several presenting topics were set in the Genetic Society of Japan, among which we presented as the iGEM team of Japan. Participants include Gifu,Nagahama,Kyoto,Tokyo_Tech,UT-Tokyo,HokkaidoU, and professors from Hokkaido University and Tokyo Institute of Technology.
We made a 15 minutes presentation about our project at Symposium Workshop WS10-6 (18:15-18:30)
Symposium Workshop title:Genetics, Synthetic Biology and iGEM（International Genetically Engineered Machine）Activities by Undergraduate Students
We also listened to words from not only iGEM related people, but also professors in genetics, and received valuable advices.WS10-6 18:15-18:30
We are grateful to iGEM Nagahama for providing such a wonderful opportunity of discussion.( See Nagahama's Page )
Result: We were able to aware many researchers in genetics of iGEM and attract their attentions.
