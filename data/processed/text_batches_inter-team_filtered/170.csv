The structure of TatC was determined for Aquifex aeolicus and is shown together with the structure of TatA from E. coli in Figure 6 (Berks et al., 2014; Cline, 2015). A fourth component, TatE provides an overlapping function to TatA, hence making TatE dispensable (Kikuchi et al., 2009).
Figure 6: Structures of TatA from E. coli and TatC from Aquifex aeolicus
While TatA forms a single transmembrane helix, TatC consists of six transmembrane helices (Berks et al., 2014).
TatB and TatC form the receptor complex, which is composed of up to eight TatBC units (Cline, 2015). The signal peptide is bound by this receptor complex, which triggers the PMF dependent assembly of TatA to the translocation pore (Palmer and Berks, 2012; Cline, 2015). The whole complex is referred to as translocase. After the assembly, the substrate is translocated and the signal peptide is cleaved by a signal peptide peptidase as shown in Figure 7. Many details of the Tat pathway are not known yet or uncertain, including how TatA disassembles (Cline, 2015).
Figure 7: Steps of the Tat translocation system
After the signal peptide is bound by TatBC TatA assembles and forms the translocation pore. Using the transmembrane proton motive force, the substrate is translocated and the signal peptide cleaved by a signal peptidase (Palmer and Berks 2012)
Croton Tiglium
Origin of Croton Tiglium
Croton tiglium (L.), also commonly known as the „Croton oil plant“ is a plant of the family of Euphorbiaceae that was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus.  Its origin lays in the south-eastern asian countries such as India or Thailand, where it can grow up to 7m tall.  In nature, it occurs in many habitats ranging from 300-1500m height as well as from shrublands to forests.  The plant we used was kindly provided by the botanic garden of the Philipps University in Marburg . Seeds of this plant were originally given to the botanical garden Marburg in 1986. They were then provided by the botanical garden Giessen.

The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level. One component of the system ,crRNA, which contains a cis-repressing sequence 5’ of the RBS, RBS, and gene of interest. The cis-repressing sequence can form a loop form complementary base pairs with the RBS , blocking the ribosome entry to RBS. crRNA is also commonly described as a “lock” because it “locks” the RBS and prevent translation. The “key” to this system is the taRNA. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore to activate translation (Figure 1.). The benefits of this system, as described in Isaacs et al.’s paper, are leakage minimization, fast response time, tunability, independent regulation of multiple genes etc1.

Our Project
The aim of our project is to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to be able to detect and sense cadmium which has been taken up from the soil environment and bound to metallothionein. This metallothionein will then become incorporated into a Bacillus spore, the resilience of which means that the cadmium ions can become isolated from the environment (and made bio-unavailable) for many years.
This project involves a number of steps, each of which can be considered as sub projects:
Cadmium Intake
Cadmium Sensing
Cadmium sequestration by metallothionein
Sporulation Tuning
Chassis
Population simulation
Stochastic Switch
Synthesizing a Promoter Library for Bacillus subtilis
Cadmium Intake
For this project we want to be able to process cadmium and cadmium only. Therefore it would be logical to find a way in which we can increase the intake of cadmium without increasing the intake of other metals too.
It is known that a Bacillus subtilis cell (from the 168 strain) takes up cadmium naturally through the manganese transport system (Laddaga. R.A., Bessen. R., Silver. S.; 1985). Additionally it has been demonstrated that mutations to the manganese transport system can affect its ability to uptake cadmium without affecting its ability to transport manganese (Zeigler. D.R., et al; 1987).
The manganese ion channel that we intend to either upregulate or control is the mntH ion channel (also goes under the name ydaR). mntH is part of the Nramp family of proton-coupled metal ion transporters (Que. Q., Helmann. J.D"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportPractices_-_-_TEXT.html," and non-human gene sequences. Because the science can be privatized and monopolized it becomes more attractive to companies seeking profit rather than addressing social needs.
The ETC group obviously defends the idea of a public concerned science, promoting external and exogenous control, regulation-building processes and decision making. That point is once again revealed in the Open Letter from Social Movements and other Civil Society Organizations to the Synthetic Biology 2.0 Conference (ETC 2006). The initiative of the Synthetic Biology 2.0 Conference in May 2006, was to mix up scientists from the field in order to write a «  ""voluntary"" code to prevent biosecurity risks ». The conference is criticized by ETC group and many other organizations  (such as scientists, engineers, environmentalists, farmers, social justice advocates, trade unionists and biowarfare experts) because of the internal control promoted by the “voluntary” perspective and is compare to the Asilomar Conference of 1975.
Asilomar was conference about the ethics of emerging genetic engineering proposed by Paul Berg in 1975. Paul Berg was then about to insert a gene from the SV40 virus in Escherichia coli and decided to stop his research because of human health considerations. He decided to invite other scientists to a debate the ethical stakes of transgenese and to build up a moratorium. That initiative was only about scientists, no consensus was found for the moratorium and the conference was only able to propose some precautions, mainly focused on human health. Most of the criticism against the Asilomar 1975 Conference was about the scientists' lack of ecological and socio-economic concerns (regarding agriculture, patenting of genes and organisms, etc).
The critic from the ETC Group and the organizations of the civil society authors of the Open Letter is coming with a set of proposal in order to build a new governance of synthetic biology. In their view, the main problems and proposals are :
Society - especially social movements and marginalized peoples - must be fully engaged in designing and directing societal dialogue on every aspect of synthetic biology research and products. Because of the extraordinary power and scope of synthetic biology technologies, this discussion must take place globally, nationally and locally
Scientific self-governance doesn't work and is anti-democratic. It is not for scientists to have the determinant voice in regulating their research or their products
The development of synthetic biology technologies must be evaluated for their broader socio-economic, cultural, health and environmental implications not simply for their misuse in the hands of 'evildoers.'

Akli Ben Imeddourene is a postdoc in Molecular Modeling, working at the Toulouse LISBP. His skills in molecular dynamics simulations of (macro)molecular systems have been highly useful in our project. Indeed, to assess the stability of the 3D structure  model of our binding platform, Cerberus, we performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The different preparation steps of the system to perform molecular dynamics simulations and the analysis of resulting trajectories required specific knowledges. Akli's help has been very supportive in conducting these studies.
HP Worldwide
Thanks to our network, we managed to collaborate with an American and an Asian team. We first thought about designing and performing experiments as collaborations often tends to be in iGEM. We found out that this would not help our projects that much and we then came up with the idea of sharing our point of views about bioethics. We wondered if the geographical and cultural differences between us could lead to different points of view concerning bioethics.
It was really a chance to be able to exchange with these two teams. We met several times via Skype and finally decided to write a short review on ethical considerations about synthetic biology. The following document presents the results of these work sessions.
We truly hope that this kind of reflection will inspire other iGEMers to take a moment in their summer lab work and think about the outcomes of their designs.

Up until now, we succeeded to produce nanoparticles and to load them, to clone a pH sensitive promoter and to engineer a fusion protein between ice nucleation protein (INP) and streptavidin.

What we would have done with 1 more month
Nanoparticles
This part of our project is rather advanced, but there are still some assays that we would have loved to make. For example, to test if and how fast the nanoparticles are digested by GelatinaseE and Matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2), we would have performed a fluorescence release assay using a plate reader. First, we would have used commercial enzymes to check that the assay works and maybe adjust the protocol, later with the enzymes produced by the E.coli transformed with the effector plasmid.
Eventually, we would have also tried to load the nanoparticles with an actual drug.
Cell surface display of Streptavidin
We weren't able to prove that the fusion protein between Inp and Streptavidin was exported to the outer membrane. The next step would be to clone a plasmid that encodes a fusion protein between Inp, streptavidin and YFP. Then, we would be able to follow the same immunofluorescent staining protocol we successfully used to characterize the Biobrick BBa_K523013. We actually started this cloning strategy, but didn't have enough time to optimize the PCRs.
We actually used the time between the Jamboree in Lyon and the one at MIT, to clone the two plasmids, and did microscopy using an anti YFP antibody. Check out Cell surface display for further information.  The results were promising, but we would need to sequence verify our constructs"

Signaling Module
The signaling module is based on the interaction of the two fragments of an intein derived protease. Each of the split intein fragments was designed to be inserted in a different Cas9 domain. Thus, when the Cas9 conformational change occurs the distance between the split intein fragments is reduced and the reaction takes place. As a result of the cleavage, a split TEV protease joined to a trans-splicing Npu DnaE N-intein is released as a signal. To test the intein reaction we designed two BioBricks with histags on them in order to recover the excised fragments by protein extraction.
Advantageous Signaling
Our signaling strategy uses the cleavage properties of a cis-splicing split intein to release an insertion when a conformational change occurs. The specifity of the intein derived protease recognition makes it suitable for proteolytic reactions in E.coli and S.cerevisae. Therefore, this module gives a precise approach for protein excision and so provides a mechanism useful for signaling and protein regulation.
Background
1. Intein derived protease
We thought that the best way to indicate that the dCas9 conformational change had occurred was through the release of a signal molecule. For that reason, our signaling module is based on the interaction of two insertions in the dCas9 protein that allows the release of a split TEV protease when the conformational change occurs. To release one of the insertions we decided to use the Ssp DnaB S1 split-intein. This intein derived protease (IP) consists of a 144 aa C-terminal intein fragment that recognices and cleaves the peptide bond between the Gly and Cys residues of the 16 aa N-terminal fragment (Volkmann et al., 2011), thus resulting in a cis-splicing reaction as shown in Figure 1.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," enzyme degradation of plastics, Prof. Wu directly affirmed that our ideas was of great value and did good to environmental protection. The original intention of our project is to protect the environment and reduce the environment load. Not only is enzyme degradation an environmentally benign and highly efficient pathway, but we don’t need to consider processing temperature range of polyester that must be concerned during thermal degradation of polyester.
Nonetheless, Prof. Wu let us know that we will still have a long way to go if we want to put our project into practice. The primary issue is the cost of the budget, and it doesn’t mean cost of enzyme degradation technology, but it is about investment in PET bottle recycling process. Specifically, it should be concerned about the sorting of plastic bottles, the separation of bottles, cover and tags and the process of crushing, washing and drying. Specially, PVC bottles are hard to tell apart from PET bottles, but one stray PVC bottle in a melt of 10,000 PET bottles can ruin the entire batch. For this reason, it's understandable why purchasers of recycled plastics want to make sure that the plastic is sorted properly. Equipment to sort plastics is being developed, but currently most recyclers are still sorting plastics by hand (and in the third world), which is a hard, expensive and time-consuming work. In a word, plastics also are bulky and cumbersome to collect.
Prof. Wu added that, however, if there was no better way to solve the environmental problems caused by waste PET, it would be really crucial to study the degradation of PET. In the present age, domestic plants usually recycle PET waste bottles into useful textile auxiliaries such as spinning fiber which cannot be utilized widely. If the production of spinning is too excessive to be exhausted someday, other methods of recycling waste PET such as enzyme degradation will be considered.
After that, we asked a female expert. She said, in some cases, the recycled and modificated PET is even more easily than the new one. In other words, the economic value of new material may not high. Thus, if we can guarantee the efficiency of enzyme degradation with the aid of hydrophobin and the appropriate cost of sorting and recycling of waste PET, it will be feasible to put our project into practice for reducing the environmental effects of PET and cleaning up the world.
Plastic is one of indispensable materials in daily life. With the astonishing development of biological industry, researchers focus their attention on biodegradation of waste PET. Undoubtedly, if we can successfully find a kind of bacteria used in highly efficient degradation of PET, biodegradation will be the best way to address the waste PET"

Collaboration with iGEM Tec-Monterrey team
We established a collaboration with the iGEM Tec-Monterrey team, and exchanged constructions to characterize. In this link you may find their characterization of our mRFP under pArs: [ Tec-Monterrey characterization ].
Overall conclusions
mRFP production responds efficiently under inducible conditions, both over time and different arsenite concentrations. The mRFP stability is acceptable for the aim of our Project. However, the visibility to the naked eye is not sufficient at low arsenite concentrations.  We reached to the conclusion that, in order to increase the colour production at lower arsenite concentrations, a signal amplification system has to be added. It could also be added some switch to stop the production and avoid saturation of all the samples, and thus keep the range of colour observable to the naked eye.

Kill Switch Database
We already started to investigate the mechanisms behind different kill switch classes. Building on that we created a database for the whole scientific community to improve the search for reliable and stable kill switch designs. Together with the tool developed in our modeling section , we provide a great framework to improve safety of projects in Synthetic Biology.
The database includes all kill switches ever implemented in iGEM since 2004 delivering a pictured topology, part numbers, kill switch classes and links to the wiki on which the system was described. Figures 1 to 4 show navigation through our database.
This intuitively usable tool will help teams all around the world to implement these essential safety mechanisms in their projects in Synthetic Biology and biotechnological applications. Find the kill switch database here:
Kill Switch Database
The database is bundled in a ZIP archive and should be extracted from it. The folder ""output"" holds various folders and files. Opening the file ""output/index.html"" starts the browser and one can start browsing our database.

Introduction
Dynamic instability of microtubule during its lifetime is very interesting and worth researching. When a cancer patient is cured by taxol treatment fortunately, it should be owed to taxol's interaction with microtubule in dynamic growth process. So it's significant to explore principles of this process. We established a series of math works to clarify mechanisms of microtubule dilution system. Then we got data from wet parts of our project. Our model predicts observed data and phenomenon. In conclusion, we have presented a model that utilizes basic kinetics and it has been proved by experimental observations. We can use it to predict results in other conditions for guidance.
What we have done to analyze the dynamic process can be divided into three steps.
Fig.1 Our process
First we proved that taxol has a significant influence on microtubule growth by using the data which are provided from wet parts. Then we presented two differential equations model. One is an original differential equation model that can predict taxol’s influence on amount of microtubule. The other is a partial differential equation model expounding analytic solution. Since it’s hard to understand if someone lacks of necessary math skills, we build a program in MATLAB@ to visualize the kinetics in microtubule disaggregation.
Modeling theory
Microtubule is made up of 13 protofilaments. Now there is a widely accepted feature about the microtubule that microtubule has highly complicated dynamic instability. Under vitro cultures conditions, on the one hand, subunits will polymerize automatically to form fine structure when subunits condition is above the critical concentration; on the other hand, the microtubule will depolymerize into subunits when subunits condition is under the critical concentration. Apart from that, the single microtubule will always in the stage of aggregation and disaggregation.
Tubulin is made up of two tubulin monomers which are nearly the same as each other. These two tubulin monomers are named α tubulin monomer and β tubulin monomer. Microtubule is"

Here are the 2 best bacteria:
In conclusion, this week was exhausting, but it was very interesting to exchange with others. Moreover we got a lot           of positive feedback and interesting ideas about Softer Shock that were used later in the development of our project. We succeeded in communicating about our project and this worldwide competition. Even if it was a stressful week         it allowed us to practice coordination and build team spirit.
Thanks to all these experiences we know how to talk about our project and inform young people through introductory         science education. It was a very rich experience to exchange with everyone because of their valuable questions and remarks.
Meetups
Parisian Meetup - 07/21/2017
We had the chance to be invited by the Pasteur iGEM team at         the Parisian Meetup the 07/21/17 to meet all French teams and present our project.
The day started with a breakfast around which we made a first relation with the presented teams. Then all teams presented         their projects. We were able to exchange about our difficulties, our successes and advise us for the continuation of the         competition.  Moreover some teams such as Bettencourt asked for our help in model a part in their project, in their case         they wanted us to aid them to model their RNA organelle strands. We started a new collaboration and it was a pleasure to         help them.
After teams presentation each team had to pitch in front of everyone. At the end the jury had to choose the best         pitch and the winner won a teddy. The winner was the team of Toulouse with their project “Croc’n Cholera”. Finally they         split us in several groups to do little workshops, in our case we had a conference with an entrepreneur who quickly taught         us how to pitch properly for D-Day! It is important to present yourself correctly and to draw attention to a subject that is         important to us.
In conclusion, it was an incredible experience in which we had for the first time a professional presentation as a         mini Jamboree. We had the opportunity to meet other French teams, exchange ideas, points of view, learn from each other and         live an iGEM experience!
Since that day, we have been in touch and collaborating with some French teams such as Bettencourt, Grenoble and Pasteur.         We want to thanks the team Pasteur for this great adventure!

Two circuits were central to our work done in the project. The first one was the 5n1, which was a 5 node oscillator constructed by Richard Murray et al, that was not modified to produce square waves. The 5n1 (560) was a gift from Richard Murray (Addgene plasmid # 70730), and had the following topology and circuit –
Further, apart from this system, that was ordered for testing our characterization and measurement devices, we designed our own novel 5 node ring oscillator, which contained modifications that are mentioned at the end of the section. The topology and circuit that we designed and constructed are as follows –
This circuit was constructed in part through cloning, and in part through synthesis via IDT and Genscript. Further, the salient features of this circuit are –
Cooperativity of repressors – Cooperativity was central to our work done, in ensuring that the rise and fall is fast for our circuit. The cooperativity of the repressors in the system that we have constructed is –

High School Promotion
This year, to further popularize the basic knowledge of synthetic biology, we set our sight on high school education. After early communication and preparation, we successfully held a seminar at The Affiliated High School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology on Jan 7th with over 200 high school teachers and students presenting. On the seminar, we introduced the concept and basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM and presented our 2015 iGEM project to them. Students showed great interests in our presentation and were amazed by all the novel ideas of iGEM teams in the past years. After the presentation, we sent out questionnaires to the audiences and received exciting feedbacks. These high school students said that they were introduced to a new world of biology and a new technology that they didn’t learn before in their textbooks. They asked us various questions about synthetic biology and iGEM on the questionnaires. After the seminar, we discussed with the teachers from The Affiliated High School of HUST about the possibility of forming a high school team to attend the competition. They listened to our suggestions and felt promising to form a new team in the future.
Since then, we also invited some students to our lab several times, taught basic laboratory skills and the progress of our Filter project. Hopefully next year we’ll have a new iGEM high school team in the Giant Jamboree!
Communication
""iGEM HUST-Cheering!"" Conference
This year, we successfully held the first “iGEM HUST-Cheering!” conference. After over four months’ preparation, the conference was held on July 8th and 9th. We invited NCTU_FORMOSA, Nanjing-China, HAZU-China, NUDT-China, Jilin_China, ShanghaiTech_ChinaB and WHU-China to the conference. During the two-day conference, we not only kept the traditional forms of presentation and poster session, but also designed fun activities to expand attendees’ understanding and critical thinking of the development of synthetic biology and iGEM. Those activities included free"

We have clearly declared the attributions of our members in each aspect of your project.
We have documented the eleven novel standard BioBrick Parts and Devices central to our project. [ BBa_K1991000 , BBa_K1991001 , BBa_K1991002 , BBa_K1991003 , BBa_K1991004 , BBa_K1991005 , BBa_K1991006 , BBa_K1991007 , BBa_K1991008 , BBa_K1991009 , BBa_K1991010 ]
We have submitted our BioBrick parts to the iGEM Registry.
We have completed the Judging form and the Safety form .
We have prepared PPT slides and Poster to present at the Giant Jamboree.
We have experimentally validated that four new BioBrick Parts and Devices of our own design and construction work as expected. We also documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. [ BBa_K1991003 , BBa_K1991007 , BBa_K1991009 , BBa_K1991010 ]
In the Collaboration , we have helped a registered iGEM team of NCTU-FORMOSA 2016 in a significant way by validating the protein expression of one of their parts using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.
In the Human Practices , our team has investigated on alcohol consumers (e.g., the school’s teachers, the member’s parents, the general public, etc.) and experts (e.g., the police officers, the judges, the health care workers, the wine tasters, etc.), as well as addressed problems with a survey in the context of our project concerning the field sobriety test. In addition, we educated the public about the issue of drunk driving by hosting a sobriety test experience for school’s staffs/teachers in the campus assisted by the school military instructor and the police officer. Moreover, we exchanged the idea and shared iGEM experience with other iGEM teams in a meet-up.
We expanded the Human Practices activity by integrated the investigated issues into the design and the execution of our project. For example, we found the problems from the news against the breathalyzer test such as the individual metabolic differences, diabetes disease, suspects’ refusal, people dead or in coma. We’re inspired by Blood Glucose Meter from the data in the questionnaire concerning the sobriety test. We transformed the idea to design and execute our project and collaborated with a"

We conducted the replication study for the previous iGEM part : BBa_K098010
Introduction ~Why do we need photo sensor~
Mars also has day and night like Earth. The strength of the sunlight reaching Mars varies from day to night. During the day, the Mars’ surface temperature is about at most -20 degrees Celsius and in the night it drops to -100 degrees Celsius, so it natural that E. coli should behave differently in the day and night. Photo-sensor can be one powerful tool to control or regulate gene expression that is suitable for the temperature. For example, we introduced anti-freeze protein into E. coli, and it should express an appropriate amount of the protein based on the surface temperature, which is in proportion to the strength of light. We believe that this sensor can also be applied and utilized for terra-forming in some other way.
Material and method
The mechanism of photo-sensor
Figure 1 : the mechanism of photo-sensor
Figure 1 shows the mechanism of photo-sensor. Cph8 consists of cph1 and envZ. Cph1 is an extracellular sensor and cph1 bound to PCB (converted from heam by ho1 and pcyA) responds to the light. EnvZ is an intracellular response regulator and has a histidine kinase domain that phosphorylates ompR protein so that it can regulate gene expression. When cph8 is not exposed to the light, the histidine kinase domain phosphorylates ompR, and then ompR-phosphate activates the PompC by binding to it. When cph8 is exposed to the light, the histidine kinase can’t phosphorylate ompR so PompC is inactive.
Experimental overview
We attempted to construct Biobrick coding cph8 and PCB-related enzymes, assay them, and characterize them. We used the strain, Ru1012 [MC"

The ligations of the different constructs were performed overnight, after which the ligated plasmids were transformed to L. lactis NZ9800, and finally a colony PCR was performed with several colonies of each construct
The construct with the P2 and PLas did not show any bands on the gel, therefore further steps were only done with the constructs containing the two constitutive promoters
The same constructs with the promoters from the promoter collection of Uppsala (see September 19 till October 5) were subjected to ligation again, but this time the vector pIL235A was used instead of pSB1K3
These constructs were transformed to L. lactis NZ9800, and plated on M17 agar with erythromycin

Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#humhub_-_-_TEXT.html," the team was afraid of the same issues that Stockholm had run into, Aalto-Helsinki stuck with Flowdock. Another problem with Flowdock was that even though Aalto-Helsinki could use it for free, there was no way all iGEM teams could get Flowdock for free. For this reason, it is by no means a platform to collaborate with other teams, and the use of an additional communication platform for this purpose is inevitable.
Then there was the Hub
Following the discussions within Team Stockholm, a network was set up by Hugi from using the open source project HumHub . In many ways, the Hub mimics a regular social network. However some functions have been added such as a better word processor. People can join different ’spaces’. One can for example make one space for each team, sub-team responsibility, such as wetlab work, cross team collaboration etc.. In each space users are able to post text, pictures, links etc. to share with each other. People are also able to post to everyone in the ’Open Forum’, for example to request help or reach out for a certain collaboration.
Aalto-Helsinki and Stockholm set up their own collaboration space and kept in touch through the Hub. This report was also initiated through a discussion on the Hub itself.
Tools matter
An example of how the hub can be customized is the integration of ’Team seeker’ and ’BioBrick seeker’, made by Aalto-Helsinki 2014, which can be used directly from within the hub. This allows users to search for other teams or Biobricks within the same working environment.
The ability to customize the hub according to the need of iGEM teams could be taken further by letting anyone design plugins, such as Helsinki’s seekers, to be integrated. As the whole system is open source, the whole system could be offered for users to modify completely and set up their own Hub for example to test new plugins or functions. These could later on be integrated in the main Hub.
Another idea that was discussed was a more readily available overview not only over all teams, but also with a short summary of what each team is aiming for. This would both make it easier to gain insight of other projects and also simplify the process of finding potential collaboration partners.
Some other people's opinion
We assumed that the communication problems were not only issues in Stockholm and Aalto-Helsinki, but to get more information about the communication platforms and collaborating practices within iGEM teams, Aalto-Helsinki launched a team questionnaire.
The questionnaire consisted of multiple choice questions and aimed to gather information about the different platforms teams used to communicate with"

SDU-Denmark,2017,Team:SDU-Denmark_-_-_TEXT.html," which offers new advantages to the field of sustainable energy. There are currently certain limitations to the existing options for renewable energy, namely the intermittency and the diluteness problem Alexandre Chagnes JS. Global Lithium Resources and Sustainability Issues.  Lithium Process Chemistry: Elsevier; June 2015. p. pp.1-40. . The intermittency problem describes the discontinuous energy production, along with inefficient storage. On the other hand, the diluteness problem is characterised as the resource-demanding production of technical devices, such as solar cells and batteries. This means that a lack of resources eventually could eliminate some of the  current forms of green technology. As such, we need to introduce a new and sustainable approach to green energy to ensure the continuation of our beautiful world for the coming generations.
In a Local Environment
We are a team of young adults raised to be aware of climate changes and the potential limitations to our ways of life. As a generation that appreciates open source and shared information, we have been encouraged to constantly challenge the ideas of yesterday. With this in mind, we decided the best solution to the eventual energy crisis would be to seek out experts and the general public, even children, in order to rethink the current notion that the only way to save our planet, is to compromise our living standards.
Fortunately, we learned through interaction with local agents that a great deal of people share our belief: that we ought to pursue the development of low energy cities with a high quality of life. In fact, we even discovered that our own hometown Odense wants to be the greenest, most renewable city in Denmark by 2050 Odense Municipality’s website, regarding their politics on  the current climate changes. .
In the pursuit of this goal we rose to the challenge of creating a truly green solution, which would provide an environmental friendly source of energy.
Please keep scrolling if you wish to read more about our solution, or go straight to bioethics if you are curious why we not only could, but ought to do something about the current and forthcoming energy crisis.
Inspiration
Our early ideas were reviewed after attending the Danish Science Festival, where we met several young minds with creative and inspiring ideas. The children came to our workshop with their parents to learn about bacteria, the history of GMO, ethics, and iGEM. They attended our “Draw-a-Bacteria”-competition, where they designed their own bacteria, some even with detailed stories. From this the children taught us a thing or two about the endless possibilities of GMO.

INTRODUCTION
The aim of the modelling section was to create an integrated, kinetic model of our Cas9-guided chloroplast transformation mechanism. This model can be used to understand the internal workings of our proposed transformation method, and to determine whether it is viable and genuinely superior to existing methods. It also has practical use, in determining the expected timescales for homoplasmy (and thus when re-plating and selection could plausibly begin). The model is fully documented, and the code is available online and thoroughly commented. It could also be adapted not just to predict homoplasmy times in the chloroplasts of other organisms, but to yield useful information about the kinetics of Cas9-driven genetic transformation in any organism, encompassing the kinetics of:
Cas9-gRNA active complex formation
Cas9 cleavage on the chloroplast genome (for both on- and off-target sites)
integration of the gene of interest, via homologous recombination
PREVIOUS MODELS
Kinetic modelling of CRISPR/Cas9 action has been attempted by several iGEM teams in the past. However, past iGEM models have largely been geared towards using dCas9, a modified Cas9 molecule with no cleavage activity, to form genetic circuits. To the best of our knowledge, no past iGEM project has included a freely available, integrated model of Cas9-induced cleavage or homologous recombination. The Salis lab at Penn State University, however, have recently published a complete, biophysical model of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage activity [1], which was a major point of reference for our modelling.
MODEL FORMULATION
1. Gene expression
For active Cas9 cleavage, a gRNA template must be transcribed, the Cas9 protein transcribed and translated, and a gRNA-Cas9 complex formed. In our proposed chloroplast transformation method, these are both expressed from the same “driver” cassette, introduced into the"

Abstract: TU Delft 2009 wanted to build an improved cell to cell communication system.  They wanted to construct an E.coli strain that can pass GFP signals through conjugation only once. When “initiator cells” which contains the “signal plasmid” for the communication system, is added to a cell culture, the initiator cells (donor cells) conjugate with other cells “non-initiator” cells in the culture. During the conjugation, the signal plasmid is transferred to the recipient cells. The signal plasmid encodes for an entry exclusion protein, an endonuclease, and GFP. It has a restriction site of the endonuclease. The entry exclusion protein prevents backward conjugation, the endonuclease and the restriction site can reset the cell back to off state, and finally GFP can a reporter to visualize where the signal is.  The expression of endonuclease should be delayed because cells, which just received the signal plasmid, require time to conjugate and pass down the signal plasmid to the recipient cells. TU Delft 2009 tried to solve this problem by introducing a delay device.  The riboregulator system was used for their RNA-based delay system. By having another level of regulation between the reception of signal and expression of self-destructing protein (e.g. endonuclease), Delft 2009 believed that there could be delayed expression of the self-destructing protein. TU Delft 2009 also designed an algorithm called Ribo Key & Lock Generator that can generate sequences for lock and key riboregulators when RBS sequence is used as an input.

The transformed colonies took over 24 hours to grow - something unusual for this strain but something Ashlee had observed since after she inserted the HMF pathway and attempted to insert dCas9. We picked six colonies for overnight growth to do more cloning tomorrow.
Design of GFPs continues as Clay works on program to optimize genes. Question asked: which GFP should be optimized? GFP mut3b and superfolder GFP both present advantages and disadvantages. Met with Chiam Yu to discuss effects of codon optimization on translation. Acquired data from previous codon optimization project, which will serve as the basis for our fast/slow codon optimization.

Memorial Day Weekend? How about lab cloning weekend! Only one of the 5 terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 ligation colonies grew. Ashlee conducted plasmid preparation of the terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 vector and digested this (the backbone) and the dCas9 system (the insert) with restriction enzymes AatII and AflII.
More RBS library calculations run. Problem: since TIR is dependent on the first 60 bp of a coding sequence and our variant GFPs will differ in this region, how can we ensure that an accurate library is developed?
Sunday, May 25, 2014
The 5 colonies still did not grow. Ashlee prepared a gel and ran the dCas9 and backbone digestions and gel purified them. Colonies had not been growing well for Ashlee in the latter half of the semester as the plasmid size increased above 12 kb, so a new strategy would have to be pursued.

Due to a string of failed clonings with the broadhost vector pSEVA251 and the large inserts, new designs are evaluated! Instead of creating a plasmid with the HMF pathway (7.5 kb) and dCas9 system (5.5 kb), we shall add the HMF pathway and dCas9 to the P. putida genome using homologous recombination.

Limitations
We have characterized TERRA’s accuracy and consistency limitations to help users plan their experiments. During stress tests and other runs with TERRA we’ve identified several key factors that could lead to inaccuracies in either dispensing or well selection. Future BostonU Hardware teams can improve upon TERRA by remedying these issues via better design, but the following recommendations can be used to manually fix issues for this initial prototype. Since our CAD and STL files as well as our assembly instructions are open-sourced, future teams can recreate our system with the documentation on our Wiki.
Sample Volume Limitations and Inaccuracy
One of the main limitations currently with TERRA is the requirement of dispensed sample volumes to be multiples of the TERRA drops, which is 0.0479 mL. To give users greater control over their sample volume, smaller outer diameter tubing that connects the TERRA Adapter to the nozzle is required. The outer diameter tubing used during the duration of the project was 0.0018 m. While our model verification was done with 0.0018 m sized tubing, users are able to use their own sized tubing to better fit their needs.
Another potential solution is to utilize droplet-based microfluidics. If the desired volume is smaller or between such sizes, droplet-based microfluidics allows us to create a smaller droplets containing the experimental output encased in oil within the output fluid. Through this method, the 48 μL droplet
that dispensed from the nozzle is part sample and part mineral oil. The proportions of these liquids can be manipulated through flow rate and microfluidic chip design to achieve the desired volume.
In order for TERRA to accurately dispense droplets into the vessel, the output nozzle needs to be filled to the end with the current output. If not, the system introduces a latency in droplet. Depending on how far off the"

Slide 314 was damaged because PDMS bound to the slide and stuck to it. Even after rubbing heavily, the PDMS remains on the slide. Conclusion: Activated stamps are more hydrophyllic and show less bubbles when flooded, but are useless because the protein won't dissasociate from the stamp
Also retried non-plasma activated stamps. The stamps were pressed only were lightly onto the glass and then blocked for 30 min in 50µg/ml BSA solution. In both cases the stamps were flooded, however the bBSA/StrepCy5 signal was very weak - even though in one case a 5-fold strepCy5 concentration was used (50µg/ml) The experiment was thus canceled before the antibody step started to save some antibody. Fluorescence for the 50µg/ml StrepCy5 showes a strong fluorescence signal however.
Conclusion: Higher StrepCy5 concentration didn't improve iRIf picture
50µg/ml StrepCy5 solution was used. iRIf signal was weak, fluorescence quite strong

2 Slides were prepared (314,24): Each with 2 stamps: 1 stamp 40ug/ml bBSA, 1 stamp 50ug/ml His-GFP. Slides were only plasmaactivated and then stamped. 314 was measured. 24 stored in PBS to be measured on next day.
Slide 314 was measured: after initiation problems with rack it was measured, unfortunately air bubbles came into systems (maintained on the bBSA stamp). However, binding of anti-GFP to GFP could be seen well (right stamp - vertikal to flow direction).
Meanwhile fluoresence of Slide 24 (replicate) was measured under fluoresence microscope. Suprisingly, it was seen well (concentration of GFP (only) 50 ug/ml).
05.06.2015
Slide 24 was meaasured in iRIf. Problems with device: Unstable flowcell evoked high noise; furthermore large airbubble came within the flow chamber. Again, anti-GFP to GFP binding could be seen anyways (right stamp).
Binding of Strep to bBSA could not be seen, probably because it didnt bind.  Cy5 fluoresence was checked afterwards and showed that strep-cy5 barely bound to the bBSA stamp.

Back-end code
The back-end software runs both the XY Plane and Control Syringes. The approach in designing the back-end was to treat information in the context of a series of different outputs coming off of the microfluidic chip. By creating an “Output” class, we created different methods that were responsible for assigning each output a set of dispensing coordinates and pair of corresponding control syringes that open and close the output. We are then able to access each output to get the necessary information to control the hardware. The control syringe and xy-plane software are detailed further in the Software section of our Wiki.

Termination
In order to terminate our system at the end of the therapy, we designed our therapeutic cells to produce the enzyme thymidine kinase.
The addition of the prodrug ganciclovir, which is converted into a toxic compound in cells producing thymidine kinase, efficiently initiates the apoptosis of therapeutic cells, making this mechanism virtualy free of leaky apoptosis.
Expression of thymidine kinase is not deleterious to cell growth.
The Thymidine kinase/Ganciclovir system in detail
Suicide gene therapy or gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) is widely used in cancer treatment. One of the most used GDEPT systems is the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) with purine nucleoside analog ganciclovir (GCV) as a prodrug. Systemic administration of the prodrug ganciclovir induces apoptosis only in cells transfected with HSV-thymidine kinase while the untransfected cells survive. Unlike human thymidine kinase, HSV-thymidine kinase is able to phosphorylate ganciclovir to form ganciclovir-monophosphate, which is then phosphorylated to ganciclovir-diphosphate followed by ganciclovir-triphosphate. Ganciclovir-triphosphate is then incorporated into the DNA, which causes inhibition of DNA synthesis and subsequently leads to apoptosis (Ardiani et al., 2010).  We used the HSV-thymidine kinase fused to mouse guanylate kinase (mGMK:TK30, BioBrick"

Carotenoids
Background Design Characterisation
BACKGROUND
Carotenoids are organic pigments naturally present in plants, algae and some bacteria. There are more than 600 carotenoids, which can be categorised into xanthophylls (hydrocarbons containing oxygen element) and carotenes (hydrocarbons containing no oxygen). Carotenoids perform a range of functions, including light energy absorption, protection against photo-damage, acting as antioxidants, and as precursor to other organic compounds. In human, for example, beta-carotene is the precursor to vitamin A.
Biochemical pathway of carotenoid synthesis
The common starting point for carotenoid synthesis is farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which derives from two precursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). In general, there are two pathways for synthesising IPP and DMAPP: the Mevalonate Pathway (starting with acetyl CoA) and the Non-mevalonate Pathway (starting with pyruvate and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate). While the Mevalonate Pathway is present in all higher eukaryotes, the Non-mevalonate Pathway is present in E.coli.
Mevalonate Pathway (image adopted from Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevalonate_pathway )
Non-mevalonate Pathway (image adopted from Yuan et al. 2006)
.
After IPP and DMAPP go on to form FPP, a series of enzymatic reactions convert the colourless FPP to coloured compounds: red lycopene and orange β-carotene.

Overview
Working with proteins as large and potentially toxic as botolinium neurotoxin C without an experimentally derived structure poses a challenge for wetlab scientists. Any modifications on the protein may impair the structure and function of the protein in unexpected ways. Hence, we employed homology modeling algorithms to first-time derive the completely assembled structure of all botolinium neurotoxin C domains. To assess the deduced structure, and various mutations performed on the protein to detoxify it, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations. The immune system does not only attack malicious molecules, but also proteins which were not originally part of the body, but got injected as parts of drugs. Therefore, to improve the potential usage of botolinium neurotoxin C as a shuttle mechanism for fusion proteins we developed a deimmunization workflow applicable to proteins.
Structure Elucidation
'Form follows function' is a principle routinely applied in industrial design and modern architecture. However, this concept also commonly applies to proteins. Botolinium neurotoxin C's structure complete structure with all domains has so far not been experimentally derived in the laboratory and submitted to publicly accessible database. Detailed knowledge of the structure of botulinum neurotoxin C may aid scientists in the general understanding of the protein and to assess the impact of sequence modifications on the protein, especially in the context of safety. Instead of generating the structure of botolinium neurotoxin C using crystallography, we modeled a theoretical structure using homology modeling. Since the generated structure has not been derived in the laboratory, we attempted to verify the structure's folding capabilities and robustness using molecular dynamics simulations.
Homology Modeling
Homology modeling describes the process of the construction of an atomic-resolution model of a target amino acid sequence using experimental three-dimensional structures of related homologous proteins templates. The identification of suitable already known protein structures which resemble the structure of the query sequence and the following alignment of residues of the query sequence to residues in the template sequences heavily influence the quality of the homology model. Researchers have shown that protein structures are"

Set sensitivity to specified settings (E Range= -10.0V; 10.0V). Leave current and bandwidth at default settings (I Range=Auto, Bandwidth= 5-medium).  Note: Save these settings as they will be used for every experiment.
Run these preprogrammed settings. Note: Wire should change to a brown/purple color when reduction is complete (~ 10 min.). Note: Placing the silver electrodes in concentrated household bleach for 30 min. also oxidizes them
To prepare the reference electrode
Combine 50 mL of dH 2 O and 0.75 g Bacto Agar (BD, Part No: 214010) in a 100 mL glass beaker, containing a small stir bar (McMaster-Carr, Part No: 5678K111).
On a heat/stir plate, stir (650 rpm) and heat (~300 ◦ C) until Agar dissolves and  solution appears clear Note: May have a slightly yellow tint.
Add KCl Crystal until saturated. Look for particles to start settling at the bottom (~ 23  g).
Pour the hot solution into a glass cylinder reference electrode (Custom made, dimensions: [Place Figure 10 here]), stoppered by 60 mm long Magnesia stick (Sigma Aldrich, Part No: 31408)) , filling it halfway. Insert a syringe with stainless steel needle (see 1.19) into the bottom and draw up any air before filling the cylinder.
Insert the reduced silver wire that is connected into the rubber stopper and create a  secure seal.
Wipe off any excess salt around the reference with water and Kim wipes.
Programming potentiostat:
Connect potentiostat to EC-Lab software.
Program EC-Lab to the following settings: Apply 0.200V (E i ) vs Ref. (Ag-AgCl) for the amount of run time desired (t i ). Leave limits at default settings (I"

BIT-China,2017,Team:BIT-China#HPSilver_-_-_TEXT.html," the yeast. And the most important thing is biology safety. In our project, the laboratory strains we used are routine strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. In addition, the sweet receptor protein we used is T1R2/T1R3, it’s safe too. We communicate with Dr. Yang about the safety details of the project.
COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES
At the latter phase of our project, we organized Beijing University, Lanzhou University and Jilin University to make a big chat about what we had done so far and held three scientific speeches to introduce the development and the common use of sweeteners in our daily life, which contributed to the popularity of iGEM as well as Synthetic Biology. Ultimately, we collected the critical advice from the audiences in time and accepted one of them, which recommended us to set saccharose as the standard. After that running, the test would be more reasonable.
MEDIA CAMPAIGN
In September, we were interviewed by the Propaganda Department of Beijing Institute of Technology, and we had launched a website campaign on the BIT official website of synthetic biology and iGEM. In the course of the interview, we carried out scientific exchanges on the knowledge of sweet substances.
iGEM MEETING
In the late September, in order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a preaching meeting about synthetic biology and iGEM for all the students of all majors in BIT. At the meeting, we had a total of three links, the first link was to introduce iGEM and synthetic biology to the students. The second link was brainstorm, so that students can think about our project's innovative point and flash point with our project's background. The third part was a free exchange session. Students can communicate with us any project and team related things. After this meeting, the innovation of our project is further sublimated.
OPEN-ENDED ACTIVITY
At the 85th anniversary of Beijing institute of technology, we were invited to show iGEM and our project to alumni. In our display case, we prepared some small biology games, and we told students what‘s Synthetic biology. And we introduced our former projects to people. They can learn about iGEM through our past competition experiences. Meanwhile, we can improve our project through the suggestions of students. In this open-ended activity, we communicated with more than 3000 people, and got more than 500 suggestions. In the open-ended activity, we select sweet substances as our inducers better.

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Calculation_-_-_TEXT.html," model through regression. After the obtaining the model parameters, we can predict the amount of protein expressed and to compare them with that of wet lab results.
With the calculation result from the previous relative expression formula, together with the wet lab result of fluoresce intensity of RFP which is mentioned in the notebook, we can have the exact value of percentage of normal ribosome x.
After the calculation, we can obtain that x=0.9737, y=0.0263.
When determine the relative expression level, the GFP intensity should be the same for experiment state one and state two. However, there are some divergences between the GFP intensity of a single cell between the two states. We rationally assume the divergence in the total intensity is result from the number of bacteria (in other words, the OD value leads to the different GFP intensity). So the intensity of RFP for a single cell should also be adjusted.
We can put the value of x and y into the formula of the relative protein expression ratio.  What is more, we also measured the Florence intensity curve of the control state. With the obtained value of the ratio we have predicted the curve of the experimental state one and the experimental state two. The result figure of our prediction process is shown in the following four figures.

Model Extension
In the previous protein expression model, we just suppose the existence of the orthogonal expression system do not have any significant impact on our system. However, to make our system more accurate, we also need to take the factor of estimation.
Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
What is AHP?
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyz-ing complex decisions. Based on mathematics and psychology, it was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s and has been extensively studied and refined since then.
It has particular application in group decision making, and is used around the world in a wide variety of decision situations, in fields such as government, business, industry, healthcare, and education.
Rather than prescribing a ""correct"" decision, the AHP helps decision makers find one that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and ra-tional framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its ele-ments, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions.
Is there any application in real life?
While it can be used by individuals working on straightforward decisions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is most useful where teams of people are"

Maria Bargués i Ribera
24 years old M2 mSSB
Coming from Barcelona, I finished this year the Master in Systems and Synthetic Biology (mSSB) in Évry. I started on the lab bench during my degree in Human Biology, but now computers have become my hands for doing science. In my near future, I plan to become a theoretical biologist working on dynamics of populations. Hobbies? Music as the key piece of the puzzle.
I barely knew about iGEM before coming to Évry, but motivation of ex-participants was contagious. Constructing an own project on Synthetic biology in an interdisciplinary context sounds too appealing for refusing the opportunity.  In the team, I have taken care of the modeling part and helped on the wet-lab, but my main role has been coordinating tasks and solving flux bottlenecks in team communication.

24 years old M2 mSSB
Born and raised in Bordeaux, I moved to Paris when I joined the mSSB, as I’ve always been interested in new technologies and new approaches regarding Sciences. In parallel, I was finishing my industrial pharmacy curriculum.
I decided to join iGEM very early last year, as it seemed really fun and a great opportunity to come together as students to carry out till the end an interdisciplinary project. As part of the team, I was mainly in charge of taking care of the Wiki and most of the infographics.
After the Jamboree, I’ll head right back to the lab in Paris, as I am now doing a PhD on the implications of the human gut microbiota in cardiometabolic diseases!

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Model_-_-_TEXT.html,", this occurs quite often in protein molecular modelling and is not a great source of concern for the viability of our platform. It is important to remember that all of these data are obtained through mathematical approximations, and that it is important to verify them in situ.
Finally, tracking the distance between the two distal heads showed that we could indeed attach medium to large functional molecules to these heads without risking too many unwanted interactions. However, due to the fact that they remain within 100 Å of each other, we could still imagine placing functions on the heads designed to interact with each other, for example to subunits of a protein that meet and activate under certain conditions.

IIT_Madras,2013,Team:IIT Madras#Weekly_-_-_TEXT.html,"21th-27th July)
The euphoria from the previous week slowly faded away and was now replaced with a growing concern over the status of our second construct (I3A). There was     a lot of paperwork that was required for raising a Purchase Order (PO) and the process, being mediated by government administrators, was typically slow and     frustrating. GenScript had already synthesized our DNA and was waiting for official PO confirmation.
This week was majorly spent in making trips to the Institute Administrative Block and back, trying to flatten out the kinks in the process. Just when the     team had reached its boiling point of frustration and impatience, the weekend brought some pleasant news. Throughout this time, we were constantly     contacting potential sponsors, seeking some financial support. And finally, Dr. Dhinakar Kompala, an institute alumnus, graciously agreed to fund us with a     gratifying sum of money! All’s well that ends well, we guess!
M03W09: The One With The Literature Review: (28th July-3rd Aug)
We devoted this entire week to reviewing literature on purification of small peptides. We realized that getting the positive clones was a very small     victory. Our Gb3 mimic peptide (9 amino acids) would not be easy to purify and detect. Some of us immersed ourselves into papers and review articles while     others sought guidance from the Research Scholars of our Department. Finally, we were able to list down a few approaches that we could adopt:
Reverse phase HPLC
Tricine-gel electrophoresis
Dialysis followed by mass spectrometry
Also, we received the sequencing results of our Gb3 mimic clone and what do you know? The sequence was an exact match to the sequence of our synthesized     Gb3 mimic DNA! A job well done, indeed.
M03W10: The One With The Generosity: (4th -10th Aug)
We had our presentation to faculty this week and we really wanted to impress. We worked hard on compiling the results we had thus far and tried to fashion     a strong argument about the encouraging progress we had made and the bright prospects in the near future (because you need to cover all loopholes if you     want to impress the Professors!). Fortunately, the presentation went well and we got some really illuminating, encouraging feedback.

Utrecht,2018,Team:Utrecht#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,". B) Upon interaction of CheZ and CheY, Luciferase and eYFP are in close proximity. eYFP is excited by photons produced by luciferase, leading to luminescence of eYFP.
Figure 3:  The implementation of the BRET-pair in the Chemotaxis pathway. A) the BRET-pair is able to get in close proximity when no ligand is bound to the receptor. B) Upon binding of ligand to the receptor, the pathway is inactivated. CheY and CheZ no longer bind, therefore YFP will not be excited by Luciferase.
Development of a BRET sensor
To measure the concentration of ligand present, the activity of wild type and modified Tar receptors has to be measured. Therefore, we designed a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based sensor, inspired by a previously made chemotaxis BRET-pair (Cui et al. 2014). BRET is a technique where photons produced by a luciferase are used to excite a fluorophore. We opted to use Renilla luciferase (RLuc) since it produces photons of a wavelength that can excite eYFP. In addition, the substrate for this protein, coelenterazine, is permeable to the cell which makes it perfect for E. coli based bioassays. For energy transfer to occur, the RLuc and eYFP proteins must be less than 10 nm apart. Thus, by measuring the ratio of light emitted by the two molecules, we can detect whether they are physically close, as can be seen in figure 2.
To create this BRET-pair, two biobricks were created: one biobrick containing fusing the RLuc fused to CheZ (BBa_K2736102 ) and a biobrick containing eYFP fused to CheY (BBa_K2736100 ). The bioluminescence of the BRET-pair can be used as a proxy to demonstrate whether the chemotaxis proteins interact (Figure 3). When no ligand is bound to the Tar receptor, CheA is active and phosphorylates CheY. This enables the phosphorylated eYFP::CheY to interact with CheZ::Rluc, bringing RLuc and eYFP in close proximity of each other. This can be measured as a BRET signal when the RLuc substrate is added. Upon binding of a ligand to the Tar receptor, CheA becomes inactivated, leading to a decrease of the BRET signal. Importantly"

They cannot afford the overwhelming medical fee, so someone has no choice but to wait for death with everyday deterioration. The current therapy do bring patients and their family too much psychological stress and huge financial burden, which worsened the doctor-patient relationship and social turbulence. Thankfully, these patients give us a great trust and encouragement, and they hope we can make it.

Age: 68

Therapeutic regimen: Medication
Gender: Female
Age: 68
Disease: Myocardial ischemia
Duration: ~5years
Therapeutic regimen: Medication
This example proves that although patients are given the same therapeutic regimen, the effect varies from person to person. Dramatically, one couple we interviewed have born on the same day, and they are both 68-year-old. They were even examined suffering from myocardial ischemia at the same time. They both chose medication instead of operation, but the effect divers greatly.
Effective and safe as the imported medicine is, taking for a long time stilcannot avoid a series of untoward effects. Some people can tolerate them while some may have a bad reaction. Therefore, the only way to solve the problem is to change the medicine. It also means that they have to take at least one week to adapt to the new medicine. For instance, the grandma takes Plavix that has a remarkable effect initially to prevent thrombus. However, with the amounts of Plavix accumulating, she appears some bad symptoms such as skin allergies, urine with blood, inflammation of the stomach, vessel hemorrhage and so on.
The grandpa using the same medicine can tolerate the side effects and still takes it regularly now. The grandma also said that she felt uncomfortable, allergic and absent-minded after taking the medicine. But she cannot change the medicine if the symptoms are not serious. She also mentioned that many of them, the old, were always afraid and unwilling to have surgery. They are more willing to take conservative method instead of the risky one. This experience reminds us of a very important thing that is the individual difference. Our project may still face the same question in the future: Can your method be effective to the problem of the majority? Therefore we should do more experiments to prove this question.
In conclusion, like hypertension, cardiovascular disease needs treating by taking medicine for the whole life once it is found. No matter how expensive the medicine is and how uncomfortable and inconvenient he"

Positive controls:
The first positive control that came to mind when designing our project, was to use bacteria with known resistance. Naturally, this was not something we desired to do - we do not want our test to rely on distribution of resistant bacteria. To work around this, we decided to purify a representative protein, a β-lactamase. A purified enzyme could, in theory, serve as a very sensitive positive control, and would be safe to carry around.
This was achieved; we successfully purified a class A β-lactamase using a biobrick from the Calgary team of 2013 (see the “biobrick” section). We also moved on to prove that even very low concentrations of the protein produced a reliable signal with nitrocefin, that it was inhibited by clavulenic acid (CVA, the inhibitor for class A enzymes in the Penta Well test), and integrated this into our hardware and software.
We also want to stress the issue that we created the chassis, in form of biobricks, to also express class B and C ESBLs, but did not do this due to bio-safety concerns. Expressing those proteins would mean creating dangerous, resistant bacteria in our lab, which we did not want to do unnecessarily. Therefore, we settled on expressing and testing for class A, and could easily also have done so for the other classes.
Addressing resistance on a genetical level:
Upon the realization that the Penta Well test deals only with the enzymatic activity of antibiotic resistance, we decided to attempt detecting also the genes causing said enzymatic activity. This led to the CRISPR/Cas9 design described further under “Gold”.

This gene was then synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies ) and we then succesfully cloned it into pSB1C3 and submitted it as a biobrick ( BBa_K1590006 )
The synthetic gene was then sub-cloned into the pQE80-L overexpression vector that adds an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag onto the protein which allows for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).
Initial experiments were carried out to optimize expression of lanosterol synthase within our E.coli chassis. Fig 4 shows the expression of LSS within E.coli.
Figure 4 -Detection of His-tagged LSS in whole cells of E.coli. Single colonies of E.coli strain M15 pREP4 harbouring LSS. Cells were used to inoculate 5ml of LB growth medium supplemented with 100µg/ml ampicillin and 50µg/ml Kanamycin. Once the OD600 reached 0.7 the cells were then induced with IPTG, as indicated. Cells were then grown for a further 4 hours at 37°C, 1ml aliquots were pelleted and cells reuspended in 100µl laemmli buffer and 20µl of samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-His antibody.
As shown in fig 4, there is successful production of lanosterol synthase (expected mass 83kDa) along with traces of degradation. Upon successful expression of LSS- His, expression was then scaled up and 4 litre cultures were grown up for purification of lanosterol synthase by nickel IMAC. The results from this can be seen in Figure 5.

Sequence Verification of Integration Products
In order to confirm that the integration products of the functionality test were the ones we expected, we attempted to sequence verify them. We load the whole PCR product visualized on lane 2 and 3 from functionality assay on 28/09/2018 on 2% agarose gel and isolated the bands from the gel and purify them. Since a very low concentration was achieved, another round of PCR was done using the isolated fragment as template. We cleaned up the PCR product and achieved concentration of 250ng/µl for fragment 1, and 50ng/µl for fragment 2.
We sent these PCR products individually for sequencing. The alignment result of this sequence is shown on Figure 1.
Sequence alignment of integration product (two red arrows) with the target EPO. Pink box represent the sgRNA binding site.
Figure 1 shows the sequence alignment between the two fragments and the target EPO gene.From the sequence alignment, we can confirm that integration occured upstream the sgRNA binding site. The overlapping alignment between the two products  suggested that integration does not always occur at the exact base pair position (~10bp variation), which might be the result of the flexible linker between dxCas9 and Tn5.
Next, we used pGEM T-Easy cloning method to clone these fragments on individual plasmid to be able to sequence verify them individually. By doing this we will be able to see the variations within that band individually. The protocol for pGEM T-Easy can be found on the protocol page. We used 2µl of 10x diluted sample of isolated fragment 1 or 1µl of isolated fragment 2 to be cloned into the plasmid. We were able to get white colonies and isolated their plasmid, but however, the sequence verification result did not come on time.

Tsinghua-A,2013,Team:Tsinghua-A#md_-_-_TEXT.html," the sorting results, compared with correct decisions and calculated the Accuracy Rate. The low overlap of optimal networks indicate adaption to DNA copy number.

Further Analysis -- Functional Motifs
After the verification, we made some attempts to summarize the core motifs of these selected optimal networks that are to the benefits of adaptation. Moreover, we wished to figure out the significant characters of these motifs and a general rule of constructing adaptive networks. We noticed that the optimal network contains some basic regulatory modules besides the 3 core topologies we have screened out. Most of the rather functional and robust networks are combinations of these regulatory modules. So we listed them and discussed their effect intensity to saturation and adaptation with further simulation.
We ranked all 111 networks that show adaptation to copy number and classified them into 10 groups. Each group represents networks containing certain core topology structures – motifs above. So we arranged the core motifs according to their appearing frequency in robust and adaptive networks.
We found that more than half of the 111 adaptive networks contain the core motif of IBA Feedforward, and very high portion of networks with best ranking also contain this motif. Both clues indicate that IBA Feedforward is an optimal network. Beside, AO Mutual-Inhibition also exists in most best-ranking networks, which shows that AO Mutual-Inhibition contributes to adaptation to DNA copy number.

School workshop
Exposing children to science is crucial for creating the next generation of researchers and their supporters. Therefore, we wanted to make sure that our outreach reached not only adults but children and teenagers as well, to get them thinking at an early age about synthetic biology and the challenges and possibilities it offers. (This way of thinking is expressed in our movie).
On the morning of 18th June, members of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Degania school (bilingual school:hebrew-arabic). They taught 5&6 grade class and were amazed at the level of questions and knowledge they demonstrated! They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students. Afterwards, they divided the class to 2 groups and played a quiz game (The winning group received a prize). We end the workshop with experiment. Growing bacteria, using the bacteria they naturally have on their hands.
They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.             Throughout all of our activities we consultant with iGEM BGU alumni polices & practices team.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"-Seq, multiple of things must be encapsulated into the droplets:
1. Catalytic Biomolecule Library - in the form of nucleic acids or cells that encode a particular catalytic biomolecule library.
2. Reagents for biomolecule production - described with more details in later sections.
3. Substrate Nucleotides - the target for catalytic biomolecule. It can be attached to any of the four dNTPs . All four different nucleotides can be used in order to record the activity information using 4 different substrates.
The goal of the catalytic biomolecule is to recognise the substrate and catalyze a particular chemical conversion which depends on the substrate and biomolecules type. In many cases such conversion helps the substrate to detach from the nucleotide. Such detachment can be achieved by the first catalyzed reaction or subsequent spontaneous reactions that follow the initial one.
Please see the Methods and Protocols section for a more detailed description of microfluidics techniques.
Proof of concept
As we have already chosen a combination of esterase enzyme and a substrate nucleotides, our initial encapsulation consisted of following:
1. Esterase mutant library created with the help of in-silico modelling.
2. In-vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) mix for catalytic biomolecule production.
3. Substrate Nucleotides (N4-benzoyl-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphates) as the targets for the esterase enzyme.
How such encapsulation looks can be seen in the video below (Video slowed down 2000x):
After the encapsulation each droplet on average contains single copy of a mutant DNA sequence from the Esterase library. Also every droplet contains the same amount of IVTT reagents and Substrate Nucleotides. We call these droplets the Substrate Droplets.
After encapsulation, does every droplet contain only a single DNA fragment from the library?
In order to ensure the fidelity of the data collected using CAT-Seq only every 10th droplet houses a DNA template after droplet generation. If the concentration of DNA molecules in the starting encapsulation mix is too high, the likelihood of encapsulating multiple mutant templates per droplet increases drastically. Such events disrupt the data acquired by CAT-Seq or any droplet microfluidics technique. Encapsulation events can be precisely described by Poisson distribution:
P(X = k) is the probability for the single droplet to house k DNA molecules. λ shows the average number of DNA molecules per droplet.  For example, if you want"

Prof. Åsberg discussed her research on occupational well-being and the emergence of fatigue syndrome as a clinical diagnosis. Before a short intermission consisting of lunch and talk by Naturvetarna on their work as a federation of the Swedish trade union representing workers in the natural sciences, team Uppsala’s own Jonas Nielsen guided the audience through a breathing exercise.
The second part of the symposium touched on the ethics of human genetic engineering that materialized following developments in genetic engineering such as CRISPR and high-throughput DNA synthesis. The topic was discussed by Dr. Jens Sundström and Assoc. Prof. Per Sandin, two researchers in bioethics at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and Hannes Sjöblad, a figure within the Swedish biohacking society and avid proponent of human augmentation and transhumanism. The three reflected on future scenarios, ranging from the realistic to the absurd, in an effort to elucidate some of the complex philosophical issues human augmentation gives rise to.
The event gathered a substantial audience and all teams did a very good job mediating the event. We hope that all participants got to learn about the importance of personal stress management and biohacking. Hosting this event allowed an open and honest discourse in discussing the most important questions regarding the rapid development of biology and medicine. The discussion by the end of the symposium got really heated due to the opposing viewpoints of the participating debaters. The significance of good moderation was made apparent in this context.
We hope our collaboration with team Uppsala and Stockholm will serve as an example for future  Nordic teams to reach out and work together.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
History
Anthony van Leeuwenhoek was born in 1632. He was the first son of Philips Antonyszoon ( a Delft basket maker) and Margaretha Bel van den Berch (from a brewery firm).  On 4 November 1632 he was baptized as ‘Thonis Philipszoon’, however, he called himself ‘van Leeuwenhoek’ because his parental house in Delft was on the corner (is “hoek” in Dutch) next to the Leeuwenpoort.
The father of van Leeuwenhoek died in 1638, whereupon his mother remarried. Ten year later also his stepfather died. Van Leeuwenhoek went to school in Warmond, during this time he lived by an uncle in Benthuizen. After his school, van Leeuwenhoek learned for the first time to work with a magnifying glass when he was apprenticed to a Scottisch cloth merchant, William Davidson, in Amsterdam. In this time, the quality of clothing was judged by thread-counting, for which of course magnification is essential.
Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Meij and moved to Delft in 1953 or 1954, where he opened his own drapery business. Together they had five children, unfortunately his wife died in 1666. In 1660 he became the Chamberlain of the Council Chamber of the Sheriffs of Delft, which ensured him of income. Van Leeuwenhoek got therefore the so called “sinecure”, this means that he was an office with salary but he has no fundamental obligations. In 1671 van Leeuwenhoek remarried with Corn"

2. GMP Concern:
Genetic engineered product has always been an issue of concern to the public. In order to understand how many people are skeptical about it, we conducted a series of surveys, including online questionnaires, written form questionnaires and booth activities. We managed to build an equal platform for communication of the public, not only to tell them about what we know about genetic engineered product but also listen to their thoughts. After the survey, we held public booth, university camps,  and experiment activities for senior high school students.
Finally, we made a analysis how public think about genetic engineered product before and after these activities. The results are as follows:
Total sample is 156 people.
Summary
From the graphs above, they showed that we not only gave people a better understanding about genetic engineered product but also dispelled their misunderstandings of it after interacting with them.
3. Rick assessment:
Based on this result, most people are concerned about the eco-environment and human health. So, we confirm the biosafety of our product both on user and environment aspect.
Q：What if the bacteria ( like E.coli) get out of the device ?
A：We have a system called kill switch which and it will be turned on if bacteria break out the device, the switch will be turned on, and the toxin protein, mazF, will express toxicity, then kill E.coli by cutting its mRNA.
Q：How will you deal with the consumptive materials includes three glide glass after using?
A：Although our consumables seem like it can just be used one time, we have a kill switch to let we recycle them after customers have used. We try to avoid of doing great harm to environment in this way."
