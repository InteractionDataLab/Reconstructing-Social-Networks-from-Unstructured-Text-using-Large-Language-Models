Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Peking,2014,Team:Peking#KillingImprovements_-_-_TEXT.html," carried out a binding assay using purified MVN protein and M. aeruginosa to test the binding ability of   the MVN produced by our E. coli. A similar MVN binding assay has been carried out by Kehr, J. C. et al. in   2006, but our experiment is different in that we fused eYFP to the MVN and we did the experiment with a different   strain of cyanobacteria.
We used pET-21a(+) as the vector to construct a plasmid for the expression of the His6-tagged version   of MVN-eYFP (see Fig. 4) During construction, we retained the promoter, RBS, His⋅Tag and terminator that   were on the original vector. We inserted MVN and eYFP coding sequence into the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. After   the construction, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and induced afterwards to initiate   the expression. After lysing the cells, the crude extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitriloacetate columns   and the fusion protein was purified and later used in our binding assay.
Figure 4. Final construct of the protein-purifying plasmid. The promoter,   RBS and terminator are native ones on the pET-21a(+) vector. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker   added to avoid protein interference between MVN and eYFP.
The purified protein was later used in binding assay with the cyanobacteria M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cyanobacteria colony were broken up by mild sonication at first. The protein was added to aliquots of cyanobacteria culture and later observed under fluorescence microscope. The detailed protocol of protein purification and binding assay can be found in the Protocols.
The fusion protein was designed to be MVN-mRFP at first instead of MVN-eYFP. We finished the purification of MVN-mRFP (see Fig. 5) this summer it was used for testing afterwards. However, our fluorescence microscope was not fine enough to distinguish the fluorescence of mRFP and chlorophyll A. We changed the fluorescence protein to eYFP and the results will be available by the Giant Jamboree.

NeuronArch:
the novel connecting and protecting biofilm based system for prostheses
Abtract
In the future, a long due consideration and an easier access to healthcare will be given to people with disabilities. Presently, some prostheses allow amputees to perform simple actions but without a direct connection between the nerves and the prosthesis. Furthermore, a major health risk is the development of pathogenic communities of microorganisms in structures called biofilms. Strong treatments with antibiotics, or even surgical reinterventions are then required. They represent a heavy burden for both the patient and the healthcare system. We imagined NeuronArch as a novel application that subverts potential pathogenic biofilms using an engineered one. This interface produces substances called neurotrophins (NGF), for directed and controlled growth of nerves. Using a conductive membrane, it will also allow passing of information and enhancement of the electrical properties. Altogether, these improvements would enable patients to regain natural perceptions and prevent the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by blocking quorum sensing.

It is based on Rainbofilm bottom layer BioBrick <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K561000 "">BBa_K561000</a> , with substitution of eYFP (<a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_E0030 "">BBa_E0030</a> ) by BglX. The sequence is under regulation of micro-aerobic promoter vgb, and the TetR expression would repress upper-layer device (Ptet regulated) in micro-anaerobic condition, which mostly exists in the middle part of the biofilm.
<partinfo>BBa_K561005 SequenceAndFeatures</partinfo>
  Coding sequence with regulation of Ptet would be suitable as the upper-layer device (such as <a href="" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13602 "">BBa_I13602</a> used in Rainbofilm system). Expression of the device would be repressed either in the bottom or medium layer, and would do its job faithfully in the upper-layer region.
Over Sugarfilm and More
  Taking most of the advantages of biofilm as a reactor, Sugarfilm makes phase-related synthesizing procedure (in this case, 3 phases in total) more suitable in biological ways:
(1)Each cell only carries out one reaction step in the system, which greatly relieves stress to the cell when compared with cells carrying the whole process;
(2)The efficiency would not be weakened due to the separation of each step, since the formation of biofilm links all the cells together to get the work done in a nice flow.
  What Sugarfilm illustrates here is more than just a simple application. It’s a symbol of infinite possibilities coming with our stratified expression biofilm system (Rainbofilm). For similar synthesizing pathways involving a lot of extracellular reaction and intermediate product flow, and relatively clear phase division in the pathway, Sugarfilm would be an ideal model. Only by substituting the corresponding coding sequence parts in the device with the desired coding sequences (enzymes or regulating molecules, etc.) would the system get off to a quick and neat reaction state.
  In future development, Sugarfilm should aim to further improve the versatility of the system. First, the targeted substrate of the reactor system should not be limited to saccharide. In fact, Sugarfilm system"

Kaushik is a biotechnology student from India. He told us all about what bananas mean to them and how BananaGuard would be seen in his home country.
Could you explain the cultural significance of bananas in India?
""I come from the south of India, where we have large banana plantations.We use almost every part of the banana plant: my grandma could even say of someone that he is “as useful as a banana plant”. We use the leaves as plates, and the stem to make soup, gravy or fibers. We also use the flowers in special occasions as a symbol of prosperity and happiness.""
How would a world without bananas be for you?
""I could not live in a world without bananas! My granny once made a vegetable gravy using bananas flowers and I really want to try it one more time. And the banana chips! I'm going back to India next month and I'll bring 10 bags when I come back to Europe.""
And how about its economic relevance?
""It's huge, and since we use nearly everything, there are a lot of people living on the banana economy.""
What do you think Indian farmers would prefer to use, a GM banana or our synthetic bacteria?
Indian farmers are not very motivated about using GMOs, or chemical products for that matter. We had Bt cotton, which gave a good yield the first year, but the second year the plants could not survive. The farmers would prefer a more natural, organic solution.
So you think Indian people would be open to use our synthetic bacteria?
""It would be fine to use it if you are sure that it doesn't harm the plant. Since you are not changing the plant itself, I think farmers would be happy to use it. But there is a very strong environmental sector in India and it would be a concern if you bacteria persisted in the field.""

Interlab
Standardizing the measurements of fluorescence is a meaningful in scientific comparasion of data. We participated in the iGEM Interlab study following the instructions and provided by iGEM headquarter. Based on the constructs description, we made a hypothesis of the result of experiment. However, experiment results cannot support the hypothesis, so further operation have been done to make sure the correctness of the manipulation of experiment.
Parts
Three interlab devices and two control group have been study. These include:
Test Device 1: promoter J23101. RBS B0034. GFP E0040.Transcription Terminator B0015 Test Device 2: promoter J23106. RBS B0034. GFP E0040.Transcription Terminator B0015  Test Device 3: promoter J23117. RBS B0034. GFP E0040. Transcription Terminator B0015  Positive Control Device: promoter I20271, with GFP Negative Control Device: Promoter R0040, without GFP
All these devices are embedded in plasmid pSB1C3. The plasmid DNA are stored in InterLabMeasurementKit with concentration 100 pg/uL in a total of 10uL of Buffer EB. Other important materials related to Interlabstudy including the FITC Standard and LUDOX. What should be mentioned here is the LUDOX in Our own stock has been made precipated due to improper storage condition, following the suggestion from Traci@igem.org Thanks to Northeastern University of China, we get another tube of LUDOX.
Procedure
The method of measurements of fluorescence we choose is plate reader. The strain we used for transformation is Escherichia coli Top10. We obeyed the protocol provided by IGEM headquarter to carry out the experiment. Mainly, the whole experiment can be divided into the following parts, Transformation and incubation, relative fluorescence measurement.
Transformation and incubation: All five devices were transformed into E. coli top 10 which is purched from Tiangen. The heat shock time is one minutes, recover time is five minutes. Later these cells were incubated in agar plate and LB broth with chloramphenicol antibiotics.
Relative fluorescence measurement: relative fluorescence measurement includes OD measurement and fluorescence measurement. For characterizing the measurement result, OD600 Reference Point and Fluoresence standard curve have been obtained previously. In the formal experiment, 5 devices with replication and blank were pipetted into 96-well plates to obtained OD600 and fluorescence data from"
Bielefeld-CeBiTec,2017,Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec#Hardware_-_-_TEXT.html," into our toolkit is 2-nitro-phenylalanine (2-NPA). This ncAA is very interesting to us, as it could induce a cleavage of the peptide backbone when radiated with light of ʎ = 365 nm wave length. This promises a wide field of possible applications. To demonstrate this astonishing feature, we use this ncAA to introduce a protein purification system with light-induced elution as an alternative to protease cleavage sides. To put this idea in practice, we started the modelling of a purification column in SketchUp and constructed it with 3D-printed parts and acrylic glass. In this development process, we integrated many advices from professors and experts to render the model as efficiently as possible.
To verify the elution as easily as possible, we created a fusion protein (BBa_K2201321) containing GFP for a visible fluorescence signal and streptavidin to immobilize the protein in our column using biotin. The two protein parts are connected through a flexible glycine-glycine-serine-linker of eleven amino acids, in which the sixth amino acid is our 2-NPA. This ncAA will then induce the cleavage of our target protein (GFP) from the streptavidin compound in the purification process.
LED panel: Overview
Background
Nowadays, light induced reactions are omnipresent both in microbiological as well as chemical experiments. As examples, fluorescent proteins and chemicals must be excited at certain wavelengths in order to detect their emittance and ultraviolet (UV) light can be used to introduce mutations in in vivo experiments.
Regarding our project, two of the ncAAs that are part of our toolbox perform an autocatalytic reaction upon irradiation with ultraviolet light. Therefore, we decided to build our own hardware that allows us to perform experiments with these non‑canonical amino acids under reproducible irradiation conditions.
Design Criteria
We aimed to develop a device which is not designed for our applications exclusively, but rather adaptable to a broad variety of experiments. Therefore, we quickly decided to build a device which is optimized for the illumination of a 96‑well microtiter plate, the most central part of modular, standardized molecular biology. As a starting point for the design process we created a list of criteria that we wanted to be fulfilled:
Multifunctionality
The device should be modifiable to emit light of different wavelengths, ensuring that it is applicable for many different purposes.
Modularity & Compact Size
It should be compatible with other instruments processing microtiter plates.
Therefore, the outer dimensions of the device"

For one activity, we conducted Strawberry DNA Extractions, first we talked about DNA, what it is, and what it means to us as humans and how our DNA is different from a strawberry’s. We walked groups of children through the extraction process, talking about what each reagent was doing to help us extract the DNA. For the other activity, we constructed complementary base pair bracelets. Four different colored beads symbolized the four bases. The kids were given a color-DNA sequence that they in turn complemented with the appropriate bead. The day turned out to be a raging success with enthusiastic participants and great conversations about synthetic biology with both the children and parents alike!

Synthetic Biology in the Park
Every Canada day one of our local parks is crawling with patriotic Canadians. We wanted to share in the spirit of Canada and use this gathering to interact with the public. We focused our conversations on education and talked about synthetic biology, GMOs and antibiotic resistant bacteria. We set up an information booth with an information poster, information pamphlets and a giant white board for people to share with us what synthetic biology means to them. At this event, we had the opportunity to clear up misconceptions, learn from people with experience, educate on new concepts or concepts people were unfamiliar with, as well as show our community what their local iGEM team is up to!

In conjunction with the TEDxUNBC convention at our school we joined many organizations in setting up an information booth for the public attending the event. At our booth, we had an information poster and pamphlets regarding GMO’s, synthetic biology, antibiotic resistance, MRSA and iGEM. We also had a white board to ask the public what they think about synthetic biology and GMO’s, this interactive tool worked wonders to open up conversations, clarify questions and connect over synthetic biology. This event brought heavy traffic past our booth, by the end of the day we had the opportunity to talk with a range of individuals, and work towards our initiative to bring synthetic biology to the North!

The dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name ""dihydrogen monoxide"" (DHMO), and listing some of water's effects in an alarming manner, such as the fact that it accelerates corrosion and can cause severe burns. The hoax often calls for dihydrogen monoxide to be regulated, labeled as hazardous, or banned. It illustrates how the lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears.
The subject of the hoax, water
[1]
The hoax gained renewed popularity in the late 1990s when a 14-year-old student collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility. [2] The story has since been used in science education to encourage critical thinking and avoid the appeal to nature .
History
A 1983 April Fools' Day edition of the Durand Express , a weekly newspaper in Durand, Michigan , reported that ""dihydrogen oxide"" had been found in the city's water pipes, and warned that it was fatal if inhaled, and could produce blistering vapors. [3] The first appearance of the hoax on the internet was attributed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to the so-called ""Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide"", [4] [5] a parody organization started by UC Santa Cruz student Craig Jackson following the on-campus postings and initial newsgroup discussions.
This new version of the hoax was created by Eric Lechner, Lars Norpchen, and Matthew Kaufman—housemates while attending the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1989–1990, [4] [6] Template:Bsex revised by Jackson in 1994, [4] and brought to widespread public attention in 1997 when Nathan Zohner, a 14-year-old student, gathered petitions to ban ""DHMO"" as the basis of his science project, titled """

HEK293T cells were transfected with the light system and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003) labeled with mCherry. Cells were illuminated using a photo mask that covered parts of the cell culture and prevented them from light exposure. However, the receptor expression was activated also outside of the pattern.

Overview
This year , UESTC-China 2014 IGEM has been working on the problem of formaldehyde,we try to use the principle of synthetic biology to make a plant to absorb formaldehyde largely.First,we conducted a knowledge quiz activity to popularize IGEM,and let more Chinese know the competition,and drawed their attract on synthetic biology.To crystallize the goal,we bought many liitle gifts such as delicate plants,cartoon fans for the people who joined in our activity and did a good job.Then,we drawed up a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness of synthetic biology and the population of formaldehyde,and last but no least,their perspective on the trangenetic plant which can absorb formaldehyde,if they mind this man-made thing.Also,we do a research in many residential district,where the houses are furbishing,so the formaldehyde pollution is relatively critical.Last,we analized ur research data,and come to a conclusion of our activity,and made many charts or diagrams to make people easy understand.In addition to these above,we also communicate with other IGEM teams,such as USTC-China,HZAU-China ,etc.
Knowledge quiz activity
 The two in our fisrt sight are our team leader Yasong Cui (the right) and our wiki Zhiqiang Yan(the left),you can see the smile on their face. And both in their hands hold our cartoon fans and delicate plant which are used as little gifts for this activity.Behind of them is our activity's banner.
We bought cartoon fans and plants as incentive
 Our team members are packing our little gifts for the activity. we bought 200 cartoon fans and 30 green plants as incentive to attract people who are passing by. If the person who answer our questions then he can own a cartoon fan, if he answer two questions then he may win a pot of plant .
The olds are also attracted by the activity
 The olds are also interested in our activity. In this picture you can see the old ask our team member question. The"

ZJU-China,2017,Team:ZJU-China#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html," cooperate with TRPV1-Ferritin system ( BBa_K2207019 ) to build up our Electrobiologic Interface and fulfill the signal transduction from electronic signal to gene expression. Even without TRPV1-Ferritin system, this part can be a sensitive reporter for intracellular calcium ion.
Introduction
This year, to achieve the signal transduction through medium radio frequencies (RF), we tried to construct an Electrobiologic Interface between electronic device and engineered creature. We formerly have expressed TRPV1-Ferritin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can receive the medium RF signal and induce calcium influx. To complete this interface, we need a calcium-sensitive promoter. CDRE，calcineurin-dependent response element，is a segment of DNA sequence which can be regulated by specific transcription factor Crz I. This TF is activated by calcineurin in the present of calcium ion. We can construct a calcium sensitive promoter with CDRE sequence[9].
Design
We replaced the upstream activating sequence(UAS) of CYC1 promoter with 4x CDREs. We called this promoter Pcdre ( BBa_K2207021 ) and it’s fully synthesized by UCAS through Gibson Assembly. We adapted overlap PCR to assembly it with mRFP( BBa_K2207036 ), which is originated from mRFP( BBa_E1010 ), a widely used report gene. We made a little change to BBa_E1010 to make it more suitable for expression in S. cerevisiae[9][10].
Result
We transferred this part (the backbone is pYES2.1) into S. cerevisiae BY4741 and cultured the transgenic clone in calcium-inducing medium and uninducing medium. The calcium concentration in the inducing medium is 200mM while the uninducing medium contains a relatively low concentration of calcium ion (natural medium 1x YPD).  Then we detected the fluorescence of these two cultures. To eliminate the influence of the concentration of the yeast, we calculated the value of Fluorescent Intensity/OD600 to evaluate these two groups.
Fig.3 Relative fluorescent intensity of induced and uninduced groups
Fig.4 intracellular relative calcium concentration
The data shows that the relative intensity of the induced group is only 149% higher than the uninduced group. We were not content with this result, and we wondered the reason why the 200mM calcium ion cannot cause a much higher fluorescent intensity as we expected. So we tried to detect the intracellular relative calcium concentration of the two groups.

Anticipate This involves continuous consideration of how you want the innovation you are designing and introducing into society to shape the future of society. It's important to question in what ways you want your research to change the future and pay close attention to the associated risk and implications for society and the environment.   It was important to gain information from stakeholders to help our understanding of the specific impacts of our project and then have internal meetings to discuss how we can act upon these. It also served a useful starting point for reflection. For example, interacting with Greenpeace allowed us to anticipate the issues surrounding the use of GM organisms in the field and the need for secure containment of any such organisms. We therefore began looking into methods for biosecurity. Click here for further information
Reflect
Reflection is about considering the motivations behind a project to ensure the purpose of the research is fully understood. It involves thinking about the evolution of the project and most importantly ensuring that the research, and innovation, is still in line with the societal issue you want it to solve.
Meetings with stakeholders often stimulated reflection, such as our meeting with a representative from Plymouth Marine Laboratory which allowed us to reflect on some of our initial ideas for our filtration system and refine them accordingly (Click here for further information). However, we generally found reflection was an internal process that allowed us to make educated decisions and allowed us to consider the broader questions surrounding our project. It also made it easier to identify the relevant stakeholders.
Engage
This part of the framework is about identifying and communicating with stakeholders who have expertise in the areas required to influence your research. A wide range of stakeholders and members of the general public should be involved to get a full range of perspectives.

Figure 2: Graphs showing that Spinach2.1 is comparable to Spinach2 with regard to ability to activate DFHBI-1T and folding efficiency. See our Lab results page for more details.
To increase the stability of the Spinach2.1 RNA-aptamer our BioBrick contains the sequence flanked by a human tRNALys3. We have submitted two versions of our Spinach2.1 BioBrick:
BBa_K1330000 contains the Spinach2.1 tRNALys3 complex in backbone pSB1C3 .
BBa_K1330001 contains the Spinach2.1 tRNALys3 complex followed by terminator BBa_B0052 in backbone pSB1C3.
BBa_K1330000 can be used for reporter fusions. The fused mRNA product can be used both as a characterisation standard for the promoter, but can also be used to calculate the concentration of the fused transcript.
BBa_K1330001 can be used as stand-alone to characterise promoter activity. The submitted BioBrick contains one mismatch in the tRNA scaffold, the brick has not been tested with this mismatch, but we expect the mismatch wont affect the function of Spinach2.1.
To be safe we recommend that BBa_K1330000 is used and ligated with a terminator if needed.
Additional Parts
In addition to our main contributions we decided to streamline the Anderson promoter library, as only 15 of the 20 promoters were distributed in the standard backbone pSB1C3. We were successful in cloning 4 of the 5 missing promoters into pSB1C3 and have submitted these parts as:
BBa_K1330002 contains the promoter BBa_J23105
BBa_K1330003 contains the promoter BBa_J23110
BBa_K1330004 contains the promoter BBa_J23112
BBa_K1330005 contains the promoter BBa_J23116
We believe that this streamlining will help future iGEM teams as these promoters are now ready to use in the iGEM standard backbone.

Modelling Tutorials
Introduction
On this page we aim to explain the concepts and methodology behind the modelling we have done in our project. We hope this will make our modelling section more accessible for all members of the iGEM community.
Gene Expression Networks
Mass Action
Our goal is to model a system of reactions such as the reversible reaction
\[A \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}^{\mathrm{k_{+}}}_{\mathrm{k_{-}}}} B\]
Where \(A\) and \(B\) are our two species and \(k_{+}\) and \(k_{-}\) will be determined shortly. To do this, we make the intuitive assumption that the rate at which something reacts is proportional to how much of it we've got. That is, the rate of change of \(B\) with time is
\[\dfrac{dB}{dt}=k_{+}A\]
where \(k_{+}\) is simply a proportionality constant. This assumption is called the law of mass action. This of course is not the complete picture, as we forgot to include the fact that \(B\) can react back to form \(A\). So the complete system of equations to solve is
\[\dfrac{dA}{dt}=k_{-}B-k_{+}A\]                             \[\dfrac{dB}{dt}=k_{+}A-k_{-}B\]
At this point, you can type these into your favourite computing program and solve them. It is worth noting that mass action applies to elementary reactions, and that more complicated models exist.
Michaelis-Menten Kinetics
It is possible to formulate a rate law that describes enzyme -catalysed reactions, this is known as Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In order to derive this rate law we will look at a generalised system of chemical events detailed below:
\[S + E\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}C_{1}\mathop{\rightleftharpoons}C_{2"
NRP-UEA-Norwich,2012,Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich#Human Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"UEA iGEM team has been VERY active on a range of social media over the summer.Any one is welcome to follow the team on Facebook or twitter. The team kept everyone updated on what was going on, both in the lab and in our spare time. This has been a great method of connecting with the public, companies,researchers, as well as getting in touch with other iGEM teams. The NRPUEA iGEM team believe human out reach via social media is important since it allows the public to follow the teams achievements and lab results, as well as providing an opportunity for members of the public to get to know the personality of the team members. The human stories behind science are crucial, informative and a powerful way to promote science in a positive light.  Please follow us on twitter @NRPiGEM or UEA iGEM 2012 page on Facebook.

Facebook
Creating social media pages also allowed us to access information about who was checking our page out, showing interesting information, showing that social media techniques such as facebook attracted mostly 18-24 years olds interest, and that it attracted no attention from those above 65. Therefore the team thought it was important to promote our project, not only through the internet, but also other techniques such as newspaper articles and radio shows.
The figure bellow shows the age ranges and gender of people who liked any posts from the NRP UEA iGEM team
Below is a list of the international locations that people liked our teams status updates from. This highlighted that whilst the majority of followers were located in Norwich, we also had followers from a range of places over the world, highlighting the importance of using such social media to reach these followers.
As mentioned the NRP UEA iGEM team created facebook statuses and tweets very regularly and as the graph below shows, there was a consistent increase in action and interest in the NRPUEA iGEM team throughout the summer.
Google+
We championed the use of Google+, a new social network from Google. We encouraged the UK iGEM teams to utilise Google+ to help make the 2012 UK team meetup as open and accessible as possible.

Vaccine development is a lengthy process from bench work to market. It involves intensive research in biotech company‘s R&D Department, clinical trials in hospitals, and public education. We contacted all three major groups in Taiwan to get a complete picture of concerns and regulations on vaccine development as well as the current market demand.
Project
In order to make more people aware of our idea, we planned various integrated human practice activities. There are three major routes that we took to achieve this goal. For “SURVEY”, we got feedback and comments from both professional experts and general public on the feasibility and acceptability of our Leijuvant product, respectively. For “EDUCATION”, we investigated public awareness of vaccination and educated them on the significance of vaccination. For “COMMUNICATION”, we set up academic exchanges with other iGEM teams all over the world and collaborated with them.

EPF_Lausanne,2015,Team:EPF Lausanne#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," to talk about science and the actual process of research: how research works, where the money comes from, how papers are reviewed and published”, regrets Aurélie Coulon,  “Such subjects only show little interest to the Editor-In-Chief, except in the case of a great fraud. Therefore, the reader never gets the keys to understand shocking news. […] As a journalist, I try to describe the methodology and to explain the words again, those that look simple in particular. But all this is definitely not easy in a one-way communication context”.
Breaking the one-way interaction model
The remark about the existence of a “one-way communication context” leads to the issue of the interaction between scientists and the general public. Does such an interaction really exist? We asked the public about during our survey in Lausanne, and the answer was mostly negative. “Science should be discussed more often in the street, with the public” or “Scientists should make an effort” were recurring comments. Despite this perception of lack of communication, the media coverage of science in Western Switzerland seems adequate according to Prof. Didier Trono, researcher at EPFL and former Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences: “I believe that a lot of effort is made in order inform the general public”, he told us, furthermore underlining the large offer of media content available in the region, including daily national radio shows and weekly TV shows. Not only national media, but also private media such as newspapers regularly talk about science and related social concerns, he adds. “It can be better”, Prof. Trono conceded, “You should never miss an opportunity to go and inform the people. We could be more imaginative in the programs we design for schools and for the public in general”.
Despite the variety and abundance of information available for the general public, the overall feeling that interaction is insufficient remains .This may be due to the fact that information alone is not sufficient to create interaction, as it only goes one way. A less top-down way of informing the public could be found in more participative methods. The University of Lausanne for instance provides to the public an open-access lab called “L’Éprouvette” (French for “The Test Tube”) [2]. In parallel, they offer introductions to scientific research with both practical experiments and discussions about the issues around Science. Other examples are the DIY biohacker spaces that are burgeoning outside institutions, such as the “Hackuarium”, a Lausanne-based bio-hacker community with which last year’s EPFL iGEM team collaborated [3].

TU_Darmstadt,2012,Team:TU Darmstadt#Human Practice#Classes_-_-_TEXT.html," At a panel discussion it became clear that the conscious use of resources and especially the recovery of these in Germany have to play an important role in the future. The Darmstadt iGEM team became clear that their project had met the ravages of time. Apart from the other projects the teams were able to provide an overview of the development of biotechnology in Germany. It was was clear that as well as the Red and White Biotechnology has precedence the furthest in the development. New technologies such as Systems Biology and particularly Synthetic Biology were observed more critically. Here the iGEM teams were aware that it applies to the next scientific generation to discuss topics like synthetic biology in an open and honest way and especially integrate the people. For this reason the German iGEM teams have pronounced an event day on 25th of August. All German teams in common should try to inform the people about their projects and also synthetic biology. It is up to the young scientists to inform about new technologies and to reflect them so that they can be explored and used in Germany.

23rd - 25th July 2012 CAS Conference - Synthetic Biology
The Center for Advanced Studies at the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich organized a conference for Synthetic Biology on the campus Martinsried. On this occasion not only top researchers from around the world were invited, but also the German, British and Dutch iGEM teams. The iGEM team from the Technical University of Darmstadt was able to present their project ""Next Generation Recycling"" to scientific audience. Furthermore, it was a reunion of the German iGEM teams which met on the 3rd Annual Meeting of Strategic Process Biotechnology 2020+ in Berlin. At the congress the teams could discuss their projects and also the challenges they were faced during the lab work. The presentations provided insights in the latest research in Synthetic Biology and its application. At the end Jay Keasling, a famous representatives of the Synthetic Biology, talked about his urgent research projects. The CAS Conference gives the iGEM teams the occasion to learn about the other teams outside of the iGEM Jamboree. Special thanks for the LMU Munich iGEM team for their great organization of the evening with all the other teams.

I am a second year chemical engineering student, with a specialization in energy and the environment.   Although I have not studied biology since high school, I was immediately intrigued when I heard about iGEM.  This competition allows us to apply  engineering principles to biology.   I had an amazing summer contributing to the emerging discipline of synthetic biology, a discipline which will definitely shape the future.
Outside of school, I have many interests.  I devote my time to friends and family, sports, volunteering, traveling, movies, music,  life...
Taras Karpachevskyy
I'm now in my second year studying mechanical / biomedical engineering. iGEM was a chance for me to do and learn something a little bit different from the ordinary class material, and that was fantastic. I see a lot of potential in synthetic biology, though not in the sense that it's a revolutionary new way of doing everything. I look at it more as a tried and true approach that has proven itself over a very long time, and that will help humans immensely once we learn how to use it properly. From a long-term perspective, with synthetic biology, it won't matter as much whether there is oil to burn or to turn into plastic. As long as the sun is shining and you have dirt under your feet, you'll be able speak the language of nature and create the things you need to live.
Joshua Leung
I am a 2nd year Chemical Engineering student with a Biomedical specialization. Though my major skills academically are involved in chemistry and mathematics, I have an interest in biology. In fact, after my engineering degree, I am considering to go into medicine. As a result, iGEM was of great interest to me as it gave me a good opportunity for me to explore the world of biology and the future of synthetic biology. It is my hope that I can be a part of this emerging technology that will change the world.

Overview
The two proteins essential for bacterial invasion of mammalian cytoplasm, invasin and listeriolysin, were already in the registry, and were previously shown to work in a very simple genetic circuit - promoter-rbs-protein-rbs-protein. Our aim with the ‘pHlow’ system was to more finely tune the expression of these proteins, as well as improve the biosafety of modified organisms.
The story of the pHlow plasmid begins with the induction of Invasin, leading to beta-integrin mediated invasion of the mammalian host. The future endosynbiont is engulfed in the lysosome, experiencing a drop in the external pH and triggering the induction of Listeriolysin. Cre-recombinase, while under the same promoter as Listeriolysin, is delayed by the RNA secondary structures until the endosynbiont has escaped into the host’s cytoplasm. The Cre-recombinase then acts on the lox sites, removing the Invasin, Listeriolysin and Cre-recombinase from the plasmid so that the endosynbiont cannot escape and invade other cells. Follow us on the pHlow journey through the various components.
Invasin
Invasin is a surface protein found in a range of pathogenic bacteria, in particular Yersinia and Listeria species. Invasin facilitates the phagocytosis of the bacteria via interaction with multiple β1-integrins on the incumbent cells surface. This invasion process can be modelled by a power law dependence, as this accounts for the large discrepancies in reported invasion efficiency [1]. Our particular brand of invasin was originally sourced from Yersinia enterocolitica. The protein itself consists of 5 chain-link like domains to which the integrin region is affixed.

Why Yeast?
  Why we use ‘Yeast’ instead of ‘E. coli’? E. coli control is easier than Yeast control. E. coli has faster cell cycle than Yeast. Moreover, there are many E. coli templates. But, although E. coli has many profits, we choose Yeast. Why? The following table is E. coli properties.[2]
  According to the table, we can find easily some reasons that E. coli cannot work human pathway well.
  First, the periplasm’s thickness of E. coli is the very small as 10nm. In our project, we have to use human proteins. Almost human proteins are much bigger than E. coli’s proteins. (They are over 10nm*10nm*10nm.) Furthermore, in our project, STAT3 has 60nm height. Therefore, this protein cannot be in periplasm, and our pathway cannot work completely.[3]
  Second, the average E. coli protein has only 360 residues, 5nm diameter, and 40kD MW. As we mentioned, our project’s proteins have over 1000residues, 10nm diameter and 50kD MW. Thus, the possibility that E. coli have our pathway is very low.
  However, Yeast has big volume size from 3~4 µm to 40 µm. [4] And Yeast is a eukaryotic, so it is more similar"

After 16h of incubation at 37°C with agitation at 200rpm, each sample was subcultured into 5 ml of fresh, equally supplemented LB and cells were grown for 2 hours more. 1 ml of the subculture was then retrieved and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS. 100 µl of these samples was mixed with 100 µl laemmli buffer, and the sample boiled for 10 min. The indicated volume of each sample was loaded on a SDS gel (12% acrylamide). pSB1C3, and pUniprom were included as a negative control, and PmanA-gfp as a positive control. The blot against 6-His – ChrB was without success and is not shown. No chromate of any kind was added to the medium previous to this blot, hence no expression of GFP was expected.

pm/μLPart For LasR can be calculated:
bp length of the construct = 767,
1 pm/ μL= 670 ng/μL, and 1 pm/μLPart = 881 ng/μLPart
And From the given ng/μL value,
22.7ng/μL = 0.025pm/μLPart
Therefore,
Added vol (μL) = [25 x 0.047pm/μLPart x 20μLrecovered] - 20μLrecovered =3.5μL
However, even though pm/μL value of pLsr is way above 0.04, if we take account pm/μLPar of LasR.
1 pm/ μL= 670 ng/μL, and 1 pm/μLPart = 4785 ng/μLPart
And from the given ng/μL value,

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android"
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Model#Software_-_-_TEXT.html," , for distributions as a result of other organisms. The output sequences are generated at a certain point in the gene and for a certain length. The starting point of the sequences is determined using a random distribution normalised to the length of the input sequence. The length of the sequences is determined using an exponential distribution normalised to the length of the input sequence, with the sequences below the minimal length treshold removed from the list. Then the starting point and sequences length are both randomly sampled for the amount of times as output sequences are required, creating the output sequences. These are saved into one fasta file of multiple sequences. See sequence cutter at the bottom of this page for the code .
Alignment and Scoring
Based on the reference sequences, we align input sequences in two steps. First, we align the input sequence with a selection of the natural human human EPO and its 6% misread ( Loman et al., 2015 ) versions to see whether the sequence is the natural EPO or a breakdown component of this. Subsequently, if we find the sequence is non-natural human EPO, we add a second step in which we align the input sequence to the doping EPO sequences in the database . In each step the average scores are compared and the machine learning algorithm k-nearest neighbors ( Torgo et al., 2010 ) is used to classify the outcome scores. These scores are determined based on a combination of two main alignment algorithms: the Smith-Waterman Algorithm and the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm that were build in the BioStrings package in R ( Pages et al., 2018 ). Both determine local and global sequences alignment respectively.
Smith-Waterman Algorithm
The Smith-Waterman Algorithm ( Smith et al., 1981 ) is a dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees to find the optimal local alignment within the scoring system used. One starts with the two sequences that need to be aligned, that are put on the axis of the empty scoring matrix $H$. Then a series of 4 subsequent steps follows.
Step 1. At this stage a substitution matrix is chosen that includes the scores adhered to aligning and non-aligning bases (in case of nucleotide sequences as we use here). In our case we chose the substitution matrix $S(a,b)$ as follows.
$$S(a,b)=   \left\{                                                 \begin{array}{ll}                                                 1 & for & a_{i}= b_{j} \\                                                 -3 & for & a_{i}\neq b_{j}                                                 \end{array}                                                  \right.                                                  $$

Kennedy Moshebashebi, Pandamentaenga Farms, Botswana
Because our GM bacteria has the potential to help farmers worldwide, we wanted to gain the perspective from someone living in a region of the world affected by drought. We sent a list of written questions via email to Kennedy Moshebashebi, a farmer at Pandamatenga Farms in Botswana. He replied with written responses via email.
What is the biggest problem with agriculture in your area today?
The biggest problem at Pandamatenga is climate change. We are used to having huge amounts of rainfall from mid-November to December but nowadays we can have rains from January to March.
What do you forecast changing in agriculture over the next 20 years?
I forecast climate change where we will have more rain, and less predictable weather, that will alter crop plans.
Are droughts a problem for you?
Drought is a problem in my area to a point where we have to irrigate the fields.
Are salty soils a problem for you?
Salty soils are a problem for our region.
Do you have any ideas for how to fight these problems?
I believe regular soil tests and analysis could curb the effects of salty soils on crop production. Furthermore, new developed cultivars can be of help; we would need to explore drought tolerant cultivars.
If you had a team of scientists to help the agricultural industry, what would you want them to do?
Hold workshops and discuss new means to carry out crop production in the midst of drought as this affects the food production of the nation.
Our team is designing a plant that can grow in salty soils and droughts; do you think this would be a helpful product? Would you buy such a product if it entered the market?
New products that improve our crop production are always welcomed. I would definitely buy that product.
Do you use GMOs in any way (crops, et cetera)?
There are certain GMOs that I use, mostly the developed seeds which usually have high yield and the end of crop season.
Do you think your community would eat GMO crops?
My community would gladly embrace anything that looks good and is high quality?
Do you currently use herbicides, pesticides, or any kind of fertilizer on your crops?
I use a number of pesticides.
What kinds of crops do you grow?
I grow sorghum, maize, cowpeas, potatoes, butternuts, watermelons, and tomatoes.
Do you think that our project is feasible?
Your project is definitely feasible because it comes as an answer to the many questions that farming communities"

Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (FAST) is a computationally efficient method to calculate variance based sensitivity indices used here via the SALib library [8]. Intuitively variance represents the spread of a set of numbers. FAST indices represent the proportion of the output variance of the model attributable to a particular variable and its interactions. Focusing on activation time as the primary result of interest total order FAST sensitivity indices were calculated and are displayed in Table 3.

The main take away from our sensitivity analysis is the importance of those parameters which affect Colicin E2 expression versus those acting on Imm2 expression, using both sensitivity analysis methods we find that Colicin E2 promoter and ribosome binding site strengths contribute more to both the activation time and output variance than do Imm2 promoter and ribosome binding site strengths. If we consider the action of the Degradation Switch within maxicells pImm has been linearized which means in the period leading up to Degradation switch activation only those parameters affecting Colicin E2 expression will have any impact hence their greater effect on the model output"

ULaval,2018,Team:ULaval#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we want to, first, demonstrate the feasibility to produce adrenaline in yeast in sufficient quantity before considering its industrial potential.
Additional challenges will need to be addressed such as optimizing the adrenaline production  by reducing byproducts and maintaining constancy of quality and quantity. Nevertheless, microorganisms are nowadays used in so many different ways: in the food industry, to produce beer, cheese and yogurt as well as for food preservation9. They are also used in healthcare, to treat intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease10 or to perform gene therapy using viruses11. This plethora of applications implies that it may be difficult to preserve constancy of a microorganism’s products. It is, however, not impossible.
In addition, we must investigate how our yeast-produced adrenaline would be perceived by the public. Indeed, people are generally concerned by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Being confronted with the choice to use a biologically synthesized medicine would be quite new for a great deal of people. In order to avoid patient’s hesitation during an emergency situation involving the use of adrenaline produced via this new method, we deemed important to investigate the social acceptance of GMOs.
Scientific research is not only about science, it is also about its impact on the society and environment. To better understand the bioethical aspects of our project, we met with a philosophy student, François Champagne-Tremblay and an ethic teacher Jean-François Sénéchal at University Laval. They brought to our attention possible repercussions of our research and helped us design a survey to gather public input on the various implications of our project. Our survey contained questions about ecology, economy, ethics and society. It was designed in the most objective way. It also aimed to educate respondents on synthetic biology. Moreover, we exchanged ideas about important issues regarding synthetic biology with two other iGEM teams, Toulouse-INSA-UPS and NUSGEM (Singapore Team-A). We first discussed different topics including ethics, environmental impact, public engagement and repercussions on the public life. Then, we decided to write a report on the three main topics selected: bioethics in synthetic biology; economic aspects towards synthetic biology; and society’s perspective of synthetic biology. Finally, we talked about our project on social media, in university classes and we had a radio interview to present our project and bring science to the public.
External Points of View
In order to fully understand the ethical challenges of our project, we had to go beyond our comfort zone. It is important to see further than the results we wish to obtain. Luckily, we had the chance to talk about AdrenaYeast with an ethic expert"

Sheffield,2014,Team:Sheffield#Surereport_-_-_TEXT.html,"beit not regarding biology) and certain social status.
Aims
The aims of this project were to explore participants’ expectations and fears regarding synthetic biology within the five faculties at Sheffield University. This demographic was targeted in order to garner differences in opinion (or to the contrary) from that of the literature already published. It was decided that short spoken interviews would be used to collect information and ethics approval was gained. Time restraints on the part of our interviewees meant that focus groups would have been impracticable set up, although they would have offered a better comparison to the BBSRC Dialogue. The original idea to collect data via questionnaire was dismissed due to difficulties in gaining a sufficient response rate (given the time of the academic year) and the opportunity that interviews provided for more exploratory questioning.
The interview questions were designed based on initial discussions with the Sheffield iGEM team, having begun to explore the scientific side of the project for themselves, as well as the scope of the original Dialogues. A short written synopsis of synthetic biology was taken to interviews to aid those who wouldn’t have heard of the technology. This was written with the aim of giving an overview of the technology without creating a bias, and no example of the technology was used to help demonstrate its possible uses.
Although expectation and risk were discussed within the Dialogue, something that was not covered in that report was the role of the iGEM competition within the synthetic biology field. As students taking part in the competition contribute significantly to progress in the field, we also wanted to investigate how people regarded this approach and interviews best served this purpose.
Findings
Having analysed the Synthetic Biology Dialogue, a recurring theme is the concern of the public regarding the motives behind the technology, rather than the health or safety risks associated with it, which were seen to be a less immediate worry.
Speaking with academics and other (technical?) staff from the university, it became clear from the interviews that a general understanding of how research is undertaken removes much of the concern associated with synthetic biology research. Many participants were aware of potential risks associated with the technology, but were not overtly worried by them.
Overall, reactions to the idea of undergraduates conducting synthetic biology research proved positive.
‘Well I think it’s a good thing … maybe the syn bio is in such a young phase it’s very difficult to have that clarity …so therefore leveraging enthusiastic young scientists in to kind of do some kind of groundwork and build some momentum …it seems like a reasonable model to me if that’s how it works.’

The NRPUEA iGEM team were fortunate enough to hold an interactive day at the Forum, giving the public a chance to engage within the world of synthetic biology. Before the date of the event, the team increased awareness via a range of techniques, including posters, leaflets and newspaper and internet adverts, including the Forums website. This resulted with a large turnout at the event, including the local press.
At the Future of Science event, the team presented a selection of informative posters, revealed their new film on a large screen, as well as showing examples of work carried out by the students during iGEM. For example, the public could view E.coli which had been transformed with GFP within a UV light box, as well as carrying out a counting colonies exercise. The NRPUEA team also created a range of synthetic biology educational material for the event, to inform the public of the concepts and terminology of synthetic biology. The different activities were designed to interest a selection of different ages. The educational resources include a range of quizzes and worksheets such as crosswords and matching exercises.
For younger children we designed a colourful jigsaw plasmid (as seen in image). The idea of this activity was for the participants to choose jigsaw pieces that represented the genes that code for certain characteristics, such as green or red hair, and piece them together to form a complete plasmid. Once they had designed their plasmid they used a biscuit base, icing of different colours and various sweets to create a ""biscuit creature"" that corresponded to the plasmid they had created. The learning outcome of this activity was to give the children an understanding that a different selection of genes, results in different characteristics, and that editing the DNA can result in a change in the characteristics. The activity was very popular and most of the participants seemed to understand this concept, as well as having great fun.
The event attracted a range of ages, as well as mixed levels of previous interest into synthetic biology. It also became clear that many members of the public knew very little about synthetic biology, and therefore were very interested in finding out more about the new branch of biology and the iGEM competition. The NRPUEA iGEM team also took the opportunity to talk to the public and listen to their opinions about the work the iGEM teams are carrying out, which demonstrated how"

Achievements
The QGEM team started out with the goal of learning and gaining experience in lab research, engineering and biology. After brainstorming we chose our project's goal, to modify C. elegans to chemotax towards various pollutants for the purpose of bioremediation. Building upon the idea of bioremediation, we decided upon our side projects and began our research.
Overall, we have learned and experienced what it was like to conduct our own research and lab work. Our research achievements are outlined below. Of equal importance, we had a great summer, made new friends and memories which we will carry with us in our future careers.
Chemotaxis
We have successfully engineered and characterized two chemotaxis constructs for our worm. These made our transgenic worms attracted to the chemicals: phenol,.....
Side Projects
With regards to our side projects, we have successfully engineered a fluorescence construct for our reporter system. Secondly, for our degredation side project, we have added the nahD enzyme from the naphthalene degredation pathway of P. putida to the biobrick registry for use in C. elegans and other organisms. Lastly, for our kill switch side project, we have researched two possible genetic hinderances that can be engineered into our worm to prevents its propagation in the environment.
Parts
We have submitted a total of 18 parts to the parts registry as can be found on our parts page . Three of which have been fully characterized, including two chemotaxis constructs, a fluorescence construct. One of our parts was submitted as an improvement to the fluorescence part submitted by our previous year's team.
Additionally, we have designed a novel"
BNU-China,2014,Team:BNU-China#investigation.html_-_-_TEXT.html," clear. Lisa M. Maurer and Elizabeth Yohannes proved that low pH (at pH 5.0) induced the expression of some flagellar and chemotaxis genes and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons to maintain internal pH homeostasis and to prepare the cell to survive future exposure to more extreme pH conditions (below pH 5 or above pH 9 which is higher or lower than the cytoplasmic pH 7.6) (Maurer, Yohannes, Bondurant, Radmacher, & Slonczewski, 2005) . The pH of attractants showed below (Fig.5) is at the range of pH 1.0 – 6.4. The highest concentration of 0.1M is pH 1.0 of malate and 2.0 of succinate, which leads to weakest chemotaxis, for oxidative stress induces its protective responses more than chemotaixs genes expression; while the curves reach maximum at concentration of 0.01M because of the opposite reason.
Fig.5 The pH of the concentration gradients of malate and succinate. The pH of  malate is lower than succinate at high concentration (10-1 and 10-2 M), and is equal with succinate at lower concentration. Both of them remain pH 6.4 at low concentration(10-5, 10-7 and 0 M).
On the other hand, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is influenced by reversible McpS methylation and related proteins phosphorylation (Fig. 6). McpS, in response to chemoeffector stimuli, transfer the signals and make CheA autophosphorylated via the adapter protein CheW. Then phospho-CheA molecules serve as donors that transfer phosphoryl groups to specific aspartate residues in CheY and CheB. Phospho-CheY enhances CW rotation of the flagellar motors; phospho-CheB has high MCP methylesterase activity that helps to change the CW rotation to CCW rotation, and they will be inactive because of loss of phosphoryl group through spontaneous self-hydrolysis. CheZ further enhances the dephosphorylation rate of phospho-CheY to ensure rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling phosphoryl groups to CheY. The signaling activities of chemoreceptors have two-state corresponding to two movement patterns separately (Fig. 6).  Receptor complexes in the CW signaling state activate CheA, producing high levels"

Project Modules
In order to successfully create a cold resistant strain of E. coli, we intend to express and combine the chaperones and AFPs listed in the Description page .
Since all action in a cell grinds to a halt at low temperatures due to reduced protein function it is essential for us to use a promoter that can effectively operate at low temperatures.  Even though some of our targets are documented to convey increased cold growth we will still have to confirm this. Moreover, our other genes of interest may have an influence on cold growth as well and, as such, will have to be characterized in the same way. Similarly, the effect of our targets conveying resistance to repeated freezing and thawing will have to be validated as well. For this experiment we will once again study all of our targets to see if any undocumented effects emerge.
The Project was divided up into several project modules. Note that the first module has to be executed independently, allowing for the second and third to be executed in tandem, modules four and five can be started as soon as the first three modules are done. The final item can be performed based on the information gained from the fourth point.
1. Characterizing and modeling promoters
When growing bacteria at lower temperatures certain problems can occur other than the misfolding of proteins and RNA. Some promoters are known to be affected by lowering the temperatures; making them less sensitive or lowering their activity. We wanted to select a promoter that wasn’t negatively affected by lower temperatures. Therefore a plan was made to test different promoters.
First the ODE’s were written down, describing the route from DNA to protein.
mRNA'[t]=Vtranscription-VmRNAdegradation
Protein'[t]=Vtranslation-Vproteindegradation
The concentration of mRNA over time depends on the transcription rate and the rate of mRNA degradation. The protein concentration over time depends on the translation rate, and the rate of protein degradation, as shown above. The rates in these ODE’s depend on different factors. These are shown below.

Our goals were to build a mathematical model of the pathway to better understand it and create and test BioBricks of the propane pathway to help future teams and researchers to continue improving it.
Outcome
Figure 1: Illustrative figure of the bottleneck results of our pathway.On the left,situation before switching FadB2 to Hbd, on the right situation after the switch.
Built a model of the pathway based on known kinetic properties of the enzymes
Identified major bottlenecks of the propane pathway using our model
Improved our experimental plans according to the modeling results by changing one enzyme to a better homolog and expressing the rate-limiting enzyme from the highest copy number backbone used
Found that propane output was sensitive to NADPH/NADH, suggesting their efficient regeneration might be a limiting factor
Designed two BioBricks containing all ten genes required for the propane pathway to produce propane in E. coli
Chose three intercompatible backbones to ensure that the propane pathway could be integrated to the same cell with cellulose hydrolysis (which required the third backbone)
Assembled Propane 1 (CAR) constructs.
Assembled Propane 2 insert.
Used NEBuilder (Gibson) Assembly to construct the BioBricks
Submitted a BioBrick (Propane 1) containing three crucial enzymes of the propane pathway and inserted it in pSB6A1 backbone for usage in propane production
After trying both ELIC and OE-PCR once and Gibson assembly twice, we managed to assemble Propane 2 with Gibson assembly and detect the right size insert with colony PCR. However, as we ran out of time, we were unable to successfully propagate the correct plasmid, despite multiple tries. As we didn’t manage to assemble the whole pathway, we couldn’t try out whether the pathway was functional.
Our chemostat.
Continuous production
Background
Industrial biopropane production would most likely occur as a continuously operated process, as it is economically more feasible in large scale production. To take the first step towards industrial scale production we wanted to try continuous production of propane using a E. coli strain provided to us by Pauli Kallio from the University of Turku.
Outcome
Successful batch production to prepare analytical equipment for continuous production
First report ever worldwide of successful microbial production of propane in continuous production
145 hour continuous production experiment in a 500 ml chemostat
Propane yield up to 22.7 µg/L in reactor gas phase

For the activators, we are interested in how much of the DNA is bound and active: $\frac{1}{1+(\frac{K_{d}}{[Activator]})^{n}}$
The Hill coefficient gives an idea about the strength about the interaction between the DNA and the protein and is sometimes used to estimate the amount of proteins that bind the DNA, but caution is needed in using it. Indeed, the Hill function has known shortcomings, but it is still very useful because of its simplicity [3] .
The constants needed for our model are $K_d$ and $n$. :

${K_d}$ is the value which corresponds with the amount of repressor or activator necessary to repress or activate half of the promoters. Since our copynumber is 200, we multiply the Hill constants with 200 because this higher value seems more logical to us.
Leakiness
A last important value in transcription is the leakiness of the promoter. A shutdown promoter still has a very small transcription which is called the leakiness of the promoter. This value should be as low as possible, because there should be a big difference between ON and OFF promoters. The effect of leakiness of promoters is something that should be checked.
iGEM 2012 Upssala measured the leakiness of the pLuxPR promoter. Without AHL and LuxR, the pLuxPR was partially active and had a RPU of 10. This means that the leaking promoter has a PoPS of $\frac{10}{390} {\cdot} 0.040 {\cdot} 0.03 = 3.077 {\cdot} 10^{-5} PoPS$. We can use this value to estimate the leakiness of the other promoters.
Translation
The next step in gene expression is the translation of the synthesized mRNA to a protein. This involves the binding of a ribosome complex to the RBS site of"

Offerings and Exit
Synbiologica is seeking funding that will be primarily directed towards research and development of BEAR, initial marketing of BEAR and networking.
Funds specifically used for research and development will be used to purchase and maintain laboratory equipment, purchase the necessary chemicals and reagents and hire laboratory technicians to assist in the development and testing of a viable prototype.
Investment money will be used to register for and travel to conferences and workshops the team will attend in order to develop our knowledge of business and the biotechnology and synthetic biology industries. This is important so the Synbiologica team can learn how to better integrate science with industry. These funds will also assist in travel to different research institutions when Synbiologica Ltd first begins to demonstrate the uses of BEAR to hormone researchers.
Synbiologica Ltd plans to spend 24 months in research and development as a viable prototype of BEAR is designed and patented. The company plans to rely on government grants and initial investment to fund this portion of the business’ development.
Synbiologica eventually plans to sell BEAR to one of the biotechnology companies to whom it had been licensed out. Profit from selling the product will be used to pay early investors, pay members of Synbiologica, and set aside as initial funding for Synbiologica’s future projects. At this point, Synbiologica cannot predict how much money BEAR will be sold for and how much money early investors will make back. The company needs to confer with people more experience with financials in order to accurately make these predictions. As BEAR expands to different possible assays it creates a current challenge in projecting the final value of the product and there for worth upon selling to investors.

MEDAL CRITERIA
Bronze Silver Gold
MEDAL CRITERIA: SILVER
Silver Medal Requirements
Validate that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
As described in the Bronze Medal section, we developed a fully integrated, end-to-end design suite for microfluidic devices. We also designed 3D printed hardware infrastructure for controlling these devices, and we designed a new and original hardware solution to controlling fluid dispension using servo motors. Putting the cherry on top, we also contributed to developing algorithms that help translate LFR specifications of microfluidic devices to lower level MINT descriptions. Ultimately, the intended function of our software and hardware is to enable researchers to design, fabricate and use microfluidics with a single, coherent workflow. Furthermore, this single workflow needs to interface with low cost tools, it needs to be simple and robust, and it should allow any researcher to make a microfluidic chip with ease.
The best way to validate our workflow, our software and our hardware, would be to explore some of the microfluidic projects we did this summer. The following microfluidic designs were made within Neptune, using the LFR and MINT specifications to create the design schematics. Further, we obtained the 3D print schematics for the control infrastructure for these projects from Neptune. We designed the control infrastructure using the tutorials and specifications detailed by Neptune. Finally, we ran control tests to validate the function of our device through Neptune's control interface.
MORE ON NEPTUNE VALIDATION
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"
Virginia,2016,Team:Virginia#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," submit our patent while concurrently conducting our preliminary lab research. In this way, our patent and preliminary research will finalize at nearly the same time, expediting the process of bringing our product to market.
Commercialization
Among all else, our primary mission is to bring a robust, affordable biocontainment method to industry. Rather than spend what could be years expanding our production scale, we plan to license our intellectual property with shared profits to established manufacturers. This will ensure that our product addresses the needs of the scientific community as quickly as possible. This method is also more feasible than establishing a macro-scale production line from scratch.
iLAB
The iLAB at UVa’s Darden School of Business is an incubator we can access for advice on business development. The iLAB is currently hosting over 20 student-run companies. The iLAB sponsors the Entrepreneurship Cup, which we are competing in, and offers business consultation and possible prize money to competitors. The iLAB provides access to over 30 mentors with experience starting their own companies. We plan to utilize this resource to polish our business acumen and prepare to introduce our product to market.
Product Components
Plasmids
The product itself contains two plasmids containing the mutant synthetase enzyme gene and the CBZ cleavage enzyme gene respectively. We will test iterations of mutant synthetase knock-in experiments using various enzymatic restriction sites. After determining the most efficient restriction enzymes, we will couple respective restriction sites to our commercial plasmids.
Manual
After assessing data from our preliminary research trial period, we will develop a manual to ensure correct use of our product. The manual will contain laboratory methods as well as biosafety guidelines, defining appropriate applications of Leu-Lock and synthetic translational control.
Funding Acquisition
The Tom Tom Founder’s Festival hosts the annual UVa Entrepreneurship Cup (E-Cup). This three-stage competition culminates with a grand prize of $20,000. Two past winning projects, Phage Flag and Agrospheres, were based on Virginia iGEM projects. Aside from potential prize funding, the E-Cup provides excellent networking opportunities.
Alex Zorychta, an iGEM alumnus, runs the Works in Progress program at UVa. He specializes in connecting start-ups with possible funding sources. We have met with Alex on several occasions. He has acted as a consultant on our business model and has expressed interest in connecting us with possible investors. We plan to compete in the 2016 E-Cup. We will also apply for grants within and outside of the University of Virginia to fund the preliminary stages of our continuing"

We would like to model the amplifier such that we are able to predict transient and steady state responses to various inputs. The amplifier, at a simple level, takes a Polymerase per Second (PoPS) signal input, and produces a larger signal as an output, but this will have an inherent time lag. We are also expecting the amplifier's steady state behaviour not to be linear. This however, could be useful if it introduces semi-discrete behaviour.
We would like to also model the pigment production response curves to a PoPS input at various levels. For this, we would need to look beyond molecular modelling, towards the optical properties of the different pigments at various concentrations.
The nature of biological modelling means that we will introduce assumptions at certain stages in the models, but we should have an idea of what impact these assumptions have. Modelling our iGEM project has the potential to be very interesting!

Part:BBa_K346001: Experience
We speculate that the threshold of MerR response can be also manipulated by controlling the concentration of MerR in cytosol. As with the bacteria in natural environment, the concentration of MerR is stabilized at a certain level. In order to verify the speculation, promoters from partsregistry constitutive promoter library with different strength were prefixed before BBa_B0034+MerR coding sequence to exogenously maintain MerR expression at different intensity (Fig.6). The sensitivity of PmerT under different MerR concentrations can be denoted by mercury threshold concentration at which reporter (GFP) expression emerges. Furthermore, we used pSB1A2 and pSB3K3 as backbones because of their different copy numbers which could also result in different MerR expression intensity (Fig.7), which was confirmed by an additional experiment.
Fig.6. The construction of the system used for MerR operation characterization. Promoters from the partsregistry with different intensities were selected, leading to varying MerR concentrations. The transcription of PmerT is controlled by the percentage of Hg-bound MerR dimer, thus the expression of GFP can reflex the concentration of Hg (II).
Fig.7. The strategy of backbones swiching. We used pSB3K3, a low-copy number backbone, and pSB1A2, high-copy, to differ the expression of merR.
We carefully tested every combination (the strength of constitutive promoter controlling MerR expression and the backbone copy number) under induction with a Hg (II) concentration gradient ranging from 10^-9M to 10^-5M. The concentration gradient of Hg (II) is: 0, 1E-9, 3E-9, 5E-9, 8E-9, 1E-8, 3E-8, 5E-8, 8E-8, 1E-7, 3E-7, 5E-7, 8E-7, 1E-6, 3E-6, 5E-6, 8E-6, 1E-5, 3E-"

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM.

As discovered by the Queen's team, parts of the software are broken, and require fixing. They discuss their troubles with CRAUT here , and what fixes they used to make the software work for them.
As for iGEM@home, it was described as a distributed computing platform that would allow iGEM teams and individuals to run jobs on a cluster – something that is particularly useful for protein folding and circularization. But when looking into using this system in March, we found that the page was down and inaccessible. There were mentions on Heidelberg's wiki pages that they would be more than happy to hand over control of the platform to iGEM HQ, or that changes may be made in the future
; however, there is no indication anywhere that iGEM@home is being used let alone even running, and there is no incentive to make sure that this happens once the Jamboree is over.
There is even little impetus to make sure that incorrect statements are fixed, and the Waterloo team is not innocent of this. At the 2014 Jamboree, our team was awarded Best Undergraduate Model, and we had an extensive wiki dedicated to our modelling last year. iGEM HQ even used it as an example for other teams to follow. But after the competition, we realized a number of values in our parameter tables were incorrect
, and we tried to fix many of them out of good conscience. However, I am still not 100% confident that all the values are entirely correct, or appropriate enough for the models we developed. Unfortunately, it is likely that no teams or judges are going to check the validity of our data thoroughly enough during or after the Jamboree to notice mistakes, let alone correct them. Fixing these values completely was not a high enough priority for our team this year, since the next season of iGEM got underway in a few months and there were other, more pressing matters to take care of.
iGEM 2008
This argument can be applied to the BioBrick Registry as well. There are a number of teams that submit less than ten BioBricks each season, and there are teams, like the 2014 MIT team that submitted fifty-six parts
. Many BioBricks are well documented ( here is one from MIT, for example) but there are also many poorly documented ones that don't give adequate detail of characterization ( this part , for example). The volume of new BioBricks introduced each year is too much to parse, and it becomes difficult to independently"

Basic Parts
Basic Parts
We designed four new basic parts that were used in our project:
Mutated EF-1a promoter ( BBa_K2520023 ) is a strong, constitutive, promoter in mammalian cells. It is particularly useful in cells that do not express proteins with other common promoters (such as CMV). This promoter is commonly used in stem cells as it is one of the few promoters that prompt high levels of protein expression in these predominantly dormant cells.
This promoter is our favorite part.  Promoters are clearly very important in iGEM. Synthetic biology depends on strong and consistent expression of recombinant proteins.  The EF-1a promoter was used by both teams who won “best therapeutics project” in 2016 ( Tel-Hai , SYSU MEDICINE ), but neither submitted it as a part since the promoter contains two forbidden restriction sites within its sequence. As a side project, we set out to create a mutated version of the original (WT) EF-1a so that it may serve future iGEM teams. We mutated the WT EF-1a at two points (base pair 319 and 824 were changed from C to T), thus eliminating the forbidden restriction sites. We characterized and tested our new promoter for functionality and compared it with the WT EF-1a (Figure 1 at the part's page ). In closing, we have added a new and valuable promoter to the iGEM parts registry that we believe will serve future teams seeking to work with mammalian cells.
Secrecon ( BBa_K2520002 ) is an artificial secretory signal, which leads to high levels of protein secretion and membrane expression. Secrecon was found to be the most powerful and consistent human secretion signal sequence (more than Igk, for example).
B7-1 ( BBa_K2520000 ) is a trans-membrane domain protein with a cytoplasmic tail. It enhances transport from the endoplasmic retic"

Parts
Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)
Design considerations
We encourage you to put up much more information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page.
Inspiration
We have a created  a collection of well documented parts that can help you get started.
You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:
2014 MIT
2014 Heidelberg
2014 Tokyo Tech
Part Table
Please include a table of all the parts your team has made during your project on this page. Remember part characterization and measurement data must go on your team part pages on the Registry.

Nagahama,2014,Team:Nagahama project_-_-_TEXT.html," by a function becoming simple. The number of Escherichia coli just leads to the level of the function, analysis becomes easy.
Our Project
We make various systems by cell-cell communication. We keep one function in one E. coli.  This means to make simple plasmid. The following is one example. We’d like to collect cadmium in water. Therefore we use two kinds of E.coli. One catches Cadmium. The other attracts all E.coli by using chemoattractant. Catches E.coli displays metallothionein a protein combines a heavy metal. Cadmium is a kind of heavy metal. The other synthesizes aspartic acid (Asp) one kind of chemoattractant. All E.coli gather in the E. coli synthesizes Asp. To use these E.coli, finally cadmium will be caught.
When we collect cadmium in the water, if use only catching E. coli(Blue),they go away from cadmium. Because they have negative chemotaxisin contrast with cadmium. Consequently, they don't catch cadmium very much.[fig1-A] In constract, if we use two kind of recombinant Escherichia coli(E. coli);gathering E. coli(Red) and catching E. coli(Blue), we can build the creature system which collects cadmium while sitting at cadmium by using two kinds of Escherichia coli.[fig1-B]   It is this theoretical merit that we can suggest two kinds of possibility that meeting condition and collection quantity of Escherichia coli are changed by changing the ratio of Escherichia coli in addition to cadmium solution.
We constracted plasmid that synthesize aspartic acid in the presence of cadmium. Part's namber are BBa_K896008(promoter),(RBS),BBa_C0083(Protein coding sequences),(Double terminator).  BBa_K896008(zinTp) is a promoter inducing gene expression only in existence of cadmium. AspA mainly catalyzes the deamination of L-aspartic acid to produce fumarate and ammonium ion. As a result of having cultured it in the nutrient medium including the substrate, we confirmed synthesis of aspartic acid by thin layer chromatography.
We are constracting this plasmid now. Recombination Escherichia coli having this plasmid becomes the thing with the function to trap cadmium on outer membrane if construction of this plasmid is completed. It is fusion protein with metal"

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Outlook - dCas9 scaffold
In the near future we would like to finish our final construct for the dCas9 project and measure the Auxin concentration to determine if we can exceed the amount of Auxin just with IAAM and IAAH fused to RNA-binding proteins.
To empirically prove that metabolic channeling occurs as we have envisioned it, we would need to plan a lot more experiments:
1. Stoichiometry of bound and unbound complexes
We have to verify how effective our dCas9/IAA complex can bind the target cassettes to include that data in the isotope dilution experiments (mentioned below for proof of channeling).
2. Compare different Target cassettes
We need to measure the number of targets that our target cassette constructs offer and how the differences between the cassettes affect stoichiometry, so we would have to measure plasmid copy number and stoichiometric data (as mentioned above already). This is needed to normalize the data and precisely measure the effect of the different distances between the target sites and rule out other factors that may come into play.
3. Gather protein expression data
To be able to compare the final construct with the control (no deadCas9 and sgRNAs), we need to measure how much (ideally: functional) respective protein is produced with each construct.
4. Check for protein integrity
We have to verify if the fusion proteins we want to produce are even present as expected in vivo. This stems from the unpleasant experience Dr. Joachim Kopka from our group had, when a GFP fusion turned out to have been hydrolyzed and the GFP signal was just freely diffusing enzymes.
outlook - confirmation of channeling:
For both"
