Extracellular AHL behavior
The wild cell extracellular AHL behavior observed in graph 7 tends to reach a value of .5457. As seen in the Complex behavior, the logistic tendency was observed but at what seems to be a low value. Then again taking under consideration that it started at zero, its growth is considerable big enough.
Unlike the wild cell, the modified cell reaches an even lower value of 0.0013. In spite of what it seems to be a growing behavior, with the same conditions of time and cell density range, the amount of Ae was significantly delayed.
In this scenario, the D parameter has a lot of impact in the Ae(t) behavior. This happens because at a lower extracellular AHL loss value, the more AHL molecules are available in the media to enter the cells and a lower cell density could trigger the QS. In the other hand a high fixed value of D will represent a high rate of AHL loss and more cell density will be needed for reaching the QS.

Graph 8. Cell density against Extracellular AHL concentration (Modified).
Behavior  through time
In the previous simulations, the cell density was compared against each variable to visualize the individual critical values of cell population that would trigger QS. In this section it is the time who is analyzed against the four variables at once. In graph 9 At first sight it looks like the Complex, intracellular and extracellular AHL concentrations are not changing through time, since the blue line, which represent the EamI concentration, presents a big increase around the 130 x-axis value. It is not until making a zoom to the image that we can appreciate the logistic growth not only in the EamI concentration, but also in the rest of the other three variables.
In the modified cell (graph 10) we identified two main differences with the wild cell model. First, that in the same horizon of time the variables have not yet reached a logistic growth. And second, the final concentration values are considerably smaller than the ones obtained in the wild cell, in fact all of them reduced in almost a 99%.

iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

UC_Davis,2013,Team:UC Davis#Notebook#Week 7_-_-_TEXT.html," transformation involving our potentially mutated pSB3K3 plasmid did not work, so we retried site-directed mutagenesis PCR, but increased the amount of template DNA in the reaction. After amplification and digestion, a gel was run to see if there was any evidence of an amplified product. It appeared that there was a band of the right size, which means the reaction was successful. At the end of the day, we did a transformation with the newly mutated pSB3K3 plasmid. We also tried ethanol precipitating some DNA in order to prepare it for electroporation.
8/7/13
The transformation involving the mutated pSB3K3 was unsuccessful. We redid the transformation with additional DNA. We also performed our first electroporation transformation with BBa_K750000 and BBa_K598010 into the DH10B strain. It took a little trial and error and the ethanol precipitations we did yesterday were not necessary after all, but hopefully it will be successful. We received new Golden Gate primers for the amplification of our TAL repressors with new BsaI sites. With the experience gained from difficulties with PCR in the past, we decided to try three different reverse primers on our two TAL repressors and then try different melting temperatures. The number of different combinations was a total of 30 different reactions. We hope that at least two reactions involving the two different TAL repressors will work. By working in parallel, we hope to reduce the amount of time that may be used in the future.
8/8/13
The transformations involving BBa_K750000 , BBa_K598010 , and the mutated version of pSB3K3 were all successful. We grew pSB3K3 in liquid LB. We plan on running a practice Tecan run involving BBa_K598010 and BBa_K750000 with our new strain DH10B. Tomorrow we will do a miniprep and sequence the plasmid for the miniprep. These will be cultured overnight. Unfortunately, all of the PCR amplifications of the TAL repressors were not successful. In light of these persistent issues with amplifying the TAL repressors, we are going to restriction digest them in order to confirm whether the DNA in our miniprep is does contain the TAL repressors that we want or just some contaminants. We continued updating our wiki with consideration of the project overview due date.
8/9/13
We ran a gel involving the restriction digest of the two TAL repressors."

The green points represent the DNA sequences of 150 bps from the genes other than EPO. The red points are the gene doping DNA which consists of a diverse set of codon varied EPO sequences as well as animal EPO sequences.
From figure 2, it becomes apparent we chose the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The k-nearest neighbours algorithm is good at identifying local structures in datasets, which is essential with the large spread of scores that have been attributed to the gene doping sequences. Additionally, the value of a learning algorithm is highlighted because of the variable properties of gene doping DNA. The algorithm was tested with alignments based on four scoring weight distributions (figures 2-5). For the figures with all weight distributions, please see the dropdown below figure 2.
Figure 2. The classification of natural EPO with 6% misread rate ( Loman et al., 2015 ), artificial EPO and any other DNA based on alignment scores with natural EPO and artificial EPO sequences in the database. The weights attached to local, global and overlap alignment are 1-10-1 respectively.
Weighing Alignment Scores
In order to determine the influence of the alignment algorithm on the classification abilities of the program we varied the weights attached to the scores from each algorithm systematically. The best performing algorithm is shown in figure 2 and adheres most value to the global alignment score. With this weighting, we were able to distinguish more than 80% of the sequences designed by our team and the cyber security specialists at the Hackathon . The classification resulting from the other weights was worse. The following figures display the scoring with the different weighings.

SouthBend-Mishawaka-HS,2011,Team:SouthBend-Mishawaka-HS-2_-_-_TEXT.html," create a device using synthetic biology to detect arsenic in water and give an instant reading to the presence of arsenic. Arsenic is a harmful to organism that use phosphorus in organic molecules because arsenic can replace phosphorus in organic molecules. This can occur because arsenic has similar characteristics as phosphorus.
Secondary Objective:
Our team's secondary objective is to use our iGEM arsenic biosensor to test different water sources.
Further Considerations
Ideally, our engineered bacteria would be able to indicate the arsenic levels based on light and odor intensity. When the promoter is activated with the presence of arsenic, RNA polymerase is able to travel down the DNA of the GFP gene or the Wintergreen odor gene. The odor will allow one to immediately detect arsenic, while the creation of Green Flourescent Protein will create light that can be measured quantitatively.

Alexander
Mangas
Design Team Member - Chemical and Biomedical Engineering
Hello, my name is Alexander Mangas and I am a senior studying Biomedical and Chemical Engineering at FSU. Before I discovered iGEM and the field of synthetic biology, I always dreamt of creating futuristic, disease-fighting nanoscale robots (huge sci-fi nerd). When it dawned on me that cells can be programmed to function as dedicated machines that perform tasks at a micro level, I was blown away! iGEM presented an incredible opportunity to create living robots that treat diseases as a cell therapy, thereby blurring the line separating science fiction and reality. Random fact about myself: I have a slight obsession with motorcycles, can’t get enough of them really.

Ms. Guo (70-year-old)       Rectal cancer sufferer
Ms. Guo has been diagnosed as rectal cancer for 8 years. Her initial symptoms were slender stools along with purulence and abdominal pain. But she thought it was caused by her constipation combined with hemorrhoids. She did not know that it was rectal cancer until she went to the hospital for a colonoscopy.
During the 8 years, Ms. Guo has experienced two surgeries. The first one was taken soon after her diagnosing. At that time, as she was found in the middle stage of the cancer, the doctors performed the surgery to remove the lesion. After the surgery she continued chemotherapy treatment for continuous control, adhering to the check every 3 months. However, in 2011 and 2015, Ms. Guo has experienced 2 recurrence. Now she depends mainly on the treatment combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Every 21 or 28 days she goes to the hospital for a session of chemotherapy. After accept chemotherapy, Ms. Guo suffers from side effects like vomiting, hair loss, limbs weakness, etc.
As Ms. Guo’s husband told us, the reimburse they received is more limited, because they came for treatment from another province, which is defined as non-local insurance. Ever since Ms. Guo’s treatment, they have spent more than 200k RMB (30,000$) on medical expenses, which add up to be a very heavy burden for them.
At the same time, Ms. Guo told us that there are a lot of people distributing leaflets and ads around the hospital. Some of these ads might be false, yet desperate patients still try to contact them as if they are clutching at the straws of their lives. Ms. Guo hopes that the government could provide some authoritative medical journals for patients like them, enabling patients to understand the latest researches from the formal channels, and to get a better comprehending of the therapies that suit them.
Summary
Long story in short, most of the patient we interviewed showed positive mental conditions, but the economic situation of their families could be uneven. There are not many patients who have relatively well-off condition like Ms. Chen, and more than half of the patients cannot afford molecular target therapy thus rely on the medical insurance reimbursement.
Most of the patients are holding certain expectations for new therapies. However, obviously, aside from efforts to promote the efficacy of new therapies,"

3.3 Protocols and Results
Late exponential phase cells of V.Cholera will be harvested and resuspended in 20 mL of 4 M-urea with DNAse inhibitors. The following step is an incubation of 10 min at 24°C, by which time more than 90% lysis occurs.  The only difference is that we extracted the DNA from E.Coli instead of V.Cholerae for security measures.
The following protocols (Table 2) has been done in laboratory in order to check if the centrifugation can be removed during the DNA extraction. Two different elution buffers are compared.

Introduction
Why Flavorator?
Food problems is are a serious matter in the world. Among them, food preservation is the one. Ideal food preservation is keeping food without causing quality change for longer time with cost effectively. A plenty of preservation methods have been used so far, we created a new one to solve it. It is ""Flavorator""!!
Thirty years ago, “KOZOKO（香蔵庫 in Japanese）” was proposed by Professor Yozo Iwanami. The name “KOZOKO” can be directly translated into ‘flavor (=KO, 香)’- ‘preserved (=ZO, 蔵)’- ‘box (=KO, box)’. However, “KOZOKO” is not just a flavor-keeping reservoir, but a preservation box to preserve food in a fragrance. Then, what flavors we fill in KOZOKO? Such flavors should have antimicrobial; and/or insecticidal activities. The best candidates are plant’s origin. Plants cannot move to other places, if microbes and/or insects attack them. So, they produce antimicrobial and/or insecticidal agents, mostly they are not harmful to human and animals. In combination with the antimicrobial flavors, “KOZOKO” would become an energy-saving substitute for an ordinary electric refrigerator. Before doing so, it has two problems to be realized. The one is that We must select appropriate flavors and/or plants that can be cultivated under the various climate. The another is that cost issues must be cleared, as mass cultivation of the plant and extraction of pure flavors from plants is expensive and requires time-consuming process. As a result, “KOZOKO” is under the state of conceptual idea.

<2-6-8> is the shortest pathway obtained from the experiment in our project. It is made up of 5 DNA single strands, which are Site NO.2, Site NO.6, Site NO.8 and Line <2,6>, Line <6,8> obtained from bridging-PCR. We designed two restriction enzyme digestion cutting site respectively in the primers of Site NO.2 and Site NO.8 in order to insert plasmid pSB1C3.Every site contains 40bp DNA sequence at random and every adjacent site is connected by line, which adds up to 13 lines. Lines are represented by 52bp DNA single strand, with post-20 complementary base pairs from the first and pre-20 complementary base pairs from the last site plus 12bp information bits in the middle. The NO.21 base to NO.32 base in the 40bp of pathway <2,6> and <2,8> represents the information sequence. The pre-4bp sequences contain the information of identification point, the mid-4bp sequences contain the information of the specified line, and the post-4bp contain the information of the path length. Through DNA Gel electrophoresis and Sequencing analysis, <2-6-8> proved to be the shortest pathway. The calculated actual length of <2-6-8>  is 26 mile in the reality.

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Project#OurSensor#Reporter#BetaLactamase_-_-_TEXT.html," our Prussian blue ferritin reporter . But unlike the Prussian Blue ferritin system,  β-lactamase can also be used for a pH output as well. This would add more versatility to our system, as β-lactamase can add a different type of output which would mean that our system is not only limited to the colourimetric outputs. Additionally, the pH output can be paired with different pH indicators to give a variety of colourimetric outputs. We have characterized this ability with two separate pH indicators, phenol red and bromothymol blue, and were able to demonstrate two completely different colourimetric output. In addition, the output of our system can be scaled by altering the number of fused β-lactamase proteins by exploiting the ferritin nanoparticle. This can be achieved through modifying the number of β-lactamase molecules attached to ferritin, ranging from 24 or 12 depending on whether our ferritin nanoparticle consists of the 12 heavy-light subunit fusions ( BBa_K157018 ),or 24  individual subunits, composed of separate light and heavy subunits. The result is a system that can be scaled by utilizing 24 or 12 β-lactamase proteins, or only 1 Prussian blue ferritin core, or one β-lactamase protein fused to a TALE as an alternate. This adds the elements of versatility, flexibility, and most importantly, modularity to our biosensor and serves a vital basis for our platform.
Constructs
We retrieved the ampR gene from the backbone of the pSB1A3 plasmid. We added a a His-tag  was added to the N-terminus of it using a flexible glycine linker ( BBa_K157013 ), allowing purification through Ni-NTA protein purification, as well as the lacI promoter for expression (Figure 3). Additionaly, we modified this gene to make it a more useful part for the registry, such as the removal of a BsaI cut-site, making it viable for Golden Gate assembly (Figure 4). We also fused the ampR gene to on our TALE A to bind to our target sequence (Figure 5). This could be used in conjunction with another TALE to act in our strip assay. These modifications resulted in the products shown below:

LMU-Munich,2012,Team:LMU-Munich#Laboratory Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," level 1 classification.  That means we wear lab coats and single-use gloves. When working with hazardous chemicals (e.g. liquid N2) we wear goggles as well. Furthermore, dangerous substances are stored and handled in designated rooms in order to assure the safety of the researchers.
For the protection of the public and the environment against hazardous substances, all GMO-contaminated waste is inactivated by autoclavation. Before leaving the laboratory, every researcher cleans and disinfects his/her hands. Moreover, we leave the windows closed and do not discard any dangerous substances in the sink.
Question 1
The subproject BacillusBioBrickBox is about the construction and evaluation of new BioBricks for the work with B. subtilis (see Answer 2) and therefore does not raise any safety issues.
The other subproject, Sporobead involves the creation of GMOs which have unknown effects to the public or the environment. Although we have great plans for the use of our Sporobeads, they never leave our laboratory, so they cannot harm the public or environment. For possible future applications, we will prevent the germination of our Sporobeads in two different ways ( GerminationStop ), so that they cannot proliferate. This is our approach towards the safety of our Sporobeads.
We have not worked on it yet, but there also is the possibility to remove antibiotic resitance genes from the Bacillus subtilis genome (for example with pMAD , a vector that we used to delete genes in B. subtilis). All of our constructs are used while being integrated into the genome. Therefore all resistances could be removed (without removing the functional constructs) before the use of the Sporobeads. Other pathogens would thereby not have the possibility to grab resistance genes from our strains.
From the best of our knowledge, the parts, strains and spores we use do not raise any safety concerns. However a point that needs to be discussed here is the potential risk of misusing our spores. We offer an easy platform for displaying any protein of interest on our spores. Could this platform be used by e.g. a bio-terrorist? Since all information on how to build a spore with a protein of interest is given on this website, one could imagine to use Sporobeads as a vehicle for lethal proteins. Our team is aware of this potential risk. However, our spores can not germinate, so the risk of a rapidly spreading epidemic is negligible. Today it still seems ""easier"" to use"

The Future Plan
We strongly hope to popularize and transform our achievements in lab, and benefit more fish farmers in China and even the world. In the way of reaching commercial success, we are confident to deal with challenges and difficulties. Chances remain that we can patent our device, realize batch production and bring our device to market. We are looking forward to the future in which a large number of fish farmers can use our product to solve the ammonia pollution problems efficiently and conveniently.

Penn,2013,Team:Penn#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," and begin creating a poster presentation for presenting at University research conferences. We also wanted to begin thinking about designing a computer application for analyzing gels.
Achievements:
During a marathon weekend coding session, we created a program that we called MaGellin that was designed to analyze our gels and characterize the amount of methylation. We attempted to improve our cloning efficiency by utilizing Antarctic Phosphatase within our reactions. We made substantial progress on finishing our TALE and zinc finger constructs, and selected and grew colonies that would be used to test our assay the following week.
WEEK 15
Sep 12 2013 - Sep 18 2013
Goals:
We wanted to make substantial progress on the website this week. We also wanted to run our assay and test how well our methyltransferase-DNA binding domain fusions had worked. We wanted to work on animation for our video as well as make progress on our human practices essay.
Achievements:
We ran the assay on the TALE and zinc finger clones, and it yielded promising results. The expression of our fusion protein was a definite achievement. We made substantial progress on the website and essay as well.
WEEK 16
Sep 19 2013 - Sep 25 2013
Goals:
We needed to finish our website and various forms this week, as well as run our assay in triplicate on the constructs we had created thus far. We needed to plan our remaining time up to the Jamboree, and practice our presentation skills at various outreach events.
Achievements:
We attended several events aimed at recruiting future team members that showed substantial interest in our research and iGEM in general. Our assay returned promising results about the state of our methyltransferase-DNA binding domain fusions. Additionally, we finished the website and filled out all the forms we needed. We have a few experiments still in progress, but our time now is spent preparing for the Jamboree and being ready to present our results.
WEEK 17

Infiltration Model
Infiltration
Background
     In our experiment, we have designed and performed the microfluidic devices(Pic 1), where the substrate inside wash the increasing AHL in the chamber room. On the one hand, we controlled the concentration of AHL in the chamber room, on the other hand, the diffusion of AHL realized the united oscillation among each chamber.      Therefore, we constructed a model on the relationship between the flow rate of microfluidic and the concentration of AHL.
Pic 1 Microfluidic Device
Derivation
     When the microfluidic substrates flows across the chamber room, the external AHL molecule in the chamber room penetrates from the surface towards the main body. At every instant of the system, there exists different instant distribution of concentration and instant interface diffusion rate, which is proportional to the concentration gradient of the interface. Thereunto, the entire process of mass transformation by convection is achieved by to different effects.      (1) Convective transformation effect. That is, under the circumstance of convection, the fluid mass point continually moves and confuses, and brings the substance from one place to another.     (2) Molecule Diffusion Effect. It is caused by the concentration difference among the fluid, the molecule transfers by the means of diffusion.      Mass transformation coefficient DAB is the combined signal of two effects, whose unit is m^2/s.
     According to Higbie’s penetration model , when composite A diffuses towards composite B, the mass flux through the interface of two liquid phases can be presented as:
    Where texp is the exposure time of two liquid phases, CAs is the concentration of AHL of the higher concentration side of the interface, and"

Top
June, 12th
Miniprep for the chosen colony of A4.
Glycerol stocks/miniprep for the five 5 ml overnight cultures of A3.
We linearized the purified plasmids digesting 1 ug of DNA with PstI in a total digestion reaction volume of 20 ul. We incubated the digestion at 37°C for 3 hours. We also applied this protocol for B0015 plasmid (taken from -20°C freezer) in order to have a negative control.
NOTE: we expected to find an insert length of 3.2 Kb (I732017+B0015) if the ligation had worked, while we expected an insert length of 129 bp (only B0015) if it had not worked. We decided not to check the length of the inserts because the scaffold vector was about 3.2 Kb long and we could not separate it from the insert without a long gel run...but after a long run, the 129 bp fragment might be lost!
For this reason, we decided to perform a run for the entire linearized plasmids to discriminate a 6.4 Kb fragment from a 3.3 Kb fragment.
Gel run for the six digestions.
Digestion screening results: A3-1 is the most pure plasmid.
Gel results: A3-1, A3-2 and A3-3 show the expected size of a correctly ligated linearized plasmid...but they show an unexpected identical heavy band, especially A3-2 and A3-3. In addition, the brightest bands of A4 and A5 are two and show a completely wrong size, different from B0015 lane, which corresponds to the expected size of a non ligated plasmid. Even A4 and A5 show an unexpected identical heavy band...All the heavy bands had a constant shift from the brightest bands.
Maybe they are nicked DNA, but if you read this notebook and you have a different explanation, please e-mail: lorenzo.pasotti@unipv.it ...thank you:)
Next reactions will be performed with A3-1, which is the most pure colony.
Meeting for wiki planning.

Each hybrid promoter is repressible by two of the following three transcriptional repressors LacI, cI and TetR. Only in case neither of the two repressor is present, transcription of genes underlying the control of the hybrid promoter can start.
PR derived promoter
The region upstream the -10 region of the PR derived promoters was conserved while the operator site of TetR or LacI was incorporated upstream to the -10 region [Kinkhabwala2008].

PL derived promoter
Fig.4.: PL promoter repressible by TetR and LacI.
The -35 and -10 regions of the PL derived promoters were conserved while the operator sites of TetR was incorporated between the -35 and  -10 region and the LacI binding sites downstream the -10 region. We decided to test two variants of that specific promoter. They differ only on the Lac operator composition.
3. Modified PL promoter with operator sites TetO2 and LacO1
Output: PABA
We constructed one pab operon consisting of the pabA and pabB/C gene from Lactococcus lactis to overexpress PABA. Therefore we used the biobrick parts BBa_K137055 and BBa_S04039 as a template to construct the wished composites.
Biobrick BBa_K909014 will be used to show that PABA is produced. In that case  the pab operon is controled by the constitutive promoter J23100 while the BBa_K909015 operon can be cloned downstream to any promoter. We will clone the ladder operon downstream of the PL promoter with operator sites TetO2 and LacO1 to incorporate the pab genes into our system.

The Strategies of Biocontainment of Genetically Modified Organisms
We discussed with Fankang Meng, who was a researcher in synthetic biology, about the biosafety of our project, and the general strategies of biocontainment of genetically modified organisms. We then sorted out and concluded our discussion contents into several aspects, wishing to provide suggestions on biosafety for iGEMers in the future.
To eradicated the escaping problem of genetically modified organisms and horizontal gene transfer between artificial and natural organisms, we highlighted three kinds of biocontainment strategies: traditional biocontainment strategies, the orthogonalization of central dogma and the design of complex genetic networks. [2]
1.Traditional Biocontainment strategies:
Figure 1. Established biocontainment strategies of genetically modified organisms (A)Auxotroph; (B) simple kill switches; (C) inducible gene switch to control essential gene; (D) gene flow barrier
1.1 Auxotroph:
There are some genes that regulate the produce of some molecules necessary for cells. The bacteria with these genes knocked out can survive only if they can absorb these essential molecules from the culture medium. If the bacteria escape into the environment, they will not grow and survive due to the lack of essential molecules.
1.2 Simple Kill switches:
The genome of the bacteria was modified to contain the kill switches controlled by inducible promoters. In the controlled environment exist some molecules which can repress the expression of the kill gene, and the cells can grow and reproduce.

In our growth assay, we looked for large, healthy colonies as well as strong fluorescence, indicators of robust growth and desired expression levels.
From our combinatorial approach towards the construction of the stress-responsive feedback system, we were able to obtain big, healthy green colonies growing on our plates. The observation of big colonies indicated that our cells were healthy and not experiencing any apparent cellular stress. The high levels of GFP observed in the colonies indicated that cells were expressing enough ToxR chimera to strongly drive transcription of the ctx promoter (Pctx).  Since we saw colonies that were big and green, we claim to have successfully resolved the toxicity of ToxR fusion proteins enabling strong transcriptional output while minimizing cellular stress.
We picked big green colonies and found that cultures showed improved fluorescence and OD with respect to pBAD promoters. In other experiments, we found that Lambda-Rep provided a better fluorescent signal so we replaced the IILK domain with Lambda-Rep in both the pBAD and Pstress, grew them in the same arabinose conditions and measured OD600 and RFU with a Tecan plate reader every five minutes. The as with IILK, ToxR-Lambda-Rep chimeras show improved fluorescence, reduced toxcity, and cells harboring this plasmid behave much more predictably.
From our results thus far, we were able to:
-Characterize a library of stress promoters from the E. coli genome, providing data that they function as stress-responsive downregulators
-Create an off-the-shelf negative feedback expression system using our stress promoters that enables the expression of toxic proteins to their highest non-toxic levels, solving our problem of ToxR chimera toxicity
-Demonstrated our proof of principle biosensing system by creating constitutively dimerizing ToxR chimeras that drive transcription off of the ctx promoter (Pctx)
Having achieved our goal of testing our proof of principle, we were ready to construct inducible homodimerizing systems.
Once we had successfully expressed a ToxR chimera that demonstrated constitutive transcription off Pctx we were ready to design a system that could be inducible, and thus a more useful biosensor. We set out to find a ligand dependent homodimer, and after an extensive literature search, we decided to use the Estrogen Receptor. We chose the Estrogen receptor because it fulfilled the criteria of being a homodimer and dependant on Estradiol for dimerization. Furthermore,  it has"

STOP… Collaborate and listen
The WashU-PSU iGEM team collaborated with a few teams over the summer and early fall. Listed below are each team we collaborated with and how we helped each other out.
Cardiff University iGEM :
In order to validate our measurements for our ATP constructs, we sent them our ATP producing plasmid constructs (pck and pgk) to be tested in their state of the art technology, the Biospace Lab PhotonIMAGER.
See their data on our results page
Vilnius iGEM :
Vilnius recreated our characterization of HSP BBa_K873002 and confirmed our results. We gave them our protocol and helped them through the procedure.
UNL iGEM :
We were mentors this summer to the  first iGEM team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. UNL iGEM's project involved engineering bacteria to denitrify water. This goal compliments our project, so the relationship was a good fit.
We...
Provided them with water from the Mississippi river to test for nitrates
Helped them find funding sources by putting them in contact with Monsanto and our other sponsors
Met up at the Heartland iGEM Meetup and exchanged presentation and project tips
Gave them many HP resources and contacts, like the Iowa Soybean Association and St. Louis Waterworks
Helped each other through the wiki freeze crunch time
We were so happy to have worked with them throughout the summer and are in awe of how hard they worked and what they accomplished!

PCR reaction & purification of gBlock 1 (14-3-3 dimer + GFP).
Double digestion & ligation.
Colony picking & Colony PCR.
CT33/CT52
First attempt of the double digestion showed inconclusive results, so a second PCR reaction was set up.
Colony PCR of ligation 12-07
Expression of CT33 did not go as smoothly as planned, so an arabinose tune experiment was set up to test several temperatures for expression.
Week 17 - 24/07 - 28/07
14-3-3
Small culture of 14-3-3 tetramer with GFP from week 16.
Sequencing of culture of 14-3-3 tetramer with GFP from week 16.
Transformation into BL21 and NovaBlue.
CT33/CT52
New attempt of double digestion, but with higher concentrations.
Protein expression of CT33 with conditions as found in the arabinose tune experiment in week 16.
August - Work Work Work
New design for the CT33 construct: a hairpin might be the problem, because of this the strep-tag is not expressed, making protein purification impossible. Addition of amino acids to prevent this hairpin via Liu PCR, we also designed a new gBlock. New gBlocks for 14-3-3 (no GFP, shorter constructs, so maybe this is easier to work with) also came in and we tried to make this Gibson Assembly work.
Week 18 - 31/07 - 04/08
CT33/CT52
Protein purification of expression of CT33 from week 17. However, SDS analysis showed that the protein was not in the elution fraction, but more in the washing and loading fractions.
Again, double digestion. This time including negative control and taking more samples to see where it went wrong. SDS page shows promising results for CT52.
Transformation of CT33 plasmid into NovaBlue for amplification. However, this failed several times. No colonies were seen on the plate.
Design of new primers for LIU PCR. A hairpin is probably formed, preventing the streptag to be translated and thus giving a protein without a tag -> hard to purify. 1 amino acid and 5 amino acids are added via LIU PCR.
Design of new gBlocks for CT33: CT33-mCherry-StrepTag and CT33-StrepTag-mCherry to prevent hairpin problems.

- Investigate public’s opinions towards synthetic biology
- Educate basic biology to kids
Description
We arranged workshops on DNA models and DNA extraction in the “Summer Science Party 2017” organized by the Hong Kong Science Park.
Achievement
Although the target audience are children from 4 to 12, we were able to receive feedbacks from parents regarding to their understanding of synthetic biology and genetically modified organisms.
There are 79 parents doing surveys. Out of them, 58% claimed to have knowledge about GMOs.  Not only they 63% know that the gene inside organism is changed, equal percent also viewed that GMOs greatly affects ecosystem followed by 54% who voiced GMO negatively affect human health  (put charts/ data)
Whereas actually there is no valid proof that GM food is harmful to human health. The misconceptions that GM food is harmful is possibly due to research bias or rumours. This could be a major barrier to the development of synthetic biology.
From this science park event, we got a number of facebook followers, majority are participants from the event. We continued to write a short article sharing knowledge about synthetic biology from the small group of facebook followers to a larger group of public, hoping people can engage with scientific world with more thoughtful point of view.

Goettingen,2016,Team:Goettingen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," domain linked to a signal for a Twin Arginine Transporter (Tat) mediated export. While the B12-binding domain (obviously) binds the vitamin, the export signal allows the protein-vitamin complex to leave the cytoplasm via the Tat system. In the following section, we will have a further look on these components.
The Tat export pathway and its signal peptide
In bacteria and archaea, proteins located outside the cytoplasm can reach their destination via either the Sec or the Tat (twin-arginine translocation) export pathway. While the Sec system translocates proteins in an unstructured state, the Tat apparatus has the unusual property of transporting fully folded proteins (Palmer and Berks, 2012). This system is very flexible in regard to the types of proteins that can be exported and the number of exported proteins highly differs between organisms. The E. coli Tat system is capable of transporting substrates up to 70 Å in diameter (Berks et al.., 2000). Many exported proteins containing non-covalently bound cofactors use this pathway, because the cofactor is held in place by the protein folding. The Tat pathway is only used by proteins containing certain types of cofactors that are classified as metal-sulphur clusters or nucleotide based cofactors, which include among others also cobalamins (Berks et al.., 2003). Therefore, our B12-bound Synporter should be able to be exported using this pathway.
Proteins are targeted to the Tat apparatus by N-terminal signal peptides that are normally cleaved by an externally facing signal peptidase (Lüke et al.., 2009). The overall architecture is similar to Sec signal peptides and includes a tripartite structure with a basic n region at the N terminus, a hydrophobic h region in the middle and a polar c region at the C terminus. The key element of a Tat signal peptide is the highly conserved twin-arginine motif, defined as SRRXFLK. The two arginines are almost always invariant, while the other residues occur with a frequency of > 50 %. The amino acid at position X is usually polar (Palmer and Berks, 2012). For our Synporter we chose the TorA signal peptide from the trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase from E. coli, a well characterized protein exported via the Tat system. Using this signal peptide, it has already been achieved to export a heterologous protein normally transported by the Sec pathway through the Tat system (Christó"

Methods: Approaching Our Project
As C. elegans is a multi-celleular organism, developing a concrete approach to our project required extensive research and planning. This section outlines our general methodology to tackling the bioremediation concept.
The Nose: Chemotaxis Mechanism
After narrowing down our project idea, the first step we took was to research compounds and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) our worm could use to detect pollutants. Since our team consisted of students from across Canada, members of our team were aware of the issues surrounding the development of the Oil Sands in Western Canada, which was part of the rationale for the project. We therefore chose to work with GPCRs which bind chemicals present in pollutants such as those found in the Oil Sands.
Below are the GPCRs our team worked with, in BioBrick form.
Rattus novergicus- NPY1R_Rat
Mus musculus- NPY1R_Mus

Homo sapiens- OX1R
back to top
The Nerves:
Since C. elegans is a multicellular organism, we needed to make sure our non-native GPCR was expressed in the neurons that would stimulate our worm to move towards the ligand.

Then, we kept the promoter of the native GPCR and substituted the rest of the protein with our foreign GPCR. Hence,"

We also performed preliminary investigation on the effects of temperature extremes on the CpxR promoter but the results were inconclusive and thus warrant further studies, possibly by future Leeds iGEM teams. Listed below is the data for detergent and pH extremes. We note that the response of the Cpx pathway to temperature has been characterized previously in the literature and by Calgary 2010 .
Triton X-100
Between the concentration values of 0.1-9.0% triton X-100, the data shows roughly the relationship that was expected, a rise in GFP production as the triton concentration increases. This is likely due to triton acting as a detergent resulting in damage to the plasma membrane of cells, activating the Cpx pathway in general, including the CpxR promoter ( pCpxR ). Past 10% Triton X-100 concentration, it is assumed that cells are dying in large quantities, being unable to produce GFP at all or in very limited amounts before they are killed. This explains the corrected fluorescence readings reducing to below zero.
The reason for the large spike in fluorescence at Triton concentrations >20% is unclear, a possible explanation for this is the total lysis of the cell, expelling all cellular components resulting in background GFP levels having a larger fluorescence reading due to reduced scattering from within the cell.
It is most important to note that this is preliminary data, from fluorescence based measurments, hence it is expected that with sufficiently high repeat readings, the trends proposed will clarify further. This would again be suggested extension work for future teams.
Membrane Stress - (Fluorescence) Atomic Force Microscopy
Atomic Force Microscopy utilises Van-Der-Waals forces to attract the tip towards a surface, causing the bending of a cantilever, onto which a laser is pointed. The tip deflection causes the laser light to also be deflected and this is tracked using a bank of photodiodes. AFM is typically used to image surfaces at the atomic scale, as well as for Force Spectroscopy. When used in Force Spectroscopy, the tip is brought into direct contact with the sample, allowing the sample protein to bind to the silicon tip. Then, the AFM is slowly retracted at varying speeds or to varying distances, applying a force to the protein. This causes portions of the protein to unravel, and the distinct patterns"

Design
Aim of the construct
We'll try out 35s->GAL4->HAP1GR->H2BmRFP.
Since H2BmRFP has not been tried in Mp, we'll also try 35s->H2BmRFP. A positive control for lab technique will be 35s->Venus N7
We'll also use FF's original plasmid to try 35s-Hap1GR-mRFP, as a control for the Hap1GR. I expect low transformation rate as in the original plasmid, we're using 35s as promoter for HygR selection marker.
Not sure whether 35s->Gal4 has been tried (check with BP), so 35s-Gal4-venus n7 is doable with BP's construct as a control
As another control, we'll try 35s-Gal4-H2mRFP

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

ETH_Zurich,2018,Team:ETH Zurich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," under the control of pOmpC (BBa_K2845007), we were able to present thorough characterization.
We participated in an InterLab study from the iGEM team Marburg, mentored a team from Rio de Janeiro and coordinated our project with the team from Utrecht. Find out more on our Collaborations webpage.
For Human Practices , we consulted not only experts but also engaged with critical audiences like Greenpeace and the general public to evaluate the societal benefit of our project.
Gold
From the beginning of our project we integrated the knowledge of experts into the design and workflow of our project. After learning about general concerns (i.e. the containment of GMOs) by the public, we went on and integrated these insights into the design of our robot. For this, we collaborated with the Department for Safety, Security, Health and Environment of our university and refined the mechanical specifications of our robot. Furthermore, we investigated possible options for biological containment systems which can, in the future, be integrated into our biosensors. Learn More
First, each part of our system was modeled separately with the help of experimental data to guide the design of our project. This includes not only the biological biosensor systems but also all mechanical parts of our project ranging from molecule uptake over image processing up to source localization algorithms. Subsequently, we integrated all components into an overall model which allowed us to capture the behavior of our entire system.
At the very end of our project, we were more than happy to see that not only in theory (i.e. in our models) but also in reality, our robot was able to navigate only by the input given from cell-imaging data. Find out more .
Achievements
Hardware
We designed, assembled and tested a LCCSM (Low Cost Casing System for Microscopy) which allows brightfield imaging with a resolution down to single-cell level on a small platform like AROMA. Furthermore, it also provides a modular platform for the assembly of a lensless or luminescence microscope .
For the operation of genetically modified bacteria in the field, we designed a robotic platform, which enables the integration of cell-based biosensors onto a robotic device by directly processing their output in an elegant way .
The heart of our system is a microfluidic chip which we developed to control the encountering of our engineered bacteria with bubbled medium, while allowing an easy readout by our microscope.
To control the medium exchange on our robotic device, we designed our own DIY syringe pumps.
For the mass transfer of the target molecule from air into medium, we designed and built a bubbling device , allowing the integration"

We talked to Prof.Charles CANTOR and took his advices about our project and iGEM.
Kick off Of Summer Meetings (14th June) : We are starting to work on our project again.
In our first meeting in summer we have discussed how our program will work, how to categorize the algorithm, how to extract information from Parts Registry 2011 distribution, how our GUI should look like, and decide a few options about it and we have have made the distribution of tasks (parts database translation, database search algorithm, software and GUI, website design and presentation, sponsorship).
All individual teams are working now. We will meet again by the early July. Biologists started to find input-output relationships. They are using a simple program developed by one of our advisors ,Sassan, with an interface for entering parts relation in a tab delimited text files. These files are processed by our team developer to be in used in our main program.
Software developers are discussing how they will design the algorithm's first part.
July 2011
Biologists are revealing the connections between bioparts one by one for all the plates in iGEM 2011 distribution.  The relations between bioparts, subparts and subdevices are investigated to form a connection database that is used for M4B to find pathways. The input-output datas in the plates is shared with the software developers. They are planning to complete this job in the middle of the July.
Developers continue improving the algorithm's first part.  They are also working on a database where all the XML information of 2011 distribution will be locally downloaded for easy access.
12th June: We test the algorithm for the first time.
We discussed different program names and at last we decided on Mining For Biobricks (M4B). Our design team is now working on our team and program logo. They are offering us different alternatives.  We began to discuss our wiki design.
August 2011
Our software developers worked on scoring and GUI. We decided how our GUI should look like. We brainstormed about the scoring of the constructed devices and we discussed which information is more important for scoring.

I've currently finished my license (Bachelor) in biotechnology and I'm about to join the AIV (Interdisciplinary approaches to life science) Masters. I discovered synthetic biology with the Craig Venter's paper (released in may 2010). After that, my school gave me a 5 month research & information processing project on synthetic biology. Through this project I've discovered the iGEM competition and the opportunities surrounding the emergence of this science filed. Enrolling in an iGEM team will give me a sight of how synthetic biology experimentations are, and also, to work with people who are interested in this science too.

ADOPE
The aim of ADOPE is to develop a complete method for gene doping detection. The final method consists of four main steps: sample preparation, prescreening, targeted library preparation and DNA sequencing and analysis.
Figure 1. A flow diagram of our detection method ADOPE. With the four steps sample preparation, prescreening, library preparation and sequencing.
1. Sample Preparation
In the sample preparation module we developed a workflow to extract the target DNA from blood. As a proof of concept, we verified the extraction of the cell free DNA (cfDNA) from bovine serum. Finally, we successfully extracted gene doping DNA that we spiked to the serum, guided by the concentration value generated by the gene doping model.

(as part of a preventive program supported by the Indian Ministry of Health). The sample will be analyzed by Dr. Mishra using light microscopy as the current standard for diagnosis of T. solium in India. The remaining sample is used to test a prototype of our diagnostic test platform. First, we will evaluate, whether our sensor system will be a suitable option for the rapid diagnosis of T. solium within an Indian diagnostic laboratory. Secondly, we plan to gather more material of tapeworms to generate molecular data for basic research or eventually, refinement of our own test. Next to validating our test, this study aims to evaluate the epidemiology of tapeworm infections in India. Once completed, it will be the third largest clinical study examining the prevalence of T.solium in India.
NTD Lab
Our Approach to NTDs
The aim of our project, facilitating diagnosis of T. solium infection, is a topic set within the field of synthetic biology, but with connections to many other domains. The targeted infection is listed as one of the 20 communicable diseases that are mostly affecting poor populations – a neglected tropical disease (NTDs). Stopping the spread of such diseases is thus not only a matter of medical progress, but also of an improved education, higher hygiene and sanitation standards as well as of more equitable communities. This also means that the challenge of NTDs is not only taken on by biologists and physicians! Politicians, health workers and NGOs as well as the private sector have for a long time made efforts to eliminate these diseases. With the NTD lab, our team aimed to bring all these players together to discuss how innovation in the field of these poverty-associated diseases could look like.
On the 17th of May 2017, we thus invited more than 100 participants to the premises of the Humboldt Graduate School. The event was split into two main parts: in an interactive “project fair”, our team presented its work to the participants next to projects of NGOs such as the Christoffel Blindenmission (CBM) or of other scientific institutes such as HTW Berlin. After a reception, a panel discussion with eminent speakers ensued. We were happy to welcome Dr. Georg Kippels (member of the parliament), Prof. Dr. KH Martin Kollmann (member of the advisory board of DNTDs and scientific advisor to the CBM Kenya), Dr. Joachim Klein (German Ministry for Research and Education), Dr. Maria-Luisa Rodriguez"
Edinburgh_UG,2018,Team:Edinburgh UG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," non-maxicells, as the half-life would no longer be intrinsically tied to the rate of division; in normal cells the level of protein halves at every cell-division. The protein levels within maxicells would therefore be solely dependent on protein export and degradation rate. These values were unknown in maxicells, as they have an altered metabolism, so we sought to determine the overall protein levels using SDS-PAGE and compare them at different time-points. As with ATP quantification, this was performed at 4 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C.
Functional Gene Expression
The above characterisations give us some idea of how long maxicells can operate, but we considered that there may be another, unknown factor that affects their functionality. As a definitive test to determine their functional lifespan, we decided to insert a construct into our maxicell instructor plasmid to see how well it can express a gene after a given time. We settled on two constructs:
ars-mCherry - the fluorescent protein mCherry under control of an arsenite inducible promoter
araC-mCherry - mCherry under an arabinose promoter
The added benefit of using these parts was to test how effectively our maxicells can function as a biosensor; in these cases for arsenic and arabinose. This would be a characterisation of how well maxicells actually work in the field, for one of their potential applications. We planned to transform the maxicell producing E. coli strain CSR603 with these constructs and then induce mCherry expression with arsenic or arabinose after 18 hours, 19 hours and 24 hours. This would give us a better idea of how long they can survive and still have the potential for gene expression.
The Triple Lock System
Colicin Kill Switch
As the first ‘lock’ in our triple lock system, the function of the colicin kill switch is to prevent the instructor plasmid from being released from the maxicell into the               environment in the first place. This 2-part system was inspired by Darmstadt 2016 iGEM team, but altered and optimised for use in maxicells. The kill switch works by the action of colicin E2, a nicking endonuclease which cuts single and double stranded DNA at random sites. The counterpart to E2 is Imm2; an immunity protein which binds to E2 and inhibits its endonuclease activity. Imm2 binds in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, so if the level of"

Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab."

Cell War
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Game is an excellent learning platform. Once involved, the profound theory and knowledge beneath the game will be absorbed subconsciously. An interesting game will stimulate the players’ imagination, rise their interests in related topics. Imagine a boy coming across an amazing sci-fi game, the scene of space battle and high-tech shuttles will stay in his mind for weeks, just like seeding a future of science, technology, universe or even literature. We believe that, spreading the interest in medic and science with joy is more efficient than merely spreading knowledge, so why not use game as a platform to spread our passions? To spread the idea of our project, we created a novel board game, Cell War. The game is based on solid medical and biological knowledge, so playing indeed is learning. Various fantasy and sci-fi elements are incorporated to attain joyful game experiences. After half a year’s exploring, we even designed several versions of Cell War for varying players, and the one version we bring to you is a delicate multiplayer board game, friendly for both veterans and green hands. The game has become a symbol of our human practice project as well as our team, representing the creative spirits of iGEMers. Here, we invite you to join our journey with Cell War.
Origin
Initially we thought about making tour speeches around Shanghai to help people learn more about immunotherapy, cell engineering and cancer related information. But teaching by speaking is really not a choice satisfying enough for us. We want people to explore the knowledge of cancer immunotherapy in a friendly way. We want to engage the public. And we want to inspire the future. After several times of intensive group meeting and brainstorming, a bold but impressive idea was brought up: To design a game.
At the outset, the game was crude. We simply copied rules from some of the most famous board games. It was much easier than developing a brand new one, but it existed big problems: borrowed forms are rarely incongruous with our"

- are not human-, phyto- or animalpathogen
- do not contain or release organisms containing to a higher risk stage
- are approved by experiments or long term evaluation or do not proliferate in the enviroment because of biological implanted boundaries
2. Organisms, which confirm the paragraph 1, are defined by §6 of the act of genetics (GenTSV):
a) as biological safe organisms
b) as organisms or strains, which are not contaminated by organisms or strains of a higher security level
c) organisms defined by the risk level S1 (list of organisms used for genetically engineering research)
The list of organisms categorize the strains E. coli K12  and A. tumefaciens as biological safety risk 1 (S1). The strain A. tumefaciens is a known phytopathogen. Because of its frequent appearence on earth (500 bacteria in 1 g of soil) it is generally regarded as safe.
The WHO defines ""security assessments"" has the highest priority for the work with organisms. This includes a proper theoretically background of the organism. Further the WHO defines rules for good molecular practice and proper lab security ( WHO Manual Biosafety, page 9 following ). They note that most of the security guidelines are not quite necessary for organisms of risk stage 1. Anyway, we play by the rules and work as carefully as possible (compare: what we do to protect ).

Worldshaper-Nanjing,2017,Team:Worldshaper-Nanjing#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," coli as a model instead of synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to test our assumptions. We quickly validated most of our design in E.coli cooperated with team of ASTWS-China.
5. And another remarkable work done by our team is that we designed and made a prototype of device for algae cultivation. Compared to the flask culture method, it has some obvious advantages including less cost, more biomass and more efficiency of space usage. Moreover it’s easier to be scaled up from lab to factory.
Of course, there’s lots of validation work left and optimization work to do in future, here we listed most of the important works we plan to do.
1. The results showed that the gene expression level in this algae is much lower than other commonly used chassis. We plant to cellect and screen as much parts as possible for this new chassis to promote the gene expression. And the codon optimisations for target genes might also be critical for their expressions as said by some references.
2. We have already expressed two carbon fixation genes in this algae and verified by PCR and western-blot, but there is still lack of direct evidence that this engineered algae has been improved its ability of photosynthesis or carbon fixation. And there are other genes involved in agar or cellulose synthesis, which might be much more suitable for our project. These validation or optimization works also need to be done in future.
3. Another important work that need to be done is the experiments of metal binding and sinking using synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 directly.
4. Finally is the work about the prototype of our cultivation device. We will test this device in a larger scale throuth parallel connection of numerous single devices or scale up the size of single device. And we will test the ‘sinking assumption’ of our transgenetic algae in a simulate environment of ocean using this scaled-up device.

Waterloo,2016,Team:Waterloo#Integrated Practices#Networks_-_-_TEXT.html," Wiki: Wiki pages provide teams with a space to communicate their project to others and make a case for how they have met criteria.  The general requirements of a wiki are project overview, project design, project results, and medal criteria checklist.  All iGEM teams are given a namespace on the iGEM wiki with their team name, and teams are allowed to create and edit pages solely within their respective team namespace.   iGEM HQ refers to wikis as the “public-facing representation” of a team’s project, stating that wikis should be understandable by  non-scientists as well as by judges who are not familiar with projects prior to the judging phase.
Methods:
The full method for how the data spreadsheet will be explicitly described below. Each column within the collaboration network data spreadsheet was gathered from multiple locations in iGEM’s publicly available website from last year’s competition.
First, each of the 2015 iGEM teams was distributed evenly between all members of the “Helping Practices of Science and Engineering” Policy and Practices subteam. Next, the website: https://2015.igem.org/Results was visited which gave some necessary information for populating our spreadsheet. In this webpage, a list of every iGEM team’s proper name was listed, as well as their respective medal colour and any “special awards” won. Special awards were distributed in a variety of categories from “Best Poster” to “Best Integrated Human Practices”. In the spreadsheet, the column “Donor” was filled with the team’s name, the “(Donor) Medal Colour” with the medal earned, the “Special Award(s)? (Yes/No)” with a Yes or No binary response, and the “Name of Special Awards” with the specific award(s) won, if any.
Two links were then consulted from the Results webpage. These were the official team profile and the team’s Wiki. The official team profile provided the basic information such as the proper registered name of the team, the country and continent they were from, as well as the team size or any auxiliary team members. With the given information on this page, the “(Donor) Country” column, the “(Donor) Continent” column, the “(Donor) Team size - Student Members” column, and the “(Donor) Team size - Auxiliary Members” column were able to be recorded. There are multiple headings for team members depending on how they contributed to their respective iGEM team. It was decided that the “Student Members” heading would correspond to our “(Donor) Team size"
UCL,2016,Team:UCL#amandeep#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," high quality of life depends on healthy ageing. We all aspire to a long and healthy lives in old age, but we know that older people are at increased risk of disease and disability that can seriously affect quality of life for them and their families.
Healthy ageing is about “optimising opportunities for good health, so that older people can take an active part in society and enjoy an independent and high quality of life” [2].
Ageing is not necessarily a burden, and it doesn’t decrease a person’s ability to contribute to society. By showcasing some practical synthetic biology solutions to healthy ageing, interacting with the society, talking to politicians, religious leaders and policy makers we hope to that UCL iGEM can make healthy ageing a reality.
An ageing themed project has never been explored before on iGEM and we are really excited to build new systems that solve the issues of the ageing population as well as add to the registry and be one of the first people to propose synthetic biology solutions to ageing!

The Improved Flip Flop (Part: BBa_K510019 and Part: BBa_K510036 ) is based on the basic flip flop (Part: BBa_K177038 ) and was built with devices which are in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. As for the different sequences used in our construction, here it is a brief description of each one:
cI promoter (Part: BBa_R0051 ): The cI regulated promoter is based on the pR promoter from bacteriophage lambda. The promoter has two DNA binding sites for lambda cI repressor BBa_C0051. cI binding results in repression of transcription. The specific sequence used here is based on the cI repressible promoter used in the Elowitz repressilator (and references therein).
Lac promoter (Part: BBa_R0010 ): This part is an inverting regulator sensitive to LacI and CAP. It contains two protein binding sites. The first binds CAP protein, which is generally present in E.coli and is associated with cell health and availability of glucose. The second one binds LacI protein.
RBS.3 medium (Part: BBa_B0032 ):This part is a weak RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis.
LacI: Our LacI was taken from E. coli strain K-12 substrain MG1655 chromosome genome and it has a total of 1083 bp.
GFP (Part: BBa_E0040 ): Green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish Aequeora victoria wild-type GFP.
DAS+4: Short tag at the end of the proteins. For more information see Figure 2 of Proteolysis section.

Background
コンストラクトはiGEMプロジェクトの最も重要な部分である。  iGEMerは他チームのコンストラクトを理解し、自チームのプロジェクトの目的を達成するコンストラクトを設計しなければならない。そのためには、遺伝子回路の原理を理解する必要がある。  さらに、設計した遺伝子回路の応答を予測するためには、そのダイナミクスをモデル化して計算しなければならない。そのためには、モデル化の考え方を理解する必要がある。
これらの点において、現状では次のような障壁があると考える。
問題点①
遺伝子回路のダイナミクスを学ぶにはシステム生物学の教科書を開けば良いのだが、それを理解するためには、微分方程式を用いた生化学反応のモデル化をきちんと理解しなければならなかった。これは多くのiGEM入門者にとっては敷居が高いものである。
問題点②

Measuring data for BIT-China
When iGEMers from BIT-China asked us whether we could allow them to use our Cytation Multi-Mode readers to monitor the gcolumnth state and fluorescence emissions of their engineered yeast, we agreed without hesitation. BIT-China wanted to detect both OD and fluorescence intensity simultaneously for up to 30 hours to evaluate the function of their yeast. With our help, they needn’t get up and take samples early in the morning but can obtain a much larger amount of data, saving them trouble and improving the reliability.

Air Samples Testing for ICT-Mumbai
ICT-Mumbai is working on dealing with the problem of excessive ammonia in toilets and chemistry labs. They contacted us via email after reading our abstract and found out that we both deal with excessive ammonia. We collected air samples from the toilets and chemistry laboratories in Huairou Campus of UCAS, and assayed them following their standardized protocol. We are glad that this data is helpful for improving ICT-Mumbai’s project.

Mentoring a New Team HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou
Every year, there will be some newly established teams in iGEM. As beginners on this rough ride, they might encounter many difficulties and need of help. HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is one of those iGEM teams this year. We paved the way for this newly established team by mentoring them, offering some advice and guidance on their project design and troubleshooting their circuits. In addition, we taught them DNA cloning methods like Golden Gate Assembly and helped them construct biobricks. This year, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou is focusing on removing excessive nitrite in canned food. Wish them good results!
