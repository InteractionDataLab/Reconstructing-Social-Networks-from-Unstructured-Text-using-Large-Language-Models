Due to the modelling, the higher the histamine concentration is, the faster yeast will respond and so is the protein degradation rate. So we made a prediction that the EGFP expression rate would positively correspond to histamine concentration in a certain time period after histamine induction.
Based on the above assumptions, we chose to induce the modified yeast already cultured to logarithm phase in medium lacking His, Trp, Leu and Ura. Then a histamine concentration gradient was made by adding a diverse range of histamine solution to the culture medium. According to medical research, the histamine concentration in normal human blood is around 30 ng/ml to 60ng/ml, while in allergic people, this concentration would reach 100 ng/ml or even more. We set three group of histamine concentration: 0 ng/ml as control group, 50 ng/ml to simulate the normal concentration and 200 ng/ml to simulate allergic concentration.
According to the test of reporter plasmid, we estimated the expression peak would be between 5 to 10 hours, so we choose 5h, 8h and 11h as three time points to run flow cytometry.
One thing worth mentioning is that due to the low concentration of yeast, we could only set 10 group so as to meet the criterion concentration of FCS.
The group set is as follow:
Table 2. The sample loading order
The concentration of yeast is around 100000 cell/ml (measured by OD600). We pick 10000 events inside the gate for each sample during FCS.
The FCS result is as follow:
Fig.8 The relative fluorescence intensity of histamine induced yeast
From Fig.8, we can see that at 5 to 8 hours’ culturing, the EGFP expression rate is positively correspond to histamine which certify our theory. When we judge each concentration group separately, it can be assumed that 50 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml group both reach its peak during 5 to 11 hours’ period. The degradation rate of each group is also positive correspond with histamine concentration, since at 11h, the expression level of every induction group has fallen, and the expression rate appears to be rather negative correlated to histamine concentration.
Considering the fact that the reaction time we had estimated for our allergy test kit is around 4 to 5 hours, it turned out that the modified yeast could indeed distinguish between allergic state blood serum and normal blood serum.

Based on this point, our international collaboration is a mutual exchange of knowledge and understanding of the policies regarding commercialization of science between China and Canada. The format of our exchange is making a handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in our home countries, in order to improve our understanding of the differences on related laws between China and Canada.
The handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in China made by our team member Luyu Jia contains the following contents: General Definition and Classification, Patent Law, Trademark Law, Copyright Law, and Trade Secrets. For the full handbook, click me.
Teams helped us:
1. TMMU_China
The assistance provided by TMMU_China mainly focused on the inhibition zone test. The inhibition test towards target microbes Staphylococcus aureus (Foot odor pathogen), Bacillus subtilis (Foot odor pathogen), Klebsiella pnuemoniae (Quality control strain), Escherichia coli (Quality control strain), Enterococcus faecalis (Quality control strain), Microsporum canis (Tinea Pedis pathogen) and Trichophyton rubrum (Tinea Pedis pathogen) were performed by TMMU_China. Unfortunately, they failed at the process of protein purification, which means the test was failed, but we still appreciate their effort on helping us.
2. IngenuityLab_Canada
In correspondence with the handbook introducing the laws on intellectual property rights protection in China made by us, iGEM team IngenuityLab_Canada designed a similar handbook introducing related laws in Canada, which broaden our internationalized horizon on intellectual property laws. For the full handbook made by them, click me.
3. SCUT-China_A
In order to help us while we were trapped at the bottleneck of the process of CecropinXJ prokaryotic expression, they provided us three specialized E.coli BL21 strain (RIPL, Rosetta and pGr07).
RIRL and Rosetta contain rare tRNA in the strain and pGr07 contains plasmid coding molecular chaperones for protein folding. pGr07 is applied in the CecropinXJ expression part in our project.
However, even we used three specialized E.coli BL21 strain (RIPL, Rosetta and pGr07) provided by SCUT-China_A, the results are still not ideal. Further experiments are required."

Secondly, the recombination fragment obtained from OE-PCR was transformed to the CEN.PK2-1C which has been already knocked out the endogenous genes ura, his and trp. Additionally, the colony was chosen by the relevant nutritional deficiency medium.
verification
To verify whether the gene was actually knocked out and to avoid false positive colonies, we designed primer1, 2, 3 and 4 for each gene, as shown in Fig.2. The primer 1 and primer 4 were designed according to the yeast genome. The primer 2 was designed according to the selection maker and primer 3 was to the gene which would be knocked out.
Fig.2 Verification strategy
We got positive result using the primer 1 and 2, meanwhile the negative result would be detected by using primer 1 and 3. Then we sequenced the PCR product using primer 1 and 4 to further confirm the realness of the results.

History
While molecular biology was established in the 1930s, the term was coined by Warren Weaver in 1938. Weaver was the director of Natural Sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation at the time and believed that biology was about to undergo a period of significant change given recent advances in fields such as X-ray crystallography. He therefore channeled significant amounts of (Rockefeller Institute) money into biological fields.

Policy and Practices Overview
fishPHARM first started as an iGEM summer project, but has quickly evolved into an innovative start-up company with the potential for immediate commencement of commercial operations and a sustained impact in global aquaculture. We have engaged in several entrepreneurial endeavors to facilitate the growth of fishPHARM as not only a project in synthetic biology, but also as a local business venture capable of addressing BCWD globally. We have also partnered with a variety of fish hatcheries and research institutions in the New York State Finger Lakes Region to help move our discoveries beyond the lab bench and meet the demands of a growing consumer market. Through collaborations with these hatcheries, which battle with bacterial coldwater disease on a daily basis, we were able to both better understand the safety implications of deploying our product in an aquacultural setting and compare the economic costs of our product to those of current solutions. fishPHARM is designed directly with the needs of your everyday fish farmer in mind. By collaborating with our consumers , we aim to develop a product that is not only safe and effective, but also practical for treating BCWD in the real world.
Hatchery Collaborations
We were inspired to start fishPHARM after seeing the devastating effects of BCWD in the local fish hatcheries of New York State. Fish hatcheries in the Finger Lakes region constantly deal with BCWD, and we sought to aid the local fish farmers in a more personal way through fishPHARM.
fishPHARM is unique because no iGEM team has ever shared a collaboration with fish hatcheries and fish research units. We have collaborated with Bath, NY Hatchery, Rome, NY Hatchery, and the Cornell Biological Field Station in order to take fishPHARM from the lab bench to real-world implementation. We have received a plethora of feedback from fish farmers that has driven us to redesign and improve upon fishPHARM in order to develop the most efficient mechanism to treat BCWD. Our collaborations are detailed below.

Cas9 Mutagenesis Projects
Background
During our research for the fight against Fusarium oxysporum, we encountered literature that suggested the PhlF protein was weakly active without the presence of its inducer. PhlF is a repressor induced by compounds such as fusaric acid and salicylate. In our circuit, its activation triggers a TLP-producing response through a system that represses the off-switch to TLP production. Constitutive weak repressing activity causes the unnecessary metabolic strain of producing TLP in conditions without F. oxysporum. In the interest of reducing this metabolic stress placed upon our bacterial strain of choice, we decided to pursue efforts to modify this protein in order to alter its repression profile. The hope was to create a PhlF protein that would only have repressive activity in the presence of its inducer.
Typically, mutating a protein in hopes of increasing its aptitude for a particular task is difficult and likely to fail. In all likelihood, the selective pressures of evolution will have already selected for the most streamlined, functional variant(s) long ago. The PhlF protein, however, is a multifunctional repressor capable of performing a variety of tasks and responding to multiple stimuli. As such, we reasoned that it may be possible to mutate the protein in such a way that it would be unfit for use in the natural environment,  but ideally suited for our particular application of it in our genetic circuit.
Cas9 Mutagenesis Projects
Design
Cas9 screening method. (A) A target sequence is mutated  in a plasmid containing an antibiotic resistance. (B) The plasmid of interest is transformed  into competent cells with the Cas9/ sgRNA machinery. (C) Expression of Cas9 and its sgRNA that compliments the wild type target sequence is induced. Plasmids mutated in the target region evade Cas9 cleavage. Plasmids retaining the wild type, non-mutated sequence are cleaved by Cas9 and degraded. (D) The transformed bacteria are plated with the selected antibiotic. Cells with mutations in the region of interest maintain antibiotic resistance and survive. Cells without mutations lose their resistance and do not grow.
For the actual process of mutating the phlF gene, we set our sights on altering the operator binding region. This was a small section within the gene and to select for mutants within it we decided to adapt a side project that we had been mulling over. The goal"

Screening for Advantageous Mutants
— a Self-enrichment System
Bioengineering uses stable, highly productive mutants, target strains, which contain foreign genes. However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. We applies synthetic biology methods, constructing a novel pathway to screen mutants by giving target strains growth advantages. Here, utilizing AND gate, the gene of interest expresses to a certain level, making the downstream pchAB gene express and catalyze the generation of salicylic acid（SA）. SA can activate the expression of glucose dehydrogenase, which gives the target strains an additional growth advantage. Besides, we integrate the most important control module of the system into the genome using Chemically Inducible Chromosomal Evolution(CIChE). In summary, the target strain will finally obtain the greatest growth advantage in bacterial suspensions and achieve screening internally. This new screening method is simple to operate and provides a new idea for antibiotic-free screening.

The metal solution in the syringe was titrated into the peptide solution in the cell, and interactions were measured. Raw data were corrected by subtracting the heats of dilution, and collected data were fit with a one-site binding model using the Origin-7™ software.
ITC Results
The results from the ITC experiment to determine binding parameters for peptides 1x-, 2x-, and 3x-HHTC-Re alongside the predicted structure (QUARK Ab Initio program) follows [2]. This program uses Monte Carlo simulations and knowledge of atomic force fields to construct the most probable structural conformation of a protein from just the linear amino acid sequence.
Figure 3: ITC data for the three HHTC-Re peptides. The binding affinity (Ka) was assessed to determine the strength of the interaction, and the results follow: 1x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.55 ± 0.21) x 106 M-1; 2x-HHTC-Re Ka = (3.73 ± 0.53) x 105 M-1; 3x-HHTC-Re Ka = (1.50 ± 0.05) x 105 M-1. Figure design credits to Jesica Urbina.
The binding affinity values in Figure 3 are largely comparable to one another, and we do see a linear trend between the number of HHTC-Re repeats and injections taken to reach saturation, which means that each peptide can bind a linearly increasing amount of copper proportional to the HHTC-Re repeats. This validates our hypothesis underlying our construct design for our fusion proteins, allowing us to bind multiple metals on the same biomolecule. In Figure 4, we can see how the specific subunits maintain proper folding (predicted by QUARK), supporting the notion that they would retain their original functions.
Figure 4: Quark ab initio model of 2x-HHTC-Re with chitin binding domain. Domains within the fusion protein have been annotated to display the conformation and spatial orientation.
After confirming the copper binding of the individual HHTC-Re x n peptides, we then needed to assess whether our fusion protein could bind copper and chitin, and whether it could do so when already saturated with the other substrate. Figure 5 depicts two experiments a) Raw data and b) isotherm for 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg and Cu. In this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to"

    However, 2015 field research shows most external lithic murals, statue, and towers still suffer from damage. Some even have distraction in main stone body. Meanwhile, there grows moss. Indoor stone inscriptions though are visible; there are obvious and irremovable cracks.
     Today, most preservation of lithic relics employ physical, chemical, or engineer approaches no matter where. It has been proven by reality that each of those approaches has fatal disadvantages for long-standing preservation of lithic relics, and those disadvantages would even lead to the ruin of lithic relics.
    Since forever, there are two categories of methods to preserve-- organic and inorganic. Organic materials cannot reach the standard of time to preserve relics such as epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone, etc.; inorganic materials would form hard shell that is not compatible or even react with the lithic relics, such as lime, barium hydroxide, and sulphuric acid.
     In conclusion, finding a long-standing, inexpensive, and efficient method to preserve lithic relics is an impending issue.

Principles of experiments
    The documents cited shows that even after natural weathering, biological decomposition, and acid rain erosion for a time period of time, some stone inscriptions, which are on rock surface containing calcium, remain in good condition because there is a thin layer of naturally formed semitransparent mineralised film that is hydrophilic and compact on such rock surface.
     In some part under the fine film, knife scratches on the stone from over a thousand years ago are still visible indistinctly. According to solid analysis, natural mineralised film is primarily composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate [Ca(COO)2·H2O] whose process of composition is interfered by microorganism.
     There are some advantages of calcium oxalate being a film as follows,
        1) In water, especially in acidulous water, the solubility of calcium oxalate is one order of magnitude smaller than normal calcium carbonate.
        2) Organically oriented calcium oxalate crystal's particles are fine and compact, which prevent the infiltration of toxic and harmful materials.
        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock"

Few cells survives (Fig15. a) after antibiotics screening without transfecting Cre recombinase gene, which means that there is a small possibility that loxp gene can insert into genomes by interior transposase in cells. To find out the optimal ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in the process of transfection, we compared two different ratio, 3:3 (Fig15. b) and 1:3 (Fig15. c), with equal amount of Neomycin-loxp gene but different amount of Cre recombinase gene.(All pictures was captured by Nikon microscope (Nikon TS100) 120 hours after transfection, 600 μg/ml neomycin were added 72hours  screening.
From observation, we know that excess Cre recombinase is not appropriate in transfection process. The most possible reason is that surplus Cre recombinase is harmful for cells, so they may random cut and recombine genes in cell’s genome. Thus, we finally chose 1:3 as the ratio of Cre recombinase gene to Neomycin-loxp gene in transfection.
6. Mutagenesis of TRPC5
Mutation frequency calibration
1. Define ideal mutation frequency
Mutation frequency is the product of DNA polymerase error rate and number of duplications. It depends on initial target amount and fold amplification. Mutation frequencies of 1~4 amino acid changes (2~7 nucleotide changes) per gene are commonly employed.
We have mutated the ankyrin repeats region (734bp length) of TRPC5 by employ 500ng initial tartget and 32 cycle amplification according to the protocol of GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,Catalog #200550).
2. Calibration of mutation frequency by sequencing
To calibrate the mutation frequency in experimental condition, we sequenced 20 mutated TRPC5 samples in the region of ankyrin repeats. The table below shows the correspondence between mutation(s) and sequenced sample numbers.

Achievement
        In 2016, we focused on to control mosquitoes. We cloned various Cry and Cyt toxin genes from LLP29, Bacillus thuringiensis strain. We also constructed Cry and Cyt toxin parts based on option optimization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Meanwhile, we built toxin groups express device based on 2A peptide system. And we tested their toxicity to the larvae of various genus of mosquitoes under the safe lab environment. Considering the potential problems in the natural environment, BNU-China and ZJU-China helped us to build the growth and toxicity model to estimate the natural conditions. To introduce the practical knowledge about how to prevent and control mosquitoes, we designed a handbook covering this topic and sent it to Zambia to help local people who are trouble in mosquitoes. We are proud of our project!

When you were talking about specimens I just want to clarify what did you mean by that?
Dr. Courtright:
Well, in the settings in Ethiopia … I’m trying to remember now what type of specimens they took ...whether they were serum specimens or whether they took swabs. […] I can’t remember right now…but I would guess it would have been swabs simply because taking serum specimens would be much more invasive and would be much more challenging to do. […]
Daniel C.:
Talking about the range of data that is gathered in different regions to assess the chlamydial endemic. How does it look with funding? Is it tight in those programs? Do the decision makers have to decide which approach are we going, because we have to turn each dollar, we have to watch every expense?
Dr. Courtright:
Well, there’s different funding mechanisms in place. From the standpoint of the funding that is made possible through the UK government it is tied to doing impact surveys. And you can learn more about that through a program that is called Tropical Data and it's organized by the WHO. And that Tropical Data is really to provide the tools for doing impact surveys after multiple years of antibiotic treatment. If the prevalence of an area let’s say is 20% an impact survey is indicated after three years of antibiotic treatment. And then the decision on whether to continue treatment or to discontinue is based upon the findings of those surveys. The funding for additional distribution is generally backed in place either UK or US governments. And that’s all fine. The trouble is when we’re talking about like Amhara where it has continued way beyond the anticipated funding envelope there’s a challenge in getting additional money to continue [...]. Donors will say: “Wait a minute we have been paying for this for how many years now?!” For most countries it has not been an issue because they are seeing the prevalence of trachoma drop and so that the donors said: “Ok great, maybe one more year or a couple more years.” There has been no problem with donors bringing up the additional money. The problem has been in a place like Ethiopia where we have been looking at many, many more years of treatment. That’s where we have challenging issues now, that will become even more problematic in the future, if we don’t understand what is going on.

Thank you a lot. We just have one or two final questions, talking about awareness. Can you talk a little bit about how aware people are in the [United] States or western countries in general in contrast to developing countries for example? So is"

The AND operator in general only gives an output when the two inputs recognized in the operator are present. In the design, we considered the possibility that the constitutive promoter could continue with transcription even after getting to the double terminator and to avoid this, we designed the AND construction with the inducible promoter before the constitutive one.
We have two types of AND:
•The Heavy Metals AND: The promoters CzrA/ArsR have something in common, they both sense cadmium. When the two promoters detect cadmium, they would not repress anymore and start transcription of P4 or LasR, and we will know it is working because our bacterium will be red, because of our reporter gene (RFP). The promoters are based in the CadA promoter plus a binding site for ArsR for get a response that depend in both, CzrA and ArsR.
Our CzrA/ArsR
•CzrA/ArsR: This transcription factors are involved in metal homeostasis, each one had affinity for a set of metals[1], the intersection of both sensors is Cadmium[2][3], in this case the proposed input metals will be Zinc for CzrA and Arsenic for ArsR. This TFs acts as repressors in the absence of metals, when there is metal in the cell, the metal binds to the transcription factor and make a conformation change that dissolves the affinity of the protein for their binding sites and let the promoter free to recruit RNA polymerase to start transcription[1].
We have three CzrA/ArsR promoters, one of them was designed by Newcastle team in 2009 ( Part BBa_K174015 ), the two remaining were design by our team based on the previous by Newcastle. Why we need more than one promoter? The part BBa_K174015 has no reported experience, so it could work as it should or not and the way this cadmium sensor was developed allow us to play with the combinatory of binding sites and with the -10 and -35 boxes. The cadmium sensor of Newcastle is -35, -10 and binding sites, our promoters are:
Promoter 1: attta, -35,-10, ArsR binding site overlapping -35, CsrA binding site overlapping TSS, rbs+atg.
Promoter 2: -35, -10, ArsR binding site overlapping after TSS, CzrA overlapping TSS, rbs+atg.

The final time lapse experiment proved that flow rate reduces over length. This is because of channel resistance that slows down the fluid over time. Figure 2 demonstrates reducing flow rate over distance travelled.

Part Improvement
After analyzing the experiment result for our pH-sensing system, we have concluded that we should try to improve the pH-sensing device based on gadA promoter which is constructed by 2016 iGEM Dundee team , PgadA ( BBa_K1962013 ). We found out that although PgadA can be induced under neutral and weak acidic condition, the fluorescence intensity is too low to be observed. We planned to increase the fluorescence intensity and shorten the time interval of induction. Thus, we added a RiboJ sequence at the downstream of the PgadA.
Based on our research, RiboJ was first described as an insulator in genetic construct but there has no any data shown this insulation affected the downstream genetic parts. The mechanism of RiboJ is that the upstream sequence, as well as RiboJ sequence, will cleave after the transcription. The cleavage of promoter and RiboJ sequence aids the design of predictable genetic constructs. The 2016 iGEM William and Mary team has reported that RiboJ could increase the expression of the downstream gene. Hence, we decided to enhance the expression of PgadA by adding RiboJ at the downstream of promoter gadA.
To determine the function and compare the improvement of the parts, we have measured the fluorescence intensity (fluorescence (a.u.) / O.D.600) of the construct with and without RiboJ in different pH environment. We incubated the bacteria in pH adjusted M9 medium and measure the fluorescence intensity (absorbance: 480nm, excitation: 510 nm) in a short period of time. The pH value of M9 medium is adjusted with 1M HCl.

Jordan Berg
The Abridged Biography of Jordan Alexandrius Berg by his omnipotent, coconut-wielding troubadour squire:
A long time ago, in a galaxy surprisingly close to you, occurred the birth and humble beginnings of Jordan Alexandrius Berg on the western shores of the United States. His journeyings eventually brought him to the fair shores of the east coast to his lush, forested home of Georgia. But suddenly his quest brought him to the white mountains of the BYU Provo area where he would learn how to be a grandmaster molecular biologist. Aside from his main objective, that of mastering the art of molecular biology, he enjoyed various side quests such as running, pot smashing, rupee collecting, marathoning, hiking, dragon riding, phage hunting, camping, deep-space exploration, general adventuring and trinket collecting, music producing, and the list continues... His deep fascination with the mysteries of the galaxy and string theory have caused great constant mental duress, but all this is subdued once a mutagenesis has worked out for the best. His love for and bafflement by the universe in which we live is only one of the infinitude of reasons Jordan Alexandrius decided to participate in iGEM. 'Twas but a single step further in his insatiable quest for knowledge. (It should be noted that this paragraph has been written in Georgia font in honor of his homeland.)

This year, Macquarie Australia has designed and constructed 15 parts. We will be submitting 14 of these parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Chlorophyll Biosynthesis
For the Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Pathway of our system, we will be submitting three parts. Our first part is our Mg-Chelatase Plasmid [BBa_K1998000] which makes up Magnesium Chelatase A and B with the cTH1 gene from Operon 3 in the pathway. The genes are arranged in the order of chlI1 - chlD - gun4 - chlI2 - cTH1 - plac - chlH. We have been able to experimentally validate this BioBrick part and have submitted this characterisation to the parts registry [Silver Medal Criteria]. The second part, forms our MgPPIX-Chlorophyll a Operon [BBa_K1998013] which joins Operon 3 and 4 in the pathway. In addition we are also submitting a third part which contains the genes yCF54 and chlM from operon 3 in the pathway [BBa_K1998001] .
Photosystem II Synthesis
For our second series of parts, we will be submitting 8 parts which form the Photosystem II pathway of our overall system. We have the five individual operons of the Photosystem II pathway completed. Operon 2 was completed by the 2015 Macquarie Australia iGEM team [BBa_K1640006] . This year we have formed the other four operons [BBa_K1998014] , [BBa_K1998002] , [BBa_K1998004] , [BBa_K1998006] and have additionally ligated Operon 2 and 3 [BBa_K1998008] and Operon 4 and 5 [BBa_K1998007] together.

Try to Synthesize 6dEB Naturely
Background:
6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, is a complex product synthesized through the action of a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS) by the soil bacterium S.erythraea [4].
Therefore, the enzyme system, which is in charge of synthesizing 6dEB, is also called deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS). The DEBS involves three polypeptide chains, including DEBS1, DEBS2, DEBS3, which have independent functions [6]. Correspondingly, the gene which codes DEBS, eryA, is divided into three, including eryAⅠ, eryAⅡ, eryAⅢ.
From the article of Pfeifer in 2001[4], it is feasible to synthesis and functional expression of the gene cluster eryA in E.coli, using the method which is mentioned in the article.
Now, let’s have a base understanding of DEBS [4].
DEBS1: containing Module 1 (KS-AT-KR-ACP) and Module 2 (KS-AT-KR-ACP)
DEBS2: containing Module 3 (KS-AT- ACP) and Module 4 (KS-AT-DH-ER-KR-ACP)
DEBS3: containing Module 5 (KS-AT-KR-ACP) and Module 6 (KS-AT-KR-ACP)
Besides, the whole PKS chain includes a Loading Domain on the N-terminus and a TE Domain (thioesterase)"

Gel electrophoresis: add 2 µL loading buffer to every digestion mix, apply about 100 - 200 ng DNA / pocket in gel. Don't forget to apply the uncut BioBrick as well. A good agarose concentration for BioBricks between 0.2 and 3 kb is 1.5 %. The smaller your BioBrick of interest is the higher the agarose concentration should be and vice versa. The gel electrophoresis is made with TAE-buffer . Be sure that you melt your agarose gel in the same buffer you use for the electrophoresis later.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Contribution_-_-_TEXT.html," will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

Chemistry
Our new antibiotic should have an alternative Ring A with a β-lactam ring as a warhead. We synthesized 3-(((1-carboxypropan-2-yl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid using the duff reaction and reductive amination (LINK TO ChemIntro). The synthesis worked fine, but clean-up attempts by crystallization and extraction failed. Purification by HPLC worked fine. Extended storage in acidified methanol led to methylation of the compound.

Biochemistry
In order to produce our new antibiotic, the synthesized Ring A derivative has to be accepted by one of the L-enzymes (CloL, CouL, NovL or SimL) which catalyze the formation of the amide bond between Ring A and B. The conjugation of CouL and CloL into the CloQ-defective strain Clo-SA02 was successful. SimL and NovL could not be cloned. LC-MS analysis showed that the feeding experiment with the synthesized Ring A derivative was successful.
Figure 8: On the left: Desired product of feeding, on the right: MS chromatogram and MS spectrum with desired m/z.
The next important step is to close the warhead, the β-lactam ring. First, we had to clone and express β-lactam synthetase. Cloning worked fine, but expression was not optimized due to time constraints.

After the two biobricks was constructed, they were transformed to JM109, BL21 (DE3) and DH5α, respectively. Then we compared their color with the corresponding strains that bear plasmid with only CrtEBI as the insert, at different time intervals.
After cultivated at 37℃ for 9 hours, as shown in Figure 2, bacteria bearing BBa_J23103-CrtEBI and naked CrtEBI represented a light red color while bacteria bearing Terminator-CrtEBI and blank vector appeared white (Fig 2). We can’t collect bacteria of strain BL21 (DE3) at this time because it was slow-growing in this experiment for some reason.

He has founded the first synthetic biology option in an engineering school in France in 2008 along with the first participation of the ESBS-Team to the iGEM competition. Since then, he has developed collaboration with the Strasbourg engineering school of physics on “Design Methodology and Modeling of Synthetic Biosystems”. He is now working in integrating concepts of synthetic biology in personalized medicine.
Instructors
Yves Gendrault
After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Electronique, Signaux et Automatique (ESA), Yves does a Master’s degree in Micro-and Nano-Electronique (MNE) at the Université de Strasbourg (UdS). He discovers the field of Synthetic Biology during an internship in the Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Systèmes (InESS) laboratory in Strasbourg. During this internship he creates models for several biological processes. Because Synthetic Biology is situated between engineer sciences and biotechnologies, the collaboration with biotechnologists is for him fundamental for a better understanding. In this way, he has started his Ph.D program, untitled “standardization of the design flow for synthetic biology”.
Yves has already participated to iGEM competition, with the ESBS team in 2010.

The cells’ competency was tested with 100 ng/µL RFP. The transformed cells grew extremely well with numerous colonies and a high transformation efficiency. The new protocol can be seen on our Experiments page.
Our IDT parts were digested and ligated into their corresponding backbones (pET29B or pSB1C3), then transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells.

We isolated the plasmids of E. coli DH5α transformants from our ligated backbones/parts from Week 9. We screened 8 phasin-HlyA colonies, 8 SP1 colonies, and 2 SP2 colonies. The isolated plasmid of each colony was digested, then ran on a 1% agarose gel for confirmation. Some of the plasmids from each colony were left undigested as a control, double-digested with the same enzymes we used last week for ligation to check for the insert size, and digested with another enzyme to check for insert directionality:

<img src=""
"" width=""910"" height=""500"" alt=""meetup""/>
Chinese teams began to participate  International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition from 2007. The number of Chinese teams has increased to 20 from only 4 at the beginning.    Considering that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams is badly needed,    a meeting for all Chinese iGEMers -- iGEM 2011 China Meetup -- was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.
The theme of this conference is ""iGEM -- the breeding ground for the next generation of synthetic biologists"". During the conference,    well-known experts was invited to promulgate their latest research findings and elucidate the development trend of synthetic biology,    and there were also  insightful students to make subjective reports and reviews. iGEM teams  displayed the current progress of their projects,    and shared their experiences with conference participants.
Prof. Xueming Zhao from Tianjin University, Prof. Michael Q. Zhang from CSHL & Tsinghua University and Prof. Jiarui Wu from SIBS & USTC were invited to give lectures.   The conference was open to all undergraduates, graduate students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. Participants interacted with each other and the lecturers during the conference.    The conference is supported by School of Life Science, USTC and the Committee of Communist Youth League of China, USTC.

Bielefeld-Germany,2011,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#BPA_-_-_TEXT.html," h in 300 mL shaking flasks without baffles with silicon plugs. Samples were taken at the end of the cultivation. Three biological replicates were analysed (n = 3).
As shown by Sasaki et al. (2008) , BisdB expressed in E. coli leads to almost no BPA degradation. In our experiments, we could not detect the BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol in cultivations with E. coli expressing <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> or <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> alone (neither via UV- nor MS-detection). The BPA degradation products 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol were identified via MS-MS (m/z: 243 / 225 / 211 / 135) and only occured in cultivations with E. coli expressing BisdA and BisdB simultaneously. Sasaki et al. (2005) reported the same MS-MS results for 1,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol when degrading BPA with S. bisphenolicum AO1 as we observed in our BPA degradation experiments.
We could also identify the BPA degradation products when working with E. coli TOP10 and MACH1 (data not shown). But because we aim to fuse BisdA and BisdB to S-layer proteins which are supposed to be expressed in E. coli KRX, we carried out the characterizations of <partinfo>K123000</partinfo> and <partinfo>K123001</partinfo> in this strain.
Specificity of bisphenol A degradation with E. coli
In order to access the specificity of the bisphenol A degradation by the bisdA | bisdB fusion protein we tested how well two similar bisphenols, bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), were utilized. The structure of those bisphenols differs only in the chemical group linking the two phenols from that of bisphenol A (see Figure 7).

University_of_Ottawa,2008,Team:University of Ottawa#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," signal degraded, the protein of interest and the repressor protein are no longer produced, and the system returns to its initial state. The two populations of sender and receiver cells can be grown together. The inducing IP signal is continually supplied to the receiver cells, which would in turn go through cycles of IP stimulation and degradation. Thus, oscillatory dynamics of pulsatile protein expression (pulsilations) can be accomplished.
The Template
We discovered a useful template system developed by Ming-Tang Chen and Ron Weiss of Princeton University [ 2 ]. They developed a yeast strain containing signaling elements from the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. These yeast express a surface cell receptor AtCRE1 that binds a cytokinin (a type of plant hormone) called isopentenyladenine (IP). This signaling element triggers an endogenous signal transduction pathway , leading to the activation of the nuclear aspartate response regulator SKN7, a transcription factor. By employing a synthetic promoter constructed from a modified yeast MEL1 promoter and containing one or two tandem synthetic SKN7 response elements (SSRE), target genes can be put under inducible control of IP. There are several advantages to using such an inducer molecule. Being completely foreign to the host organism reduces the concern of affecting alternate pathways or of endogenous activation of the pathway. IP is relatively cheap compared to other inducer compounds and can be synthesized on site using the recombinant enzyme AtIPT4 from A. Thaliana. Our ultimate plan is to incorporate this enzyme into a strain of sender cells as part of a dual population system. In addition, given that the selection of biobricks for yeast is currently limited when compared to the spectrum of parts developed for E. coli, we thought that this would be a novel yeast-based system to expand upon.
The original CRE1 system
To construct the original yeast strain, several genetic manipulations had to be performed to ensure proper function [ 2 ]. It is known that upon binding inducer, CRE1 phosphorylates the histidine phosphor-transfer protein YPD1. In yeast, YPD1 is normally affected by the cell surface osmosensor histidine kinase SLN1. Under normal conditions, SLN1 is constitutively phosphorylated and its kinase activity maintains YPD1 in its phosphorylated state. YPD1 in turn regulates two parallel pathways by transferring its phosphate to two proteins: SSK1 and SKN7. SSK1 phosphorylation is key to suppressing the yeast’s HOG1 pathway – a stress reponse pathway to high osmolarity, whose activity is"

We set a = 20 as usually the case in experiments, and λ = 0.001 (so that the time to get to steady state is 1000) and r = 15000 so that the initial amount of plasmid per cell is 5.

kdm = 0.006/s
Notes:  The rate limiting step in ranscription including transcription initiation and elongation. The rate of transcript initiation reaction is 9.46*10^5 for cI (8,9). Average elongaration rate is 30 nt/sec. λ repressor is about 720bp, so υm = 24/720=0.033/s . The half lifetime of mRNA in e.coli is 2 min(7), kdm=ln2/2*60=0.006/s

parameters:
υp = 0.0288/sec
kd_cI_w = 0.0002/s   (widetype)
kd_cI_tag = 0.003/s (with degradation tag)
Notes: An average ten copies of proteins are assumed to be produced per transcript. Given the half lifetime of mRNA of cI to be 4 min, υp = 10/(4*60/ln2)=0.0288/sec The half-life of  widetype λ repressor is 60 mins (10), however, with degradation tag, it could be as short as 4 min (11).
Plasmid-protein complex affect plasmid replication
If a replication is already initiated but when the replication forks meet a lamda protein on the way, this replication will be aborted. So only when replication forks pass the protein binding point without lamda protein there, the replication processes are effective. This is a simplified model on how plasmid-protein complex affect plasmid replication, we will try to find out some more detailed mechanisms in the future."

Results: The ligation was successfully finished and we are now ready to transform the LEAs.
8/31/16:
Objective: Made glycerol stock for MAHS and RVLEAM, plasmid miniprep, Qubit reading, transformation of the ligations of the LEAs from 8/30/16
Made glycerol stock of MAHS since it went missing. Made glycerol stock for RVLEAM from new overnight made on 8/30/16
Plasmid miniprepped the two LEAs
Qubit readings came out low, a digest and gel was ran
Results: Transformation of the LEAs is finished and the plates will be ready to view tomorrow. Hope there will be great news!
9/1/16:
Objective: Review plates from the LEAs ligations, colony PCR and gel analyzation of PCR products
Transformation of the LEAs came out great but the colonies were green
Colony PCR was done and a gel was ran
The gel came out fine but there were bands at 3000bp resulting in inconclusive results
Results: The results of the transformed plates fluorescing green indicates the misusage of the promoter, RBS, and backbone part. The goal was to use the K880005 part, but the green colonies show that this was not the part that was ligated. Colony PCR was conducted to analyze the confusion. This concluded that the wrong vector was used for the insert. Thus initiating a rebuilding of parts.

Taking these results into consideration, the pBAD promoter was used in combination with the pSB3K3 vector to regulate the expression of the antitoxin RelB. Again, a reporter system was used to mimic the expression of RelB, as the part, BBa_I6058 , containing YFP controlled by pBAD, was assessed on different vectors.
The Final Approach for the Three Components Comprised Three Different Vectors
Based on the modelling the system approaches reviewed in the preceding part, the final design, which is illustrated on Figure 4, was established. Ultimately, the dormancy system was composed of the photocontrol device controlled by the PenI-regulated promoter on a high copy vector, RelB controlled by pBAD, BBa_K2449031 , on a low copy vector  and RelE controlled by the OmpR-regulated promoter on either a low copy vector or the chromosome.

I am not sure whether it was sheer ignorance to assume that when you are put into a care facility, you are stripped of your independence and pride, or whether it was the fear of the unknown for my family or even myself in the distant future. Nevertheless I couldn't have been more wrong (or at least I was in Monikas case.) With the everlasting excitement in her eyes she told stories of her grandchildren visiting her and how she was proud to be known as “cool grandmother”, always having their backs and helping them out when they have made a small mess of a situation.
When I asked her how things had changed over the years she told me “I used to always be happy… But now the sad thoughts are catching up to me but I don't let anyone know. Especially not my grandchildren, to them I still am ‘happy grandma.’” When I tried to enquire further about her sad thoughts she blocked me off and told me it was no matter and that it was just a thing that happens when you get older. The momentary sadness in her eyes vanished in an instant as I saw the strong powerful woman inside trying not to let the distress get a hold of her.
Monika showed me that the character you have built up in your youth and earlier life does not need to change as you grow older. She was still the strong powerful woman that she had described to me and although she does require some assistance she does not seem at all dependent or unhappy about the help that is provided to guide her through her everyday life. Lastly she also opened my eyes to the fact that ageing is more than just a physical process but also a mental one that can affect your mental wellbeing, which may need to be taken into greater consideration when providing for the elderly.

Third Chassis:inBLUE-outRED
Third Chassis: Blue Light reception module coupled to Red Light emitter module.
Reception module: Blue Light Photosensor LovTAP and blue light inducible promoter
Working in this chassis, we decided to use as blue light receptors: LovTAP photosensor and the native blue light inducible promoter from E.coli.
LOVTAP
OBJECTIVES
Design and construct an improved version of the LovTAP photosensor under the regulation of  different constitutive promoters and  with a punctual mutation (ILE427PHE), as was proposed by the model results of the EPF-Lausanne 2009 team.
Transfer the plasmid with the LovTAP synthesized gene from Mr. Gene Plasmid to pSB1C3 DNA submission backbone and ligate the construction to different weak constitutive promoters.
Characterize LovTAP reporter systems, both repressor and activator activity.
The structure of the device is designed as follows:
METHODOLOGY
LovTAP design
The blue light sensor LovTAP biobrick (BBa_K360121) was designed and constructed with some modifications in comparison to the existing LovTAP biobrick (BBa_K191006) available at the registry. It is an improved version that contains a punctual mutation ILE427PHE, which was proposed by the model results of the team EPF-Lausanne 2009, with this mutation LovTAP should react faster and the conformational change should be more stable (the protein stays in the active form for longer, under light induction).
As well, LovTAP was designed without the inverting regulator sensitive to LacI and CAP protein because according to the report of Lausanne team, the expression levels of LovTAP under the inverting regulator didn’t show differences to the induction with IPTG. Thus, the inverting regulator was removed and none promoter was included in the design that was sent to synthesize, instead several constitutive promoters would be ligatated to the synthesized construction to choose the one that works better. The RBS (ribosome binding site) was changed from a strong to a medium strength. Finally, the 2 PstI restriction sites were removed from the coding region of LovTAP, which makes the LovTAP construction compatible with the 10 standard protocol of biobrick assembly.
So, the LovTAP construction that was sent to synthesize to Mr. Gene Company, consists of the following basic parts:

Glasgow Science Centre
We spent the afternoon at Glasgow Science Centre educating children on healthy guts and how their health affected their bowels.  While the children were making ‘healthy poo’, we had time to speak to the parents about our project and get their thoughts on what we were doing.  To aid this, we prepared two posters to present; one detailed how our project would work; and the other was based on campylobacter and how to reduce the risk of infection.  The two posters had different designs, one was more text based with biological terms and images, and the other was an infographic consisting of images and figures.  The feedback we received said the infographic was easier to understand; therefore we are going to design our final poster in the style of an infographic to aid understanding of our project and to simplify the communication of our results.  We received great feedback from the kids and Science Centre staff who all enjoyed our activities and learned from our exhibit.

Edinburgh Debate
We teamed up with the undergraduate team from Edinburgh to organise a debate regarding GMOs to help us better understand perceptions from non-scientists and what they main points are for arguing for and against the use of GMOs.  We enrolled the University of Dundee and Edinburgh debating unions to present and chair the debate, which was a massive success and contributed to our understanding of the main opposition to GMOs in the public eye.
The debate leaned heavily towards GM crops, as it does in Scotland, and focused on the profit that could be made by large companies such as Monsanto who develop GM seeds that outperform their natural siblings.  There is a fear that these companies would hold their seeds ransom for an extremely high price, with farmers obliged to pay due to their undoubted benefits.  This was countered with the notion that whilst companies such as Monsanto make a profit, it is not comparable to the saving of millions of lives"

a) Confirming Ag43-FLAG expression with Western Blotting
Western Blots were used to confirm the expression of FLAG tag. Anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase was used.
Fig.6    Western blot of a total cell lysate of an E. coli Bba_K1352001 transformant, run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto membrane and probed with an anti-FLAG antibody.
Two prominent bands are present which roughly correspond to the expected sizes of 116.77 kDa and 56.7 kDa. The additional faint band most likely corresponds to a protein degradation product. Overall, the Western blot results confirmed expression of FLAG tagged protein of the sizes expected from Ag43.
b) Confirming FLAG surface expression with anti-FLAG immunolabelling
In order to investigate membrane localisation and accessibility for antibody binding, fluorescent immunolabelling and confocal microscopy were used.
Fig.7    Schematic representation of immunolabelling technique used.
Cover slips were coated with 0.01% Poly-L-lysine to which cells expressing a construct were adhered. The cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, without creating pores in their membrane. They were exposed to a monoclonal anti-FLAG mouse primary antibody, then an Alexxa633 fluorophore-conjugated Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells expressing the Ag43-FLAG construct were visualised at up to 100x magnification with a Cy5 (red) filter on an upright confocal microscope, this was contrasted against visual identification with brightfield. Unmodified Bba_K1352000 which does not express a FLAG-tagged Ag43 was used as a negative control.

We reviewed these in more detail as part of our Human practices section, to help communication within synthetic biology we also compiled a set of Synthetic Biology Communication Guidelines . Communication is a very important factor within safety as if proper practices are not carried out due to misunderstanding small hazards can be amplified.
Safe Project Design
Chassis
The chassis, which we chose, are all non-pathogenic and were selected within the design stage to minimise the risk. These were E. coli
E. coli
The strains of E. coli we are using are DH5-α and BL21-DE3, these strains are within safety group 1, like most E. coli strains these present the lowest level of risk to humans. Research commissioned by HSE (Chart et al. (2000)) showed that these lack the pathogenic mechanisms usually present within hazardous E. coli strains.
Cell-Free
From the perspective of safety aspect of our project were advantageous due to their cell free factor. Within cell-free systems random mutations and dissemination are not as likely. This utilizes cell extract for transcription and translation. Sonification and centrifugation steps remove the cell membrane. This makes them suitable for use outside of the lab, however in line with Newcastle and iGEM’s ‘Do Not Release’ policy’s this was not carried out.
Arsenic
As we are producing an arsenic biosensor to characterise this arsenic is needed. In order to use this sepecific safety forms needed to be filled out within the lab, these COSHH forms detailed the use and possible hazards involved. For this we had to assess the health risks and procautions, provide the appropriate protection with reduced exposire. The lab has appropriate ventelation and fume cupboards that can be used. The use of arsenic on the small scale that we needed was allowed witin our labs. It is a groundwater contaminant of major significance to public health. Arsenic can get into the body via ingestion and absorption, for this reason it is not used as a fine dust as it can be breathed in which can cause serious health hazards. The health hazards related to arsenic are range from irritation to internal bleeding for short term exposure. As arsenic is only used for characterisation longer term effects do not need to be considered. The risk team members working with this in the lab is set to as low as 'resonably practicable' as it is with every hazardous compound.

\begin{equation} \large \frac{d[ArsR|As]}{dt} = (ArsR_{TOTAL}) - (\frac{[ArsR_{TOTAL}]}{1+(\frac{[As_{FREEin}])}{k_{[ArsR|As]}})^{h_2}} - \delta_{ArsR|As}[ArsR|As]  \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \large \frac{d[ArsR_{FREE}]}{dt} = (\frac{[ArsR_{TOTAL}]}{1+(\frac{[As_{FREEin}])}{k_{[ArsR|As]}})^{h_2}} - \delta_{ArsR|As}[ArsR|As]  \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \large \frac{d[MT|As]}{dt} = (MT_{TOTAL})-(\frac{[MT_{TOTAL}]}{1+(\frac{[As_{FREEin}])}{k_{[MT|As]}})^{h_3}} - \delta_{MT|As}[MT|As]  \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \large \frac{d[MT_{FREE}]}{dt} = (\frac{[MT_{TOTAL}]}{1+(\frac{[As_{FREEin}])}{k_{[MT|As]}})^{h_3}} - \delta_{MT|As}[MT|As]  \end{equation}
In equations 5 to 7, kArsR|As and kMT|As are the kinetic constants for the interaction of arsenic with ArsR and MT, respectively, using a different nomenclature as in equations 1 and 2; here, in equations 6 and 7, the binding of two molecules is represented as ""moleculeA|moleculeB"". The indexes h2 and h3 are the Hill coefficients for the interaction between arsenic and ArsR and MT, respectively. The deltas are the degradation constants for the protein|As complexes. The unbound As that results from complex degradation then goes to the AsFREEin pool and is ready to"

Safety
1.Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?
The main purpose of our project is to regulate some of the kinetic properties of E. coli, which is not much concerned with the toxicity of the bacteria. However, it is never too overreacting to keep a warning bell in mind. Just in case our experiments may bring about uneasiness of safety, we have taken measures to make sure people inside the laboratory and in the outside world don’t get hurt. Several rules are established for everyone to stick to such as protective gears are required while performing experiments, and poisonous and reactive reagents should be used in special areas. We are using separate and distant spaces to perform experiments and study. Also before the whole project started we had a specific and detailed safety training for both USTC and USTC Software team members since we are using the same laboratory.
Gelred, an intercalating agent used as a nucleic acid fluorescent stain, will be and only be applied in electrophoretic procedures during our whole project. We prefer to use it instead of Ethidium bromide due to its relatively low toxicity. But still dangers exist.  Anyone performing the procedure is asked to be wearing nitrile gloves all the time and no other thing is allowed to be done in the same area. The used agarose gels are carefully collected and thrown away after experiments.
Ultraviolet light are used during sterilization and decontamination of culture medium as well as visualizing the stained DNA in the electrophoretic gels. We are making rules against direct exposition to UV radiation such as special safety lenses would be used and the machine we use to visualize electrophoretic gels is UV-blocking.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?
Since the strains we use in the whole study is not related to the genes of plants, animals or human and no pathogenic or toxic genes are being used during experiments, it is not likely that our materials or products will threaten the safety and health of the general public. Nevertheless the regulations of Genetically Engineered Organisms (GMOs) made by relevant departments of P. R. China will be followed.
c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?

5.1 Parameter Set
Modeling Overview
We estimated the possibility that the genetic circuit works as intended by constructing mathematical modeling. First, we simulated time series of concentration of each fluorescent protein to find parameters which establish expression loops of them. We also mathematically analyzed the stability of the expression loops, and the parameters which make the loops stable were found with  this analysis. We conducted parameter fitting with the data which we got from experiment, in order to estimate the parameters that we used in our simulation. The parameters that we could not obtain from the experiment were estimated from literature.
Simulation of Time Series of Concentration of Fluorescent Protein
Aim
We ran the simulation of the transcription and translation for two reasons. The first one is to make sure that our project is not theoretically impossible. In other words, if we can find the parameter sets which establish the loop of gene expression, it means our project is theoretically feasible. And also it is expected that we can get the insight for improving our design of the genetic circuit using this simulation.
The second one is to check whether genetic circuit works as intended under the given condition when parameters are obtained from experiment. If there is a tool which can calculates the behavior of genetic circuit with any parameter sets inputted and  outputs a graph indicating time series of concentration of fluorescent proteins, it is useful for judging whether genetic circuit works as intended when we get the actual parameters from experiments or literature. So we developed the tool.
Method
We described the behavior of the genetic circuit by differential equations and developed a tool solving the differential equations with Euler's method. We judged from the graph outputted by the  tool under various parameter sets whether the gene expression loop was generated as intended. First, the meaning of each variable is indicated in the table"

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Project#HumanPractices#Killswitch#Regulation_-_-_TEXT.html,"A promoter and riboswitch was obtained from Winnie and Groisman. A lack of magnesium activates other genes in E. coli to allow influx of magnesium into the cell. The two proteins in the cascade that activate the system are PhoP ( BBa_K902010 ) and PhoQ ( BBa_K902011 ). PhoQ is the trans-membrane protein which gets activated in the absence of magnesium and phosphorylates PhoP. PhoP in turn binds to the mgtA promoter and transcribes genes downstream (Groisman, 2001).
Manganese riboswitch
Manganese is an essential micronutrient. It is an important co-factor for enzymes and it also reduces oxidative stress in the cell (Waters et al. 2011). Despite being an important micronutrient, it is toxic to cells at high levels. MntR protein detects the level of manganese in the cell and acts as a transcription factor to control the expression of manganese transporter such as MntH, MntP and MntABCDE. In order to regulate these genes mntR ( BBa_K902030 ) binds to the mntP promoter ( BBa_K902073 ). The manganese homeostasis is also controlled by the manganese riboswitch mntPrb ( BBa_K90274 ). The sequences of the mntP promoter and the mntP riboswitch was obtained from the Waters et al, 2011.
Figure 2: A) MgtA pathway in E. coli. PhoQ is the transmembrane receptor which, upon detecting low magnesium concentrations, phosphorylates PhoP which acts as a transcription factor, transcribing genes downstream of the MgtA promoter necessary for bringing magnesium into the cell. There is a second level of control with the magnesium riboswitch. In the presence of high magnesium the riboswitch forms a secondary structure which does not allow the ribosome to bind to the transcript, thus inhibiting translation. B) In the presence of manganese, the MntR protein represses the mntH transporter, preventing the movement of manganese and also upregulating the putative efflux pump. Genes downstream of the mntP promoter are thus transcribed in the presence of manganese.  The addition of the MntR protein in this system allows for tighter regulation of the system.

Every member of the public, regardless of discipline, will be impacted by synthetic biology research. As a result, it is becoming increasingly important for communities to have an understanding of the science. This year we expanded the conversations around synthetic biology, working to target communities beyond STEM students while simultaneously investing in a state wide foundational understanding of bioengineering. By presenting our work to new groups, and supporting a deeper understanding of general synthetic biology, we were able to engage in more complex conversations surrounding the ethics, policy and implementation of our project. In many of our engagement activities we received new feedback which ultimately helped shape the direction of our work.
We have divided our outreach into three categories, Incorporating New Communities , A Statewide Standard , and Continuing the Conversation . We have also continued our work with our Outreach Database .
Incorporating New Communities
We identified 7 communities we wanted to bring into the conversation. We followed our Outreach Planning Guide and utilized the Outreach Database to build on past years successful programs. This ensured our programs were relevant for our target communities and put synthetic biology into a relatable context. Be sure to click through all 7 of our initiatives found here .
Major achievements:
7 distinct programs created, executed, and reflected upon
600+ Meaningful conversations with community members
Integration of public input into this years project. See IHP
A Statewide Standard
As synthetic biology has developed it has become vital for all members of the community, regardless of discipline, to share a baseline understanding of the subject. We decided to promote a statewide understanding through the Virginia Public School System. It became clear in our early conversations with high school students that the Virginia Standards of Learning had provided a background in genetics, but did not encourage students to use apply background to the exploration of synthetic biology topics. To address this, we worked with the Virginia Department of Education to update the Biology Standards of Learning. To support teachers in this curriculum change we create a teacher course supported by a NASA mini-proposal, and have entered a partnership with Thermofisher Scientific working to improve"

Turing meets synthetic biology:
self-emerging patterns in an activator-inhibitor network
LCG-UNAM-MEXICO & IPN-UNAM-MEXICO teams working together
When we heard that there was another iGEM team within our alma mater we started trying to contact them because we knew we could help each other to make better projects and produce better results.
This is how we found LCG-UNAM-Mexico iGEM team and since the early stages of our projects our team has been closely collaborating with them  by exchanging ideas and discussing about experimental and theoretical issues we could have had in the future.
Before we started to implement our projects we had some meetings where we finally met them. In this meetings we exposed to each other the general ideas we had and the way we were planning to model and implement them. We recieved a valuable advice from them on our project, specially on the way we were planning to regulate our system using IPTG and aTc inversors and we mentioned them some theoretical issues they cuold have on the modelling of their system, and we offered to help them. We also kept an active online communication with them and we were always curious to know what the other team was working on.
When we were about to start implementing our system we had some bureaucratical issues on the customes with the current iGEM Kit Plate, and we needed some BioBricks of this Kit. Fortunately they already had it, so they kindly extracted, eluted, transformed, purified and sent them to us so we wouldn't lose more time. Certainly they saved us a lot of time, and we could started to work with a very little delay in comparison to the time we would have to wait for the arrival of the Kit. They also advised us in some technical details and tricks on the handling of the BioBricks, with good results in the wetlab.
When they were modelling they found some difficulties on describing the dynamics of the diffussion component of their system, so we assesed them on what finally would be their cellular automaton with discrete diffusion. Since they had some troubles with a continuous model we proposed them to use a discrete version of what they were trying to do: the discrete Laplace operator, or well a partial differential equations system.

Chloroform may cause irritation to eyes, skin and mucous membrane. Prolonged dermal exposure can result in the development of sores as a result of defatting. It's also a carcinogen and can impair liver and kidney to some extent. Moreover, chloroform dose harm to nervous system that it causes depression of the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately leading to deep coma and respiratory center depression. Serious illnesses would ensue upon ingestion of 7.5 g (0.26 oz) of chloroform. The mean lethal oral dose for an adult is estimated to be about 45 g (1.6 oz). Due to its threat to respiratory and cardiac symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, prostration, jaundice, coma, liver necrosis and degeneration, the anesthetic use of chloroform has been ceased.
Chloroform is not stable and easily decomposed in exposure to light, so it should be kept in brown bottle away from light, heat and acetone (acetone will have acute reactions with chloroform). For protection from chloroform, lab workers should wear proper nitrite gloves and eyes protectors, as well as working in the fume hood. Spent chloroform should be extracted and collected for further disposal.
Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris) is an organic compound extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology experiments as a component of buffer solutions, such as in Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) and Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, especially for solutions of nucleic acids.
Although Tris is considered as a low-toxic reagent, long-term exposure may still lead to potential threats through skin and breath. Thus, gloves and eye protectors are recommended.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) is the smallest polyoxymethylene with a typical degree of polymerization of 8C100 units. PFA commonly has a slight odor of formaldehyde due to decomposition. Once paraformaldehyde is depolymerized, the resulting formaldehyde may be used as a fumigant, disinfectant, fungicide, and fixative. The applications of PFA include production of polyoxymethylene plastic (POM or Delrin), root canal treatment, etc. PFA is widely used in organic chemistry labs for various synthetic reactions.
PFA is not a fixative; it must be depolymerized to formaldehyde in solution and kept in sealed containers at a temperature between 2"

3G Assembly
Motivation
The creation of genetic circuits is core to synthetic biology. However, with traditional DNA assembly methods, this process can be both time consuming and expensive. Additionally, current methods allow for only one circuit variant to be made at a time. This is inefficient when specific, but unknown, parameters are needed in the circuit.
Golden Gate-Gibson (3G) is a new, hybrid method of DNA assembly that addresses these issues. In 3G assembly, many variants of multi-part circuits can be constructed in a single day with high accuracy and efficiency [1]. When implemented in our iGEM lab, 3G assembly greatly improved our productivity and enabled us to spend less time on circuit construction and more time on experiments. With a simple protocol and low costs, 3G would be an invaluable tool for the iGEM program as whole. In order to make this method of DNA assembly accessible to all iGEM teams, we created a library of compatible parts to add to the registry.
Mechanism
Mechanistically, 3G assembly is a hybrid of Golden-Gate and Gibson assembly. In the first stage, transcriptional units are built using Golden-Gate. In the second stage, transcriptional units are combined on to a universal backbone.
Figure 1: Overview of 3G workflow
Golden Gate Stage
In Golden-Gate Assembly, type IIS restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA. Type IIS restriction enzymes are useful in that they cut outside their recognition sites, creating fragments of DNA with no unwanted base pair scars. We use the restriction enzyme BsaI, which recognizes specific DNA sequences (BsaI sites) and cuts outside of these sites, leaving sticky ends that can be ligated together with T4 DNA ligase.
In this stage of assembly, 3G takes advantage of the Cidar MoClo system, in which specific part types are distinguished by their sticky ends. After being cut, each type of part reveals a distinct sticky end on either side. The standard parts"
XMU_Software,2013,Team:XMU Software#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". This regulation is quantified by the termination efficiency (%T).
Two mechanisms of transcription termination and two classes of termination signals have been described in bacteria: rho-dependent and rho-independent.
Rho-independent (also known as intrinsic) terminators are sequences motifs found in many prokaryotes that cause the transcription of DNA to RNA to stop. These termination signals typically consist of a short, often GC-rich hairpin followed by a sequences enriched in thymine residues.
The conventional model of transcriptional termination is that the stem loop causes RNA polymerase to pause and transcription of the poly-A tail causes the RNA: DNA duplex to unwind and dissociate from RNA polymerase.
Algorithm
In 2011, iGEM team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B developed a software tool TTEC to predict terminator efficiency. It takes DNA sequences as input and returns the terminator efficiency value.
In the algorithm, it takes 3 steps to calculate the terminator efficiency:
1. Use RNA folding algorithm to predict the secondary structure of terminator and and recognize A tail, stemloop and T tail.
2. From the secondary structure, we calculate the free energy of stem loop, and generate a score by considering stem loop free energy and T tail
3. From the score, we predict the terminator efficiency based on the score-terminator equation.
The prediction of secondary and recognition of A tail, stemloop and T tail are achieved by Kingsford scoring system.
Kingsford Scoring System
In 2007, Carleton L. Kingsford et al. described TransTermHP1, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators.
They put forward an algorithm to predict Rho-independent terminators. The first 15 bases of the potential tail sequences are scored using a function:
where
for n=1,2,..,15 and =1.
The energy of potential hairpin configurations adjacent to a reference position can be found efficiently with a dynamic programming algorithm. The table entry hairpin_score[i,j] gives the cost of the best hairpin structure for which the base of the 5' stem is at nucleotide position i and the base of the 3' stem is at position j. The entry hairpin_score[i,j] can be computed recursively as follows:
The function energy(i,j) gives the cost of pairing the nucleotide at i with that at j, and loop_pen(n) gives the cost of a hairpin loop of length n. The hairpin's loop is forced to have a length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting loop_pen(n) to a large"

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

We transformed in the 2X DNA samples but the 2X time samples were not transformed until tomorrow. Also ran a colony PCR on last week’s MutL and UmuC ligation attempts: looks like half our UmuC colonies were successful, but all of MutL failed.
Tuesday
Miniprepped the mCherry+AroF constructs while admiring the culture’s pinkish color. Sent that and a UmuC ligation attempt in for sequencing. We also ran another PCR of the TPC and TDE quickchange products (the ones with a doubled extension time), and while one of the TDE samples had promise, none of the TPC samples showed anything. Still went ahead with all the transformations anyway, because these things tend to be wonky at times. We also miniprepped mMutH for sequencing and MelA for verification.
Wednesday
Oh hey, a good sign! Monday’s mDnaE and mParC plates show a possible colony. Made overnight cultures of those and redid our MutS and MutY mutagenesis, with 2X DNA concentrations, since that seemed to have worked well. We transformed those in after Dpn1 digestion. Also sent in mMutH samples for sequencing and religated MutL, MutD, and DinB. We also ligated our promoter+TyrR construct and began a mutation rate assay of wild-type XL1-B cells.
Thursday
Transformed in the constructs we ligated yesterday. Also miniprepped yesterday’s overnight cultures, but not much growth was seen. Miniprep yields were disappointingly low, so there go those samples (i cry evry tym). At least we had colonies grow on our rifampicin plates. Made Dam overnight cultures and new IPTG stock. Friday Really good results for our TyrR construct! Looks like we’re actually starting to make progress! Colony PCR doesn’t seem to be working for this, but hopefully sequencing on Monday will tell us if we got it for certain. No growth on yesterday’s ligation plates, however, but we’re giving the plates one extra day to grow. We seem to be having the same problems that we had a few weeks before. Maybe it’s just a fluke. Also miniprepped yesterday’s overnight cultures. Yields were somewhat low as usual, but looks like we at least have enough for sequencing. Redoing MutS, Par"

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," each droplet contains a defined amount of nucleotides with their substrate removed, which is proportional to how strong the catalytic activity was in the particular droplet, of that particular biomolecule.
This information must then be stored into the biomolecule coding DNA sequence in the process of DNA amplification.
There are two main things that need to be considered in order to precisely record the activity information: effective DNA amplification and the addition of reference information which would serve as an activity baseline or a point of reference.
First of all, the efficiency of amplification reaction. After an in-depth discussion with microfluidics expert Karolis Leonavičius we have decided that DNA amplification reagents must be added after the initial droplet generation and protein production. That is because protein synthesis reagents usually do not work well with various amplification mixes.
Droplet merging can solve this problem. Main principle of droplet merging techniques, is that by using a specially designed microfluidics device, droplets can be merged with the help of electrical field. In CAT-Seq, the initial population of substrate droplets must be merged with freshly generated amplification droplets . All the the amplification droplets contain the same amount of reagents that are required to amplify DNA.
Another important thing to consider is creating a reference point which would help to precisely determine the activities of different catalytic biomolecules. For CAT-Seq, such reference point is nucleotides with reference modification. This modification can be any small modification which still allows a DNA polymerase to incorporate it during the amplification. We call them the Reference Nucleotides.
For example, If we would try to amplify DNA template in each droplet that contains different amounts of nucleotides that can be incorporated, we would get a sequencing bias that would be more favourable for biomolecules that are highly active.
That is because biomolecules with higher activity would produce more nucleotides for polymerase and the amplified DNA amount would be much bigger than compared to lower activity mutants which would produce less. Reference nucleotides can easily remove this bias - after merging the Substrate Droplet with Amplification droplets that contain Reference Nucleotides, they allow the synthesis of a similar amount of amplified DNA in each droplet.
Thus, two important parts of CAT-Seq has now been established - droplet merging and Reference Nucleotides.
Going back, we now have a population of substrate droplets that have a defined amount Product Nucleotides (the chemically converted substrate nucleotides). Those must then be merged with Amplification Droplets, wherein every droplet contains the"

Abstract
Tokyo_Tech' plans at first was to integrate the chemotaxis experiment into our overall project. Unfortunately, Tokyo_Tech were unable to obtain positive results from the gene that they constructed, before the Giant Jamboree. Chemotaxis experiment is very difficult. We helped Tokyo_Tech by the chemotaxis experiment. We helped team Tokyo_Tech by advising these 2 about chemotaxis experiments. 1. In order to increase the chemotactic activity of E. coli, the best concentration of agar is 0.3 %. 2. It is better to directly stick the chip inside the agar and then inject the E .coli, than to place the E. coli on top of the agar Also, we gave Tokyo_Tech the raw data along with the protocol of the experiments for assaying the chemotactic activity of a wild type E.coli.

Bacteria producing chimeric flagellin with multiepitope in the middle (CF213-multiepitope-CF215) were applied either by oro-gastric application (directly to the stomach) in a volume of  100ul (2.2 X 108 CFU per animal), while another group received intranasal application of 2.2 X 107 CFU in the final volume of 10 ul of sterile 0.9% saline solution. Mice receiving bacteria with the backbone plasmid only served as negative controls.
 
 
 
VACCINATION WITH DNA VACCINES
 
DNA vaccines were introduced by electroporation (Tevz et al., 2008) into the leg muscles or subcutaneously. Constructs tested were:
a)CMV-HA-UreaseB-His6;
b)CMV-ss-HA-UreaseB-His6;
c)CMV-ssCF-UreB (BBa_K133018)
d)CMV-CF-multi-CF;
e)CMV-SS-HA-multiepitope-TMTIR4-His6;
f)CMV-SS-HA-multiepitope-CD"

Figure 4: LbpA Culture Samples. Lane 1: Sample from uninduced culture. Lane 2: Sample from culture induced with 1mM IPTG. It seems that on comparison of the two cultures, that inducing expression of LbpA causes the cells to die given the significant reduction of protein levels visible on the gel.

Figure 5: OD600 Readings from Uninduced Culture and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG). The table shows that after being induced with IPTG the cultures stop growing since their OD600 readings are notably lower than that of the uninduced control.

Figure 6: Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG) The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, the induced cultures stop growing when LbpA expression is induced. After ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have adapted to the production of the foreign protein.

Figure 7: Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG) The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, after reaching an OD600 of 0.6,  the induced cultures stop growing when LbpA starts to be expressed. Similar to the previous growth curve assay, after ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have dealt with the production of the foreign protein.
