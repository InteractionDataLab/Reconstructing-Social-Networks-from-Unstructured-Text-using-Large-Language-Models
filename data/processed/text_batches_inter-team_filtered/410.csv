Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Sequencing results showed that even with a new PCR product the same mutation occurs in bpul(T7)_His so it is probably already present on the plasmid which was sent to us. So we decided to use this plasmid. We give him the name <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo>. Tth(T7)_His showed a positive sequencing result, too. So we have <partinfo>BBa_K863010</partinfo> ready for use!
Team Shuttle Vector:
Primer design was done for the shuttle vector. The following primers create fragments with a 5' overlap. Were ordered the primers: pSB1C3-5aox1-f, pSB1C3-5aox1-r, 5aox1-mfalpha1-f, 5aox1-mfalpha1-r, mfalpha1-aarI-taox1-f, mfalpha1-aarI-taox1-r, taox1-phis4-f, taox1-phis4-r, phis4-kozak-his4-f, phis4-kozak-his4-r, his4-3aox1-f, his4-3aox1-r, 3aox1-pSB1C3-f , 3aox1-pSB1C3-r.

Project
OVERVIEW
The Lambert High School iGEM team from Suwanee, Georgia is a group of dedicated and self described nerds who love the challenges of doing science. We set out to further our work from our previous year’s project, as we never had the chance to express our protein, chitin deacetylase.
During the year 2013 we isolated the chitin deacetylase gene, CDA2 from Sacchromyces cerevesai. Studies have shown that this gene could be expressed in E.coli successfully. Martinou, A., D. Koutsioulis, and V. Bouriotis. 2003)  CDA breaks down chitin, a naturally occurring polysaccharide into chitosan. Chitosan is widely used in a multitude of industries; including agriculture, aquaculture, health, biofilm production and water treatment. Current methods of Chitosan production use strong acids and bases to deacetylate the chitin, these may be cost effective at the moment, but the waste is incredibly harsh on the environment and is not sustainable. Our idea was to engineer cells to accomplish this task. The cells could be grown and used in a bioreactor, producing acetic acid as a waste product, which also has useful industrial applications. Current industries that produce chitosan are often located near coastal areas due to the natural abundance of shrimp shells and other exoskeletons. Unfortunately the wastewater form production can be polluting to the fragile ecosystems.
Chitosan has antifungal and antibacterial properties. We needed to engineer a system where we could turn on and off CDA production in such a way as to not kill our host cells. To this end we designed several constructs that would direct expression to the periplasm using a pelB tag combined with a Tet repressible promoter. We added GFP to the construct so that we might be able to visualize the proper expression in the periplasm. We also wanted to engineer a kill switch by incorporating 2013 Carnegie-Mellon's Killer Red   BBa_K1184000.  This would enable an environmental safety switch in our cells.
After research and discussion with our mentoring team and Dr. Styczynski at the Georgia Institute of Technology, we chose a threefold approach to the design. Sometimes large engineered proteins have difficulty folding properly in the periplasm so we needed to address the issue using different placement of promoters.
The first design we call"

5/5 Our final result
‹ ›
234 sets of data: refined and combined to give just one.  This is the prized result of the data collection element of our modelling project. The only other attempt at a time series of total fish biomass was provided by Tremblay-Boyer et al. (2011). They used a very different approach to our own, however (they relied on the Ecopath ecological modelling  software) and their time series consisted of only five data points.
Mathematical model
Delay Differential Equations and Numerical Solution Approximation Methods - is it all really necessary?
Why model?
In our project we sought to:
Investigate the impact we, as humans, will have on the population of fish in our ocean if we continue to fish in our current manner.  Today and in the past, we have fished at a rate proportional to the size of our population.
Discover whether iGEM Team St Andrews can, with our alternative method of production of Omega-3, influence the ""future of fish"", by preventing or, at least, slowing the suspected depletion of fish.
In order to answer such questions about the future and theoretical, never before encountered, scenarios, one has to make assumptions about the nature of our world and how it 'works'.  Very often, these assumptions can be expressed in a mathematical format.   The mathematical format is often referred to as a ""mathematical model"" of the physical situation.  Hence, as we sought to answer our own questions, we produced a mathematical model that predicted the population of world fish biomass at various times.  Our model involved parameter values which could be changed to enable us to ask different questions of the same model.
Why wet biomass?
Our model measured the total fish population at a specific time, in terms of the fish biomass present in our oceans at that time; and not in terms of total number of fish.  It did this for various reasons:
Most relevant data for fish population modelling, for example - recruitment rate, is expressed in terms of biomass. Therefore, we avoided unnecessary conversions and errors.
More importantly, we modelled total fish populations with the aim of investigating their sustainability.  To model fish numbers, when the definition of a sustainable number of fish varies so significantly from one species to another, would have been silly"

The iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be released into A549 cells and suppress the expression of KRAS in vitro. To examine the consequence of KRAS knockdown by anti-KRAS siRNA in vivo, we built a non-small cell lung cancer mouse model for in vivo experiment. Forty mice were subcutaneously injected A549-LUC cells to realize tumor implantation. Then tumor volume were measured through bioluminescent imaging several times after injection. The areas that emit fluorescence in the mice bodies represent labeled tumors (tumors developed from the implanted A549-LUC cells), which helps us to monitor the tumor growth, location and metastasis.
Figure 8. In vivo imaging of tumor-bearing mice. The parts in the mice body representing the tumors xenografted with A549-Luc indicates that the tumors are relatively uniform in size. First panel: the imaging of tumor-bearing mice injected with PBS. Second panel: the imaging of tumor-bearing mice treated with iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA.
Safety
Endotoxin detecting of anti-KRAS siRNA-loaded exosomes
Endotoxin is a type of natural pyrogen that was found in outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and can make impact on over 30 biological activities. To ensure the safety of our drug system, avoid toxicities, thus prove that our achievement is of great value for clinical application, a detecting assay was carried out using an endotoxin test kit. The result was negative, demonstrating that our drug system satisfies the safety requirement.

Conclusions
An efficient drug delivery system
KRAS mutation was identified in NSCLC more than 20 years ago, but its clinical importance in cancer therapy just began to be appreciated. Our project aimed to develop a drug system that employed modified exosomes with iRGD peptide on its surface to deliver KRAS-siRNA into lung cancer cells specifically, thus target KRAS gene and down-regulate K-ras protein expression to treat lung cancer cases. Our results had demonstrated that iRGD-exosomal KRAS siRNA can be delivered into tumor cells and efficiently down-regulate KRAS expression both in vitro and in vivo. In silencing validation, we transfected KRAS siRNA into A549 cells using Lipo 2000 and performed western blot to test the function of our siRNA. Subsequently, we collected iRGD-modified exosomes loaded with KRAS siRNA, evaluating"

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," human such as the human considers that the computer is actually a thinking being (a person), the computer is now a thinking being. In other words, being a thinking being is nothing else but being regarded as thinking. That replication is not without putting some new stakes on the table : as Turing enlightened the obsolete form of the question “could a machine think”, the question “is a synthetic organism alive?” is transformed into “is a synthetic organism able to be regarded as alive?”.
To me, this replication ironically answers the question of the distinction of a living and unliving world, putting into light the subjectivity of qualification. In other words, the validation of our definition of the living doesn't seem able to be satisfied by “unsatisfying” answers such as the Turing test. An other formulation of the logic of the test can be found in the text What is it to be a bat? from Thomas Nagel (Nagel 1974) . In that text, we explore the cognitive conditions of the limit of the qualification process.
The authors remind us of Marchery's arguments about the lake of solidity of a biological concept of life. The uncertainty of the concept shows that the quest of definition can only comfort fears about boundaries between the living and the artificial, that quest being necessarily unsatisfied.
It is with the same problem, now regarded as insolvent, that we finish that brief analysis. That dissatisfaction shows, to me, that the question of naturality and artificiality is also obsolete in the way we figure it. The biological test of Turing is ironical in that way and so distinguishes itself from the lexicon and the justification process of the other actors of the debate.  The “playing God issue”, the will of “saving nature from life science” has to face that pragmatical arguments and seems now reduced to an obsolete criticism.
In our pragmatical ethical approach, we now have to wonder if “real questions” can be asked of synthetic biology about the stake of naturality and artificiality. Our own qualification of real and false questions are needed to be criticized, it is not about reliance of fears and tears expressed within, it is a way for us to distinguish the “resolvability” of these questions. The way we've crossed from now was about wondering on “protecting the living from synthetic biology practices”. We tried to show how, without any stable and reliant definition of the life in question, the feedback on the initial concern will be to transform it to a insolvent question.
E. What “real question”? : Practices and alienability of the living.

Device 1: Anti-Inflammatory Device
Device 1 is the anti-inflammatory device: it functions by recognizing an inflammation signal ( nitric oxide ) and subsequently producing an immunosuppressive factor ( retinoic acid ).
The team chose nitric oxide (NO) for the in vivo inflammation signal for two primary reasons.  First, NO levels closely correspond to inflammation.  In Crohn’s Disease and IBD patients NO levels are elevated up to 1000-fold.  Moreover, Th17 cells induce nitric oxide production by secreting Interleukin-17 (IL-17), which stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in nearby chondrocytes.  Thus, nitric oxide can serve as a clear signal of IBD conditions and surfeit Th17 activity.
Second, E. coli naturally senses NO through an endogenous superoxide stress system, making this stress system a prime candidate for bioengineering.  Through kinetic and thermodynamic studies this system is predicted to have nanomolar sensitivity to NO concentrations.  At the heart of this highly tuned superoxide sensor are the SoxR gene and the SoxS promoter.   The SoxR gene encodes the SoxR transcription factor, which is activated by NO.  In the presence of NO, SoxR induces transcription from the SoxS promoter.  Given its exquisite sensitivity and robust transcriptional response, the team selected SoxR/SoxS to be the Device 1 sensor.
With the sensor identified, the team next designed the Device 1 generator.  Recall that the generator must produce a factor capable of suppressing IBD inflammation.  The literature provided several candidate immunosuppressives, but the team chose retinoic acid for several reasons:  Recently, retinoic acid has moved into the center of inflammation research for its ability to shift differentiation of naïve CD4+ cells away from the Th17 lineage in favor of the immunosuppressive Treg lineage.  In this way retinoic acid may be key to reducing damage from inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as IBD.  Furthermore, retinoic acid is a small hydrophobic molecule, meaning that it can diffuse freely through cell membranes.  This reduces the possibility that the output retinoic acid will become trapped inside Device 1 as inclusion bodies.  Finally the biochemical production of retinoic acid"

Just in case, and for the sake of time as a backup, I have ordered a new iLOV BB REV with a lower delta g. Additionally, I will run a PCR today with 0.8 uL of DMSO, 3% of volume, hoping that takes care of the issue with the primer secondary structure.

Unlike the emission spectrum for our red-light producing S248T variant , the spectrum differs greatly from the expected; there is a small peak at roughly the correct location (557nm), but also a shoulder at approximately 580nm and a further peak at 600nm. This is due to the fact that the cells were suspended in citrate buffer, pH4.8, to help the luciferin enter the cells. At pH 7, the luciferase peaks in the yellow green region and does not make red light.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 on the next page demonstrate the difference in spectral output due to the pH of the buffer solution.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor IRES_-_-_TEXT.html," incorporated a 6nt gap region, and performed blunt-end ligation to re circularize the plasmid. Post recircularization, we re-transfected E Coli with the gap-containing plasmid, and once again tested in vitro transcription with varying levels of theophylline.
Figure 5: Modified IRES with gap sensor trial. In order these tube are 0.1mM Theophylline, 1mM Theophylline, 10mM Theophylline and 30mM Theophylline, and on the the far right is the negative control (no theophylline).
Even with the  gap introduced, and utilizing sequence confirmed DNA for the sensor, we did not observe differing levels of fluorescence when treated with different levels of theophylline.
Ultimately we concluded based on this data that we were not able to replicate the IRES sensor behavior of the Ogawa paper. We suspect that there is some important experimental parameter that we unknowingly did not replicate (Mg concentration? RNA cleaning process? In vitro translation time? etc.). Nonetheless we believe that this system could be an extremely powerful in vitro synthetic tool, because if it could be optimized to work as well as the data Ogawa reported this could be an easy ""plug and play"" sensing platform that allows maximal user design flexibility to customize both the desired target and the desired response. In the interests of ensuring that the broader iGEM community has the opportunity to benefit from this work and the potential of this system, we BioBricked it ( BBa_K2027015 ), in hopes that in hopes that it might be helpful to teams in the future interested in creating maximally flexible biosensors.

Upscaling
The candidate is later produced in a larger reactor to simulate industrial settings. The importance of this is step is to test the system in a bigger volume due to oxygen pockets being more present in up-scaled settings.
Industry
Finally, the VHb technology is integrated into the companies production pipeline. Based on what we learned from consulting with experts, we do not expect VHb to pose any issues during purification of the final product.
Comparison with other potential solutions
The use of large-scale bioprocesses and recombinant DNA technology has made possible the production of proteins in quantities that are rarely obtained from natural sources [3]. On a large scale, the economical feasibility of an expression system relies on an optimization of the specific productivity and/or the cell productivity which are limited by, among other factors, the oxygen supply and its transfer to the growing cell population [3][4]. Oxygen availability is a common limiting factor in this type of processes due to the poor solubility of oxygen in aqueous solutions and the high oxygen consumption rate of the high cell-density population [1].
The oxygen transfer rate in aqueous solution is influenced by different physical and chemical parameters like the solubility, the turbulence of the fluid, the aeration rate and the oxygen concentration of the gas sparged in the bioreactor among others [5]. Current solutions to increase oxygen transfer are limited to physical approaches due to the highly detrimental economical impact on the process associated with a change of the sparging gas to pure oxygen. In consequence, the most used approaches to increase the oxygen transfer rate in a large- scale bioreactor are increasing the stirring and aeration rates. These methods to control the dissolved oxygen level are popular due to the low capital cost required for their implementation. Nevertheless, the fact that recombinant organisms, like yeasts, are sensitive to mechanical stress constrain the implementation of these solutions to limited ranges of the stirring speed and the aeration rate [5].
Our solution, on the other hand, challenges pre-existing ones by introducing a molecular approach that could potentially remediate the issue of limited growth due to oxygen deprivation without causing any physical damage to the organism and the product (e.g. a recombinant protein). The integration of our system incorporates the plug-and-play concept of synthetic biology. The provided constructs come pre-assembled and ready to use by simply inserting the sequence of the desired protein to up-scale.
Our method provides a way to increase the intrinsic ability of"

Formal Lab Session - 29th July 2009
Introduction
In yesterday's lab session we conducted mini-preps for three sets of JM109 E. coli cells which contained BioBricks BBa_C0056, BBa_B1002 and BBa_R0077 (seen as we picked three colonies for each of the BioBrick trasnformants there was a total of nine mini-preps conducted). A sample of these prepped plasmids were then run on agarose gel; although the undigested plasmid samples couldn't determine whether the DNA was in fact the BioBrick incorporated within the correct plasmid the gel certainly showed that the samples were consistent (trulin out contamination).
The next step in the lab plan is to digest samples of these 9 mini-preps and then run these fragments on agarose gel by DNA Gel Electrophoresis. As well as this, the team needs to consider another attempt at transforming E. coli with the BioBricks BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076 (the transformations which didn't yield colonies on LB + ampicillin plates). In addition the team needs to start to freeze down cells which will probably be needed in the future.
Practical Outline
Before the day is out the team needs to carry out the following:
Carry out a restriction digest on the 9 mini-preps using enzymes EcoRI and PstI
Run the digest products on gel through DNA Gel Electrophoresis.
Transform JM109 E. coli cells with BioBricks BBa_C0077 and BBa_C0076
Inoculate tubes containing 5ml LB (+ antibiotic) with the cells that are to be frozen down

University_of_Sheffield,2008,Team:University of Sheffield #Project_-_-_TEXT.html," to amount of pathogens recognised as contamination and if this amount high enough to trigger the response in the receptor. Second question asks how fusion would decrease efficiency of the receptor. Answering these questions is crucial to assess if the machine based on fusion receptor would be of any practical use.
We think that fusing two domains from two different but similar receptors to build a new one could be a general approach to embrace during making biosensors that are based on  a foreign receptor.
The Native E.coli Pathway
Downstream the Fusion Kinase
The sensing event triggers the phosphorilation of the CqsS-BarA and stimulates the transfer of phosphate group downstream the signaling cascade. Naturally, E.coli passes the phosphate group from BarA to its response regulator UvrY. This particular protein then binds to DNA triggering the transcription of small regulatory RNA called CsrB - Carbon Storage Regulator B. The most complicated part of the pathway is that CsrB inhibits CsrA. CsrA in turn inhibits a whole set of genes depicted in the table on the left ( plus represents activation, minus - inhibition).
One of the genes that CsrA inhibits is responsible for biofilm adhesion protein formation  - PGA. This particular operon was our target for reporter molecule insertion. More details about pgaABCD operon can be found below.
Reference for the images: [2]
Fluorescent Reporter
Introduction
The initial plan was to introduce a Green Fluorescent reporter molecule under one of the genes controlled by small regulatory RNA called CsrA. So as not to reduce the viability of the cell as well as to avoid any possible “noise” in the engineered system, the gene choice required several attempts.
Re-usable testing kit
The plan to have a micro – chip for sensing biological water contamination ideally would include a possibility of reusing it. Thus, the aim of our project was to use GFP with an LVA tag (AANDENYALAA). This would mean that the GFP would have an amino acid tag targeted by  housekeeping proteases and would be degraded within 45 minutes once there is no more stimulation for gene expression. This in turn would mean that the E.coli system sensing V.cholerae presence in water would stop fluorescing once the concentration of CAI-1 molecules decreased up to tolerable level. [2]
The idea to include degradable GFP in our project was taken from the Andersen, J.B et al. (1998) New Unstable Variants of Green Fluorescent Protein for Studies of Transient Gene Expression in Bacteria"

Endosomal uptake
Varga et al. 2005
Upon reaching the target kidney cells, the gene doping viral vectors infect the cells. The infection process and production of gene doping EPO was modeled through a series of kinetic equation. Kidney cells have a mean lifespan of around 57 days. Upon their death, the infected cells release the gene doping DNA back into the bloodstream as cell free DNA (cfDNA). This increases the detection window of the gene doping DNA.
Figure 11. Cellular uptake of gene doping vectors. Figure was inspired by Varga et al. 2005 .
Detailed Intracellular Gene Delivery Model
Cellular uptake
After the uptake of the vectors in the tissue, the stage of cellular uptake ensues. In this process we modelled multiple steps as indicated in Figure 11 according to a model first developed by Varga et al. 2005 . The cellular uptake of gene doping vectors as depicted in Figure 11 can be dissected into multiple steps described by a set of coupled differential equations, for which the constants are given in Table 3.
First, the complex is taken up by endocytosis after which it is either degraded or taken up, as represented by equations 6 and 7.

First run - Benchmark Test
As a test phase, before advancing to more complex designs,           we ran the protocol with Aspartic acid which is Tar receptor's native ligand. This was done in order to make sure that Rosetta can ""handle""           the Tar protein, meaning it does not create unnecessary or drastic changes in the protein.
From this design process we received four output structures (after filtering) with 3-5           mutations each, all of which in the binding pocket. These results proved that Rosetta           can recognize and work with the Tar ligand-binding domain (LBD).
Fig. 2: Design results after filtration for native Tar ligand- Aspartic acid.
Protocol automation
For the purpose of our work, we automated the different steps of the protocol,           including the filtering process, turning it into a single main script file complete           with well-documented instructions. This script also enables easy modification           of the filtering parameters to suit the specific ligand being used in the design. For more information           see our software tool .
Redesigning for new ligands
Using the Rosetta software's designs, we attempted to construct several new ligand binding sites for different materials:
- Histamine
- Lactose and glucose
- Rohypnol
- Ampicillin
Histamine
Histamine is known to be found in decaying food, especially rotten fish. This was our motivation for redesigning the Tar LBD to bind Histamine, as a proof of concept for this computational design technique. This ligand is a           derivative of Histidine, which is also an amino acid as Aspartic acid, the native Tar ligand. This increases the chances of a successful result.
Figure 1 and video 1 demonstrate the library for Histamine ligand we obtained after running several cycles and filtration.
Fig. 1: Alignment of Tar ligand-binding domain (LBD). The alignment presents            the 11 variants in the library with the native Tar (wild type).
Video 1: 3D imaging of the 11 variants in the library with             the native Tar (wild type), each color represents a different variant. As expected, the mutations             can be seen near the binding pocket.
Analysis of the results shows two main regions of mutations, one around amino acid           number 34 in the LBD sequence and the second around the 115th amino acid. These           results led us to design and perform a two-step cloning assay,           in each step we insert the mutations with single PCR reaction.

I decided to take the list of metabolites already defined in the code and generate a new list which only included metabolites with cytoplasm compartments (Tom and I eventually realized that these metabolites are the only ones we are interested in given we are only concerned with “dummy” exchange reactions). With time and effort, I was finally able to generate a new list entitled metname. And from this list, after defining the new metabolite ids as exchange reactions, I was also to make new sij.txt, rxn.txt, and rxntype.txt output files.

Recalculating with new Metabolites
J_exp17
After compiling my new metabolite input files, I started tweaking with the max biomass code that Laura and I have been using to run FBA. Other than including these additional files in the code, I also included a loop statement, which iteratively runs through each metabolite. The data generated from each loop was then placed in an output file, which included max biomass, max ATP, and max flavodoxin.
Initially I set my max biomass constraint to the max biomass determined from running the code. However, setting it to this parameter overconstrained my output file. For example, only 9 of the metabolites had maximum ATP values other than the ATPmreq (3.15), and only 4 of them produced some amount of flavodoxin (all other metabolites produced none). Tom suggested setting the constraint to the original N2 WM1788 max biomass to see if I would get a wider range of figures. Sure enough, there was a much more diverse set of outputs, and almost all of the metabolites produced flavodoxin.

Carbon Constraints
J_exp18
In order to standardize my outputs, and make any viable recommendations to the UWash team for improving the model, Tom recommended that I constrain the amount of substrate in each exchange reaction. And to do so by the number of carbon molecules in each metabolite. We used glucose as a template, and set the supply at 60 (half the amount supplied by the 6 carbon atoms in glucose (20 per molecule)). I also compressed the list of exchange reactions to only include those metabolite who have at least one carbon atom. We planned on dividing the supply by the number of carbon atoms in each metabolite, so dividing by zero carbon atoms would result in computational errors. It took some time reformatting my input files to only include these carbon­containing"

Besides, the                         accessibility for this technology allows an increased                         food quality without being a big issue for the familiar                         economy.
3. Increasing productivity
In 2011, the world’s population reached seven billion                         people. By 2050, it will surpass nine billion, meaning                         that it will be necessary to produce 70% more food (                         11). One of the biggest problems regarding this issue                         is the low productivity of some crops. Crops that                         suffer from this problem need more resources, higher                         land extension and are prone to be more expensive,                         compared to High Yielding Varieties of the same                         crop.
High Yielding Varieties of maize, rice and wheat were                         developed in the 1960’s (12). These varieties had the                         common characteristic of being semi-dwarf. This meant                         that photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced,                         and the assimilates are redirected to grain production,                         increasing the yield of the crop. Later studies found                         that semi-dwarf varieties had a mutation in the pathway                         of gibberellin synthesis, making the plant shorter. In                         particular, semi-dwarf rice has a mutation in                         gibberellin-20-oxidase gene (Ga20ox) (13). With                         HYPE-IT, any rice variety which does not have the                         semi-dwarf phenotype can be edited to obtain the same                         crop with higher productivity.
This is the case of the well-known Bomba rice variety                         from Valencia, Spain. It is commonly used for paella,                         and its organoleptic properties make it very valuable                         for the consumers. However, this rice is expensive and                         needs large land extensions due to its low yielding.                         Bomba rice has a high stem, it lacks the semi-dwarf                         characteristic. Using HYPE-IT, the Ga20ox gene of this                         variety could be edited, obtaining a semi-dwarf rice                         that would maintain the same organoleptic properties                         with a higher production.
Nutritional impact
Rice provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy supply                         (14). It contains vitamins, minerals and a high                         carbohydrate content. Bomba rice is more appreciated                         due to its organoleptic properties acquired during                         cooking. There are many varieties of semi-dwarf rice                         crops which are cultivated around the world"

iCG model
Description
The script iCG model creates a linear discriminant analysis model to discriminate between natural bases and unnatural bases in the sequence context that is present in the DNA samples used to compute the model. As an input, the script needs paths to directories containing sequencing data filtered by iCG filter: One directory containing data of a DNA sample with the UBP being analyzed, and at least one containing natural bases at the position of interest. For these datasets, the program identifies the exact location of the position of interest in the raw data of every read, taking into consideration the alignment data previously produced by nanoraw. Then, the mean raw signal in the normalized intervals from two bases upstream to two bases downstream of the position of interest is calculated for every read. Figure 4 gives an example of how this processing is performed.
Fig. 3: Determination of Mean Normalized Signals at positions -2 to +2.The plot on the left hand side shows the normalized signal traces of reads originating from a DNA sample containing C at the position of interest, plotted against the normalized and corrected sequence position using nanoraw. For positions -2 to +2 relative to the position of interest, the mean normalized signal is calculated for every read individually. The table on the right hand side lists the average characteristics of this group regarding these sequence positions.
With this step, a template dataset consisting of entries for every read in every directory passed to iCG model is created. Each entry holds the mean signal for the five base positions at the position of interest and a group identifier indicating to which input directory the read belongs. The script then applies linear discriminant function analysis to this template dataset in order to create an equation system that classifies the different groups of data based"

Edinburgh_OG,2016,Team:Edinburgh OG#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," with humans as they engineered Escherichia coli as a vector to deliver peptide drugs to the human gut and thus sewage and water systems (NTU-Taida iGEM 2012). Other examples of iGEM projects that are associated with the release of GMOs to the environment are the Imperial College London 2011 team, which used genetically modified E. coli to secrete the auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA) to prevent erosion (Imperial College London iGEM 2011), and the Lethbridge 2011 team, which developed a toolkit based on genetically modified E. coli to be used for the cleanup of polluted lakes (University of Lethbridge iGEM 2011).
One  has to consider that, once released, GMOs cannot be retrieved and this poses a major risk to the environment. For instance, the differences in the physiology of synthetic and natural microorganisms might alter the manner those interact with their surroundings. Furthermore, the GMOs may survive, evolve and adapt quickly, hence competing successfully with wild-type strains. Another important risk is their gene transfer ability, based on which GMOs could take up genetic material from the environment or exchange it with other microorganisms (Dana et al. 2012).
CURRENT REGULATIONS AND RISK ASSESSMENT PRACTICE
Since the events in the US of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks on that same year, security concerns have increased due to the increasing threat of biological or chemical terrorist attacks. These concerns have been compounded by recent developments in the SynBio toolkit through which it is now possible, for example, to synthesise entire microorganisms (Hamilton 2015). As a consequence, these incidents have extended the concerns about biosecurity among the entire research community. Therefore, new efforts have been made towards designing new ways to hinder malicious uses of these developed technologies (Garfinkel et al. 2007).
A proper and integral way to approach the biosafety and biosecurity aspects is through risk assessment methods that evaluate SynBio activities and techniques in order to determine whether they can be deemed as safe in terms of research or commercialization, or both (Schmidt 2009).
As the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) along with the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols – its two supplementary agreements – address, SynBio activities and their risk assessment methods must comply with local regulatory frameworks and international legislation that oversee biosafety and biosecurity (Marles-Wright 2016).  For instance, the European Union has regulations regarding the exposure chain of potential hazards of genetic engineering applications to human"

Human Practices: Teaching
Giving students an insight to the controversial questions within synthetic biology and its many perks
In May 2016 we first reached out to a group of high school students ranging between the ages of 15 and 18, who had all undertaken biology as part of their A level education.
The concept of iGEM had already been introduced into their curriculum through an extended exam question based on a scientific article discussing synthetic biology, iGEM and the use of standard biological parts, so we took the opportunity to expand on these principles and help students apply them to a host of real life situations.
The overall aim was to inspire students with an innate interest in biology (just like us) to pursue these new ideas in more depth and possibly be influenced into studying these even further as they progress through their education. Naturally we also aimed to make the project interesting, thought provoking, collaborative and fun!
Following a positive response from both teachers and pupils about becoming involved in our project, we developed an online educational programme composed of case studies , which was accessible through our main website.
image would be good here-anything educational
The Programme
Our education programme incorporated work on 4 main areas (detailed below). For each area the student had to imagine themselves in a position of authority and respond to an issue at hand. We also emphasized the importance of ethical decision making. Just because we have the know-how, does it give us the right to continue to modify our world with biology and what are the risks and benefits of doing so.
How does it work?
Each of the first 3 areas constituted 2 separate case studies linked to a variety of resources (videos, scientific articles, images and websites). One main question was set in relation to each available case, encouraging students to research specific questions and present an opinion, idea or perspective on one of the two options.
Each set of 2 cases were left running on the website for a period of 2 weeks, following which work was submitted by email to a central contact point and assessed by the Human Practices team.
Any submission was carefully read and individuals or groups were given personalized feedback by email (we were always impressed with the quality of the pieces entered!).

Voigt, author of “Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers” is going to help us with a valuable gift: a plasmid to secrete ADF-3 in salmonella. With this plasmid we can obtain the sequence of the spider silk protein ADF-3.
April 2-8, 2012
We transformed the backbone pSB1K3, so that we could amplify it when our primers arrive. Later we made and ordered the primers for our next experiment: basically the same constructs as before (GFP Reporter Plasmid) but with ADF-3 instead of sfGFP.
Ulises met with Dr. Angélica Fierro, and she accepted to be our advisor in protein modeling! Besides, we contacted Cheryl Hayashi, a well-known scientist that works with spider silk (she even spoke at TED!) [link: http://www.ted.com/talks/cheryl_hayashi_the_magnificence_of_spider_silk.html ]
We asked her if she could send us the genetic sequences EF595245 and EF595246, but later we knew that those parts are not compatible with our purposes. They are fosmids and the silk sequence is only a small portion of those clones.  The fosmids are low copy number and difficult to propagate. Then, it´s  better to work with ADF-3.
Additionally, we wrote to Dr. Sang Yup Lee, author of one of the paper “Native-sized recombinant spider silk protein produced in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli results in a strong fiber”. They produced and spun into fiber a 284.9 kDa recombinant protein of the spider Nephila clavipes in E. Coli, and we asked if he could send us his spider silk protein. Unfortunately, we didn´t receive an answer. April 9-15, 2012  The School of Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile makes every year a fair of entrepreneurship and technological innovation called Ingenia. The deanship of the Faculty of Engineering is so interested in us that wants that we form part in a conversation table to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. We will have also our own stand in the fair!

Tianjin,2012,Team:Tianjin#Modeling#Propagation_-_-_TEXT.html,"ω：The social welfare brought about by awareness of the problem;;
a: The total cost of the advertisement;
Q(t): the average social welfare;
E: response factor which means the level of response of A(t) to V(t).
Establishment of Our Model
In the propaganda of genetic pollution, with more and more people knowing and becoming familiar with them, the speed of transmission will approach an equilibrium state. The advertisement will increase the speed through which the people get to know the problem, and the level increased will be directly related to the intensity of the advertisement. This approach will only impact those who are not aware of the problem. What is more, natural attenuation is an inherent property of all the objects, which means the speed of propagandize will decrease as the advertising time goes by. Based on the above description, we can establish our differential equation as shown in equation (1)
Therefore, if the A(t)=0 or V(t)=M, we can have the equation (2)
In order to solve the equation (1), we choose the following model to describe the intensity of advertisement (the pulsing schedule).
Within the duration of (t1, t</sub>1</sub>+T), if the cost of public service advertisement is a，then we have: A=a/T substitute it into the equation (1),we can have equation (3)
Sinceβ, a, T, t1, M are all constants, we can assume
Then we have:
If we assume: V(t1)=V1
then：
When 0≤t≤t1, t≥t1+T we can have:
The general solution is:
When t=0, V(0)=V0
So
Then:
When t=t1+T, V(t)=V2
Thus,
Finally, we can have
Thus the general tendency chart is shown Fig. 1.
Figure 1. The tendency curve of advertising speed (from TJU iGEM Team 2012)
Model Analysis
If we use V0 to represent the initial propaganda speed, thus the magnitude of V0 will be directly related to the problem itself. We can discuss and obtain the optimum beginning time t1 of different problems with different V0. We can set the maximizing the average profits from the beginning of the problem till the end of the advertisement as our objective function (OBJ), then the following optimal value function.
Then:
Model 1
If V0 are very small, this means the genetic pollution related problem is difficult to gain public attention. However, the potential dangers hidden beside will be"

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Citrobacter-Freundii#1-Replicon-compatibility_-_-_TEXT.html," therefore these replicons are compatible with C. freundii.
C. freundii cells with the multi-host plasmid (pTG262) did not grow at all. The most probable reason is that the cmlR gene (which confers chloramphenicol resistance) in pTG262 is a Gram positive one (from Lactobacillus) which works much less well even in E. coli than the standard iGEM cmlR gene, so if C. freundii is a little more chloramphenicol-sensitive or expresses it a little worse, it would explain why no growth was seen on this plate.
pTG262 characterisation
One reason why the C. freundii cell transformed with pTG262 did not grow may be that the C. freundii cells are less resistant to chloramphenicol than E. coli, so they were plated onto plates with varying concentrations of chloramphenicol (Table 2) to see whether they grow at all. pSB2K3 was used as a negative control, as it does not have chloramphenicol resistance.
Table 2 - Table indicating the amount of chloramphenicol added to each (20ml) plate.
Method
The plates were incubated for two days and growth was observed on the 5 and 10 μl chloramphenicol plates.  In order to assess whether growth on these plates was due to the activity of the resistance gene on the plasmid or due to some innate resistance to chloramphenicol, 20 μl of C. freundii containing the plasmid or 20 μl untransformed C. freundii were plated out onto LB agar containing 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 μl chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C overnight. Close the method.
The C. freundii + pTG262 plasmid grew on all plates to some extent whereas the no plasmid control grew only below 8 μl chloramphenicol and there were fewer colonies on the plates compared to the C. freundii + pTG262. This suggests that the plasmid works, but very weakly.
Conclusions
We characterised the compatibility of Citrobacter freundii with the major replicon types used by iGEM
We extensively characterized the pTG262 plasmid to figure out why it was not working well in Citrobacter freundii
We have concluded that the other replicons are compatible with this organism

The synthetic biology community has not come to an agreement on the precise definition of “Human Practices”. The MIT iGEM team believes there are two main aspects of “Human Practices”: analysis of the risks, regulations, and barriers that impede the implementation of new technologies and community engagement.
We participated in a series of engagement exercises, educating our international collaborators to promote the formation of a new iGEM team, risk assessment of our project with Kenneth Oye, consulting with patients and doctors about potential application spaces for our research technology, educational outreach to the local Boston community, and collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to improve their projects and presentations.
MIT iGEM 2013: From Technology to Product
The team started with the goal of developing an exosome based cell-cell communication system. Because so little is known about targeting specific cargoes to exosomes, we were unsure of the feasibility of our project. Now that we have a characterized system, however, we can create a basic technological platform. In taking the first step towards creating a new product, we have chosen an application space, identified a potential market, and are interested in applying our technology to hepatocyte research and mouse model development.
Technological Platform
Although we focused our research on cell-cell communication, our work can be generalized. In essence, we engineered an exosome mediated protein export system. We believe this system can be useful across a range of application spaces; however, after considering the regulations we have narrowed our application space.
Choosing an Application Space & Considering Regulations
Because certain application spaces are tightly regulated, it can be difficult to implement a new technology. We considered three potential application spaces for our system: Research, Model Development, and Clinical Application. The exosome mediated protein export"

Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our team has worked with painstaking care to ensure the highest levels of safety throughout our project.
The E. coli strain DH5-alpha was used throughout our project. This is a Risk Group 1 laboratory strain of E. coli that has a low, but not nonexistent, virulence. Organisms classified as Risk Group 1 are not known to cause disease in healthy adults. Keeping with registration requirements for Risk Group 1 bacteria, all laboratory work was performed in an environment certified for Biosafety Level 1.
These strains of E. coli are generally not resistant to antibiotics. All bacteria were transformed with bacterial plasmids carrying our desired insert gene and antibiotic resistance to antibiotics commonly used in laboratories for selection (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, etc.), but will not interfere with potential clinical treatment. Neither plasmids nor their insert genes will affect virulence, infectivity or host range. 
Bacteria was cultured in 5mL volumes and all cultures and inoculations were performed in a biological safety cabinet. As part of our project we have coordinated the receipt and library preparation of several experimental Deinococcus strains of bacteria. These strains were cultured by the Daly group at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, pelleted and sent to us. These strains grow very slowly and at temperatures warmer than the human body, so pathogenicity is not a major concern when working with these species. Nevertheless, DNA was extracted from these samples inside a biosafety flow hood with a face pressure of over 100 ft / min. Solid waste (plates, flasks, etc), liquid waste (decanted culture supernatant), and work surfaces were disinfected using 10% bleach before disposal and biohazard disposal bins were used whenever necessary"

GOLD & INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICE
We took our market research, and all of the work we have done previously to improve our project, working on the data we collected from the surveys, the interviews and the data extraction. Moreover we took in consideration, the professional feedback we received from the fablabs and makerspaces owners to improve our biomaterial 3D printer design every step of the way.
Aside from the market research, we seek advice from professionals linked to our project and interviewed them to discuss our project and asking them the right questions.
Finally, we produced a study about fundamental research, to understand how our work would impact various scientific field, expanding from synthetic biology.
Fablab and Makerspace community
We decided to enter and discover the makerspace and fablab community by investigating first-hand as we went to more than 10 fablabs and interviewed the owners as well as the regular customers. We conducted the interviews with the same standard questionnaire in order to have valid data we can work on to make our market research.
We shot over 4 hours of footage, and reduced it to a video of 18 minutes, that summarize well the challenges facing the Fablab and Makerspace community as well as the use of a 3D printer.
The fablabs and makerspaces we visited are all spaces providing shared machines for a community of users that can use them for their personal projects. But beyond this similarity, we found out that those different places were actually extremely diverse, both in terms of their global vision and their type of users. Some aim to help people manufacture objects they need, or objects they want to make for fun; others are focused on common projects and education of the general public; some are for anyone in the neighborhood, while other are just for students; some spaces are for researchers to help them with their research and experiments, and others aim to help in prototyping projects that will eventually"
UCL,2013,Team:UCL E#Product#Supplies_-_-_TEXT.html,"ase enzyme joins two fragments of DNA together by forming a phosphodiester bond between them, fusing them together so that they cannot break away. The Quick LigationTM Kit joins two strands of DNA together in under 5 minutes, and is in an easy-to-use format that makes it perfect for use with Darwin Toolbox.
During DNA cloning, it is often necessary to check that the fragments of DNA amplified or cut out are the correct size and to purify them away from contaminants. In order to establish their size, a DNA ladder is necessary. The 1kb DNA Ladder is a suitable reference for a wide range of DNA fragment sizes, and so is an excellent match for use in Darwin Toolbox.

2 The iGEM Matchmaker
RHIT collaboration
During the summer we have had close contact with the Rose-Hulman team from Terre Haute, Indiana.  Our main advisor, Dr. Eivind Almaas, was present at another event at the Rose-Hulman university and came in contact with the team advisor from Rose-Hulman, Dr. Richard Anthony. They began discussing the possibility of a collaboration between the two teams, and 7/23/2012 we had our first video conference so the team members could meet and discuss what we could help each other with.
Our advisor, professor Eivind Almaas, with associate professor Richard Anthony, advisor of the RHIT iGEM team.
We agreed that the Rose-Hulman team would help us characterize our new pLLD BioBrick, and we would in return critique their mathematical model, and make a stochastic model of their system. We had a new video conference in august to update each other, and share experiences about the iGEM project as both teams are fairly new in this competition. This has been a fun experience, and exiting that we can help each other and share experiences across the globe!
We hope to meet the Rose-Hulman team in Boston in November, and to further continue our cooperation. The work we did for RHIT is available on our modelling page .
The iGEM Matchmaker
In the middle of the summer, we got the idea of the Matchmaker . What brought us to this idea was the fact that if you haven't already arranged a cooperation with another iGEM team, it is hard to find someone to cooperate with. We also knew that the NTNU iGEM team 2011 made many attempts to cooperate with other teams by sending out several emails, but they never recieved any answers. So we decided to make the Matchmaker, and so far, we"

Toronto,2016,Team:Toronto#HP-Impact_-_-_TEXT.html," superior knowledge of subject matter. Boaler (1997) observed two UK high schools’ math classes, one which emphasized structure and rote learning and one that emphasized self-directed problem-solving. The school that emphasized problem-solving performed better on the applied math test that Boaler administered. It also boasted a higher pass rate and smaller gender gap. Stepien, Gallagher, and Workman (1993) compared several problem-based high school courses with conventional courses and found that the students who were exposed to complex and ill-defined problems not only gained better problem-solving skills but also a better understanding of the subject material. Mehalik, Doppelt, and Schunn (2008) observed 46 grade 8 science classes in one urban public school district and found that an engineering, systems-based approach to teaching electricity was superior to the standard pedagogy, particularly with regard to poorly-achieving blacks. Thus, based on the repeated complex problems that an iGEM project poses, we would expect iGEM participants to see gains to problem-solving abilities and knowledge of synthetic biology vis-à-vis those who only learn through traditional methods.
Competition also provides benefits to engineers. Shehata and Schwartz (2015) wrote that:
The benefits of engineering competitions for students, as supported by recent engineering education research, can be summarized in the following ten points: increase student motivation, encourage deeper learning, improve student research methods, give students control over their learning, engage students with academic writing, provide opportunities for interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary work, encourage student innovation, increase student-to-student and student-to-faculty interaction, provide students with professional engineering skills including project management and professional communications skills, and provide students with real-world engineering design experience.
Their study of the Concrete Canoe Competition, Concrete Toboggan Competition, and American Concrete Institute Construction Competition subsequently confirmed all of these points. Recall that iGEM stands for international Genetically Engineered Machine; we would expect all of these benefits to accrue to participants of this particular engineering competition as well.
iGEM teams who wish to win a silver or gold medal at the Jamboree are now required consider the human practice implications of their project. This is similar to Project-Based Service Learning (PBSL), which focuses the standard engineering PBL around a problem facing a local or international community. While an iGEM team faces a choice of which problem to pursue and may never actually implement their solution, both involve deviating from a purely technical solution based on consultation with the afflicted stakeholders.

Guo Fuyu talking with middle school students in Hutian Middle School
According to a survey at Peking University, freshmen who have had a sense of higher education and sought for their interest in high school, get accustomed to college life and study remarkably faster than those who haven’t. We genuinely hope university students and professors across China can communicate more with high school students and help every single one find his or her interest worth pursuing their whole life as soon as possible. We especially hope that the students in second-tier cities and rural areas get the same chance of quality education as those in megacities.
From the talk, we also gained unexpected understandings of middle school students’ view on synthetic biology. Many students raised a lot of interesting questions, for example: “Can I be genetically modified to become a super warrior?” “Can I live forever?” “If I freeze my brain right after my death, can I revive?” We realized that there were strong wishes for these children to become stronger and live longer with the aid of synthetic biology, and that these questions were not easy to answer as they seemed.
Pre-school scientific education
While the idea to introduce the most cutting-edge science to children in kindergarten may sound outlandish, we can still spend a nice day with them and introduce them to science. Two of our team members did this in the kindergarten attached to Peking University. We designed a series of games with a science background: demonstrating the three phases of water, observing phase separation, constructing a 'phase separation' system with magnetic balls, and water drawing. The kids liked these games very much, which inspired us a lot.
It is a big challenge for us to tell the children about basic science, but we’re happy to see them enjoying the games which is also interesting and relaxing for us. We enjoyed the fascination with science, which can cross the boundary of age and life experience.
Kids playing marbling paint together
Ouyang Xiaoyi teaching kids about three states of water
This activity made us confident about the perspective of broad-based scientific communication, and we realized the we can communicate in both a 'meaningful' and 'interesting' way, where all the participants are equal and relaxed and the conversation is much more efficient.
Documentation of Peking iGEM as enlightenment for beginners

Global Mutagenesis
Modeling
The Math Behind Global Mutagenesis and Cas9 Selection
Random mutagenesis is a valuable technique because it produces novel protein structures with potentially useful functions. Unfortunately, global mutagenesis operations also generate a vast array of fruitless changes. In our project we define potentially useful mutations as mutations that occur within a small region of interest in a gene. To determine the ratio of potentially-useful-mutations to definitely-useless-mutations produced by a global mutagenesis operation, we take a dive into probability theory.
Consider the following scenario:
We grow a colony of cells from a single cell.
At each cell division, there is a probability p that the cell will mutate desirably.
The cell divides d number of times before being mini-prepped.
Our goal is to find the density of cells that have mutated desirably at the end of d divisions. To do so, we find the probability that any given cell has mutated desirably. Finding this probability is tricky because desirable mutations propagate throughout generations. We must therefore find the probability that any given cell in the final generation is NOT desirably mutated. The graphic below more readily demonstrates the math involved to analyze the cell population at the end of d divisions.
If the probability that any given cell is NOT desirably mutated is (1-p)d, the probability that any given cell IS desirably mutated is 1-(1-p)d. Rather than being concerned with cell mutations, we remember that we are truly interested in mutations of individual bases. Multiplying 1-(1-p)d by the size of our region, r, yields the probability that any given cell contains a potentially useful mutation.
We reach the following result:
Where M is the density of cells that have potentially useful mutations.
This model assumes that:
Cas9 always cuts the on-target site;
any off-target cuts are inconsequential;
all mutations are non-lethal.
The following describes a realistic application of our project:

How will genetic engineering and Synthetic Biology affect Indians in their everyday lives? The films above might indicate that the early reception from the farming community to biotech crops has been highly negative. This bears a very obvious comparison to Stuart Brand's much-touted example of the Amish's use of Genetically engineered Seed .
Local ways of telling stories
The second fantastic find was Level 10 Comics a Bangalore-based publisher of comic books. Below are some examples of their publications and here is an article about them.
Northern Song ""Set in a world inspired by Indian myth, Northern Song tells the tale of the mysterious Bala and his quest that takes him all over this mystical land""
The Rabhas Incident ""A mysterious virus that turns its victims to a feral, savage and rabid state has been released in Bangalore""
Shaurya ""Set against the backdrop of Mumbai, five gifted teenagers from different parts of the country, unite to overcome their personal differences and emerge as a unified front to take on the might of a globe-spanning terrorist organization.""
We'll be trying to get in touch with Level 10 Comics this week.
In the afternoon, we collated the myths under each heading, trying to find synbio myths that matched. How could we tell these stories through bacteria? Each group started to think about specific bacteria that would tell these stories. From mirror images to ecosystems, how can new ideas be mined from old stories? Do we need to make up new myths?
]
""Synbio Takes Myth and Makes History ""
The Centre for Everything hosted us with an evening of mythology with Arshia Sattar , Sanskrit scholar and translator of Valmiki's Ramayana . We began by going through the lists from the afternoon with Arshia, examining each myth and its connection to synbio.
Out on the terrace until late, we dipped into history, myth, truth, science, story-telling, expertise and navigating ten open tabs in your browser window.
In Hindu mythology (and life in general) we can think of everything working in an ecosystems - the myths are populated by gods and anti-gods. Each action brings about a consequence. Action and reaction, balance in an ecosystem between opposites, demons and gods. In the story of the Churning of the Ocean, we see gods and demons pitted against each other, neither could survive without the existence of the other, their position in the world depends on their context in the power struggle. In the demons' world-view, they should be on top and the gods naturally feel that the world is at rights when they are in control."
TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics background_-_-_TEXT.html," the results of the top-down approach towards understanding living systems is that we can now understand how certain substructures of complex living systems work, and sometimes even how they interact with other substructures. But there is still a very long road (if not endless) to completely understanding the complicated superstructure called life. A different result is that understanding substructures of living entities proceeded in creating these substructures artificially. It did not take long before they were implemented in simple organisms and were proven to function there, in some cases even more efficiently than the original ""natural"" system.
Impression of Jacques de Vaucanson's Canard Digérateur (Digesting Duck).
The Digesting Duck, an automaton  created by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1739 is an example of the principles of Descartes' mechanistic universe, which argues that we can begin to understand complex things by studying the most fundamental aspects of them - a concept known as reductionism. The duck appeared to have the ability to eat kernels of grain, and digest them. While the duck did not actually have the ability to do this - the food was stored in a container, and pre-stored feces was ""produced"" after minutes - Vaucanson hoped that a truly digesting automaton could one day be build.
The bottom-up approach of enhancing organisms has been going on since genetic engineering was applied first in 1973, although mankind has been altering live since they were able to manipulate crop growth and directed the reproduction of animals. What they did not know then was that they were manipulating DNA of descendant live forms, and thereby enhancing evolution for their own good. So what is different now? Are the attempts to manipulate DNA directly and implement it in an organism one step too far? Or is it nothing different from genetic engineering as researchers have been doing since the 70s? Research proposed by Craig Venter and others indicate that we are about to open the door to understanding what life is all about, and that synthetic biology is the key. Why does this next step scare some people? Are we afraid of the possible results? Do we care too much about our present perception of life? Scared of possible disappointed? But then again, should we be anxious? Maybe understanding the principles of life could give life more value. Moreover, it could well be that the reductionism approach is limiting in defining life. Maybe life has this property that does not let it explain in chemical and physical principles. Whether or not this might be true, getting to this point in evolution makes us morally obliged to think about such questions.

This assemble                                         gave us a plasmid that contain a T7 promoter, bacterial Ori, Amp resistance,                                         terminator and the LL37 protein along with a His tag.
Human practice
The iGEM Latin America Meet Up had place in our campus, we had the presence of                                         teams from Monterrey, Guadalajara, Chihuahua and virtual presence of teams from                                         Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. In this meet up the teams had the opportunity to                                         give a presentation such as pre-run to practice the one that has to be done in                                         Boston, in addition several specialists were there to analyse and give feedback                                         in the projects. The logistics of the visit to Universium was performed.
Week 27th
15 July- 21 July.
Summary
We had meetings with several teams seeking if we could collaborate with them and                                         see how the rest of the iGEM teams are doing to try and expand communication                                         around the scientific community. We also went on with the preparations for                                         Universum. We continued with the characterization of LL37 and the                                         transformation of E. coli. The DNA synthesize from IDT was delivered and the                                         first project insights could be achieved. This week Interlab was done in the                                         lab to obtain the results.
Wet lab
The plasmid with LL37 was transformed in E. coli strains as Rosetta gami and                                         BL21 (DE3), the transformations were successful as single colonies were                                         achieved. In order to verify the transformation plasmid extraction was                                         performed and positive results were obtained. The IDT sequences for collagen                                         type V (COL5), tenascin domain V (TCD5) and leptin (LEP) were resuspended in                                         bio mol water for the creation of stocks. A ligation to the plasmid psB1C3 was                                         performed by enzymatic restriction and T4 DNA ligation.
Human practice

Originally, we thought that the sequence of EF-1alpha promoter cloned from iDUET101a contained the full functional promoter region annotated in pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen). We believed that EF-1alpha did trigger transcription but failed to translate the GFP coding sequence due to insufficient 5’ untranslated region (UTR). After the regional jamboree, the promoter was re-cloned with additional 3' sequences after the identified TATA box to allow a longer 5’ untranslated region before the GFP coding DNA sequence. From the the results above, we believed that translation of GFP is successful this time.
Conclusion
The EF-1alpha promoter is fully functional and has a weaker transcriptional strength than the CMV promoter in HEK293FT cells.

Imperial_College,2016,Team:Imperial College#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," affect.  While the protocol has not existed in its current state since the beginning, working with it and trying to employ it has had a profound impact on the development of our project.  We cannot say that the creation of all of the many components of our project can be attributed to the S.T.I.R. protocol.  We can say that it helped to shape and clarify their development by organizing and structuring our thought process.  We hope that in the future, iGEM teams will be able to build on our new method and have it be the easiest method of employing the S.T.I.R. protocol without a “resident sociologist.”  Moreover, we hope that future iGEM teams take the time to use our method because of the many contributions reflexivity has brought to our project.  Here is a summary of the impact of our reflexive analysis:
Colour demonstration:
We realized that it was hard for people not familiar with our project to grasp the concept of co-culture.  Our project revolved around visual strategies.  Moreover, we had developed technology that allows for the ratiometric control of different cell populations.  Mixing different colours seemed like the best way to showcase our project and have it tie in with our overarching theme of visualisation.  After further reflecting on this, we found that this colour mixing technology could be further developed to create environmentally friendly clothing pigments or an easier method for mixing inks in industrial printing processes.
Development of the game:
We realized that many people associate bacteria with negative things, like disease.  We also realized the abundance of microbial consortia in nature that produce useful products like milk or cheese.  Furthermore, many people are completely unaware of the lab practices involved in synthetic biology.  We determined that there was a need for many people to be educated about the benefits of synthetic microbial consortia.  Our educational material needed to be far reaching and accessible.  Therefore, we decided to develop a mobile application called Go Culture.
Development of the web tool:
After discussions with researchers at the Center for Synthetic Biology at Imperial College, we realized that there was no standardized method for doing co-culture.  We learned that many researchers who would use co-culture do not because of the amount of preliminary experimental data and literature they would would need to review in order to conduct their experiments.  Therefore, we decided to create an online tool for researchers and iGEM teams to access for their future co-culture experiments.
Development of the visualisation strategy:
After discussions with students at the Royal College of Art about our project, we realized we were having difficulty communicating about our project with them"

What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
You should also describe what your results mean:
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.
Aquaculture tips brochure
How can we provide more help to fish farmers facing water quality and fish diseases problems? Our team members searched information and wrote a brochure for them. The brochure contained typical problems and tips to improve the water quality in each season, as well as symptoms and solutions for some widespread"

The AND-gate
We hypothesised that building a combination biosensor requiring the input of two Campylobacter-associated molecules would reduce the risk of false-positives. To do this we envisaged a biosensor genetic circuit in the form of an AND-gate. In electronic circuitry, an AND-gate is a form of switch that only activates an output in the presence of two positive input signals (Figure 1).
Figure 1: The AND-gate. A: An electronic circuit diagram representing an AND-gate. B: A “truth-table” representing the logic of the AND-gate schematic. 0 = Off and 1 = On. No inputs or only 1 active input leads to no output. Both inputs must be present to yield an output signal.
A genetic AND-gate uses transcriptional signalling in place of electricity. In the simplest form, we can design a genetic circuit where two gene products must be actively transcribed to produce an output signal. The interaction between the input and output signals can be direct or indirect, and we aim to test both types in this subproject.
The directly interacting genetic AND-gate we aim to test is gained by GFP into two individual protein subunits, either of which expressed alone would not be fluorescent. If both GFP subunits were to be transcriptionally controlled from separate promoters within the same cell, then an AND-gate would be formed. Only expression of both subunits at the same time would make the cells fluorescent. To split GFP we attempted to improve parts designed by a previous iGEM team, Davidson Missouri 2007 , who split the GFPmut3b part E0040 into a 151 aa N-terminal fragment (named GFP1: I715019 ) and an 83 aa C-terminal fragment (named GFP2: I715020 ). These parts were designed for fusion to other proteins for Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays for validation of protein-protein interactions. As such, the N-terminal part lacked a stop codon, and the C-terminal part lacked a start codon. The 2015 team NUDT_CHINA altered the GFP1 part to include a stop codon, now labelled K1789003 , but we would have to design a PCR amplification to add a start codon to the GFP2 part for our uses.
For an indirectly interacting genetic AND-gate the inputs do not themselves act together as the output. The indirect gate we planned can be generated by splitting the"

Finally, the iGEM team of Nankai University organized a visit to the iGEM lab to get more closer with iGEM and our experiments. Through our publicity, many students showed great interest in synthetic biology, which is a meaningful publicity.
Team Communication
The iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University
On July 6th, we held the iGEM University Joint Conference in Nankai University. This event aimed to promote communication and cooperation between various universities teams, and at the same time carry out science popularization to show the charm and essence of iGEM. This was the first time that our school iGEM team successfully conceived and held this large-scale joint conference. Each team introduced their experiments and other aspects of the work. After the show, we discussed our experiments and look for teams that can cooperate according to our needs, the exchange atmosphere was warm and reflected a good collision of thoughts. Finally, we organized everyone to visit our iGEM Lab to get a better understanding about our experiments.
TEAM NPU-China
When we visited Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, we happened to meet Team NPU-China. We discussed our experiment and Human Practice and put forward some suggestions about their project. At the same time, we told them that we had some problems in Tet A gene expression recently. Fortunately, they suggested that we should communicate with team XJTU-China because our projects were very similar. Through their suggestions, we successfully communicated with team XJTU-China and improved our experiments. What a wonderful experience!
CCiC
The 5th CCiC Conference was held in Shanghai University of Science and Technology from August 27 to 31. More than 60 teams from China participated in the Conference. The conference is divided into two parts: presentation and posters. Teammates of NKU_CHINA listened carefully to each team's statement and learned their advantages and our wonderful show was so Brilliant that many teams communicated with us. In the evening, all the teams are showing their unique design posters. However, our poster attracted a large group of people to seek cooperation. Thanks to our excellent presentation and poster display, we won the best Poster Award, which was a great encouragement for us. After the meeting, we exchanged views and ended our travel to CCiC meeting with a group photo.

Dalhousie,2017,Team:Dalhousie#BobMcdonald_-_-_TEXT.html," learn the science very quickly, and I found that easy because I was interested in it, so I started to make science fun using props, demos, my own body, all kind of things, like standing people’s hair up with static electricity. Freeze flowers in liquid nitrogen and all the stuffs. So out of that, the media would come out once a while and said, would somebody come on and talk about something in space. I was also really interested in space. So I started appearing on television and news, and I was all excited about it. Like oh, here’s what happened, we landed on Mars today, so it was really great. And the television producer said, hey, you’re really good, do you want to come back and do our news program? So I started doing it. And one thing led to another led to another led to another. I was asked to do educational videos in the United States, I was asked to do a kids’ television show in the 80’s that was called Wonderstruck that was on CBC television, half hour preshow, and then Quirks and Quarks was looking for a host so they asked me to do that. So one thing just led to another and I always I said I’d try it. And each time I had to learn really fast how to do it, but I found that people would help if I wanted to do it. So that’s the story of my life. Took advantage of opportunities that came along and always said yes. Angela: That’s great. The fact that you are interested in it. I am pretty sure you did a better job than some people who went to journalism school and they had a schema in their head that they have to do it certain ways… So I think what you are doing probably makes your program more fun and interesting. Bob: Well, I find that my lack of phD actually puts me closer to my audience. Because the journalist is between the science and the audience. The scientists know a whole lot and they speak their own language. So, the journalist has to understand that language and translate it over here for the audience who doesn’t speak that language. We are translators. I have found that, I grew up speaking the lay language, I understand this so I can translate. But when I hear something in science, I am always thinking in my mind, I think pictures. So if you are talking about enzymes breaking down cellulose, I think of scissors cutting up those little threads. Which is sort of like what they do right? Making them into little pieces. So that’s what I’m thinking"

Spot test of the engineered bacteriophages after His-tag purification, the left spot is the T4 phage, which is modified at the Hoc-Protein and the right spot is the negative control, where native T4 phages were used.
Phage Genome Engineering
An additional advantage of Phactory is the possibility of rebooting bacteriophages from their genomic template, which is especially important for genetic engineering of bacteriophages. With home-made cell extract it was possible to manufacture an engineered MS2 RNA phage, where a polyhistidine-tag was added on the phage RNA polymerase. The genomic template was generated via gibson assembly and PCR amplification. After purification of the engineered genome, phages were assembled in our self-made P15 cell extract. A plaque assay confirmed the successful assembly of functional phages with a titer of 3 × 107 PFU/ml.
To test the his-tag modification, the Phages were amplified in a bacterial culture flask. After lysis of the bacteria the tagged polymerase was purified from the supernatant by nickel affinity chromatography. An SDS-PAGE proved that the 62 kDa Protein remained in the Nickel column due to the successfully engineering of an inserted His-tag.
SDS gel of the His-tag purified MS2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase
Quality Control
Quality control covers several aspects of phage manufacturing including phage functionality, endoxin levels and DNA purity. We found that
we are able to produce functional phages in our cell extract
the cell extract of our optimized strain has an endotoxin content below the detection limit and our regular self-produced cell extract has fewer endotoxins than the commercial cell extract
next-generation sequencing allowed us to accurately quantify contamination
phenol-chloroform extraction leads to a large amount of contaminating DNA which complicates phage assembly
next-generation sequencing helped us to improve our purification protocols, leading to improved phage assembly
Assessing Phage Functionality by Plaque Assays
We performed a Plaque Assay to determine the activity of the viable phages (titer) in our assembly batch. By creating serial dilutions, we were able to calculate a plaque forming units/milliliter (PFU/ml) value. The plaque assay protocol was used.

The network inference from the microarray expression profile, for protein concentration profiles, from promoter sequence data, etc, can be done in the DREAM (Database for Reverse Engineering Analysis and Method) project. Meanwhile, the network design can also be done to the required profile. So we will start from here!
So the aims for our project: 1.Present a structure frame for network design 2.Redesign the known networks to test the strategy 3.In silico, design a network with a interesting behavior 4.Realize the network in the cell
And the problems are really hard for our projects. Actually, everything we want to do is we have never done before. So we will try our best.
Week 4
The problems we faced may be harder than our imagination. First, the search space is too large to traverse. The number of potential topologies is , while K is the number of interaction forms and n is the number of species. It is an astronomy number if n >=3. Second, the non-linear system identification is still an unsolved problem in the present. The parameters can not be recognized exactly even the topologies are meeting the requirements. Some approximation should be done mathematically. First, the networks we designed are restricted to the simple network, which means the reactors are at most two kinds in one reaction. The searching space can be shrunk in this way, while all the dynamic behaviors can be simulated with this simple model. Second, we may need some restrictions to the interactions forms and the parameters. The more information is, the better system we can get by the design process.
Week 6
The frame of the software has been constructed as indicated in right figure.
week 9
From the analysis, we should get the information of a reaction from three aspects: topology, formula and the parameters. The optimized algorithms are required with the three different layers problems. For the bottom layer, the parameters are optimized with the known forms of formula. For the upper layer, we need genetic algorithm to look for the formula forms that meet the requirement. And for the top layer, genetic algorithm is also employed to optimize the topology. And I will work with the selection of the formula and the topology.
week 16
The genetic algorithm has been implemented with c++ and tested with some benchmarks. Next, we discussed about the data structures for the program, including the input form and input data, the output form and output data, the description of a reaction, and the items considering in formula. According to the discussion results, I began to implement the whole frame for the program"

Welcome to Johns Hopkins iGEM
        The International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM) is an annual intercollegiate challenge that seeks to answer the question: ""Can simple biological systems be built from standard, interchangeable parts and operated in living cells? Or is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in this way?"" The newly-formed iGEM team at Johns Hopkins is composed of mostly undergraduate students with diverse majors ranging from Materials Science Engineering to Biology. While the team has graduate and faculty input, it is almost totally undergraduate run. The iGEM teams work over the summer at their, respective university, and then attend the iGEM Jamboree in November to present their work. We plan to create novel genetic parts that could be added to the existing iGEM registry of biological parts. The MIT iGEM Registry of Parts is the databank of biological standards to which iGEM teams from 2003 and onward have contributed. Currently, the databank only has 16 yeast ""biobricks"". These biobricks are reporters, tags, plasmids and other useful interchangeable genetic parts, that could one day revolutionize genetic and synthetic biology. By the end of our project, we will have most likely doubled the amount of yeast biobricks in the registry.

Lab work safety
We're payign attention to every detail in our experiment to guarantee the safety of ourselves and our teamates.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Manual, the rank of our lab is classified as BSL1 (bio-safety level1), the one with lowest risk. Under proper precautionary measures, researchers wouldn't be threat with any harms.
All team members are required to undergo professional biological lab training before experiments started. The training areas cover molecular biology, biochemistry, cytology, and plant physiology. Safety instructions set prior to the start are always followed strictly. We wear white coats, gloves and masks all the time in the lab as required. The UV light of laminar flow is kept open before and after experiment to kill bacteria.
We're very concerned with the safety of team members. The dry- and wet-work space are separated to prevent contamination from reagent. Additionally, lab is cleaned everyday and eating is not allowed in the lab.

CymA
CymA, a c-type tetraheme cytochrome protein located in the CM, belongs to the NapC/NrfH family of quinol dehydrogenases principal in bacterial anaerobic respiration [4]. CymA is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by a single transmembrane domain with the rest of the protein extending into the periplasmic space; four heme groups are covalently bound to the periplasmic portion of the CymA protein. CymA has been shown to be essential to the reduction of Fe(III), DMSO, fumarate, nitrate, manganese and nitrite in Shewanella species through its shuttling of electrons from the cytoplasm to a number of different PECs [4,5]. Whereas NrfH proteins form strong bonds with their redox partners, CymA appears to bond only transiently to its partners in the periplasm. This is consistent with its ability to interact with many different PECs, offering   Shewanella sp. respiration flexibility and versatility [4].
MtrA
Reverse electron flow experiments have shown that direct electron transfer occurs between CymA and MtrA, a periplasmic decaheme c-type cytochrome, during in vitro Fe(III) oxide reduction [4]. Recently, the structure of MtrA has been elucidated through the use of small angle x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation; due to its elongated and 104 Å rod-like shape, MtrA has been postulated to function as an electron shuttle between CymA and OMCs MtrC or OmcA [2,3]. Cross-linking by formaldehyde treatment has shown that MtrA is physically associated with MtrB [7].
MtrB
While the structure of MtrB has not been determined, based on sequence analysis, MtrB has been posited to be an OM b-barrel, porin-like protein consisting of 28 transmembrane b-strands [1,4,7]. Experiments done with mtrB deletion mutants have shown that MtrB is required for MtrA localization to the outer membrane. Additionally, in a mtrA deletion strain, mtrB expression is detected in cell lysates but MtrB is not, indicating the necessity of MtrA in assembly of OM MtrB complexes"

Device
pluxR->luxS
luxS is controlled by pluxR promoter. luxS is a kind of DPD synthetase, which could produce DPD (4,5-dihydroxy 2,3-pentanedione) under the cooperation of Pfs enzyme. DPD exists widely in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria as the signaling factor for quorum sensing, in order to complete the information transfer process within different kinds of bacteria.

AHL single-cycled oscillation pluxL-luxR-pluxR-luxI(LAA tag)-pluxL-luxR-pluxR-aiiA(LAA tag)
This circuit is composed of the constitutive promoter -- broken Ptet and membrane protein cph8. Under dark conditions, protein cph8 could transfer its  phosphoryl group to intracellular protein ompR (ompR is native protein carried by E.coli), and this process could be inhibited by 650-nm light.

UI_Indonesia,2018,Team:UI Indonesia#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the receptor which diphtheria toxin binds in human cells. The design of the chimeric protein, which we named HBEGF-Tar (HT), is explained more deeply in the modelling page.
In the native pathway, when no aspartate binds the Tar receptor, the CheA protein autophosphorylates and interacted with the CheY protein. CheY then interacts with FliM protein in the motor section of the flagella. This interaction results in the tumbling movement of the flagella. When aspartate binds with the Tar receptor, the autophosphorylation of CheA stops, thus stopping the interaction of CheA with CheY. The interaction between CheA and CheY is what our team use to detect the binding of diphtheria toxin through the Lux-BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) system. For this purpose, we linked CheA to LuxAB protein and CheY to enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (eYFP).
Fig. 1 The native Tar chemotactic pathway in E. coli
When diphtheria toxin (in our project, a modified version of it) binds with the HB-EGF binding domain in HBEGF-Tar, the interaction between CheA and CheY is supposed to stop as if there’s aspartate binding. The input which is the binding of diphtheria toxin with HBEGF-Tar will create an output of blue color as a result of the lack of interaction between CheA and CheY. When there is no binding of diphtheria toxin, CheA and CheY could interact, thus resulting in LuxAB and eYFP being brought into close proximity, resulting in the fluorescence of eYFP which resulted in an output of yellow color.

Managing the realization of the usage of synthetic diphtheria exotoxin (i.e. DiphTox/DT) and chimeric HB-EGF/Tar (i.e. HT) receptor, our team proposed a focus on characterizing the part of each BioBrick’s function.

Those all-nighters Arun spends in lab can’t be for the iGEM team: he must be working on some miracle anti-aging cream because while the rest of us are losing our hair, his continues to grow in lush. It’s a good thing Arun has remained dedicated to the team, however; at this rate, the Cornell iGEM team in 100 years will still be consulting Arun. Maybe then he’ll be having his first shave.
Kevin Hui
Kevin Hui is a snowflake clownfish. He’s always quick to crack a joke, and his unique sense of humor is always good for a laugh. A very amiable fish, he was the perfect choice for the Cornell iGEM team’s social chair. Kevin created new team events and put his own clowny twist on some Cornell iGEM classics to make sure the entire team enjoyed their time outside of the lab. Kevin resides in a sea anemone (obviously), so he’s immune from the harmful effects of BCWD. He was the perfect choice to lead the crusade against Flavobacterium, and he worked this year to characterize the effects of ecnB proteins on that nasty bacteria. We thank Kevin for his sacrifice. It takes a lot of effort to wage two simultaneous battles: one against a deadly bacteria, the other against our team’s desire to never leave lab.
Casey Zhang
If Casey were a Pokemon, she would be Jigglypuff. Found in the lush green plains between Route 115 and Ithaca, Casey’s charm is super effective against any foe. Her special abilities include captivating bystanders with her huge round eyes, and lulling the manliest of men to sleep with her gentle lullaby. Her friendly nature makes her the ideal Wetlab team member. After a tragic accident covered the floors of Weill in blue loading dye, legend has it that she spent countless nights scrubbing the mile long hall with a single paper towel. Casey draws her positivity from her diet consisting of baked goods and bibimbap burritos. On one unfortunate occasion, she was poisoned with a Jalapeno pepper hidden deep within an enchilada. Witnesses say that she swelled to a round pink ball and to this day she maintains a deep-seated aversion to anything spicy. Although this remains her sole weakness, Casey’s copious strengths allow her to lead a team of less evolved Igglybuffs, all of whom would be nowhere without her.

6. Tom Johnson - Past iGEM projects which we could incorporate into our own: Cancer projects, Gut projects, Protein engineering, Antibodies expressed in bacteria etc.
7th June
The team discusses findings from the initial research - further agreement that the 'Anti Cancer' project seemed to be the best idea, preparation of 'project sheets' to be sent to Dr. Darren Nesbeth for review and subsequent meetings.
11th June
looked a bit at the possible chassis species: salmonella, clostridium, helicobacter, E. coli. according to the tissue type/cancer type we shall decide which works with which. We start with E. coli in the lab.
We considered a pro-drug approach - bacterially directed enzyme pro-drug therapy which suggests that we may establish a transformed bacterial population with an enzyme capable to activate an ingested prodrug. This pro-drug would be connected to an antibody (possibly part of the tail) and would also have linking consensus sequence targeted by the enzyme produced locally by our bacteria.
From this above point Alex distinguished 2 scenarios built on the circuit sketch that he and Laia posted a while ago. These would be:
1) Kill unit produces tailed protein pro-drug (possibly tailed perforin) and signaling molecule, A. When A reaches a threshold amount, perforin and a protease to remove the confounding tail is produced, bacteria lyses and activated pro-drug acts on surrounding cells.
2) No protease is produced, because the tail can be cleaved off by matrix metalloproteases.
Goals for the end of this week:
- Alex, Andy and Weiling continue investigating possible candidates to fill in the parts for the scenarios
-Tom, KC and Ruxi make sure we have everything set up to start the work in the lab: protocol, parts etc.
12th June
Ruxi and Tom went through a general cloning protocol but then realised that the best way to prepare for the lab is to get familiarised with the iGEM distribution kits. We discovered that we are given almost everything we need in order to get it right.
Alex filled in the form with our proposal requested by Darren - we have the sequences and details of potential new biobricks.

Conclusions
Introduction
During the development of CAT-Seq, we have met various biotechnology field experts with the hope of finding design flaws and improvements to our system. One of these experts was Audrius Laurinėnas. At that time we had a big problem of not having enough amplified DNA in each droplet for robust sequencing. Audrius has suggested the MDA reaction. Yet, he also knew that using modified nucleotides might inhibit the MDA reaction, as phi29 DNA polymerase does not incorporate many modified nucleotides. It is a logical assumption to think that some of the Substrate Nucleotides might somehow inhibit the DNA replication reaction. We have hypothesised that the inhibitory effect of modified nucleotides might skew the amplified DNA fragment size and product yield distribution. This an important aspect to consider, as long fragments are crucial for high quality when Nanopore Sequencing is employed. Yet, if we don’t use a high enough concentration of Substrate Nucleotides, the dynamic range of our measurement might decrease dramatically.
Modelling of inhibitory nucleotide incorporation
Therefore, we have written a mathematical description of Phi29 DNA amplification which takes into account the possibility of the Phi29 inhibition by Substrate Nucleotide, in order to investigate the maximum amount of substrate nucleotides we can use without worrying about short sequencing reads.
The mathematical Phi29 model imitates the amplification of the CAT-Seq Esterase DNA template with random hexamers. First of all, random hexamer primer sequences are generated and aligned to the DNA template. This maps the beginning of the DNA amplification. After that, newly synthesized DNA templates can be immediately primed again with random hexamers. The re-priming of DNA template happens every few iterations of synthesis. Each site housing"

Luba Prout
BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Luba recently completed a BSc in Chemical and Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. As part of her undergraduate degree, she undertook an experimental research project on directed evolution of XNA ligases and in parallel she also focused on the use of bioinformatics for enzyme engineering. Previously, Luba volunteered and was an intern at a biomedical chemistry lab, gaining experience in organic synthesis and analytical techniques. Her passion for science, synthetic biology and academic scholarship sparked the initiation of the first Birkbeck iGEM team.
Luba’s first degree was in law, yet her strong interest in science has led her to Birkbeck to study for a second degree, whilst taking up a support role at the Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development / Birkbeck BabyLab. After the spell with BBKiGEM, Luba will start a PhD on the BBSRC LiDO programme at University College London.

Imperial_College_London,2011,Team:Imperial College London#Extras#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," for having the system recognize when to secrete hirudin would be by having the bacteria sense trauma related chemokines and have the chassis secrete the protein only when it senses above a certain threshold of these chemokines or we could try to express protease-activated receptors (GPCR) that are cleaved by activated thrombin (the target of hirudin). Direct application would only benefit over the use of leeches in that the chassis is more aseptic then a leech bite. The biggest issue remains the fact that for this to work we would have to inject the patient with living E. coli that can evade the human immune system.

They produce B-glucosidase, Cellobiohyhrolase (cbhI family), B-xylosidase (xlnR) and phenoloxidase (Pox2) to promote leaf degradation.
-As leaves decay, they produce heat. Leaves will decompose into an excellent organic soil amendment that can be used as a soil conditioner.
-The decomposition process is slow (i.e. leaves require 5 months to 2"

However, the LCR should be emphasized as an alternative to the current methods due to the expensive enzymes and reagents involved in the process of phosphorylation of the oligonucleotides for use in the LCR cycling  program.
USER Reaction
The Uracil Specific Excision Reagent is composed of two enzymes, which are commercially available and robust:
Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG)
Targets the pyrimidine and ribose components of the uracil base and cleaves them from the phosodiester backbone.
DNA glycosylase/lyase Endo VII
Cleaves the exposed phosphodiester backbone, which allows the release of the 3-11 bases upstream of the uracil base, thus creating a nonpalindromic sticky end.
This sticky end that is released is utilized for the construction of Composite Building Blocks; when these ends are designed so as to be complementary only to that of the adjacent Building Block, the Building Blocks can be ligated only in a single, predestined order and in a single, desired orientation.

TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," asked Engeline what is the most appropriate sample for detecting antibiotic resistance. She tells us that feces contains too many bacteria, blood is supposed to be sterile but is not common practice and thus economically not so attractive. Urine samples are often used with pet animals. Milk would be most suited as this is has little bacteria, only skin bacteria and the pathogens causing mastitis.
Engeline also told us about extended-spectrum lactamases that can break down a lot of types β-lactam antibiotics and thus can make a large group of antibiotics inactive. A lot of β-lactamases can be passed on from animals to humans

Summary
Interview summary
When asked about the most occurring/challenging bacterial infection in cattle, Bouwe Frank pointed us towards mastitis. This is in an infection of the udder. The problem with mastitis is that it can be caused by various bacteria. If you are interested in detecting antibiotic resistances in the case of mastitis, you will thus first have to establish which pathogen you are dealing with.
How the current process goes, is that a sample of a sick animal is sent to the GD Animal Health. They cultivate the sample to see what bacteria causes the disease. Often, an educated guess considering the pathogen can be made. If the test is positive, the animal can get a suitable treatment. If not, the test is repeated under different conditions. These tests are not based on detecting antibiotic resistances, because this takes more time and money.
Bouwe Frank referred us to the GD animal health to get a better insight in the current diagnostics process through the veterinarian laboratory. A valuable person to contact is Ynte Schukken, who is connected to the GD animal Health and professor at the Groningen University.
