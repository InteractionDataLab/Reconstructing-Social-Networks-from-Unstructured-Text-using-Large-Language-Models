Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," variance (ANOVA) and factorial design. The book I had chosen to study from was Montgomery's Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook.
Week 10: July 1 - July 5
After talking to Taylor it has been determined that we will do a factorial design to investigate the effects of concentration and PH on the magneto-ferritin we will prepare in our lab. The goal is to quickly find better operating conditions to move on to next stages of the experiment. My next step needs the raw materials to be here and processed, so I am continuing to learn more about factorial design.
It has been decided that for the modelling in Autodesk Maya, we shall use the plug-in ePMV, which is only available for 2013 as the latest version. So installing both Maya 2013 and ePMV. Our vision is to simulate the bonding between parts, so I was studying dynamics and other related techniques in Maya as well.
Week 11: July 8 - July 12
This week's focus has been on Maya. Mostly figuring out how to import protein data base files (.pdb) and how to install and use various extensions in ePMV. I found out that the ePMV website isn't always clear, but fortunately YouTube has wonderful video tutorials on ePMV.
I loaded the ferritin sphere into the database file and changed the color scheme. The resulting Maya file can be as large as 50 MB, sometimes 100 MB more.
Week 12: July 15 - July 19
I kept working on Maya. Now all parts of the assembly have been loaded to Maya and ribbon, coarse surface, surface and atom models have been constructed. We were trying to print the modelled scenes from Maya, by rendering the scenes to images. But so far we have no success; all rendering methods in Maya resulted in poor images that we can't visualize the 3D structure. Sometimes the colors were lost resulted in a region of red surface. This problem occurred on all computers with Maya installed, under many different settings, even in Autodesk Max, but not on our in-house expert Merry's computer. For now we just use print screen to get the image and will worry about rendering later.
At the same time Ceser asked us to study the following techniques in Maya: Dynamics, nParticle, and APBS extension of ePMV for calculating the electrostatic force of a protein. Like everything else in Maya, the APBS extension did not work as we expected; for some reason it complains error occurred when executing a line in the script but without the details necessary for debugging.

Week 14: July 29 - August 2
Realizing the time constraints we have for the submission of our parts, we reviewed our Golden Gate assembly experiment to ensure we can submit the parts to the registry. In case this method fails, we also began development of Gibson assembly primers to see if this assembly assembly method cooperates with us.
We began characterization of prussian blue ferritin through kinetics experiments. Our first goal was the construction of the Michaelis-Menten plot to determine the activity of our peroxidase-like catalyst with the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) substrate (Figure 6).
Figure 6. Measurements of the absorbance of the 415nm light by the substrate ABTS over a period of 600 seconds. 8 uL of 10 mg/mL substrate was used in a 242 uL reaction volume. Prussian blue ferritin ( 10 uL of 0.022 mg/mL sample) is represented by the blue data points. Orange data points are a negative control using standard ferritin (10 uL of 0.047 mg/mL sample). Negative controls are ABTS and hydrogen peroxide, and ABTS only. Standard error of the mean bars are based on a sample size where n=8.
These experiments then continued on to optimization experiments wherein we determined the optimal pH, temperature, and concentrations of ABTS and hydrogen peroxide. We intend to repeat these experiments with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) so that we could compare the two substrates and determine the most viable one for our final system.
Week 15: August 5 - August 9
This week, we prepared the basic reagents for magnetoferritin synthesis, we attempted to create apoferritin this week. Apoferritin turned out to be a very light brown, suggesting that some of the iron cores were unloaded. We moved onto magnetoferritin synthesis, but the resulting product contained a lot of particles in it, we fear this may be due to synthesis of magnetite crystals in addition to magnetoferritin.
We did our tested heavy ferritin ( BBa_K1189019 ) as ordered from the synthesis company for expression on an SDS-PAGE. The LacI induced promoter ( BBa_J04500 ) was induced with "

The next step towards our goal was to demonstrate that plasmid DNA can be adequately recovered and repackaged (PCR amplified, transformed into a different strain, etc...) as a result of lysing. In a more elaborate experiment , we were able to show that not only did the lysing efficiently release plasmids from the cells, but that it could be made to do so selectively in a large culture containing a variety of strains. Finally, cognizant of the fact that a good lysis selection method ought to be flexible with regards to the larger reporter system, we manufactured twelve different T7 promoter variants that exhibit a wide range of strengths and induction efficiencies. The latter will play a crucial role in being able to accomodate the activation time-scales of fragile and complex selection systems.
All the components of the selection machine have been separately tested experimentally and found to work. Therefore we are convinced the system can work, but it would still require a full-circle experiment to demonstrate its usefulness.

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Both experiments show that the RFP is already expressed in     regular LB. This is probably due to traces of guanine and vitamin     B12 in LB medium. Nevertheless the pictures also show that the RFP     signal increases with the addition of guanine and vitamin B12.

Disclosing synthetic biology and science popularization
Synthetic biology is not well known in Brazil and we realized that one of the consequences of this is the small number of Brazilian teams competing in iGEM. With a little more publicity, we could help raise awareness of synthetic biology in Brazil and perhaps increase the number of Brazilian teams in the coming years.
No information on Wikipedia(pt)
A simple example of the lack of information in Portuguese about iGEM: there is no page on Wikipedia (of course, we are working to solve this). In this chart below, we see the comparison of the interest over time to organic searches on Google by ""synthetic biology"" and its counterpart in Portuguese. The numbers on the graph reflect how many searches have been done for a particular term, relative to the total number of searches done on Google over time (they do not represent absolute search volume numbers):

The Institut Pasteur
Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo is the head of the Genetics of Biofilms Unit at Institut Pasteur. He is interested in the mechanisms involved in infections independent of a material, and infection linked to an implanted material.
Interview with Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo.
Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo was the first professional to talk to us about the formation of biofilms. In addition to his help with lab biofilm growth protocols, he also gave us great advice concerning our device and the confinement of our biofilm. Indeed, biofilms have a tendency to colonize the system and we needed to think of a way to confine them so they don’t disperse in the patient’s body or contaminate other material during the integration of the implant. By confining the biofilm, we would also reduce the chances of bacterial conjugation between possible pathogenic bacteria and ours.

Dr. Bernard Zalc is co-leader of the oligodendrocyte development and neurovascular interactions department. He studies oligodendroglial cell development in the embryonic brain and the interactions between neural cells and the cerebral vascular network.
Dr. Bernard Zalc facilitated our understanding of the nerve growth and explained to us some issues that we could encounter. He gave us some tips regarding nerve growth and the connection between the nerve and our interface. Indeed, for him, other neurotrophins (like BDNF and VEGFA) and chemoattractant molecules are needed in order to attract and direct the growth toward the implanted interface of our system. We exposed to him our experimental approach for the proof of concept and he talked about the importance of the Schwann cells and the myelinization for"

Calgary,2013,Team:Calgary Entrepreneurial#Project#Manufacturing_-_-_TEXT.html," associated with each step is listed below:
This development plan assumes an approximate 2 month development cycle.  This will require approximately one year to fully develop our final product that will be ready for mass production.
Cost of Production
Once our finalized product is ready to enter mass production, estimated analysis for the cost of building the device would require an overhead of about $215.00 per unit.  Additionally, producing one of the cartridges would be equivalent to $5.80 per unit.  The information for this analysis is below:
Figure 3: Cost of production for each cartridge and the components that were included in this analysis.
Figure 4: Cost of production for each device and the components that were included in this analysis.
With these fixed cost of production, we would expect that in order to break-even for manufacturing, we would have to produce 390 cartridges and 9 detectors. This does not include any other over-head which will be required to produce these units. Estimating our profitability will require additional information and will be important to consider with the development of sales strategies and selling activities.
Manufacturing Operations
Production will be facilitated by partnering with key manufacturing services and operation experts. One such example of these partners would be ACAMP - the Alberta Center for the Advancement of MNT Products. This government funded organization provides expertise and funding in order to help commercialize products. The amount of manufacturing which is done by our group will be set to a minimum and only include those particular components which must be completed in a biological manufacturing facility.  This will be advantageous since many of these government organizations can off-set early production costs to allow for our products to reach the market faster. In addition, this allows our company to focus on other areas of production, namely the biological components.
Creating key manufacturing partnerships will be vital in developing the technology.  Our mass production strategy is summarized in the following figure:
Figure 5: Overview of manufacturing strategy and selling activities from in-hosue production to distribution.
Strategic partnership with manufacturing facility which will allow for production of a minimum of up to 10% market share value (government regulatory market detailed above) of cartridges and detector units - costs will be subsidized through government grant programs (for example Alberta Innovates Technology Futures Venture Funding) and government not-for-profit organizations focused on aiding groups to achieve manufacturing goals at limited cost.

The magnets placed on the back were not large or strong enough, so the plasmid pieces fell off the board often. Also, the color scheme was a bit confusing. The restriction sites were different colors in order to indicate that they were different, but students seemed to think that only all the colors had to match -- the pink gene belonged with the pink restriction site.
In order to address these issues, more magnets could be placed on the back of each piece. As for the colors, better instructions could be written regarding the coloration or different shades of each color could be used to represent the different sites.
Florida State University also gave us many suggestions for improvements of the kit. The admired the aesthetics and bright colors of the different parts of the plasmid, and found that its maneuverability made it effective in teaching young scientists the value of synthetic biology, and surprisingly, in communicating certain concepts to experienced experts in fields of life sciences. We saw the usefulness of our plasmid kit not just as a flexible educational tool, but also as a icebreaker for communication many different groups of people. They had constructive feedback on how we needed to clarify the instructions manual that accompanied the kit, as it was not clear at first how the magnets should be oriented and the plasmid kit assembled at first glance. We were overjoyed when we heard that FSU iGEM ran with our kit, building on it with their own innovative educational ideas.
We plan to use the feedback we’ve collected from our friends at Rice University iGEM and Florida State University iGEM to improve and expand our plasmid kit for the future. We’ve already begun to incorporate some of the feedback we’ve gotten from other teams such as including stronger magnets and clearer instructions. When we began this project, the goal wasn’t to build a tool and use it for a year; rather, we plan to perfect the model to maximize learning outcomes. Our collaborations with Rice and Florida State allowed us to expand the scope of our outreach and public engagement. As scientists, the burden falls on us to not only make great innovations now, but also enable a future where great innovations can continue to happen. We believe education is key, and that our plasmid kit is a powerful tool in helping us to accomplish that mission. Here is the drawing for the plasmid kit’s final assembly, so that anyone can access and use it to make their very own kits!

During my years of clinical training, I truly understand the influence brought by intestinal diseases to our patients. For example, the recurrence of the disease seriously affects people's health and lives and aggravates their economic conditions.
Intestinal microecology is the research hotspot in recent years. However many pathogenesy of intestinal diseases is still vague. I’m greatly interested in studying inflammatory bowel disease from the perspective of intestinal microecology.
Q: We really hope to learn more about the classification of intestinal lesions from the perspective of medicine.
A1: The first classification of lesions in digestive system is mainly based on dissection, including esophageal diseases, gastroduodenal diseases, small intestinal diseases, colon diseases, anorectal diseases, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases.
Actually, each disease from different splanchna can make a sub-classification, like congenital disease or genetic disease, inflammatory diseases, tumor diseases, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. Also there are other symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement caused by some certain disease. For example, immune disease can cause the gastrointestinal involvement.
A2: There are four types of lesions in digestive system : esophageal and gastric diseases, intestinal disease, liver diseases and biliary and pancreatic diseases. Intestinal disease includes infectious intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic bowel disease, autoimmune enteropathy, medical bowel disease and tumor enteropathy.
Q: As an outstanding doctor, you must have participated in many major discussions of operations on patients and intractable cases. We would appreciate it if you can offer us some details about some cases caused by inflammatory intestinal disease and patients’ following development.
A1: Inflammatory intestinal diseases is an important type of intestinal disease, which is one of the priorities of our work here at Department of Gastroenterology. There are mainly two types of inflammatory intestinal diseases: ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease.
The target organ of ulcerative colitis(UC) is colorectal mucosa mostly, which means that inflammation is limited in mucous layer. The main clinical symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea and blood stool with mucus and pus. Most of cases are chronic and recurrent, and a little of them is fulminant. We treat mild-moderate patients with 5-aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA) preparation. If the patient is not sensitive to 5-ASA, we give them glucocorticoid. If the patient is also resistant to glucocorticoid, we add imuran(AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine(6-M"

2) Resuspend a single colony in 10 ml liquid culture with ampicillin and glucose:
8 mL LB
2 mL of Glucose (10% stock) for final glucose concentration of 2%
10uL carbenicillin
Remember to do two colonies per condition, so take two colonies from the same plate.
3) Incubate at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.4 - 0.6.
When checking OD, take 100 uL of culture and add to 900 uL of LB media in an OD cuvette. Measure OD of dilution and multiply the OD600 by 10 to get the approximate OD. (You can check 1mL of culture when you believe the approximation is close to .5).
Since cells grow fast you may have to re - inoculate before inducing with IPTG. Inoculate (8mL LB, 2 mL Glucose stock, antibiotic) fresh culture with overnight culture. Remember to OD before inducing.
4) After reaching proper OD, spin down cells and discard supernatant (it has glucose in it). 4000g for 5 mins should work. Resuspend pellet in 10mL LB.
5) Induce with IPTG:
4 µl of a 1M stock of IPTG if doing 10mL culture (final concentration of 400 µM)
Induce for 6 hours at 37°C.
Remember to induce only one of your duplicates and keep the other as an uninduced control.

Our heritable, tunable, stochastic switch is novel since the device can be tuned to be biased by altering the amount of invertase protein.
Finally we believe that our aim of controlling stochasticity in the differentiation process to alter the behaviour of soil bacterium is a worthy aim and the idea of packaging cadmium in spores is unique.

Exhibition
We hold a one-month long display about employing synthetic biology to combat antimicrobial resistance and some other applications of synthetic biology as medicine and energy, such as MDC,which is cooperated with the Guangdong Science Center, the largest science center around the Asia, and helped with SCAU (you can have a look at their wiki). We have prepared for the exhibition for half a year and tried to connect with many companies or schools like SCAU. Finally, our exhibition opened to the public at 1st Oct. 2014. At the first day, we can feel the enthusiasm obviously.
The volunteers selected from our freshmen of our school tried their best to explain the knowledge of the synthetic biology and let them know about the antimicrobial resistance better. All the volunteers were trained strictly by us with our whole heart devoted. Meanwhile, the freshmen who did this work also learned a lot about the synthetic biology and iGEM.
Our exhibition is divided into five parts:
1.exhibition board
The main part is the 10 exhibition boards filled with concepts of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance which were made by us with many days forgetting sleep and diet. As this picture shows, our team member was trying his best to explain the safety of synthetic biology. These boards contain the introduction, safety and application in antimicrobial resistance. During these days, many people came to look at these boards and learned a lot.
2.microscope area
The second part is the exhibition of some microbes which can arouse many diseases using the microscopes brought from our laboratory. The public were very interested in them and learned about the bacteria which can arouse the antimicrobial resistance. For example, we displayed some common antimicrobials, like Vancomycin resistant S.aureus (VRSA).

We performed this experiment to establish the phage stocks we can use for our modeling project. With this experiment, we were also able to determine the concentration to phage we need to use and several variable we have to control for in our actual experiments.
Detailed procedure: 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol
This is our seventh round of mutagenesis. We were able to finalize our protocol for T7 mutagenesis with 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol . However, the Phage Purification Team needed more sample to finalize their CsCl protocol. Thus, we performed this new round of mutagenesis. We also switched to E coli B after establishing in 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments that E coli B also support the growth of T7.

There was a story that I known this competition from my internship supervisor in March and I began to study synthetic biology. During this project, I learn knowledge in synthetic biology and it gives me experience of designing and conducting an experiment. I really enjoy this summer and have many friends. I think iGEM is a good opportunity for students to study synthetic biology together and communicate with students from different universities. It is lucky to be here, iGEM.

This discussion ought to be based on the facts, while arguments based on emotion and dogma should be put aside. Furthermore, one can argue that a technology (or knowledge of it) carries with it no ethical dilemmas, but it is the application of it that has an effect we can discuss. In the same way that nuclear fission has no ethical or moral agenda, but it is the application of the knowledge that should be evaluated and discussed.

This topic also relates to genetic engineering of microorganisms. Genetic modification of microorganisms differs from modification of higher animals in that it does not cause any physical or psychological suffering as we currently understand and define it. Therefore, our focus will be on potential impacts that the modified organisms could have on the environment and biosphere of the planet as well as human life. The discussion regarding genetic engineering of life in general, and whether it is good or bad, is certainly still relevant but outside the scope and aim of our integrated human practices discussion. The focus will be on the application of synthetic biology and genetic engineering of microorganisms, and the considerations that were made during the design and development of our project idea.
Safety of Genetically engineered microorganisms
To be able to assess the risks of using a genetically modified organism (GMO), several factors have to be taken into consideration, especially when estimating the potential danger to human health as well as to ecosystems. As all microorganisms currently used within the field of synthetic biology originate from nature, unmodified strains of these organisms could be considered safe to the ecosystem at large (of course excluding directly pathogenic strains). To make a reasonable argument of the risks regarding the use of a GMO, the specific modifications must be considered. For a GMO to be considered as a threat to the ecosystem, the modification needs to provide a significant evolutionary advantage over the wild type (WT) of the organism. This relates to unintentional damage that GMOs might cause if it ends up in the wrong hands (intentional misuse of the technology is further discussed later in this section).
In general, the modifications made to industrially used strains of microorganisms rarely provide such an evolutionary advantage. Most often the opposite is true. For example, modifying a strain of Bacillus subtilis to produce an enzyme (a common application of biosynthesis) is highly metabolically costly for the organism and would put it at a significant evolutionary disadvantage compared to the WT strain. This would lead to the GMO quickly being outcompeted by the WT in a natural setting.  In fact, contamination of the fermentation culture, by wild"

      我們利用乳糖操縱組的原理作為整個裝置的開關，並利用乳糖作為控制開關開啟的輸入訊號。 首先，利用一個會被LacI蛋白抑制(LacI-repressed promoter,R0011)的啟動子作為整個裝置的起點，所有後續的蛋白都是由它轉譯出，並直接或間接受到它的調控。 其次，利用一個強啟動子 (J23106) 不斷的轉譯出LacI蛋白，當環境中的LacI蛋白濃度高時，容易與R0011上的位點結合並抑制其作用 (培養期)。當加入定量的乳糖誘導物後，乳糖與R0011爭奪LacI的結合位，使結合在R0011位點上的LacI逐漸減少，也開啟了後續反應的進行 (作用期)。當乳糖逐漸被降解時，LacI對R0011的結合又再佔優勢，也再次使反應轉換 (警示期)。 簡單的說，加入乳糖即可啟動整個系統，而缺乏乳糖"

When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

Immobilization
As a mature technology which has fully developed in the past 100 years, the immobilization of bacteria at present is widely applied in various fields ranging from pharmaceutical industry to sewerage system. Embedding method is the most common one to realize bacterial immobilization. Immobilizing living bacteria in carrier like sodium alginate, cellulose and agar"

Modeling
We built a conglomeration of two models in order to find the best cultivation time and inoculation number. This approach made it possible to predict when the desired proportion of the best adapted E. coli culture is reached.
Model I
The model for the bacterial two hybrid system , model I , needs the affinity value of the bacterial two hybrid complex as an input.  It then simulates the events in the cell which are essential for the bacterial two hybrid system and the resulting production of beta-lactamase.  As an extension the encounter of beta-lactamase and ampicillin, an antibiotic that harms the cell, is modeled. If the beta-lactamase concentration in the cell is too low and the ampicillin concentration is too high, the cell dies. If the proportion of ampicillin does not lead to death a high ampicillin concentration will cause growth inhibitions.
To ensure that our program can deal with all extreme cases, we made a simulation run of three different affinities: an optimal affinity, a moderate affinity and a bad affinity. The time scale for the events in the cell is limited to 20 minutes, because after 20 minutes it is assumed that the"

Prepare control OZs for sequencing
We performed a miniprep on the eight samples for sequencing, obtaining the following concentrations:
Our OZ concentrations after miniprep.
The miniprep lysis step looked good, and the samples turned blue after lysis.
We then performed a junction PCR using the previous protocol, and checked the products on a gel:
Gel of our PCR product that we sent out for sequencing.
They looked good, so we sent them out for sequencing.  Hopefully we will have our final OZ control plasmids for tomorrow.
Practice Plate resuspension
We resuspended the practice plate oligos in 40 ul of water to produce a 100 uM solution, taking 10 ul of the final solutions into 90 ul of water in separate tubes to create 10 uM working concentrations.  When we receive our tag primers, we should be able to test the presence of the oligos in each tube as well as amplify them in preparation for integration into the expression plasmids.
Colony finalization
For the colonies that we plated yesterday, we saw that the plates all had good growth on them and so we wrapped the plates in parafilm and put them at 4 degrees for storage.  1/1000 ul from saturated culture seems to be a good amount to plate.

Plated 3 mL of our recombination culture on zeocin plate, and also plated 2 mL of MAGE results on zeocin plate as a control
The recombination plate had about 15 colonies around 9 30am, and the MAGE plate had none
Continued by PCR of 4 colonies on recombination plate
Each template was analysed with presence of different sized bands for rpoZ (using rpoZ_F and rpoZ_R) and presence of Zeocin cassette (using rpoZ_R and zeocin_R)
Gel resulted with the following:

Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part"

Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix
Bees experiments and protocols
Oxalic Acid Gradient:
In 15 mL falcon tubes, 5 mL of sulfuric acid, 2 mL of Potassium Permanganate, and x amount of oxalic acid.
The solutions would then sit for 10 minutes, being inverted every few minutes.
The optical density with a wavelength of 528 nm was taken for each falcon tube. The results were recorded.
Mite Trials:
Pouches were made using parafilm. This was done by stretching out the parafilm very thinly with the experimenter’s hands.
Using a pen cap, the parafilm was arranged so that there was a small pouch at the bottom for the mite and solution to fit in.
The pen was removed and the top of the parafilm was left open.
A Varroa mite was then placed into the pouch along with a solution such as water.
They were left overnight in the 27 ℃ incubator.
Bee Trials:
Bees were obtained from a bee hive.
The bees were then fed RFP producing E.coli with glucose and sucrose sugars. The bees were then observed to determine if they were drinking.
Mites were added to Petri dishes following a sugar shake. Paper derivatives were soaked in different treatments , water and RFP E.coli and were in the bottom of the Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then placed into the incubator for 24 hours at 27 ℃.
The bees were euthanized using EtOH, surface sterilized in bleach, opened using a razor to expose the gut, and placed into the shaker overnight at 37℃.
Biofilms experiments and protocols
Growing biofilms
In the lab for biofilms, our first focus was on trying to see if our team could grow biofilms. We successfully did this using the following protocol:
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µL of RFP, and 21 μL of KAN were added. This solution was then mixed more thoroughly by putting the cap on the falcon tube and inverting it a few times.
3 mL of this solution was pipetted"

--CB MM TR-- As it happens, our entire auxotrophy approach must be completely reformed. The Methods in Enzymology book says that N. multiformis CANNOT be electroporated, neither is it chemically competent, leaving Conjugation as the only viable transformation method. From E. coli to multiformis, we will pass a plasmid, meaning we do have to put our homologous recombination pieces into a plasmid. This plasmid needs to be a suicidal plasmid so that we can get rid of it after the recombination event. This being the case, we now must design primers to create 500bp regions of homology on either side of the serA gene and SOE them together onto a plasmid to be transferred to multiformis and later removed via homologous recombination. Skip helped us to design the plasmid which we would need, since Dr. Grose is ordering plasmids tomorrow. They are as follows:
SUICIDE PLASMID for the Conjugation of E. coli plasmids into N. multiformis
Front and Back halves of our primer (SOEing)

EPFL,2018,Team:EPFL#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," of concept for the detection of a particular sequence contained in the same sample as another sequence differing only by an SNP site, in addition to the presence of the natural background of circulating                       DNA contained in the plasma. This makes sense as part of our project, since it’s realistic to imagine that both the sequence coding for the normal peptide and the point-mutated one coding for the derived neoantigen circulate together                       in the bloodstream.
We tested with 1 fM, 10 fM and 100 fM of the mutated BRAF fragment (region 1 amplified) that we added respectively to 0.1 pM, 1 pM, or 10 pM of background (bg) which would be here the original BRAF gene fragment that we do not want                       to detect. Control samples included those containing the background only and treated plasma (with PBS) that do not contain any activator, so we are expecting to have no fluorescent signal there.
Figure 8. Our system as a tool for single base pair polymorphisms’ detection. We show that our optimized system was specific enough to detect the target point-mutated DNA region in the presence of 100-folds added background,                           which consists of the same DNA template that differs only by one SNP site (shown in different color here), and the background generated by the plasma itself.
Agarose gel electrophoresis gel after amplification is shown below.
Figure 9. Overview of the agarose gel. Mutated BRAF gBlocks gene fragment (different concentrations) was used, from which we amplified target 1 with PCR.
One interesting thing to say about this result is that there is no way of discriminating SNP between two fragments when these are put together in the same sample. This was however possible to do with the Cas12a assay (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Results of the Cas12a detection assay (average fluorescence; n=4 replicates after 250 minutes; bars represent the standard error here). The assay was performed using as activator the amplified region 1 of BRAF                           mutated fragment with respectively 1 fM, 10 fM and 100 fM before PCR amplification, with 100-folds more concentration (before amplification) of original BRAF mutated target 1 added as background. CrRNA A used here. Please refer                           to Figure 1 in order to have an overview of the crRNAs/DNA fragments used for this experiment.
Here we show that our optimized system was specific enough to detect the target DNA region in the presence of 100-folds"

Model overview
    The system we designed involves many kinds of relationships between populations and individuals. To help us understand these relationships better, we designed models to describe how the amount of E.coli and substance change with time.
    Concretely, we designed a fluid model and a solid model, where the solid model takes spatial effects on relationships between populations and individuals into consideration. In fluid model, we use Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to describe the behavior of the amount of different characters and molecules. In solid model, however, we use Cellular Automaton (CA) to mimic effects of spatial factors. (See more at Fluid Model and Solid Model )
    We use models to do the things listed below:
I Design warriors that can be killed only by the warrior from the other group
    According to our results from Orthogonality test , we can just determine the circuit of warrior II and what AHL warrior I should secrete. The results are shown as below:
Fig.1 Gene circuit designed from results, the upper one is warrior I while the one below is warrior II
    We cannot design a warrior I that can be killed by warrior II but not by itself regardless of whatever receptor-promoter pair we put inside warrior I. (See more at Orthogonality test )
    The problem now becomes how to block warrior I’s response to C4HSL secreted by itself. Our model tells us if we design warrior I as below (Fig.2), we can realize that warrior I"

Calgary,2018,Team:Calgary#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," However after consulting with him we had learned that engraving holes through glass would be a very difficult challenge. Assuming that the holes could be made, we would proceed by filling them with a conductive paste, to create the positive electrode. We were interested in using a sheet of conductive PDMS to act as a channel cover and ground electrode. Moving forward, we will develop this device and see if we are able to apply current across the channels when droplets are flowing through them.

TJU,2015,Team:TJU#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," Engineering, TUST (Tianjin University of Science and Technology) asked if we could share a little bit of our experience and help them to build an iGEM team, we were super excited that we could get this golden chance to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology to more young Chinese students like us.
Lecture
This July, we went to TUST (Tianjin University of Science and Technology) and held a lecture with vice-president Zhou, professors and fifty students from their college. We briefly introduced the novel scientific discipline, Synthetic Biology and the iGEM at first. Since they had never get the chance to know iGEM before, we showed the procedure about how to start a new team in detail then. In order to help them have a thorough understanding of the iGEM project, we presented our project in 2012 and 2013 when we both won the top three of Asia Regionals and the gold medal of the Giant Jamboree. The brand-new concept and the stirring competition struck IGEM fire into the hearts of audiences and we got an enthusiastic Q&A at the end of our meeting. Before leaving, we promised that we would always be ready to help if they have any question when they start their team.
Team-start Guidance
After the lecture, professors and students form TUST still had lots of questions. There is an old Chinese saying: “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” We decided to establish an effective and instant guide platform for future benefits. Thus, we provided a 24 hour on/off-line guidance for the past 2 months. With the arranged schedule, with take in charge with the TUST team in turn and solve their problems through Wechat, email and mutual visiting.
TUST Team-Following Intern
Through our 24 hour on/offline guidance, we felt visiting or demonstrating in flesh always had a desired effect. So, why not let the TUST teammate involving in our team’s work? Two TUST students, Li YE and Tingyue Deng came to our lab at the end of July. They lived and worked together with us for an one-month intern, in which they participated in every parts of our team’s work They brought the experience they gained there back to their school and will start their team next year.

In order to get a functional and successfully expressed plasmid, we added the mutated 2-micron ori of yeast into the plasmids we got so far. The ori was introduced downstream of the ADH1 terminator (see figure 3 for plasmid maps).
Figure 3| The final plasmids of our composite parts. The TRP-GFP- tool can be used to select for tryptophane auxotrophy and to tag a protein of interest in yeast with GFP. The LEU-mRFP-tool can be used to select for leucine auxotrophy and to tag a protein of interest in yeast with mRFP. These two BioBricks can also be used together, to analyse two different proteins in yeast.
Intermediate parts
In the first step, we incorporated the TDH3 promoter upstream of our selection marker and inserted the terminator HHO1 downstream. This promoter-marker-terminator brick could also be used as a single part for other purposes (intermediate parts, table 3).
Table  3| Intermediate parts that we constructed.
In the second step, we introduced the TEF2 promoter upstream of the BamH1/Bgl2 site, the fluorescent marker and the ADH1 terminator (see figure 2).  In the last step we added in this construction the mutated 2 micron (compare creation of TRP1 and Leu2 genes, figure 1) and finalized our two plasmids as functional device (figure 3).

UC_Chile,2012,Team:UC Chile2#Cyanolux#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," replace E. coli, for example, in the biotechnological industry in order to achieve greener processes.
Rationale
Synechocystis PCC 6803
Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic photoautotrophs and they are believed to be the only group of organisms to evolve oxygenic photosynthesis about 2.4 billion years ago 1 . Although this biochemical breakthrough can’t be understated, several cyanobacteria species also play a crucial role in the planet nitrogen cycle as marine diazotrophs 2 . Cyanobacteria are found almost in every environment in earth´s surface and interestingly, they are one of the few prokaryotes known to have circadian rhythms accounting for their photosyntethic lifestyle 3 .
Synechocystis PCC6803 is a gram negative non-filamentous cyanobacteria and it was the third prokaryote and the first photoautotroph whose genome was sequenced. Consequently, is has become a model organism as its genetic background has been widely studied.
Given the reasons mentioned above, it is of no surprise that Synechocystis PCC6803 (among other cyanobacteria) has been extensively used for biotechnological applications and proposed as the “green E.coli” 4 .
With the dawn of Synthetic Biology, research has made use of Synechocystis for commodity chemicals production and detection of water soluble pollutants among other applications 5 , 6 .
While aware of these practical applications, we (UC_Chile) are particulary interested in the well characterized circadian behavior of this chassis 7 and its implications. There are several genes known to oscillate in a daily basis, most of them related to respiration, photosynthesis and energy metabolism 8 , and it has been shown that reporter systems using these promoters show a similar expression pattern 9 .
Lastly, there are a lot of biobricks designed especially for Synechocystis or from its genome´s sequence by previous iGEM teams (references) but sadly no one has ever characterized them in this chassis and the registry lacks a set of tools for its transformation with standard biological parts. Moreover, to our knowledge, no iGEM team has ever accomplished a successful direct Synechocystis transformation with naked DNA.

, since it is not tagged for fast degradation.
DDEs
Due to the time interval between expression of regulating protein and transcriptional activation by the luxR and AHL complex which depends on the past concentration of internal AHL, we decide to use DDEs model. Transcription, translation, and maturation rate of proteins are combined into a single time-delay parameter
. We modeled based on the paper “Rapid and tunable post-translational coupling of genetic circuits”.
The simulation is carried out using custom written software in MATLAB. We get the simulation result of oscillator, as shown in Figure 1.

ODEs
In the genetic circuit of Dual-feedback oscillator, the three promoters are the same hybrid promoter composed of an activation site and a repression site. They can be activated by the araC protein in the presence of arabinose and repressed by the LacI protein in the absence of IPTG. The mechanism of dual-feedback makes oscillatory behaviour stable and adjustable.
There are four states of promoter: original promoter without inducer, bound with araC dimers (

HOW SAFE IS “SAFE ENOUGH”?
1. Introduction
To understand and to form an opinion about the safety of synthetic biology, people should know what synthetic biology is. These days, no global definition of this term exists: people all over the world give a slightly different interpretation. Our view is well displayed by the definition posed by the ETC group (a Canadian Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration). For a good understanding of our safety analysis we give their view on this complex matter. Synthetic biology is ‘the design and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems that do not exist in the natural world and also the redesign of existing biological systems to perform specific tasks’ (the ETC group). For the creation of these synthetically engineered organisms we make use of biological building blocks, called BioBricks. While creating such organisms, scientists reflect on the possible consequences of their future creations. Even with the best intentions, experiments can go wrong or people with bad intentions can abuse the results.
While engineering E.D. Frosti we added several mechanisms to ensure biosafety. When a stimulus (arabinose or lactose) is combined with a cold temperature, a cell death mechanism will kill off the cells. Hereby the bacteria will be killed but the produced proteins stay active on their cell surface for some period of time. We thought about the dangers that E.D. Frosti could entail for the environment and even for mankind, if something would go wrong. But the question remains: How safe is “safe enough”?
2. Safety in the lab
The Irish novelist S. Lover said:” It’s better to be safe than sorry”. While working in the lab, this is the key sentence that the K.U. Leuven iGEM team 2011 kept in mind. We are working in a laboratory in a laminar flow with biosafety level 1 because the host organisms we use are non-infectious. Every student working in the laboratory attended and passed the course ‘safety and laboratory practice'. [1] We apply the standard rules of ‘Good Laboratory Practice’; we always wear a lab coat, safety"

The micro-road to rubber
Natural rubber is a chain of several isoprene molecules. The rubber tree has a prenyltransferase PrenyltransferaseHRT2 enzyme, which links molecules of IPP IPPIsopentenyl pyrophosphate into the isoprene chain Isoprene chainnatural rubber. To start the extension of the chain, the prenyltransferase needs a DMAPP DMAPPDimethylallyl pyrophosphate molecule. Thus, in order to produce rubber, the bacteria needs the prenyltranferase, IPP, and DMAPP. Source: Light DR, Dennis MS. Purification of a prenyltransferase that elongates cis-polyisoprene rubber from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis. J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 5;264(31):18589-97. (Link)
The basic idea is to convert sugar (glucose) into natural rubber through the glycolysis to yield pyruvate and GAP. These are further converted into IPP and DMAPP through the MEP pathway. A DMAPP and several IPP molecules can then be linked together into natural rubber"

I had my first workflow presentation: Kepler intro
We talked about the role of Kepler in future Clotho's development. Kepler workflows are powerful in designing and sharing computational process, so having Kepler actors that connect to Clotho can increase Clotho's productivity.
We also discussed about the line between Kepler actors and Clotho plug-in, since there are operations that we can either code as part of Clotho, or Kepler actors that separate from Clotho. I have some sample workflows from Christ that relevant to the wetlab needs.

I was debating between using Java RMI or implementing in a lower level with Sockets, so I'm trying RMI first with simple scenarios. For basic methods, Java RMI works fine in Kepler actor classes, I hope it's ok when talking with Clotho.

All the attendees could learn about the basic concepts of synthetic biology and could discuss their point of view to each other and to our team.Most of the students were fascinated by the way how people use these standardized and changeable gene parts to engineer devices of novel function, and how people of different background and disciplines meet and work together in this field. Some of them mentioned their worries about utilizing synthetic biology in illegal use and some controversial implications, such as bio-weapon development, bioterrorism, GM food, and application of stem cells, etc. The students also spoke of potential risks including unwanted spreading and multiplication of transgenic microorganisms, environmental protection, and long-term side effect on human body which could not be detected in early stages.
Symposium for Medical Students
Invitation for Lab Visiting
We also invited some of our classmates and other medical students of different grades to visit the lab, showing them how to perform some technique and the systems we designed. Moreover, students from different departments and fields were invited to participate our meetings as well, offering us different suggestion. We received many perceptive questions about our project and how we get the balance between research and work in hospital.
Showing Visitors The Technique We Used in Our Project
Knowing that there’s a 3-year-long summer-student program for senior high school students in Taiwan, “Biological Programs for Selected Senior High School Students in Academia Sinica” , we’re planning to partner with some of their classes which start after mid-October and to provide some introduction to iGEM program and synthetic biology since most of our groups were the members before.
Building A Platform for Information Sharing
Another way to promote synthetic biology is through the internet. Though there are some problems using blog as the platform of outreach, such as the difficulty in keeping the discussion on specific issues for a period long enough to raise stimulating conversation and feedback. We set up a website as our team’s blog sharing our project. And we also wrote some news, reviews concerning bioengineering and information on current issues in Chinese. Thus more people could know what synthetic biology was, how we came up with the ideas, how to formulate the project.

Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <groupparts> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.
Note
Note that parts must be documented on the Registry . This page serves to showcase the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.
Adding parts to the registry
You can add parts to the Registry at our Add a Part to the Registry link.
We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you do need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)
What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?
The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:
Part Name
Part type
Creator
Sequence
Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)
Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)

Getting around in Aachen
Aachen is, compared to other cities, quite compact. Basically, every route is well doable by foot. This way it is even possible to cross Aachen in 30 minutes! For instance, walking from Couvenhalle to Schanz is roughly 20 minutes by foot.
Regarding bus tickets, and depending on whether you wish to get one yourself or not, we highly recommend to stick together in groups of 5 and get a 'Minigruppenticket'.
Things to do in Aachen
If you are arriving early enough (or are departing late enough), there are a few things to do in Aachen.
Aachener Dom / Cathedral
The cathedral is the major landmark of Aachen. It was the palatinate of Charlemagne, and several other ancient kings and emperors were crowned under the cathedral's dome. A relict from these days is the marble throne on the upper level of the cathedral. Since 1978, it is an UNESCO World Heritage, the first one in Germany.
If you are a history geek or just want to learn more, the cathedral is a great place to visit. Taking a guided tour is highly recommended!
Lindt, Bahlsen & Lambertz Werksverkauf / Lindt, Bahlsen & Lambertz factory outlet
Who does not like chocolate?! If you ever wanted to get Lindt chocolate for cheap, we highly recommend this opportunity! 1kg of parlines for less than 5€ seems tempting, doesn't it?
Hours: Monday till Friday, 9am - 6pm and Saturday, 9am - 4pm
Address: Süsterfeldstraße 130, 52072 Aachen
If you make it to Lindt, stopping by at the Bahlsen factory outlet is worth the time as well. It is just across the street from Lindt. Cookie monsters will love this place!
Hours: Monday till Friday, 9am - 6pm and Saturday, 9am - 1pm
Address: Süsterfeldstr. 27, 52072 Aachen
Just down the street, there is another factory outlet by Lambertz. Their specialties are gingerbread and the famous Aachener Printen which you can get all year round. Christmas in September!
Hours: Monday till Friday, 9am - 6pm and Saturday, 9am - 1pm

Part 1: Hardworking Coco
Once upon a time, there was a hard working guy called Coco. He was always busy working in his office. As time went by, He got more and more colleague. The workplace become crowd, everyone in the office could not work well.
Part 2: The bothering of warming
So he set an air-conditioner. That stuff cost him a lot of money for electricity. But that was not ended, the electricity consumed by air-conditioner came from the fossil fuel. As a result, the burning of fossil fuel not only damaged the earth but also made everyone outside the house suffer in hot.
Part 3: Help from the doctor
To find a way, Coco found the Doctor for help. The doctor, who has knowledge of synthetic biology, performed an operation on Coco. With the help of the Doctor, Coco did not feel hot at all in the office where he had used to feel scorched. And he found that there were not so many colleagues, but he didn’t lack any, either.
Part 4: The arrival of happiness
According to this, Coco could work without the air-conditioner. There was no sweat from heat, nor conflicts from crowd. Coco and his colleague work happily day by day, and produce a lot of happiness to the world.

    Before setting about our project, we had to think over many troublesome but necessary questions. For instance, is it safe and efficient in accordance with Safe Policies? Are there any advantages of it when compared to those pre-existed wastewater treatment devices? What impact will it have on people’s lives? iGEMers have been doing a great many of meaningful Human Practices(HPs) over the 14 years around the world. Therefore, to figure these out and improve our project’s feasibility, we planned some HPs mainly in the light of safety and necessity. We put them into effect as follows.
Safety
    First, our team members all have been trained after Guidance of Student Experiments formulated by TCEB (Teaching Centre of Experimental Biology, Wuhan University), including how to use chemicals and instruments safely and how to manipulate organisms properly.
    Second, Prof. Chen Yu of College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University(CLS-WHU) had a significant talk with us. He reminded us of the importance of biosafety, including experimental safety and laboratory safety. And we took part in the Lab Safety Exhibition held by CLS-WHU and had a better understanding of Biosafety.
    Third, to propagandize Biosafety to as many people as possible, we collaborated with other 10 iGEM teams to make videos about Biosafety and have uploaded these videos to Bilibili .
    Fourth, since our project has many similarities with that of JLU-iGEM, we communicated a lot about how to improve each other’s project and make the whole wastewater treatment a more practical and environmental friendly one.
    Fifth, we got lots of inspirations and pieces of advice from other iGEM teams and professors about how to get rid of the leaked bacteria in effluents with synthetic biological and industrial methods.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html,"versal - the main issues here were the unpredictable effects of introducing a GM foreign species into the local ecosystem, and the fact that nitrate removal had been attempted before, so our project wouldn’t be very original.
Purification of salt water - distillation just seemed a lot easier than introducing bacteria into the water and then removing them (completely) before the water can be drunk.
Control of fruit ripening - something which could absorb ethene and hence prevent fruit ripening was the idea, but we realised that fruits would have to be individually shielded in order for this to work; hardly feasible if we want to be economical and avoid contamination of the fruit with bacteria.
Application of PACE - we were all enthused by this novel technology, but we found out that it was more difficult than we thought initially to harness. We decided to pick a more focussed project and use PACE as a tool, rather than using PACE as the starting point.
Smart bandage - despite the fact that biofilms have been shown to ‘protect’ wounds, the problems of containment and medical approval would be insurmountable.
Removal of mucus/toxins from the lungs - discarded because we don’t want to release GM bacteria in the body.
Leak detection - we thought this would be quite feasible, but perhaps not ambitioous enough given that it has been attempted before and could be done entirely with existing parts.
Bio-scaffolds - we didn’t think we’d be able to have much success in this area, the technology seems a bit too far off to do anything that would give us a substantial sense of achievement.
Lab on a chip - we wanted to harness microfluidics in this project, and really take miniaturisation of, for example, blood tests, to a new level. However, it was too ambitious to be attempted in a summer project.
Bacterial hand warmer - dropped when we saw that chemical versions exist, which we didn’t think we could beat.
Inner city air scrubbing - we thought that it would not be possible to make a significant difference in open spaces, since the volume of air would be too large. It would take a lot of bacteria, and probably completely uncontained - not a good idea!
Bacterial battery - this was considered infeasible because the bacteria with the most interesting behaviour (including ‘’Rhodoferax ferrireducens’’ which produces conducting nanowire filaments) are anaerobic, and hence difficut to work with in the lab. We think that the production of ions in such bacteria is likely also to be linked to their ana"
TAS_Taipei,2016,Team:TAS Taipei#Modeling1_-_-_TEXT.html," function of free ligand concentration, and it returns the fraction of macromolecules that are bound. Two constants are involved in this equation: the dissociation constant and the Hill coefficient (Weiss, 1997).
The Hill coefficient describes cooperativity of the binding. Positive cooperativity (n>1) means that a bound enzyme has higher affinity for other ligands; negative cooperativity (n<1) means the converse is true; and non-cooperative binding (n=0) means that whether or not the enzyme is bound has no bearing on further binding (Weiss, 1997).
The Hill equation is shown below:
, where [L] is concentration of the ligand (in our case, the inhibitor), Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient.
Mouse Inhibitor Serpina3n vs GzmB Activity
Our first dataset (Table 1), which measures Serpina3n concentration vs relative GzmB activity, came from research by Ang et al. at the University of British Columbia (2011). Serpina3n is a known mouse GzmB inhibitor, and the paper documented the effects of Serpina3n on GzmB activity. Given its specificity in mice, this inhibitor was not chosen as part of the final construct, but data from this paper was used because the relevant constants can be analyzed and compared to other inhibitor substitutes.

Several adjustments were made to the equation and dataset so that we could have a meaningful model.  First, GzmB activity was shown as percentages ranging from 10% to 120% in the paper. This is likely because the control for the experiment was set at some point where the Serpina3n expression is not 0. Thus, we scaled down the data points by a factor of 1/120. This scaling is necessary since the Hill equation returns a fraction; the output is limited to between 0 and 1.
More importantly, since the data was presented as the concentration of enzymes that remain free after binding, we needed to modify the Hill equation in order to model the fraction of un"

VI - Characterization-
Poly Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
1. To characterise the Promoter + RBS + nrfA biobrick (Bba_K1866000), we first ran the total protein content of our recombinant E.coli DH5α culture (into which our pSB1A3 plasmid containing the biobrick had been cloned) on an SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel. The result showed over expression in the range of 55 kDa, which is roughly equal to the size of our protein.
2. Periplasmic protein SDS-PAGE—following the over expression obtained from the Poly Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, we extracted the protein content from the periplasmic space using the periplasm fractionation protocol. This was run on another polyacrylamide gel, and we saw over expression on this gel as well, on the appropriate range.
Growth experiments
3. Minimal media growth- Following a research paper by Clarke et al., a culture of our cloned E.coli DH5α culture was grown on a minimal media containing 5% Luria Broth (by volume), 40mM Potassium Nitrate, 20mM Fumarate and 0.4% glycerol for 16 hours, in anaerobic conditions. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and were then to be sub cultured. This experiment failed, even though we saw a pellet after centrifugation following growth. However, we later realised that the pellet was not of our cells, but of ampicillin, which had formed some sort of white precipitate with the media. Hence, this resulted in a failure.

Alberta Innovates Technology Fund Summer Workshop at University of Lethbridge, Day 2
Today, we spent the day at the University of Lethbridge for the second day of the Alberta Innovates Technology Funds Summer Workshop. There was a presentation workshop in the morning by Anne Marie Downey where we were taught techniques on how to speak to the judges at the iGEM presentation. In the afternoon, each of the three teams present had a one hour troubleshooting session with Andrew Hessel where he listened to the project ideas and gave his opinion or any recommended changes that could be made.

SDU-Denmark,2014,Team:SDU-Denmark#Tour44_-_-_TEXT.html," the two strains are different. The difference between the odor-free strain and wild type is, as mentioned, that the odor-free strain should not produce indole. Source: iGEM, 2006: Registry of Standard Biological Parts, (Link) We therefor wished to investigate whether the indole peak was present for the wild type and not the odor free.  The indole in E. coli has earlier been found at K0-1=0.556 s V cm-2. Source: Ochoa, M. L., et. al.: Characterization and Differentiation of Bacteria Using In Situ Derivatization Ion Mobility Spectrometry of Whole Cells and Chemometric Modeling, Ohio University, 2004, p. 25 (Link) In figure 3 the spectra is shown for wild type (WT), odor-free (OF) and air. As can be seen from the spectra there is a peak for wild type at 0.556 that is more intense than the two others. This indicates the indole produced by wild type E. coli. The spectra for the odor-free strain can be seen to follow the spectra for air. This shows that indole is not produced by the odor-free strain.

Dundee,2011,Team:Dundee#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," the PduN. As it is such a small fragment it is proving difficult to see it on a gel. The team finalised what proteins they wanted to target to the microcompartment. The plan is use the microcompartment to produce lemonade, using limonene and aspartate biobricks from the iGEM directory. Additionally we plan to target arsenic binding protein to use as a potential water purification system and ferritin in order to make our bacteria magnetic. Cloning of these proteins into the PduD20 and 40 is well under way.
As an aside half of the team took part in fire extinguisher training. The remainder of the team will under take this course in the coming weeks.
Diary: Week 6
This week was much the same as the previous week with the team working on individual projects as well as the microcompartment. We also had a team night out which was a great success. In an attempt to get the microcompartment much faster we ordered primers to perform a Gibson Assembly. This would allow complete amplification and formation of our microcompartment in one step.
While the scientists were hard at work our two brilliant computer scientists have released apps for both Android and IPhone. Both apps are now available on the app store and are essential tools for any synthetic biologist. Get downloading people!
Diary: Week 7
The final push is on. Work is still under way to complete the microcompartment as well as individual projects. We have also began cloning of a variant GFP with a SSRA tag attached which targets GFP to CLP a protease sometimes referred to as CLPA/CLPAX within the bacterial cytoplasm. Our hypothesis is that by ligating this GFP to our signalling sequences either PduD20/40 it will be translocated to the microcopartment before it is degraded. This will also allow us to specifically label only the microcompartments.
Work into the Human Practices element of iGEM is also well under way. We have been in contact with the World Debating competition which is being held in Dundee this year and we hope that we may be given a slot where we can perhaps carry out workshops or have a discussion about what synthetic biology involves as well as what we are currently doing on our project. We have also been in contact with Café Science a monthly informal talk followed by a discussion by a scientist about their research area at a local café Chambers. We are hoping that we may be given a slot in the coming weeks.

Discussion “Group to Group”"
Goettingen,2018,Team:Goettingen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," glufosinate to plants leads to reduced glutamine and elevated ammonia levels in tissues, halting photosynthesis, resulting in plant death. In the 1960s and early 1970s, scientists at University of Tübingen and at the Meiji Seika Kaisha Company independently discovered that species of Streptomyces bacteria produce a tripeptide they called bialaphos that inhibits bacteria; it consists of two alanine residues and a unique amino acid that is an analog of glutamate that they named ""phosphinothricin"". The inactivation of the gltT gene indeed allowed B. subtilis to tolerate glufosinate (Figures 11B and 11C)! Moreover, the observation that the expression of two copies of the gltT gene in strain BP236 (amyE::Palf4-gltT) increased the sensitivity of the bacteria toward glufosinate further supports the idea that GltT is involved in glufosinate uptake by B. subtilis (Figures 11B and 11C). In contrast to glyphosate, however, the simultaneous deletion of the gltT and gltP genes did not increase glufosinate tolerance of B. subtilis (Figures 11B and 11C). To conclude, under the tested growth conditions the high-affinity glutamate transporter GltT is the major entryway of glyphosate into B. subtilis and GltT is also involved in Glufosinate uptake!
Figure 11. Glufosinate is also taken up by B. subtilis via GltT. (A) Comparison of glutamate and glufosinate. (B) Disk diffusion assay to test whether glufosinate is transported via GltT and/or GltP.

Tianjin,2018,Team:Tianjin#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html,"5× protein concentrations, the KaiC phosphorylation rhythms were nearly the same as those measured under standard conditions. While lowering the protein concentration to 1/10 of the standard mixture, the amplitude of the KaiC phosphorylation rhythm was reduced and the period of the rhythm was prolonged. What’s more, at 1/20 or 1/40 of the standard concentrations, KaiC would be remained dephosphorylated. In addition, in the case of a decrease of the relative concentrations of KaiA or KaiB to KaiC, the rhythm could change accordingly. While lowering either KaiA or KaiB concentrations to one-fourth or one-third of the standard mixture abolished cycling, the rhythm was still maintained in the presence of a two-thirds concentration of either KaiA or KaiB.  However, the period is extended by lowering KaiA concentrations to two-thirds, while lowering the KaiB concentration to two-thirds of the standard couldn’t alter the rhythm.
Owing to a series of reasons like the lack of a complete transcriptional/translational feedback loop(TTFL), the KaiABC system, reconstituted in yeast cells, can not express the correct protein concentrations as in cyanobacteria. Therefore, we intend to get a good command of protein concentrations by selecting promoters of different intensity to construct the corresponding expression cassettes,  thus the KaiABC system works better and more stably. Besides, we measure our promoter strength of six core genes convenient for the analysis of the final results.
Based on the research measuring the promoter strength of 14 constitutive promoters by GFP fluorescence intensity[4], we designed our experiment about the measurement of the promoters by constructing mCherry cassette with different promoters to measure the fluorescence intensity of mCherry, representing the promoter strength. Before our experiment, we selected three common promoters which are TDH3 promoter, PGK1 promoter and TEF1 promoter according the data of the paper as our promoters of six core genes. The detailed information of plasmids we constructed were shown on the table 1 below. We assembled our plasmids by yeast homologous recombination. Taking TEF1P-mCherry-TEF1Tcassette for example, we obtained fragments TEF1P, mCherry and TEF1Twith homologous arms by PCR and then we transformed three fragments and linearized vector pRS415 which had been digested by enzymes HindⅢ and NotΙ  into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to do yeast homologous recombination.

Gel purification
Back to protocols .
Purpose: separate and extract products of a PCR.
General idea: The PCR products are separated by gel electrophoresis, then mechanically cut out with the gel. The DNA is then extracted from each gel fragment.
Run a first electrophoresis with a low volume of PCR product, to verify the expected fragments were produced. If that is the case, run a new electrophoresis with all the PCR product, using a thicker combs to make larger wells. The well from our thick comb contain up to 25 or 30 ul.
Warning: the PCR products destined to extraction must be exposed to minimal amounts of UV radiation, to avoid any damage to DNA.

Equipement
Gel electrophoresis setup
Scalpel
Eppendorf tubes: As many as there are gel samples. The 2 ml ones are necessary if more than 0.3 mg of gel is to be treated.
Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit (250): make sure the protocol is inside.
UV plate reader and UV-shield.
Cutting the gel
From the first (low-volume) gel, determine which bands contain the PCR products. If necessary, adjust the duration of the second electrophoresis to increase spacing between bands.
Prepare as many Eppendorf tubes as PCR products to extract. Weigh them.
To cut out a desired band from the gel:
Lift the black camera box off the UV plate.
Fix the anti-UV shield on the front of the device; switch on the UV light.
Quickly identify the desired band, cut around it, and switch off the UV light.
Remove the cut-out gel and store in an Eppendorf tube.
Clean the scalpel with DI water before cutting each band to avoid cross-contamination.
Notes:
Cut out as little gel as possible, i.e."

Washington
People may perceive science as a complicated and boring topic, but the Washington iGEM Team                         decided to prove this as a common misconception. To achieve this goal, the team designed a                         synthetic biology booklet meant for kids. This book is easy to understand and states the                         importance of science through interesting experiments and fun explanations. However, in                         order to succeed, our team had the task of fully translating it to Spanish, with the                         objective to reach a much wider audience, including all the Spanish speaking countries.                         This also was done with the intention of giving them some feedback about the booklet.
UChile_Biotec iGEM LATAM
How would you describe iGEM to a stranger? More than a competition it could be part of a                         culture. How can someone who has never been part of it, can get to know what iGEM is?                         UChile_Biotec decided that it was time to show the world what does it means to belong to                         this community.
Collecting information from teams all over the world, they designed a magazine that                         gathered several aspects of the competition and the projects of the participating teams, as                         well as integrating the participant teams culture. We joined their strongest and more                         attractive collaboration by sharing details and the implications of our project, our own                         experience as iGEM members and describing some interesting, fun elements of the Mexican                         culture regarding science and biotechnology.
Video Labs Like Us Collaboration
Music is a universal language that helps us communicate our feelings. That is why iGEM TEC                         CEM 2018 team decided to bring all the teams together and use music as a way to express all                         the ups and downs lived in every step of the competition, these being stress, despair,                         happiness, motivation, etcetera. We had the participation of 24 iGEM teams from different                         countries. We produced two videos covering two popular songs, one is “Labs like you” and                         the other one is “Moves like iGEM” (inspired on Maroon 5’s Girls Like You and Moves Like                         Jagger respectively). The aim of the music videos is to demonstrate that despite being from                         different teams and countries we all went through the same situations. The teams that participated are:
