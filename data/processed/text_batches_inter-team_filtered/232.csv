However, we think it is not                     advisable, considering that it will exacerbate the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with IBD.                     In our review of the literature, we noticed that some researchers used engineered constitutive                     secretory immunosuppressants in animal models to alleviate IBD and achieved good results [1-3].                     Interleukin-10 is a natural immunosuppressive cytokine that is normally released by regulatory T                     cells and plays an important role in intestinal homeostasis [4]. In our engineered bacteria, we                     aim to induce the release of interleukin-10 through the inflammatory signal nitric oxide to                     achieve drug release controllability. In particular, we have fused the secreted protein YebF [5]                     in E. coli with interleukin-10 to help our drugs be delivered extracellularly. This is more                     convenient than using an ABC protein-mediated secretion system.

During our HP event, we made conversations with specialists of IBD, During the conversation, we learned that                     the biologic TNF monoclonal antibody (eg. Adalimumab) is a more effective therapeutic output.                     However, the cost of antibody drugs is expensive and it is difficult for ordinary people to afford.                     In the future, we will enable engineered bacteria to jointly release immunosuppressive agents and                     TNF monoclonal antibodies under controlled conditions to achieve better efficacy while reducing                     treatment costs.

Thus, we decided to contact student universities administrations from some African universities in order to ask them to spread the survey to their students. We contacted 30 Universities but we received few answers to our mails. However, we assumed that a part of them did spread our survey since the number of respondents from Africa rose a lot soon after sending our mails. Besides, we have received a message from a student of the University of Cape Town, who encouraged us in our project after being informed on our survey.

Eventually, is our public ready to use PLA? Yes. If they had to choose between PLA and another petroleum-based product, 88.3% of our respondents would choose PLA. Besides, even if it is produced by a bacteria- that is generally associated with danger from the general public, our respondents would be likely to use PLA in their daily life.

Introduction
This year, our team project aimed at designing an innovative insole called ""Comfootable"" to prevent foot odor and foot infection of microorganisms by two strains of engineered E.coli. Compared with the conventional chemical treatment, biological method shows high specificity and long effectiveness. Yet, the traditional bacterial media was limited to be used as the substrate of our insole for it’s low mechanical strength and poor water retention ability. Also，present materials used in the insoles also were not suitable to culture bacteria. To address these problems to manage our innovative insole, we synthesized several new types of hydrogels (Nano Composite hydrogels and Double Network hydrogels.) having a good performance on water absorption, water retention, mechanical strength and biocompatibility. In addition, we designed and produced some innovative insoles and constantly improve them with the help and feedback of our users.

XMU-China,2012,Team:XMU-China#brainstorm_-_-_TEXT.html,"3. The project of University of Edinburgh in 2007: Intracellular proteins are not able to excrete by themselves. How to solve this problem?
To do research about:
a) Ways of cells secreting proteins.
b) How do original cells excrete cellulose?
c) In nature, how do living beings utilize cellulose?
What are the advantages of this plan?
Conclusion:
     After studying literatures, the members of Group 3 learned about ege gene and Bgat1 gene that published in 2012, which can be used to produce cellulose. Generally in the process of producing cellulose, some enzymes must be added for lysis, and then release cellulose out of cells.
     The members of Group 3 hoped to utilize the device controlling cell density which was constructed last year, and exchange ccdB to another gene which will let cells themselves decompose. Thus our engineering bacteria will not only produce cellulose with quorum sensing but also release it out of cells. Besides, the members of Group 3 are trying to construct a secreting route way and hoping to produce cellulose without cell disruption.

3. –Youbin Mo
a) Metabolism of acryl amide.
b) Utilize of light energy: bacteria → amylase/protein → energy.
c) Finding usable bacteria.
Conclusion:
     Group 4 firstly introduced photosynthesis and its 3 major metabolic pathways. It's arduously to clone these pathways, so they are considering constructing some Biobricks, which help to transform the organics that photosynthetic bacteria cannot utilize to another matter that can be utilized. Thus some organics can be decomposed by our engineering bacteria.

Participating at iGEM Meetups
To integrate ourselves into the iGEM Community and exchange ideas to the point where laboratory work and art intertwine, we visited the german national iGEM meet-up in Marburg. The Marburg iGEM Team did a great job in organizing the symposium, and we lived through the weekend, to tell the tale of barbeques, pub rallies, inspiring conversations, great scientific talks and bubble soccer.
Laboratory Collaborations
Working together with iGEM Toulouse, we created biology tutorial videos with protocols for standard practices in molecular biology (such as ligation, digestion and restriction), for future iGEM teams and other interested parties.   We also joined forces with iGEM Sydney, who are developing an ethylene biosensor to measure ripeness in produce. We developed and designed a 3D printed reaction chamber for their glowing sticker, making it easier for workers to detect reporter expression via smartphone. They in turn designed a prototype app for statistical diagnosis by comparing fluorescence levels in the microreactors of our microfluidic device.The collaboration extended to exchanging data for molecular mathematic modelling from our reporter signalling pathway, from the biosensor affinities to the EnvZ-Kinase activating OmpR and the subsequent activation of GFP reporter expression.

The Issue
The use of synthetic biology based biosensors is limited in the field due to restrictions around the use of genetically modified organisms outside controlled areas. Speaking to Dr Chris French on this matter, he told us about his experience with this issue when trying to get clearance for the use of the arsenic biosensor in the field.

Modeling
How Should We Design the Banana Project?
As discussed in the Design Section of the Banana project, we devised three possible designs to transduce the fusaric acid signal. Here’s a quick recap of the designs:
The TetR Design places TLP expression under a pTet promoter. TetR is expressed under the phlF promoter. In the presence of fusaric acid, TetR does not express, allowing for TLP to express.
The Antisense Design places TLP expression under a constitutive promoter. An antisense RNA that binds to the TLP transcript is expressed under the phlF promoter. In the presence of fusaric acid, the antisense RNA is not produced, and the TLP transcript is liberated and translated into TLP.
The T7 Design places TLP expression under a T7 promoter. T7 polymerase is expressed under the pTet promoter. TetR is expressed under the phlF promoter. In the presence of fusaric acid, TetR does not express, allowing T7 polymerase to express, leading to the expression of TLP.
The overall question we’re trying to answer is: which design is best? In order to answer this question, we broke it down into more concrete questions that we could search in the literature.
Following this roadmap, here is what we found:
How do the promoters stack up in terms of strength?:
According to the 2015 Glasgow iGEM team, the phlF promoter is slightly stronger than the pTet promoter (Figure 1). According to literature1, the T7 promoter should be about three times as strong as"

Beyond the lab works, we also strove for the innovation and presentation of synthetic biology to people.  As a medical school, our hospital has its own quarterly magazine, “Yasama  Sanati” (in English: The Art of Living).  We decided that we could mention about iGEM and synthetic biology; thus we wrote an article that told the bacteria is not too much harmful living creature to  humans as it is seen nowadays. In fact, we mentioned that bacteria would become  very handy, helpful and inteligent “machines” in appropiate conditions. We  listed the former experiments and parts that took place in iGEM competition and  gave some examples about what to do next.

Hydrogel
As described on our design page, we based our hydrogel on a paper from 2012,                      in which glycidyl methacrylate derivatized dextran is polymerized into super                      macroporous dextran hydrogels. The subzero temperature polymerization conditions                      employed in this paper result in an interconnected supermacroporous hydrogel with                      pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer. This unique morphology allows for the rapid                      and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size and has already                      been used as a matrix for cell seeding. (1) Therefore, this paper has                      been used as a starting point for the synthesis of our hydrogel.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

Functionalization of dextran
Before the dextran polymer molecules can be crosslinked into a covalent network,                              they first need to be functionalized. As dextran source we used dextran 500kDa                              polymer of pharmaceutical quality, kindly provided by Pharmacosmos. Each polymer                              chain has a weight of approximately 500kDa, and therefore consists of approximately                              three thousand glucopyranose units. Based on the methods described in the article                              by Plieva et al. (1) , we decided to functionalize the dextran polymer chains by                              methacrylation. Subsequently, the methacrylated dextran molecules can be polymerised                              into a covalent hydrogel network via radical polymerisation. (1) The methacrylation reaction using glycidyl methacrylate is illustrated in figure 1. We designed the reaction in                              such a way that for every 100 glucopyranose units, 60 glucopyranose units are                              functionalized with a methacrylate group (a degree of substitution (DS) of 60). The resulting reaction mixture of this reaction can be seen in figure"

Captain Mou reminded us to pay attention to mathematical modeling,submit the material ahead of time , ensure the material be uploaded in time in case of the server congestion, try to use the new gene connection method and efficient gene splicing to start the loop debugging earlier and other specific issues. After the captain Mu led us to visit their spacious laboratory , they gave us a badge which was the made last year as a souvenir. Finally, we took a picture in front of the school of Life Sciences and the gate of Wuhan University.
The captain of WHU told us about their last year’s project.
FAFU-CHINA
    June 2nd, we came to the school of Life Sciences of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. A profound exchange was carried out. The iGEM team of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University first time attended the iGEM competition in 2015 and won the bronze medal. We are the first time in 2016 iGEM competition. FAFU-CHINA new experience of attending the iGEM competition for the first time is a good reference for us.
    The iGEM team of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University led us to go through the last year's valuable experience. They reminded the arrangements of the staffing of us and introduced their experience of attending Giant Jamboree last year. Then, they led us to visit their lab.
We visited the room for cultivating mosquito of FAFU-CHINA
Peking University
    On September 19, we came to Peking University to have an exchange visit with their iGEM team. Peking University is one of the four universities that first participated in iGEM competition. The iGEM team of Peking University is a top team in China. They had outstanding performance in all aspects of the competiton, which is worth learning.
    Captain Li Cheng took us to visit the laboratory of Peking University iGEM. We asked them about the preparation of the late stage of the competition, such as project arranging, presentation, and Parts mailing. They guided us with great patience and offered many valuable opinions.

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Colony PCR samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 5μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
It is apparent that no amplicons of interest are found, other than template/uncut/self-closing plasmids (lane 3 & 25). Judging from the double bands around 200 and 500, most of the clones are identified to contain plain pACYC-DUET, which contains double T7 promoter, resulting in double amplicons around that height.

pGLO transformation at BioCurious (Jay)
The transformation we did on Saturday was successful.  We got some transformants on plates 1B, 3B and 2B expressing GFP.  I attached images showing all the plates and the GFP glowing under UV (let me know if you need a higher res image).  Below is a table of the plate by plate outcomes.   We used pGLO plasmids from different sources and some were over a year old so we expected that not all would successfully transform.  Thanks to everyone who helped out on Saturday!!  
I'll streak an HB101/pGLO plate for CCL.  I plan to do a miniprep to purify the pGLO plasmid on Thursday night starting around 7pm if anyone wants to participate. Patrik will be at Biocurious on Thursday night and he can pick up a plate with the transformed HB101 and some plasmid to take back to CCL.

Signal-to-background ratio (S/B):
Signal-to-background ratio
The approach is quite similar to the one that determines the optimal wavelengths which should be used to monitor the fluorescence of the NAD+ bioassay buffer (Fbuffer) and the added molecular beacon (Fclosed) as well as the target (Fopen) or split target. Monitor the fluorescence at the optimal wavelengths until the equilibrium is reached each time before you add a new component.
The signal-to-background ratio can be calculated as shown on the right. Finally, compare the signal-to-background ratios after adding the target and split target to check whether the split target has an effect on the melting of the molecular beacon's hairpin structure.
Imaging:
Prepare a 200 µL reaction mix composed of NAD+ bioassay buffer and 500 nM molecular beacon in a PCR tube. In a separate sample add 600 µM either target or split target. Excitate the samples by a UV transilluminator and take images preferably with a camera that can detect different colours.
Purification of DNA ligase
The purification of the overexpressed NAD+-dependent DNA ligase gene ( BBa_K525710 ) in E. coli was performed under native conditions and Ni-NTA columns were used utilizing the recombinant protein`s C-terminal 6xHis-tag.
Cultivation
Prepare an overnight culture of E. coli KRX carrying the plasmid with DNA ligase ( BBa_K525710 ) in 30 ml LB medium containing 20 μg mL-1 chloramphenicol at 37 °C.
Dilute the overnight culture in 100 ml autoinduction medium (20 μg mL-1 chloramphenicol added) to an OD600 = 0,1 and harvest the cells after 4 h growth at 37 °C.
Use the centrifuged cells immediately for protein purification or store them at -20 °C.
Small-scale purification
Resuspend a pellet derived from 5 ml cell culture volume in 630 μl NPI-10 .
Add 70 μl lysozyme (10 mg/ml) as well as 25 Units benzonase nuclease and mix thoroughly.

Recombination Module
Overview / Rationale
The final project in our module which activates after the delay produced by the Time Control module is the Recombination module. The purpose of this module is to create recombinase proteins which will cleave the plasmid at specific sites and separate the origin of replication from the gene of interest. The recombinase we chose to use in our project was Cre recombinase.
Cre recombinase does not destroy the entire plasmid and allows the cell to live after the gene sequence is removed. This could be advantageous in eukaryotic organisms where the death of healthy cells is not favorable and only the unwanted gene portion needs to be removed.
Cre recombinase is simple to use when two loxP sites are flanked around the sequence to be excised without the addition of other guided DNA/mRNA. It has been experimented with in mammalian organisms and extensively in mice. Similar recombinases such as Dre can be further added to splice other inserted gene sequences. The Dre recombinase recognizes its own specific sites so there will not be cross recombination between the two recombinases.
While Cre recombinase itself can only recombine about 55% of the plasmids to be in the recombined state due to the fact that it also catalyzes the reverse reaction back to the original state, our model shows that under when the population size is in equilibrium, the amount of the gene of interest is diluted after generations of cell replication and cell death.
Diagram 1. Cre recombinase targets lox mutant sites which will then recombine gene A, while Dre recombinase targets rox site which will recombine gene B
The function of the Cre-lox & Dre-rox is to knock out the gene of interest from the plasmid. Cre is a site-specific         DNA recombinase derived from the P1 bacteriophage while Dre derives from P1-like transducing phage D6 isolated from         Salmonella"

NYMU-Taipei,2016,Team:NYMU-Taipei#HP#Gold-Media Analysis_-_-_TEXT.html,"9 for example, many college students may have heard of it, but to what degree do they know about CRISPR/Cas9? When we consider restriction enzyme as high school level gene technology-related term, some, or to say, many high school students may not actually understand how this protein works. And to know how restriction enzyme works is beyond what undergraduate have to know.
B. Not gene technology-related term:
Take 2013 iGEM Colombia Uniandes wiki for example:
It is widely accepted that exposure to stressors increases secretion of glucocorticoids, cortisol, and corticosterone in a wide variety of gnathostome                         vertebrates (Stephens, 1980) (Greenberg et al, 1987). Research in animals, have demonstrated that allostatic overload of this hormones and other                         mediators, resulting from chronic stress, causes atrophy of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex; brain regions involved in memory,                         selective attention and executive function; likewise, it causes hypertrophy of neurons in the amygdala, the brain region involved in fear and anxiety                         as well as aggression (McEwen, 2004).
We say understandability is highly related to difficulty of terminology. In this project, we look into gene tech related terminology which is an important                     part in accessing the understandability of a team’s wiki. However, when reading the paragraph above, several vocabularies, such as: glucocorticoids,                     cortisol, corticosterone, gnathostome vertebrates, allostatic overload lead to low understandability in their background.
ii. What is the definition of terminology explanation?
At first, we thought the definition of terminology explanation is clear, meaning an article provides deliberation on a technical term. We found the                     definition is clear and successfully wade through the field of magazines. But we got stranded when we saw 2013 iGEM SDU-Denmark . SDU-Denmark is so thoughtful that they offer clear information when the                     mouse hovers a term. As we were astonished at these considerate design, we discovered the information displayed may not be useful for general public:
We may agree at ‘natural rubber’ is helpful to realize the word ‘isoprene chain’. But it doesn’t look so when it comes to other cases. In real work, since this design really offer several useful explanations, we consider it as offering more than 3 terminology explanation.
Result and Discussion

Application: Customizable Bioplastics
    The world’s plastic problem is reaching new levels of unsustainability and pollution. Bioplastics, plastics made from biodegradable materials that can break down on their own, could be a possible solution. One way to create bioplastics is by using polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), storage polymers used by a variety of microorganisms. Since these are a part of a microorganism’s natural synthesis and degradation cycles, these plastics should naturally be broken down. With multiple microorganisms each producing their own PHAs, polymers could be created with different subunits. By controlling the ratios of the organisms producing the PHAs, we could control the ratios of the subunits, allowing for greater variability—melting temperature, glass transition temperature, flexibility, and more! This is where our project comes in: controlling the ratios of the organisms allows for control of the PHA ratios, which can help control the characteristics of the plastic polymerized.

Collaboration with Groningen ’09 team and Amsterdam ´09
Through the summer we have been maintaining close relations and collaborations with the teams of Groningen and Amsterdam . We had two meetings (just one with Amsterdam), one on June 29th 2009 in the city of Groningen and the other on August 20th 2009 in the city of Delft. The agenda for both meetings was composed by presentation sessions from all the teams present, troubleshooting discussions, experiences exchange and of course lunch and fun activities in each city. We hope both teams gained useful inputs as we did from their suggestions and comments.

INSA-Lyon,2014,Team:INSA-Lyon#molecular_-_-_TEXT.html," chelate an ion. All in all, we determined that a floating tag should be able to chelate up to 5? nickel ions for the His1-tag, and 8? for the His2-tag.
""Then what is the point of tagging the original protein when it chelates so much more than the tag itself?"" are you going to ask me. The answer is quite simple : just for one protein, with only one His1-tag we increase its chelation power by 25%. Now remember that CsgA is only the subunit of a fiber that is composed of thousands of them, that one bacterium bear hundreds, maybe thousands of these fibers, and that a culture of such bacteria allows for a countless number of bacteria as well, it's easy to understand how an increase of 25% of efficiency of the elementary unit of the fiber is already quite something. Well, that's provided the floating conformation is the prefered one, but as the wetlab results liens vers résultats ICP seem to prove that His2-tagged CsgA chelates better than His1-tagged CsgA, that already chelates more than wildtype CsgA, we can be confident in saying that the floating conformation is actually the most present in the fiber. However, as we are still unable to accurately quantify curli and CsgA, we unfortunately cannot provide any information regarding the difference between the theoretical chelating power of CsgA and the experimentally determined quantity of captured nickel.
Conclusion
Overall sum up
Through our molecular study of a CsgA protein engineered with either His1-tag or His2-tag, we came to the conclusion that since it has a longer and its mobility makes it more available for chelation, using a tag positioned by the C-terminus of the protein is more relevant than placing it in the middle of the sequence, although doing so may provide a little more chelation power as long as the tag isn't too long. We also showed that for the tags there exist two possible conformations : one is folded on the side of CsgA and a priori does not increase the already-existing chelating power of CsgA; the other is a ""floating"" conformation where the tag is not attracted to the protein and is able to improve its chelating power by up to 25%!
What we couldn't achieve
Unfortunately, having very little time and people, there are a few things we couldn't investigate as extensively as we wanted:

BNU-China,2017,Team:BNU-China#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"tubule molecular motors to create a micro-factory based on the extracellular microtubule network we built.
Additionally, due to the important role microtubule plays in mitosis, it is also a major target in cancer treatment. As microtubule-stabilizing agents become more and more important in cancer chemotherapy, it's really necessary to find more antitumor agents such as Taxol®, or other agents that can also stabilize microtubules. Displaying microtubules on the yeast surface, we can easily observe the interaction between small molecules and microtubules, which is very helpful for cancer treatment.
Figure 4 The protein system used to simulate the interaction between microtubules and Taxol®. GTP and GDP are shown in cyan and gold, respectively. The M-loop for this monomer is colored yellow and the interacting H1-S2 loop of the adjacent monomer is colored red.
(Source: Arpita M, et al. Biophysical Journal, 2008.)
What do we plan to do using microtubule?
Thanks to the comprehensive human practice work, we learned a crucial fact: considering the poor stability of microtubules and their strict polymerization conditions, we'd better not use microtubules in large-scale industrial applications, but should rather use it in a relatively mild laboratory environment.
Thus, we regard microtubule as an excellent tool for high-throughput screening of microtubule-stabilizing agents. Furthermore, we attempt to construct a screening platform on our microtubule display technique.
Display module-parts design
Here we choose the vector pYD1 to fulfill the display function. As shown on the Figure 5, pYD1 vector contains AGA2 gene, which has described above, codes AGA2 protein. And our target protein is fused on the C-terminus of AGA2p, which is shown as multiple cloning sites in Figure 5.
So after inducing by galactose, our target gene expression can be started by GAL1 promotor. Additionally, there are also several tags on the plasmid such as V5 tag and His-tag, which will be used in further analysis.
In this display module, we designed two basic parts: pYD1-α-tubulin (BBa_K2220019) and pYD1-β-tubulin (BBa_K2220020) , which means to insert α-tubulin or β-tubulin gene sequences respectively.

Next week:
1) Calculate estimate of transformation efficiency
2) Calibration of nanodrop respective to yeast (and E. Coli) OD measurements <== important for activator tests
3) Activator and competitive binding plates
4) Replate transformations if possible, especially those that were contaminated (for those without contamination, attempt to reuse plates)
5) Verification of transformations (massive amount of colony PCRs and subsequent gels)
-must verify the expected lengths of each band

But what are our biological beads made of? Using clever natural engineering millions of years ago, evolution developed endospores of the soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis. Endospores, which are highly resistant to environmental stressors and can survive harsh conditions, are a dormant life stage of B. subtilis. To get to know more about the life cycle and the production of endospores, have a look at the life cycle of B. subtilis on the next page.

Overview
To enable an efficient project development, it is essential to regularly talk with experts. These give insights regarding actual requirements on the specific area of expertise. In addition the permanent consolidation of experts during the project development process, it is useful to obtain an assessment at the end of the project,  in order to assess aspects such as efficiency, future opportunities and biosecurity. Therefore, we consolidated several experts to evaluate our project. Dr. Falk Harnisch was our permanent expert who helped us especially with the engineering aspects and mediators. For the project assessment we consulted Dr. Arnold Sauter and Dipl. Environmental Scientist Aeneas Wanner.
Dr. Falk Harnisch
Introduction
At the congress Biotechnologie2020+ in Berlin, Germany we met Dr. Falk Harnisch , an expert in bioelectrocatalysis and bioelectrotechnology, who works at the department of environmental microbiology at the Helmholtz-Zentrum for environmental research in Leipzig, Germany. He is the supervisor of the research group for microbial biocatalysis and bioelectrotechnology.
On October 8th we interviewed him via Skype. After a short discussion about our Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) at the beginning, where we figured out that the most difficult part of the MFC is the transfer of the electrons through the cell membrane and"

Protocol
Sample Collection
Take cells out of the incubator and wash them with PBS 3x
Lyse the cells (we used three different protocols for this step: Freeze-Thaw Protocol for Protein Samples , Glass Beads Cell Lysis Protocol for Protein Samples )
This solution should be gooey once you collect it. Boil your sample at 95°C for 5 minutes and pass it through a 20-200μL pipette. If the lysate is passing freely (i.e. not gooey) then freeze the sample or do protein assay. If the lysate is still gooey boil it again and repeat the steps until it is no longer gooey
Protein Quantification
Add 20μL of reagent S to each mL of reagent A that will be necessary for the run. This makes reagent A’ (If the solution precipitates warm the solution and vortex. Do not pipette the solution the precipitate might clog the tip)
Prepare standards (use BSA at 0.2mg/mL, 0.5mg/mL, 1.0mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL)
In a 96 well plate put in 5μL of your standards as well as your samples in triplicates. Make sure to map it out first

Nottingham,2018,Team:Nottingham#Lab_-_-_TEXT.html," allowing quantification of the effectiveness of each guide RNA. Out of the six guide RNAs tested guide RNA 6 displayed the most consistently promising results with significantly less Gus activity implying that this guide recruits dCas9 to the PtcdA promoter region most effectively. Therefore guide RNA 6 will be used in future work when the dCas9 approach is trialled within C. difficile for its ability to reduce toxin production.
Future Work
Since we have demonstrated the effectiveness of asRNA at reducing C. difficile toxicity in this project, the obvious next step is to integrate our toxin suppressing construct into phiSBRC. This will involve taking the C. difficile lysogen with phiSBRC integrated into the genome and modifying it in the same way as we would modify the C. difficile genome normally. A recent paper (Wang et al., 2018) has described genome modification of C. difficile using Cas9 as a counter-selection mechanism forcing the cell to undergo homologous recombination with the delivered knockout plasmid to escape the lethal effects of Cas9. The recombination event which allows the cell to avoid the lethal double stranded break caused by Cas9 is directed by homology arms delivered on the knockout plasmid allowing researchers to delete genomic regions or introduce novel DNA into the genome. With this approach in mind we designed the plasmid pSBRC_Cas9_PhageIntegration_holin. This plasmid contains asRNA Construct Two which reduced toxin production by 85%, between homology arms directed at a gene within the phiSBRC prophage. The phiSBRC gene we chose to target was a holin gene which is thought to be responsible for cell lysis. Without this gene the progeny phage particles will not be able to burst out of the bacterial cell. This gene was chosen because it is one of the few areas of the genome which we are confident in ascribing function to and that function is not required to prepare more of the modified phage. Even without the phage being able to exit the bacterial cell it can still be induced and replicate itself and from there we can artificially extract phage particles ready for re-infection or delivery as a therapeutic. The other reason the holin gene was chosen is because of concerns around the size of phage genome which can be successfully packaged. It may be that the phage has evolved to be at or near to the limit of DNA which it can package. In this case replacing the holin gene which is of a similar size to asRNA Construct Two would mean that this is no longer an issue.
After knocking out the holin gene whilst simultaneously introducing"

DESIGN NOTE
There are 4 Questions on the Safety page.
Q.1 Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
1.researcher safety,
2.public safety, or
3.environmental safety?
A. No issues of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety raised up during our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2012 project. We used nucleic acid donor or host, which follow the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1.
In our project, we plan to establish transgenic flies. They will be produced and kept in P1 room and fly room in which fly trap and double-entry doors are equipped. By these safety equipments, even if they escape from the culture bottle to the room, we can block them flying out of the room.
Q.2 Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes,
1.did you document these issues in the Registry?
2.How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
3.How could other teams learn from your experience?
A. No. A BioBrick part we are going to submit is related to GAL4-UAS system which is generally used to study Drosophila melanogaster. Any safety risk has not been reported.
Q.3 Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
2.If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A. Yes. We have bio safety group at KIT, and our project has been monitored by them. The leader of this biological safety group was Prof. Yamaguchi. Furthermore, there is an upper level committee of the recombinant DNA experiments at Kyoto Institute of Technology. Our project has also received permission from this committee. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It meets with all safety standards requested by biosafety level 1. In addition, Prof. Yamaguchi and other supervisors and instructors fully support the work done by this iGEM team.
Q.4 Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues"

A core concept of iGEM is the collaboration within an interdisciplinary student team. Accordingly, students of different age, gender and field of study came together to found our team in Aachen, in order to realize our project with joint forces and enthusiasm for the overall goal. Working closely together, we therefore not only have the chance to learn from each other, but also to excel ourselves. Using our collective creativity and common responsibility, we will create something special in order to make our contribution to synthetic biology.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," brightness information. We can use the relative position to pick 10 pixel in each line, and calculate the mean value of each line’s brightness. We assume that there is a linear relationship between the brightness of the system and the amount of GFP in the system. Now we can get a relative stoichiometric relation of three mi-RNA. We use the function mentioned above to sum the data proportionately. We set B2P(Brightness to Possibility) as the symbol of this value.
Finally we use this data to calculate the possibility of having cancer.(Of course we have to get the threshold of B2P value. But that can be easily calculated through a machine learning or a basic statistical method if we can get enough samples.)
Outlook
Exactly，all of the experiments we have done is to improve the channel capacity and reduce the disturbance from the noise at the same time. Anyway our final target is to make sure that we can transfer more information when the environment is noisy. Our team focuses on comparing performance between two ways to get fluorescent protein (EBFP), namely, to express the protein directly from the gene, or to independently express two proteins and let them assembly afterwards to become the same protein as the one in the first way. Beside analyzing the experimental data by calculating channel capacity of two systems we wanted to know if there are any difference between two circuits in amplifying the inputs or responding to the noise. And we also want to know which frequency of noise makes our circuit worse and which signal-to-noise ratio may have a higher channel capacity?
So we have these simulations first and we will conduct more experiments to collect data and confirm our conclusion.

Daily Life
Overview
Our project is about information flowing through gene-regulatory networks and it contains both theory of information and biology. The human practice we did fit our project very well. We show the students who have no idea about what synthetic biology is the fun it have and also make the cross subjects knew by more people. We all think we have did a meaningful practice and help promote development of the cross subjects which is also the aim of iGEM. In a word, human practice gives us a chance to tell more people about our idea and the makes more people realize the charm of synthetic biology.

Please refer to this protocol.
Cell measurement protocol
Prior to performing the cell measurements we performed all three of the calibration measurements. For the take of consistency and reproducibility, we used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha, as the other teams.                       For all of these cell measurements, we used the same plates and volumes that we used in the calibration protocol. We also used the same settings that in our calibration measurements.
Protocol:
Day 1:Transform Escherichia coli DH5α with the plasmids (all in pSB1C3) given in the material and settings section. Please refer to the electroporation protocol.
Day2:Pick 2 colonies from each of the transformation plates and inoculate in 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Day3:Cell growth, sampling, and assay
Make a 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture in LB+Chloramphenicol (0.5mL of culture into 4.5mL of LB+Chlor)
Measure Abs600 of these 1:10 diluted cultures

Edinburgh,2013,Team:Edinburgh#Human Practices#Independence_-_-_TEXT.html," that people want to do good, high quality research, and those opportunities exist in Scotland. It is necessary to ensure that the universities are funded properly, and that would be a priority of the Scottish government, but provided that’s done, the universities will continue to survive and thrive under independence, I’ve absolutely no doubt about that.
J: From our discussions with academics, we felt that they were not certain about their position post-independence.
JE: The concerns are absolutely legitimate, I’m absolutely confident that the Scottish government will be able to provide the reassurance that the people seek, because it’s in our interest to do that. At the end of the day, if you’ve got the fiscal levers, if you’re in control of your own finances then you can then determine what your priorities are, and there’s absolutely no question that higher education would be a priority for Scotland, and life sciences research within that. We would find the resources to match the current funding, and I think over time to exceed the level of funding. Because that’s where our comparative advantage as a country is going to be, in key sectors such as Life Sciences. One of the things that’s great is that we’re attracting some of the best brains from across the world to come and study in Scotland and then to go on and work in important research.
J: Yes, our entire academic group in our School of Biological Sciences is very international; researchers are coming from all over the world to work here.
JE: The links that have been built up over many years within the UK, those will continue, professional cross fertilization of ideas and research is something everybody wants. Scotland and England and other countries within the UK will continue to cooperate, what we are seeking to do is to create a new institutional framework, so the MPs from Scotland who currently go to Westminster would withdraw, and the Scottish parliament would have responsibility over the areas that are currently reserved for Westminster parliament. That’s not to say that the governments would not work together, and we’ve already got an embryonic system, if you think back to the Northern Ireland peace process, one of the things that came out of that was the Council of the Isles, or the British-Irish council, which has it’s secretariat in Edinburgh. It brings together the UK Government, the Republic of Ireland, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the crown dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man, which have very small populations, yet sit at the table with the devolved administrations and the UK government as equals. It’s similar to the European Union (EU)"

Composite Parts
tfa (tail fibre assembly) gene circuit (BBa_K1846001)
This part provides the gene sequence for tfa (tail fibre assembly) protein, together with a TetR repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ), ribosome binding site ( BBa_B0034) and an rrNB T1 terminator ( BBa_B0010 ).
The tfa (tail fibre assembly) protein of bacteriophage lambda assists in the assembly of the stf (short tail fibre) protein into a functional short tail fibre [1],[2]. Tfa gene displays a high level of homology (~40%) with the gp38 of bacteriophage T4 [2],[3],[4].
This tfa circuit was synthesised removing the illegal restriction sites to make the sequence BioBrick-compatible. The sequence was cloned into a pSB1C3 and the success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with EcoRI and SpeI restriction enzymes and followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1). The construct was also confirmed by sequencing. This BioBrick was registered as part BBa_K1846001 .
TetR circuit (BBa_K1846003)
This is a constitutive part for the production of the tetracyline repressor TetR, using a constitutive, medium-copy chloramphenicol promoter ( BBa_I14033 ), ribosome binding sequence ( BBa_B0031 ) and double terminator (rrnb T1 terminator followed by a T7Te terminator, BBa_B0010 ).
TetR generator cassette ( BBa_P0140 ) and P(Cat) promoter ( BBa_I14033 ) were obtained from 2015 iGEM distribution kit  and cloned into a single pSB1C3 vector. Correct cloning of the parts into the pSB1C3 shipping vector was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2) and Sanger sequencing. This BioBrick has been registered as part BBa_K1846003 .

Fudan,2017,Team:Fudan China#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," the taxonomy, giving it a completely new interpretation aimed specifically at iGEM project presentation.
We hope that these works may lead to a better understanding of possible goals or outcome one may get when presenting the iGEM project, and that improvements may be made by finding out the additional goals one may want to achieve when comparing the existing goals and the possible goals listed in this taxonomy.
Here are the detailed illustrations of our work.
First we shall have a look at the right part of the figure, the box named ‘metacognitive system’. The idea comes from the revised version of Bloom’s Taxonomy by Robert J. Marzano, which indicates that mental process can be ordered in terms of control. That is to say, before we actually start our cognitive activities, we need first to decide whether or not we will engage in the speech the speaker is delivering. When it comes to presenting an iGEM project, it means that at the beginning, the speaker may need to stress on the importance and uniqueness of the project. So it would be helpful to show the seriousness of the problem the project is dealing with, and to clarify the research background of the project so that people doing research in similar fields may be interested.
Then we may come to the cognitive part of the process, which is illustrated by the large triangle in the middle in figure. It is further divided into four levels.
1. Retrieval
The retrieval here means the retrieval of knowledge about simple facts. The major mental activity in this stage is memory. It’s about the knowledge we have memorized and the knowledge we are yet to memorize.
Speakers working on this level will help the audience to recall simple facts like ‘an open reading frame starts to express when the inducer binds to the promoter’, and also introduce the basic feature of a new concept like ‘a recombinase reverses the DNA sequence between its action sites’.
The knowledge or fact we retrieve here will become the building block of the following stages.
2. Comprehension
Comprehension here includes the common ‘understanding’ process and also an additional ‘interpretation’ process, which means that the audience here are expected to take in what the speaker is explaining and convert it into something that is more meaningful to him/herself.
Speakers working on this level will give meanings to the knowledge building bricks retrieved in the first level. The basic knowledge here are organized in a certain relationship to express an idea the speaker want to express.
In an iGEM presentation, this is extremely important when the speaker tries to explain how their circuit work, for example ‘how does the combination of different promot"

HOW CAN THAT EVER BE POSSIBLE (?):Basically, we focus on achieving BRET under electromagnetic field oscillations......
In our project, we focus heavily on inducible BRET by electromagnetic field oscillations (BRET, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer). In this stream of thought, mms13, a transmembrane magnetite tight-binding protein on the magnetosome membrane of Magnetopirillum magneticum AMB-1 was chosen as the linker between non-contact force and biological responses. Comformational wobbling of mms13 induced by magnetic movement under electromagnetic field oscillation is our primary hypothesis. Before testing on this hypothesis directly, we have designed several constructs to prove ""lemmas,"" which are believed to be the foundation to this ""theory"". Computational modeling is thus a key emphasis in our project, check out for more !
BUT BEFORE DREAMS COME TRUE (#):Yeah, yeah, we know......We were not using E. coli.
Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 has been proven to serve as a genetically manipulatable species. And we also noticed from the history of iGem that there are always some teams attempting almost every year to deal with AMB-1, but, unfortunately, those respectful movements never got their chance to appear on the jamborees. This year, we will make a change. A brand-new magnetic chassis is about to be established, and a complete toolkit containing all elements required in genetic manipulations on AMB-1 has been submitted to the registry (see Chassis for more details).
WAIT, SO YOU GONNA PUT THEM IN... (§):Glial cells in brain......Yes, we will make them dormant.
Retrospectively, neuroimmune response appears to be the major negative issue spanning all invasive neuro-stimulatory methodologies. Although we've designed the injectable wireless optogenetic system aimed to avoid deleterious responses surrounding the electrodes / light cables inserted into the brain tissue, our very approach, utilizing bacteria, if left unresolved, may cause far more serious aftereffects. To handle this problem, we engineer our AMB-1 with genes of team Warsaw's construct in 2010. In brief, intracellularity with controlled cell count is our goal of this part. We've designed a timeline of future applications with optomagnetic AMB-1, where stable in vitro symbiosis within glial cells precedes injection on the schedule. And, in our design we plan to inject glial cells containing AMB-1, not bacteria ("

Debrecen-Hungary,2010,Team:Debrecen-Hungary#project_-_-_TEXT.html," we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity.
The potential for these tools is immense; e.g. from the ultra sensitive detection of lipid contaminants in the environment to the opportunity of titration specific gene expression canges in patients undergoing gene therapy. Regarding applications in food quality control assessment, these system allows the measurement of Vitamin A, Vitamin A derivatives through RAR (retinoic acid receptor),  vitamin D and its derivatives through VDR (vitamin D receptor), but also the detection of steroids (antiinflamatory steroids, anabolic steroids, estrogens) through GR (glucocorticoid receptor), ER (estrogen receptors), AR (testosteron receptor). By simply copying the xenobiotic receptors of humans (e.g. PXR, CAR) we can assess the presence of antibiotics in food or wheter existing or new food additives will activate our endogenous xenobiotic system.
In summary the Nuclear Receptor Toolkit developped by us allows the (1) ultra sensitive detection of xenobiotic activators in the environment (e.g. oil derived traces in water and soil), (2)  the assessment of lipid soluble vitamins, steroids, xenobiotics in food and (3) the potential of inducing specific genetic programs in transfected cells or modell organisms with a possibility to destroy these modified cells by an independent tetracyclin induced apoptosis effector system.
Introduction
Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is a relatively new area of biological research; similar to many other new scientific fields it has many definitions. The best way to express the meaning of synthetic biology is to understand the desired end-result: engineering of complex biological systems. These systems are best thought of as analogues of everyday machinery: cogwheels, levers, timers, button and buzzers (in this case a clock), only in the case of biological systems (molecular ones) cells, DNA, proteins, lipids, sugars and RNA are the “parts” of the system.
Similar to mechanical engineering (or every other engineering branch) there is a need for standards (consensus way of doing things), abstraction (simple and unified way of thinking about the parts of a system), and modularity (how these parts interact to become the device, or several devices into a system). Thus a good definition for synthetic biology could be engineering of molecular (for the time being) biological systems according to preset standard parts.  The international genetically engineered machines and associated parts registry are, to date, one of the largest registries for standard parts"

Figure 7: Simulated concentrations of product and reactant in the toy example. Measurement noise is added to mimic experimental data
To better simulate actual conditions in which literature values could be wrong,  initial parameter estimates were each an order of magnitude lower than their actual values (0.1 and 0.01). We also used as few data points as possible while still maintaining small error rates (<10%). For the extended kalman filter, the lower limit turned out to be 30-40 measurements, while the particle filter had success down to 15.
EKF Test #1:
Figure 8: EKF simulation run on the toy example. Reactant and Product tracking is shown in the top two plots, while the two parameter estimates are depicted in the lower two.
As recommended by Lilacci and Khammash, final parameter estimates were calculated by averaging the last ten kalman filter predictions. Running the entire simulation 1000 times resulted in a mean parameter estimate of 0.9951 and 0.0968 respectively (less than 1% and 4% error), with standard deviations at about 10% each. As seen in the figure above, two different measurement types (reactant and product concentration) can be fused together to produce more accurate results.
Figure 9: Distribution of parameter estimates over the course of 1000 EKF simulations
EKF Test #2:
Next, we moved on to testing our filters with the predicted equations of our base editor system. We chose to focus on the base editor binding to DNA and . We again simulated the data using known constants (taken from the literature), and measurement noise with variance around 10% of the total range. Unfortunately, because our system was very non-linear (due to the wide range of rate constants), the extended kalman filter diverged from the correct estimates. It was clear that a different filter would be needed for this more complex system.
Particle Filter Test #2:
The particle filter was initialized with 1000 particles and fed the same simulated data as the EKF. This time the filter was able to eventually track the amount of DNA base edits over time, and converge onto the given parameters. As shown in the figures below a tradeoff still existed between the number of datapoints used and the accuracy of results. The 10% error threshold was crossed between 30 data points and 15 data points, but estimates could still be improved by altering the time steps between points, giving more resolution to the transient stages of the reaction.

Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Notebook#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," the PQS sensor, we also got started on planning and constructing the DSF sensor. From this point onwards we decided to use GFP rather than mCherry, as we already had antibodies against it for blotting later. Our desired DSF sensor has four sensory components! This posed a bit of a problem for cloning, as we thought we would need to use more restriction enzymes than we had access to. The solution? Order primers that include a 5’ BglII site and 3’ BamHI-XbaI sites. This way, fragments could be cloned in sequentially. Each new insert could be cut with BglII-XbaI, and the ever-growing vector cut with BamHI-XbaI. This is because the BglII and BamHI overhangs are complementary, but upon ligation leave a scar that is not recognized by either enzyme (see below). The 3’ BamHI-XbaI site allows this process to be repeated indefinitely. Woo, idempotency! A lot of cloning followed...
Week 4
With lots of cloning, comes lots of sequencing… which was all kindly carried out by the sequencing service downstairs from our lab. To help us along the way Professor Philip Cohen kindly granted us 100 free sequencing runs (which we quickly exceeded!). After every cloning step for building our PQS and DSF sensor, we sent a sample to be sequenced – the results were a source of merriment and heartbreak in equal measure…it turned out that our cloned PQS sensor wasn’t quite right so we spent the week trying to rectify this.
We also began the lengthy task of removing all the illegal restriction sites from the fragments bound for BioBricking; and so began Dimitrios’ epic journey into the world of BioBricks!
It turned out, (after a bit more sifting through papers), that the Netlogo model for PQS was not quite right. While we figured that out, we began to calculate the ordinary differential equations for the same system.
Week 5
We successfully biobricked PpqsA!
Thankfully we had succesfully ligated PpqsA with pqsR-HA into pUniprom.   After western blotting the PQS system, we obtained results which showed that PqsR was being expressed. We then obtained synthetic PQS from Sigma Aldrich to test this sensor for the production of GFP.  Meanwhile...the dry team were finding the the DSF model slightly harder to work with than PQS (sorry guys!), as it contained a lot of components; our first model started with about "

Project description
While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism.
In terms of fat storage, conversion of carbohydrates or protein into fat uses ten times more calories of energy than simply storing fat in a fat cell. This brought us attention to one method of burning calories - increase energy expenditure by converting fat into glucose. However, mammals cannot convert fatty acids into carbohydrate due to lack of glyoxylate enzymes, while plants and bacteria can. We envision to introduce glyoxylate enzymes into mammalian cells and create an artificial futile cycle.
While the consequence of introducing nonnative cycle unknown, Dean et al. at UCLA recently has introduced glyoxylate shunt into mammalian liver cell to investigate fatty acid metabolism (2009). They observed that although fatty acids could not be converted into glucose in normal mammalian cells, human hepatocytes expressing the glyoxylate shunt have increased fatty acid oxidation and mice expressing the shunt were resistance to diet-induced obesity.
In addition to introducing a constitutive glyoxylate shunt, our team plans to elaborate the UCLA study by introducing inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentrations. This inducible system prevents the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while greater fatty acid uptake at high circulating concentrations can be facilitated. Fatty acids uptake will be quantified to compare the activities in wild type cells and cells expressing constitutive and inducible glyoxylate shunt.
We believe the introduction of an inducible glyoxylate shunt will serve as an artificial futile cycle in human liver cell that increases energy expenditure responding to high circulating fatty acid levels. This will help obesity patients increase expenditure of calories and alleviate health complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.

Part 2  Feasibility & Practicality
Although our project is just a small step forward on the way to specific protein degradation, if one day we find proteins that can induce cell carcinogenesis then we can use this technique to weed out these carcinogenic proteins in the human body, which will contribute a lot in the history of Medicine. However, we had no idea about the feasibility and practicality of the application of PR PREDATOR in actual disease, especially cancer. And to what extent could the new development of cancer treatment be promoted?
Based on the above questions, we contacted Professor Qiang Ma and Professor Yunshan Ning in School of Laboratory Medicine and Biotechnology, Southern Medical University by emails on the exchange and consultation.
Through the interviews, we had learned that the degradation of target protein is still a cutting-edge field in scientific research and clinical application. The environment of human cells is so complex we can’t exactly say which protein is absolute good or bad for humans. And the degree of degradation may affect the internal environment as well. Talking about the details in experiment, we still had some issues to consider, including cross-reaction, the affinity of single-domain antibodies and so on. Only when we solved these problems could we took further step in application and industrialization of our project.

Introduction
As an introduction to modeling we've made a small presentation for the workout sessions of the first meeting. This presentation handles the following items:
some definitions
the difference between white box and black box models with an example
focus on the role of ODE's
the need for modeling
some modeling tools
and iGEM modeling
This presentation is mainly based on the wiki of ETH Zürich 2006/2007.
The Full Model
Modeling steps
Position in the system
For each of the subsystems (compartments) we started with the idea of what it was supposed to do, considering it as a black-box system (as described in the project page ). To make sure that Dr. Coli was able to do his work properly, we had to design several subsystems and be well aware of the different interfaces between these subsystems.
Then we tried to match species with these black-boxes, keeping in mind the working biobricks which have been made already. So we searched for existing components which could be able to perform the requested task.
Describing the system
The kinetic actions (transcription, translation, complexation, ...) that take place in the subsystems can be described by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) like Mass-Action laws, Hill Kinetic laws and so"

We have constructed a new website for all the iGEMers to learn and communicate--- CORRIDOR
We want to build a website that provides a chance to communicate. Good ideas always been discovered during constant sharing and discussing. You can always find people benefiting from this in the corridor of university or even back to the era of ancient Greek. And that is why we found Corridor, a place where communication would not stop, with the infinite discovered of genius ideas.
Corridor has some different features, one of these is the community of iGEMers. You can either glance through some practical report or participate in an enjoyable debate on the biosafety issue. You can also find some useful tips that provided by some elder members of iGEM team. Anyway, please feel free to exchange your ideas with others.
We’ve also settle a special page-----Memory, when you first look at it. It’s just a calendar. And each iGEMer can draft something down in the exact date on the calendar by words or picture, even emoji! We believe after the accumulation of this diary-like report, people can find some precious memory together with some experiences. That, is another meaningful feature.
It was after the tour of CCIC of 2017, when we were in the middle of flight, we believe that it is really significant for every iGEMers to know about some different projects and of course some new minds from synthetic biology. But CCIC can only fulfill this once a year, lasting for 3 days, which is apparently too limited compared to the questions that we want an answer. So, why don’t we make it easier and more efficient? And that is how Corridor first came to be. What really interesting is, this idea came from discussion, again! And I can still remember how excited we were about the plan of making such a website in the airport, just like the way we dedicate ourselves making it.
Of course there are a lot of problems need to be solved. Currently we want to make sure the iGEM teams from other countries can also visit our website. And we plan to launch the app in the next year, with a shinny project plan: Corridor 2.0! We want to ask for some integration with iGEM and some other synthetic companies. Anyway, we are working our way up and we believe CORRIDOR will be benefiting all the iGEMers in the short future.Of course there are a lot of problems need to be solved.

Therefore, key project ideas and goals were provided to us from Lynn and we were encouraged to collaborate and complement our efforts with the Stanford-Brown-RISD team.   As the supervisor of the Stanford-Brown-RISD team and mother of Kyle, Lynn was the connecting point of both our projects. She had a strong vision for a two-parted project and managed successfully to convey the possibilities to us. Even though she is across the world, she has managed to visit us three times to guide us.

Safety
Synthetic biology has the potential to impact many areas of society.     Synthetic biologists may use artificial molecules to reproduce emergent     behavior from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial     life or seeking interchangeable biological parts to assemble them into     devices and systems that function in a manner not found in nature (Benner     and Sismour 2005, Endy 2005, Heinemann and Panke 2006, Luisi 2007, Serrano     2007).There is possibility of causing intentional or accidental harm     to humans, agriculture or the environment. While deliberate damage is     dealt with under the heading biosecurity, the potential unintended consequences     have to be considered under the term biosafety. As a software developer     , we have to consider all possible maliciously use of synthetic biology     tools. However, it is diffucult to understand for which purposesour     tools will be used, bestway avoiding garage bioterrorism is all parts     before adding to partsregistry must be checked , looked for toxic affect     and any environmental or human harmness. After scanning possible candidate     parts, a committe should decide whether novel part can be added parts     registry or not.And we can only warn the user about our intention while     building the application:

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence ( BBa_K1119000 , BBa_K1119001 )
Introduction
In our characterization, the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format ( BBa_K648013 ). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter ( BBa_K1119006 ), and terminated by hGH polyA signal ( BBa_K404108 ). The aforementioned construct ( BBa_K1119009 ) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos dye after transfection and co-localization between the GFP signal and that of the dye was determined as the area of signal overlap. To provide a positive control, the CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). Our negative control construct was the same as our experimental construct, but minus the MLS CDS. ( BBa_K1119008 ).
MLS is submitted in RFC25 standard ( BBa_K1119001 ) to facilitate fusing with other CDS. MLS in RFC10 standard ( BBa_K1119000 ) is submitted as alternative but it cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to limitations in RFC10. Users who obtained the part in RFC10 standard can amplify the part by PCR and fuse it to other domains using overlapping PCR.
To quantify the amount of signal overlapped between the GFP signal and the MitoTracker® dye, we adopted the method described by A.P. French et al. in “Colocalization of fluorescent markers in confocal microscope images of plant cells” (French et al., 2008).
