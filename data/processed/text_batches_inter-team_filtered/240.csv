Ashlee Smith- Project Lead, Supersenior in Chemical Engineering
Completing Honors Thesis in Chemical Engineering
Clay Swackhamer- Project Lead, Senior in Biological Engineering
Completing Honors Thesis in Biological Engineering
Ashlee is a supersenior Chemical Engineer in the Schreyer Honors College and is also completing a minor in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. She has worked in the laboratory of Dr. Howard Salis for two years and started her second project in January 2014. In her first project, she determined the ribosome binding footprint of Escherichia coli ribosomes to help improve Dr. Salis' Ribosome Binding Site Calculator. These results will be published in an upcoming paper. During the school year she works as an exam proctor for the Penn State Chemistry Department and is involved in the Penn State Outing Club. She loves to run, hike, bike, backpack, rock climb, ski, and play any outdoor sport. When she isn't in lab, she is most often found adventuring in the woods around Penn State or at Centre County PAWS animal shelter where she leads volunteer shifts and trains dogs. Her plans after graduation in December 2014 are to pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry. She hopes to move out to California or Colorado and thru-hike the Appalachian Trail after graduation (despite the picture below, she has not yet graduated).
Clay Swackhamer is a senior majoring in Biological Engineering with a bioprocesses option. He is a Schreyer Honors Scholar and is using this codon optimization project as an honors thesis. Clay has been part of the Salis Lab for one year. He serves as a committee chair on Agricultural sciences student council, and is active in tennis club. Clay is minoring in Spanish and will be spending the fall semester taking courses in Alicante, Spain."
Mexico-UNAM-IPN,2008,Team:Mexico-UNAM-IPN#Turing Patterns#Brainstorming_-_-_TEXT.html," we would have made a big step. I want to remark that, in my opinion we should not be attached to the model that is shown in most papers, after all no one knows the mechanism that underlies the formation of “Turing patterns” in organisms.
A short answer to the Problem #1
Luis de Jesus Martinez 28 may 2008 (EDT)
Well, first to say that the literature about Turing patterns explicity specify how they should be generated and emerged (it has been proved with different chemicals); obviously the model is expressed in Partial Differential Equations...  I really think that we do not need a promoter with that behaivor, the model of the autocatalizer-inhibitor is esentially an abstraction, we can go down in it and create a system that behaves like the autocatalizer with more than one promoter; Juan and me are working in it. And about the silver bullet... our teacher Pablo has told us about it (with the help of the physics), the key is to see that we do not necesary need difussible signals, only a device that with some probability could get some stage of equilibrium... I will explain it later. I must go to sleep now.
Federico C 29 may 2008 (EDT)
Surely we can get patterns without intercellular communication...the rounded colonies that grow in petri dishes show a structure (rounded!) and a pattern (dispersed colonies), albeit a simple one.
If you add a devise for differentiation you will be able to differentiate single colonies or parts of one colony but if you want that you might just mix green and red bacterias and you will get the same result.
You could generate complex patterns without cellular communication with an external signal that would trigger a differentiation (such as the Turkey's las year iGEM project) but then you will not be using the putative homogeneous media that Turing patterns require.
You could also obtain patterns by regulating the way and rate by which bacterias divide (which is kind of difficult) or by killing some (easier) but I don't see how that is related with Turing patterns.
Federico C 05 June 2008 (EDT) Last Friday, while talking with Pablo Elias and Luis, Pablo suggested that a devise for cell communication would not be needed for patter generation. The simple competition for resources between two populations would generate interactions that might create patterns.
I support Pablo’s Idea and I think that it’s feasible to implement.  Basically we would need to create a devise that would differentiate bacteria relying on metabolic signals such as the concentration of a"

We took a 1ml sample from the induced culture and measured the OD600nmand then the samples from the cultures were spun down to separate the cells and supernatant. Through running both samples on a western blot we were able to determine whether; the protein was being expressed inside of the cell, and if the protein was being secreted outside of the cell. On the whole cell western blot, we can see that our OsmY-HA is being expressed in the presence of rhamnose (Fig. 1A). On the supernatant western blot, we can see traces of our OsmY-HA outside of the cell which shows that it is being secreted (Fig. 1B).
Figure 2: Western blots showing the whole cell samples of rhamnose induced OsmY-Hfq-HA fusion proteins with Hfq from E. coli (A) and Serratia marcesens (B). Western blot showing supernatant samples of both fusion proteins along with OsmY-HA and empty vector. (C) Western blots showing the supernatant samples of OsmY-HA, OsmY-Hfq E. coli and Osmy-Hfq serratia.
Once we knew our OsmY-HA was working and being secreted out of the cell we then proceeded to the next stage, we had to make sure that our fusion protein which was made up of the OsmY-Ha and Hfq from E. coli was also being secreted to test this we ran an identical experiment with cells expressing our OsmY-Hfq-HA constructs (Fig. 2A). The same had to be performed on the fusion containing the Hfq protein from Serratia marcesens and it can be seen that once again the fusion is being expressed when in the presence of the Rhamnose (Fig. 2B). Once we knew that the cells were being expressed we had to perform a western blot on the supernatant of the cells; this was done on the supernatant of each of the fusion proteins as well as the OsmY-HA and on the empty vector to make sure it’s not interfering with any of the results. From the results (Fig. 2C) we can see that both of the fusions are secreting our protein however the Serratia version seems to be more limited in comparison to the E. coli. We can also see that the OsmY-HA"

Lane 4 is top10 control group, lane 3 is constitutive GvpA and GFP generator, lane 5 is constitutive GvpC and GFP generator. The upper blue and red boxes are in the position about 26KD are GFP protein (25.8KD). The lower red box in the position of about 20KD is GvpC-20 (20KD). Because the MW(molecular weight) of GvpA protein is too small, it’s very difficult to see it on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. But the expression of GFP suggests it may be expressed.
Some papers say that GvpA is difficult to see is that GvpA is too hydrophobic to run out of sample hole. Because the gas vesicle is multimodal protein so it cannot isolate by using SDS-PAGE, too. (Figure28)
Finally, we consider that GVP as exogenous protein may be in escherichia coli form inclusion body so we through the Wilkinson–Harrison solubility model to predict GVP protein solubility and judgment GVP protein formation the possibility of inclusion body.
The revised Wilkinson–Harrison solubility model involves calculating[9]
a canonical variable (CV) or composite parameter for the protein for which
the solubility is being predicted. The canonical variable in the two parameter model is defined as:
where: n 4 number of amino acids in protein
N,G,P,S 4 number of Asn, Gly, Pro, or Ser residues, respectively.
R,K,D,E 4 number of Arg, Lys, Asp, or Glu residues, respectively.
λ1 andλ2 coefficients (15.43 and 29.56, respectively)
The probability of the protein solubility is based on the parameter CV-CV8,
where CV8 is the discriminant equal to 1.71. If CV-CV8 is positive, the
protein is predicted to be insoluble, while if CV-CV8 is negative, the
protein is predicted to be soluble. The probability of solubility or insolubility can be predicted from the following equation:
Probability of solubility or insolubility =
The Calculation results show that the gas vesicle protein is insoluble protein.it may be form the  inclusion body in the escherichia coli expression system.( Table 2)

DTU-Denmark,2010,Team:DTU-Denmark#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html,"As the log was supposed to be updated according to the successes based upon construction of a template plasmids containing the FP's, the reason why this never occured is because it never worked and a huge change in the project occured.
After having performed the same procedures as was mentioned in the previous log entry, the colony PCR results indicated a zero success rate at constructing the FP template plasmids.
The new biobrick approach (Annemi, Patrick, Thomas, Lisa) :
A new biobrick approach was engineered to put our whole system together. We scratched the idea of using red swap to insert our half switches into the chromosome as these were not biobrick friendly..
Instead we came up with the idea of having ""mini-genes"" synthesized and thereafter assembled together in the manner of the biobrick assembly standard. This also means that we can in the end submit all of our pieces as biobricks.
All the mini-genes and corresponding primers have already been ordered and we're still awaiting the arival of the mini-genes.
Dr. Thomas has created a powerpoint presentation illustrating how these mini-genes are to be assembled and how everything will look like in the end.
The powerpoint presentation, called ""Bistable switch design - Biobrick approach"", can be found in the ""Step-wise construction and in-silico model"" folder in dropbox.
As you all should know, the biobrick assembly standard uses 4 restriction sites, 2 in the prefix: EcoRI (E) & XbaI (X) and 2 in the suffix: SpeI (S) & PstI (P).
Whether having to assemble biobricks taken directly from the dna distribution kit or the mini-genes, the concept would be the same and you need to follow the assembly standard.
If you need to refresh your remember about this procedure, have a look at the file ""BioBrick_Assembly_Manual"" which can be found in the ""Research Group"" folder in dropbox.
As we are under quite a bit of pressure to construct our system, the positive side of this approach is that it should be rather easy to assemble everything as long as a lot of thought is put into the digestions and ligations. ;)
In terms of actually activating the system, to start with we won't be using the light-receptor mechanisms, instead we will initially test / activate the system based upon carbohydrate sources, namely rhamnose and arabinose.

Social Media Report
""I hate social media. I have Twitter, just so I can tell people what to buy.”
Louis C. K.
Introduction
As part of our iGEM project we wanted to raise awareness on synthetic biology. As such it seemed beneficial to have a successful social media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation. Opportunities for green marketing: young consumers . Social Media Influencing Green Buying
Our Strategy
The design of our logo consisting of a light font and a picture of a leaf combined with an electrical plug, was determined in the start of April. We sought to make a simple logo that showed the essence of our project, The PowerLeaf, not only in name but in brand as well.
During spring we narrowed down the relevant hashtags of our Twitter and Instagram to #science, #igem, #sdu, #gmo, and #forsksdu. These hashtags were used at relevant occasions and generally helped expanding our reach on social media. A few times we even used a couple of silly hashtags like #adventuretime and #lifechoices when we found it appropriate.
A complete relaunch of our social media platforms was made in the start of April. One of the changes we made was the setup of the Facebook page and Twitter account, that we changed to resemble an enterprise.
Results
Looking at Figure 1 we see the number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year. There is a sharp increase around the start of April, this correlate nicely with the relaunch of our social media. Since we started using the Facebook page on March 1st, we have seen an increase of followers on 44%.
Figure 2 shows the number of unique interactions with our Facebook posts each day. Some posts gained around 200 interactions per day, while the highest amount of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated bacteria from the fingers of the attendants on agar plates. The photo gallery of these plates was widely shared on our Facebook page, and it probably was the reason for the rise in amounts of interactions.
During the summer, we realised that an increasing fraction of our followers on Facebook were non-Danish speakers. Therefore, we set out to analyse the distribution of first languages among our followers seen in Figure 3, which showed that one in three of our followers were not speaking Danish as their first language."

However, we need to once again take into account the bias in the low values of the intensities on the logarithmic scale. We are unable to estimate the parameter for complete darkness. If all the values would be set relative to complete darkness value, the efficiency multiplier would be lower and more accurate.
.: Fluorescence of our light response element at different intensities. During the first four time points the samples were in eight different constant intensities of blue light. After the fourth measurement, the samples were put in identical conditions in complete darkness. The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.
.: Fluorescence of our light response element at different intensities. During the first four time points the samples were in eight different blinking intensities of blue light. The LED lights were blinking from dark to maximum intensity (see legend) with frequency of one cycle per minute. After the fourth measurement, the samples were put in identical conditions in complete darkness. The times indicated are times of the day, not incubation times.
The LED-dark plate was first incubated in the LED rig and after the first four timepoints, the plate was put into complete darkness. In the we see that the fluorescence levels diverge immediately and they are separate already in the second timepoint. Higher intensity levels lead again to lower fluorescence. However, each line also has an increasing trend during the 4 first timepoints which again may be result of bacterial growth. Already in the 5th timepoint the correlation between the intensities and fluorescence has disappeared. This state is comparable to the samples incubated in environmental light . In contrast to dark-LED measurements, the fourfold difference is present only in the 2nd and 4th timepoint. This may be due to fluctuations in temperature between the measurements.
This strengthens our hypothesis of the fluorescence depending on the average intensity.
The fluorescence profiles in the are very similar to that of . Whereas the fluorescence at the low intensity levels seem to remain somewhat unchanged, the high intensity curves have higher fluorescence in 2nd to 4th timepoint compared to the constant light. The separation of different fluorescence levels is not as big as in the steady light. This strengthens our former hypothesis of the fluorescence depending on the average intensity, not the highest or lowest value. The efficiency multiplier seems to be on the same scale as in the dark-LED measurements.

Tianjin,2015,Team:Tianjin#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the core of iGEM- BioBrick and RFC Assembly Method , to build a universal purification tag. This tag includes a linker containing TEV protease site and sJanus, designed by the RFC23 method which is specific for fusion protein. Thus, if other teams want to use this system to express and purify their proteins, they could use the standard assembly to make a fusion protein.
Secondly, we explore for the best detergent, the best concentration of detergent and the best buffer solution. For example, we tried Berol 532 and Triton-114 as the detergent, and used 2%, 5%, 10%, 20% as the gradient of concentration. We also tried PBS, Tris-HCl and many other buffer solutions. Thirdly, we construct many fusion proteins, including three kinds of fluorescent proteins (GFP, BFP and RFP) with four kinds of Janus, which are inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants. We also construct experiments about fusion proteins with cutinases Thc_Cut1, FsC and LC to test if this system could be used on the purification of enzymes. After back-extraction, we run SDS-PAGE and calculate the efficiency.
Then we use these data to run our model . To find the universal experiment conditions, we designed a mighty-possible way to do prediction. The first thing to be made clear is that, it is the presence of difference in protein that will affect the effect of extraction most on the first way and then we have to change our experiment conditions to achieve better results. The second thing to know is that, among all properties of protein, the molecular weight, isoelectric point, hydrophobic property is the most possible impact factors, so we build a universal model to find the feasible extraction conditions, such as what concentration we should choose, or how much volume should we add…by choosing the properties of protein as main variables, and the conditions as dependent variables, using the best condition we got from our experiment and model and the protein’s properties as interpolation point to do interpolation, through this way we can gain the formula suits all proteins as long as we know their properties.
The results of our experiment could be found in results of Protein Extraction Kit..

Our results also allowed us to conclude that at temperatures close to 4°C and 37°C growth is limited, as there was little to no change in area. Below (images 1 and 2) are time-lapses of the dishes used to grow the dikaryion monokaryon strain at 24°C, 30°C, and 37°C over the course of 9 days. This information was important as it also informed our mission architecture. Temperatures on Mars can fluctuate greatly, with a common average being -55°C. Because of the low temperatures on Mars and the slower growth rate of mycelium at low temperatures we realized we needed to configure a heating system into the design of the habitat during the growth period.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," The phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) then store 5 to 30% of their dry weight as phosphorus. The exact composition of PAOs is unknown, but likely includes Acinetobacter, Rhodocyclus and various coccus-shaped bacteria. [15]
Our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli system provides another option for biological phosphorus removal in tertiary treatment. Our system would be designed in a way for easy removal of the E. coli from the wastewater in order to harvest the phosphorus for future work. Also, due to the ease of engineering E. coli, in the future, we can add to our system in order to handle several other aspects often involved in tertiary treatment, such as nitrogen removal, chlorine removal, [16] and antibiotic and pharmaceutical removal [17].
Home Bioreactors
In a bioreactor, bacteria can remove nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen [18]. A home bioreactor can use our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli to remove phosphorus from a house’s wastewater before it reaches the treatment plant. In the future, a system for nitrogen removal can also be designed and incorporated into the home bioreactor.
Floating Phosphorus Collector Unit
Dundee 2013 developed a prototype of an electronic environmental sensor to collect and relay real-time data from water reservoirs. We see this design as another platform to apply our modified E. coli in an on-site location. The Dundee design is already modulated with sensors for light, dissolved oxygen, temperature and humidity, and pH. Adding to this design, we could create a compartment housing the bioreactor with modified E. coli for uptaking phosphorus at the contaminated source of water.

Advisors
Henning Jacobsen
Henning started his PhD on virology in November 2016. He was an iGEM-Teamleader in Hamburg in 2015 and now acts as advisor for the following teams. He is basicly our bad guy, constantly telling everyone that he or she is too lazy and that we need more money. If Henning attends the seminar to “make a serious announcement” he is feared more than Prof. Snape.  Besides the fact that he is at least right about the last fact, he further developed the concept of our lab and is a driving force behind new non-scientific collaborations. He already did a great job advising the last team in 2016 (Finding Chlamydory) and agreed on serving another year as advisor for our team. Thank you for your support!
Daniel Wedemeyer
Daniel was one of the team leader of last year’s team and offered his support as advisor of our team. After receiving his O.W.L grades leading iGEM Team Hamburg 2016, Daniel is Prefect, uhm, advisor for this year’s team. With Hamburg 2016 he was on hunt for Chlamydories, a completely different kind of creatures they were only able to catch with their magic detection bacteria. As advisor, he introduced us to BioBrick design, Defence against the Dark arts, HTML and the wiki, sponsor acquisition, and is always happy to share his experience in Niffler taming. Thank you for your advice!
Former Members
Katharina Hoffmann
She helped us a great deal at the beginning of our project but sadly couldn’t stay since she moved for a semester abroad to South Korea. Thank you for being part of our team!
Dorian Orlikowski
He helped us with sponsoring and later in the lab too, but went on to see the world too. Thanks for your help!
Caroline Oertzen
She was involved in the sponsoring but had to put her regular studies first. Thanks for being with us!

The team discussed about the work on zeocin,pA-f1-Zec biobrick, which will indeed be an improvement of BBa_J176124 because:
i) it gives most of the functionality of BBa_J176124 but is compatible with standard assembly
ii) it allows people to simply insert a PROMOTER-ORF fragment upstream of a pA to give an expression cassette for the ORF of interest, and a ZEC to select stable transfectants.
9th August
Project description is up on Wiki!
Darren gave us a visit at the lab to check if everything is O.K. with our work and enthusiasm. The requested batch of biobricks arrived as glycerol stocks.
The team discussed about Kickstarter crowdfunding and planned to launch the Memory Lane/Map thing WITHOUT getting people to pay. We will get people to upload their best memories in different forms and potentially do some beautiful art with it like the Memory Palace FYi suggested.
12th August
We had a strategy chat at the lab with Darren.
FYi drawn the wiki background for the diary section. She also made the illustrations for the T-shirts. The team also debated on the wiki design and a consensus was reached regarding the site map, default banner, logo.
In 'Memory Lane', we are going to ask people to 'leave one strong memory' on one page whether in text or pictures. These will be done anonymously but they will leave their emails with us so they will be notified when the 'compilation' is up.
The website came to life today!

Alex and Oran came up with the idea of a Creative writing competition.
FYi, Robin, Alex and Stjohn and Oran focused on wiki building for the weeks to come while the rest of the team worked in the Bacterial Labs.

Valencia_UPV,2014,Team:Valencia UPV#Modeling#fba_-_-_TEXT.html," metabolic network model that   currently better approximates the metabolism model of N. benthamiana. In Sexy Plant we have added in silico the reactions from the network of pheromone production.  As optimality criterion  we sought to maximize the pheromone flux produced by the plant.
Pheromone pathway location
Figure 2.  Palmitic acid is a common fatty acid in plants and animals. This metabolite is the precursor of our   pheromone.
Palmitic acid (16:0) is the most common fatty acid (saturated) found in animals, plants and microorganisms.
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc) catalyzes the carboxilation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. The last one substrate triggers the biosynthesis of Palmitic acid and produce the Hexadecanoic acid_acc.
As precursor of our pathway, our  efforts were aimed at the optimization of palmitic acid. In the AraGEM model, this is denoted as Hexadecanoic acid_acc (16:0) and is located in the cytosol (see Figure 2). To model the pathway, we combined the new reaction   EXZ11 with one influx V1 and two effluxes V2, V3 (see Figure 1).   The efflux V3 was incorporated as an exchange reaction, in order to generate a branch in the original pathway of 16:0   metabolism.  As our metabolic pathway is linear, starting from 16:0, this new added branch represents the whole synthetic pathway of our pheromone.
Defining scenarios
AraGEM is  capable of representing both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic cell types [1].  In order to reproduce the classical physiological scenarios of plant cell metabolism, we explored two photosynthetic scenarios: i)   Photosynthesis and ii) Photorespiration.  The difference comes from the carboxylation reaction of rubisco.   This enzyme, in the presence of oxygen, reduces the energy efficiency of photosynthetic output   by 25% in C3 plants.
Figure 3.  The action of the rubisco enzyme  defines two scenarios in plant metabolism: photosynthesis, and   photorespiration.  During photosynthesis, the carboxylation-oxygenation ratio is +1:0 and there is no oxygenation of ribulose 1.5-bisP.  Moreover, the presence of oxygen and rubisco also catalyzes an oxygen reaction, photosynthesis   efficiency"

Materials and Methods
We used the plate reader protocol provided by iGEM and used the Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader for all our measurements.
Calibration Protocol
OD600 Reference Point
100 µL LUDOX provided in the InterLab Measurement Kit was transferred to a Greiner Bio-One 96-well plate in wells A1, B1, C1 and D1. 100 µL demineralized H2O was added into wells A2, B2, C2 and D2. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm of the eight samples and the data was imported into the provided Excel sheet in the OD600 reference point tab.
FITC Fluorescence Standard Curve
The FITC stock tube provided in the InterLab Measurement Kit was spun down to make sure that the pellet was in the bottom of the tube. 1 mL of PBS was added in the tube to make a 2x FITC stock solution (500 µM). The solution was incubated at 42℃ for 4 hours. The stock was then further diluted to 1x FITC solution (250 µM). 200 µl of 1x FITC stock solution was added to A1, B1, C1 and D1. 100 µl PBS was added to wells A2-12, B2-12, C2-C12 and D2-12. 100 µL from A1 was transferred to A2. The new dilution was mixed by pipetting and 100 µL was transferred to A3. This process was repeated until A11 was reached and 100 µL of the final 200 µL in well A11 was discarded. The same process was repeated for rows B, C and D.  All of the samples were measured in the 96-well plate and the excitation filter was set to 395 nm and the emission filter to 509 nm. The data were imported into the provided Excel sheet FITC standard curve tab.

Building Blocks: A revolution
The Johns Hopkins team presents the work of a Build-a-Genome course that fabricates synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 and provides students tools to meld seamless arrays of DNA into redesigned synthetic chromosomes. Our team is part of a larger effort to develop new technologies and standards for synthetic genomic construction allowing for the production of longer more complicated DNA sequences without certain constraints of current Biobrick standards. By using overlap assembly PCR, followed by Uracil Specific Excision Reaction (USER), and finally, multiple rounds of homologous recombination we create pieces of chromosomes and finally full chromosomes, efficiently and cheaply. We will present improved methodology for building block synthesis, the software created to aid in our synthesis, and applications of the yeast genome redesign, focusing on the implications the Build-a-Genome course has on future genomic technologies that rely on and teach students.

It is also unclear as to why the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 with E0840 in the correct orientation did not fluoresce (as it was also an exact match for the target sequence), although more repetitions of the experiments would be required to ascertain the efficiency of the different constructs, as the results here could be an anomaly (there was not enough time to perform these experiments here). Of the two pCpxR_pSB1A3 constructs, the TR235 pCpxR_pSB1A3 was an exact match for the target, while the MG1655 pCpxR_pSB1A3 had one mismatch within the promoter region, although not in the CpxR consensus binding sequence. Note: as the MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 construct was shown to be an exact match for the target sequence, the mutation in MG1655 pCpxR_pSB1A3 must have occured after the construction of MG1655 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3.
Two fully functioning BioBricks can therefore be submitted; the TR235 pCpxR_pSB1A3 construct ( BBa_K13500 ), and the TR235 pCpxR_E0840_pSB1A3 construct ( BBa_K135001 ).

I am a Plant Cell Biology Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Calgary. I completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Alberta and spent a few years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University. My main research focus is on the study of subcellular dynamics, however, this past year my research group initiated a project on the identification of plant genes that are important in the reclamation of tailings ponds. As an iGEM rookie myself, it’s exciting to see a group of students with diverse backgrounds come together and use their individual expertise to approach an important environmental problem.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2016,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,". coli, we reviewed Bacillus subtilis 168 strain for experimenting in the laboratory as well as B. subtilis HU58 strain for the actual use of product. B. subtilis HU58 is already acknowledged as a strain, widely common in the human intestine, and has all the probiotic cell properties. In addition, it has a vast advantage over E. coli, as it forms spores, which can be dried down and placed in the pill.
Due to the fact, that we would like to use B. subtilis spores, we thought that it might be a good idea to induce their growth before they get into the intestine. This way our bacteria would start working immediately after getting into the intestine. Prebiotics, which would be used to initiate spore growth, in theory would be packed inside of the capsule and surrounded by B. subtilis spores. The idea is a double capsule – one inside another. Before taking the capsule of probiotics, it would be necessary to squeeze it. After that, inner capsule breaks apart and interaction between prebiotics and probiotics induce the growth of the bacteria.
The probiotic delivery method is also one of the things, that needs to be taken into the account. In collaboration with Oxford iGEM 2016 team, we conducted a survey (see the results of the survey on our human practices page ) about how people see probiotics and what kind of drug delivery they would like to use. The survey showed that people prefer taking pharmaceutical products over food based products.

USTC,2016,Team:USTC#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," green florescence will disappear[2]. However, existing variants of GFP often misfold when expressed as fusions with other proteins, so we decide to use a robustly folded version of GFP, “superfolder” GFP, which can fold well even when fused to poorly folded polypeptides[6].
We use the plasmid designed by group iGEM07_Cambridge (2008) which containing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) and split it into two parts, sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. In this circuit, sfGFP11 is linked to PrD (prion-determining region). Prion aggregates at a certain temperature range which is around 37℃~42℃[7] and protein denaturant Guanidine Hydrochloride (GdnHCL) can eliminate the aggregation[8]. So it’s easy to imagine that green fluorescence is invisible when heat shock is added because of prion assembling, and visible when Guanidine Hydrochloride is added.
Thus, this circuit can be used as a biological temperature control kill switch and a biological temperature indicator (BTI). We also hope this circuit can be used in scientific research. If a certain protein A can be split into two fragments A1 and A2, which can spontaneously bind to each other and perform function, then we can use this circuit to control the function of this protein in the protein level. It may be a useful tool in protein engineering.
What is GFP & How to make use of it
I wonder the one who is looking at this website must know about the green fluorescent protein (GFP), anyway, I will make a brief introduction.
GFP is a protein composed of 238 amino acid residues (26.9 kDa) which exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue to ultraviolet range. The kind of GFP scientists usually use traditionally refers to the protein first isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. In cell and molecular biology, the GFP gene is frequently used as a reporter of expression (so it is in our project!). Scientists Roger Y. Tsien, Osamu Shimomura, and Martin Chalfie were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein[9].
Normal application of GFP is introducing the GFP gene to animals or other species and then measuring its expression in a given organism, in selected organs, or in cells of interest. Based on that, here we create a novel usage of GFP, splitting and reassembling.

Conclusion
We proved that our designed fusion protein could direct DNA integration to a specific sequence by the use of a sgRNA. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that this novel protein can be used to perform targeted next generation sequencing. We were able to identify 89 sequencing events that align to our target DNA (EPO linear plasmid DNA). We were even able to identify the exact position of adapter integration by our fusion protein based on one single DNA read out of over 200 000 reads (including reads from the internal control). This demonstrates that targeted sequencing with library preparation by our fusion protein significantly simplifies data analysis and could be used to detect gene doping DNA.

OUTPUT
To sense intracellular ROS content and express its changes quickly and                     intuitively, we constructed roGFP2-orp1 fusion protein and optimized it.
Increase the sensitivity of roGFP2 to hydrogen                     peroxide
Overview
We made codon optimization of roGFP2 gene sequences and constructed RoGFP2-Orp1 fusion protein                         to make roGFP2 more sensitive to the REDOX state of cells.
Specific methods:
First, we obtained the gene sequence of roGFP2 from the part:BBa_K2296006: Constitutive                         Promoter-RBS-roGFP2-Orp1 C82S and codon optimized it for our chassis organisms---yeast, in                         anticipation of better expression in yeast.
Second, we synthesized the codon-optimized roGFP2+linker sequence, obtained the sequence                         of Orp1 from the yeast genome and ligated them by OE-PCR. This enhances the specificity of                         roGFP2 for recognizing hydrogen peroxide and increases its sensitivity to H2O2.                         After that, we completed the 82nd cysteine point mutation (C82S), which made our signal output                         more responsive.

Overview:
After optimizing the most important detector component roGFP2-orp1, we need to construct it                         into yeasts modified in regulator and feedback part. In order to make roGFP2-orp1 in a suitable                         redox state, we"

This account recorded our progress and interesting comments about synthetic biology. The articles were written by our team members and were published regularly. The number of Subscribers are increasing as we speak.
HUST_Cheering
On July 7th, members of team ShanghaitechChina_B attended HUST-CHEERING seminar hosted by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. After several days of heavy rains, the city suffered serious water-logging. Power supply was damaged in HUST. Organizers and participants had to move from the hall to the teaching building to continue our seminar. The classrooms were not spacious but were big enough for passionate IGEMers.
Because ShanghaitechChina_B is a newly founded team, we gave a presentation about our project and received many pieces of valuable advice. Experienced IGEMers also gave their encouragement to our team. Our team gained a more comprehensive understanding of IGEM competition through this event and became much more interested in synthetic biology. It was quite an experience to establish friendships with other IGEM teams.
iDPI
Owing to one of the purposes of IGEM that is to improve public awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology, as the first team founded in ShanghaiTech IGEM, we decided to establish an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI). This year, the IDPI invited students and teachers from Shanghai Concordia International High School and held an IGEM Open-Lab Day on Sep 3rd, 2016. Along with another IGEM team at Shanghaitech, we warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Concordia. Their delegation included two major science teachers and eight students from different grades. We delivered two introduction speeches about and synthetic biology and the IGEM on behalf of two ShanghaiTech IGEM teams respectively. One was done by Haolong Zhu, a member of ShanghaitechChina Team, another was by Shenjian Ai, one of our team member. We introduced our IGEM project Gutrio to these curious visitors. To explain the design of our project, we made analogy of engineered bacteria to trained agents who carried secret weapons to terminate their targets. Thus, we described our potentially complicated experimental system in an understandable manner - an amazing adventure. Those high school students were all cheered up: “It was really cool!”. Our provocative speeches did stimulate their interests to synthetic biology.
After that, we held an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of the"

Bacterial Communication
Bacteria are no longer thought to exist as individual single celled organisms; in fact, they can co-ordinate and communicate in a multicellular fashion when it is advantageous for them to do so. The majority of microbes are found thriving in complex polymicrobial biofilm communities. In the natural environment bacteria predominantly live adhered to a surface as part of a biofilm. A biofilm is a multicellular community of cells encased in a self-produced extracellular matrix. Life in a biofilm offers advantages to the population, including supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stress.
Bacteria have evolved elaborate means to communicate with each other, both within and between species, by releasing a wide range of diffusible signalling compounds into their external environment. Once outside the bacterial cell, these molecules freely diffuse within the milieu where they can be perceived by other microorganisms. Bacteria can utilize such systems to monitor their population density (the process of quorum sensing) and/or their confinement in particular environmental niches, and to coordinate specific population-wide alterations in gene expression and bacterial behaviour. Cell–cell signalling allows a colony or group of organisms to behave in a coordinated fashion to regulate processes contributing to virulence, antibiotic production,"

Transformed cells from before did not work, performed transformations again.
6.19.15
Goal: Move fluorescent proteins from MACH competent cells to TOP10 competent cells. There were some problems with the overnight cultures and plates, which we have to correct.
Retransform the plasmids into new plates
Add IPTG to new cultures to induce gene expression
Restart cultures from yesterday in new media (did not add IPTG) & started cultures from transformation (added IPTG)
Measure growth of TOP10 cells relative to growth of MACH cells (using OD measurements). The following is the OD in Top10 cells
mRFP: 0.102, OFP: 0.056, YGP: 0.053, GFP: 0.054, BFP: 0.213
Week 5
6.22.15
Goal: Test the effect of IPTG on the growth of the culture.
Used UV light to check relative expression levels of each fluorescent protein and marked colonies
Took colonies from plates and put in 5 mL LB, adding 5 μL LPTG and 5uL chloramphenicol
IPTG cultures that were started from the transformation on Friday did not grow, were not expressing the protein, and were all the same color.
The cultures started from culture grew fairly well. Will compare them tomorrow with the other two cultures (from culture, from transformation compared to from plate).
Weak expression of IPTG culture was most likely due to starting it from a transformation rather than a colony. These cultures were thrown out.
6.23.15
Goal: To extract the proteins from our new cultures that were grown with IPTG.
Followed standard protein extraction protocol.
6.24.15
Goal: To quantify an array of fluorescent proteins produced in Top 10 E. coli cells and subsequently characterize their relative fluorescence in order to connect the amount of protein to fluorescence.
Normal his tagged soluble protein extraction on 50uL of Ni-NTA bead solution for mRFP, OFP, YFP, eGFP, and BFP
3 rounds of elution in 50 uL of EDTA buffer for each protein
Bio-rad Protein Assay microassay protocol using BSA standards of 3, 9, 15, and 20 ug/mL
Fluorescence measurements taken on TECAN Safire2 with 100uL of culture and 100uL of extracted protein for each culture transformed to express fluorescent proteins

Calgary,2012,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Hydrocarbon_-_-_TEXT.html," the NotI site was successfully removed. These results were good, as the plasmid ran at 2000 base pairs and the insert at just under 1000 base pairs in the mutagenized CarAd whereas the non-mutagenized CarAd had its insert cut into 2 bands. This will be sent for sequencing next week to confirm the mutation. Unfortunately the sequencing results came back negative for the Ant operon meaning we will need to restart genomic PCR on it next week. Multiple transformations and confirmation PCRs were run on AmdA this week, however none displayed a band size of 1700-1800 base pairs as expected. We have continued to try different digested plasmids as other team members also had difficulties this week with ligation into PSB1C3, possibly indicating a problem with our antarctic phosphatase stock.
The other news from this week was the final results from our carbazole degradation experiment attempting to demonstrate LD2's ability to degrade carbazole and hopefully other nitrogen containing compounds. Unfortunately, these results were very difficult to make sense of as the LD2 that were cultured with carbazole grew, but did not show elevated ammonia levels which would be indicative of carbazole degradation. One of our controls was LD2 cultured with ammonium chloride to test whether LD2 was capable of using ammonia as a nitrogen source. This would pose a problem for us as we were planning to use an increase in ammonia levels as a proxy for carbazole degradation rather than measuring carbazole degradation directly using GC-MS. However, the LD2 showed significantly less ammonia after 44 hours when compared to 26 hours indicating that it may be degraded, either by the LD2 or by an unaccounted for abiotic process. This has lead us to decide to use GC-MS and directly measure carbazole levels in our sample the next time we do this experiment.
Decarboxylation
This week, the attempted PstI mutagenesis of CAR was run on a gel. Unfortunately, amplification was unsuccessful, but we had an idea for why this might have occurred. It was discovered that our plasmid of 9kb would need a 7.5 minute extention time, rather than the 1 minute extention time that we had originally programmed into the thermocycler. The mutagenesis experiment was repeated, this time with a 7.5 minute extention time. When these results were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, we had bands appearing to indicate success with the 50ng samples of CAR that we had run, as shown below.

Uptake and Biosynthesis of iso-CmTP and iso-GTP
Short Summary
A crucial aspect in the development of semisynthetic organisms is the supply with unnatural nucleoside triphosphates Two main strategies exist to provide Escherichia coli with unnatural nucleoside triphosphates. The first strategy is based on the uptake of nucleoside triphosphates from the media, which requires the expression of a heterologous transporter, facilitating the uptake across the inner membrane. The second strategy is based on the in vivo biosynthesis of the desired nucleoside triphosphates, which can be achieved by integration of heterologous or synthetic pathways. For our project, we pursuit both paths, analyzing uptake of unnatural nucleoside triphosphates by different variants of a nucleotide transporter and investigating the biosynthesis of isoguanosine using a pathway from the plant Croton tiglium.
Strategies to Supply the Cell with iso-CmTP and iso-GTP

Project Overview
We are trying to construct a novel E.coli that has fruity flavor like Japanese rice wine (Japanese sake). In order to accomplish the purpose, yeast genes related with production of the Japanese sake fragrance were introduced into E. coli cells. We also tried to develop a way to eliminate bad smells of E. coli in parallel. Although we previously won a gold prize by the development of a novel pen (E. coli Pen) in 2010, its bad smells were weak points and must be improved. We will overcome this problem through the progress of our new project in 2013. So far, “smell” is not a popular keyword and not a major field in iGEM. However, we believe that our project will provide a new point of view to iGEM friends.

We constructed ATF2 generator. (BBa_K1049002) Our team KIT-Kyoto 2013 constructed this part for the purpose of measurement. T7 promoter is an IPTG-inducible promoter. We added 20µL IPTG (100mM) to our genetically modified E.coli after cultivation at 28 and 37 ˚C. 2 hours after, we extracted soluble proteins from it by FastBreak™ Cell Lysis Reagent and did SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

METU-Ankara,2011,Team:METU-Ankara#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"-categorize the “WORKS” comment into 1) “Quantitative”      for parts which are characterized with experiments and 2) “Qualitative”      for parts which are not characterized will be an appropriate measure      for standardization of Biobrick database.
In order to overcome these problems we suggest enforcing the working     conditions title for the registry entrance, in order to collect quantitative     experimental details on submitted parts, which might slow down the registration     process but will definitely increase the quality of the database.
61% of participants agree that POPS (Polymerase Per      Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks with a promoter,      where appropriate. - 57% of participants have been agree that RIPS      (Ribosome per Second) should be assigned to every part or biobricks      with a RBS brick.
Though most participants agree the need for POPS and RBS information     , they are concerned about the workload it would bring to individual     labs.
“To do this, the Registry need to define a reliable and easy method     of determining the PoPS for teams to use. However, I would say that     there are better systems for quantifying promoter output than PoPS,     and they should be used instead, if possible”.
67% of participants have thought that entering POPS      information should not be mandatory while submitting new parts.      Similarly, 65% of participants disagree that entering RIBS information      should be mandatory while submitting new parts
Even though the researchers feeling the need for this information     they are shying away from requesting it as a mandatory title for parts     registry as it would be difficult for underfunded and inexperienced     groups to perform these measurements.
We strongly suggest starting a forum on how to quantify the performance     of promoters and genes to bring an easy to measure standard for the     efficiency of the parts. Additionally iGEM should the responsibility     and provide the measurements for the each promoter and gene included     in the distributions. The second choice would be even better in terms     of standardization as all the measurement will be performed by one center     under similar conditions and with experienced researchers, which will     allow user to compare and contrast the efficiencies of the parts more     accurately.
82% of participants have thought that information on      working conditions of the parts should be mandatory while submitting      new parts. Most find submiting the detailed experimental      information and working conditions is crucial and even easier than      submitting measurements of POPS or RBS.

The aim of our project was to make it possible to combine the advantages of the nonribosomal peptide synthesis with the ribosomal pathway,  i.e. the enormous repertoire of amino acids combined with the ability of the ribosome to synthesize huge proteins.
Introduction
The ribosome is the primary site of protein synthesis in a cell with its advantages being the high reliability of protein synthesis combined  with the possibility of assembling huge proteins from amino acids using mRNA as blueprint. As an adaptor that guides the correct incorporation  of amino acids as specified in the mRNA template ribosomes use aminoacyl-tRNAs. These are generated by activation of the needed amino acid using ATP.  The created adenylate intermediate is then transferred to the 3’ terminus of the corresponding tRNA. This loading reaction of tRNA is catalysed by an  enzyme family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (Rodnina, 2013). These form multi-synthetase complexes (MSCs) in eukaryotes and archaea that  contain not only the aaRSs themselves but also accessory protein factors for the local scaffolding of tRNAs to the aaRS (Quevillon et al., 1997).  One of these accessory proteins, Arc1p (Figure 2), has been shown to improve the functionality of the MSC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by facilitating  tRNA binding (Simos et al., 1998).
By contrast to the ribosome, the nonribosomal peptide synthesis occuring in the secondary metabolism of many microbes on the other hand uses modular  multi enzyme complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Due to the fusion of different domains nature build highly developed catalysts  for the production of a huge amount of biologically active compounds in evolutionary time (Strieker et al., 2010). The reactions that these modules catalyse  can be compared to equivalent steps in the ribosomal pathway. Especially interesting in this context is the first step catalysed by an adenylation (A) domain  which is the activation of the"

This time, we invited Ph.D. Haoqian Zhang, who is once an iGEMer and now the chief technology officer of a syn-bio company Bluepha, to give a speech on SELF Conference. Aiming at promoting synthetic biology, the speech talked about its principle, significance and various applications. In this conference which more than two hundred people attended, our UCAS iGEM team members offered volunteer services and have a really good time!
Overview
Aiming at designing an effective, convenient and cheap device to detect ammonia for fish farmers, we believe that our device has the potential to be applied in the real ponds and reach commercial success. The following is a summary of our work on entrepreneurship, including the discussion on product application, market analysis and financial summary.
Product Application
Since a patent is needed if we want to apply our device on real ponds, we went to the department of transformation of scientific and technological achievements in Institute of Biophysics, and asked for advice. During the communication with the staff there, we learned about the process of applying a patent and noted significant issues. At present, we are planning to apply a patent for our designs after the project is finished.
Market Analysis Summary
In China, freshwater aquaculture is the most important production method in the fishery industries. Among all aquaculture modes, ponds account for over 75% of the product. Nevertheless, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring and water purification systems, causing pollution and fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production.
We compared our designs with other methods on the market which are widely used currently, and find our designs having the obvious advantages such as cheaper, cleaner and more convenient.

Toulouse-INSA-UPS,2018,Team:Toulouse-INSA-UPS#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," composed of teenagers from 11 to 19 years old, and their teachers. The aim of this intervention was to share our experiences, open their minds about the wide possibilities biology studies can offer, and the importance of multidisciplinary studies.
Meeting in a high school biology class
We met the biology high school class of Mr David Faure. We presented ourselves and our different study backgrounds in order to inform them about the possibilities offered to them after high school in university. Then, we presented the iGEM competition and our Cerberus project, we also discussed why we chose to participate in this adventure. By speaking about the multidisciplinarity of the iGEM competition, we also alerted them to the importance of human practices and the fact that we can not create science without including human practices-oriented aspects.
Presentation
Figure 1: Presentation at the International High School
We presented our Cerberus project in front of 230 high school students from 9 to 19 years old and their professors. First we presented the iGEM competition, secondly the reasons why we had chosen to develop Cerberus and its potential. Thirdly, we explained our labwork and we showed them our funny results, they really liked pink cellulose and paramagnetic fabrics. Finally, we developed our human practice approach, and we explained how the society perception improved our Cerberus project in order to be more acceptable.
Journal?
Some students were very interested, and they would like to write an article for their high school journal. After the iGEM competition, we will work with them to write this article and speak about our giant jamboree results which we hope will be wonderful.
Additional reflection
It was a rewarding intervention, sharing our experience as scientists to maybe create new callings. All three of us who participated at this intervention were women, and to quote Mr David Faure: “You have been a great example of women in sciences, the impact and importance of multidisciplinary skills and the quality of our studies in university.”

Zoë endorsed our approach for biosafety and gave us some nice tips on how to improve this and how to approach expert interview and integrate these into the design of the project.

Dr. Zoë Robaey is our contact point within the Rathenau Institute. Although she switched jobs soon after we met her, she remained willing to advise us on ethics-related questions about our project and about the iGEM Jamboree. She endorsed our plans for biosafety: an infographic and interviews. She advised us to define the target of our application more precisely. Another point she mentioned was 'connect the disconnect': find the bottleneck in the whole diagnosis process and try to connect it using our project. She also advised us on preventing the feeling of being overwhelmed by the competition: reconsider your approach after every new bit of information. Moreover, to use the expert's point of view to get more specific info on the topic, and to set goals prior to interviewing. Finally, try to show it in a storyline. As a result of this interview our approach to interviewing experts greatly improved.
June 8
Implementation
Following the interview with dr. Robaey, we made a storyline about our project.
Moreover, we elaborated greatly on our biosafety and ethics . To make our biosafety page, we got into contact with several experts in the field of biosafety, ethics, and risks. For example prof. dr. Marcel Verweij, head of the department of philosophy of the Wageningen University & Research, an expert in bioethics.
Are the alternative applications for Mantis more relevant?
Instead of individual diagnostics in humans, we might be able to apply our diagnostic device on the detection of viral diseases in mosquitoes. Vector control plays an important role in the containment and eradication of infectious diseases. Is there a need for a new diagnostic device in this field? Is this a better application than screening disease in humans, since for most diseases no treatment is available?

Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in [5] ). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested in vivo. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well [6] and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters [7] and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements [8] , but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength [9] , [10] .
In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several ""domains"". The core promoter is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in [11] ). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as ""enhancers"" and ""silencers"". A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity [5] .

We have developed a standard method (termed ""Random Assembly PCR / RA-PCR"") for the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR [12] to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites"

Protein Cages
Higher order self assembling protein assemblies are a commonplace in nature, one common example being ferritin, which carries iron in many single-celled organisms. Due to their encapsulating function and box-like structure, such assemblies are often called protein “cages.” Inspired by these natural sources, much research has been done into creating synthetic cages with new properties such as stability, size, and subunit types. Furthermore, in many cases applications of cages have been suggested, but many have not been tested experimentally.
One such application is targeted drug delivery. By specifying the region to which drugs should be delivered, effect can be limited to the areas desired and avoid damaging or affecting other parts of the body. Moreover it ensures the drugs actually affect their desired targets with ideally high efficiency. Since these drugs would likely be inserted into the bloodstream, a function directly connected to that method would be a first step into drug delivery.
Thrombosis, when a clot forms inside the blood stream, is associated with widespread diseases including stroke and many heart conditions. Anticoagulants prevent clot formation by interfering with clotting factors and allow a smoother blood flow, restoring normal circulation. However these drugs can have side effects, a main one being problems stopping bleeding from wounds. By localizing and minimizing the amount of drug used, issues such as these would become less serious. A protein cage containing an anticoagulant is well-suited to this. To specify the clot as a target, an associated enzyme or byproduct of clotting could be used. Thrombin is one such enzyme, promoting clotting in most cases. It does, however, cleave a certain amino acid sequence. This sequence, if properly inserted into a protein cage containing the anticoagulant, would result in disassembly of the cage, release of the drug molecule to the targeted area,and destruction of the clot.
The goal of our project is to modify a protein cage that can be disassembled using a thrombin protease and to use this protein cage to deliver a drug molecule. We are using two previously created synthetic cages, one composed of 12 subunits forming a tetrahedron cage while the other composed of  24 subunits forming an octahedron cage. For each of these protein cages, we have designed mutants with inserted thrombin cleavage sites and hope"

Conclusions
The goal of this module was to transport proteins into vesicles. One of the things we have shown through Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS) experiments is that hypervesiculation occurs in E.coli BW25113 of the Keio strain with a TolA deletion. Produced vesicles have a size of around 18 d.nm. Additionally, by measuring fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm and periplasm, we have demonstrated that GFP with the TorA tag is transported to the periplasm. To determine if GFP was transported into vesicles, we combined the two plasmids and measured the intensity of GFP in vesicles. Modeling determined that after 25 minutes post induction the concentration of GFP in the vesicles did not increase anymore and reached its maximum. On top of this, it we had shown that the amount of vesicles produced was higher after 20 hours. Combining this, the vesicles we harvested after 20 hours post induction. The same purification method as in the DLS experiments was used, after which fluorescence was measured in the plate reader. With these results, we can conclude that the fusion of TorA and GFP is transported into the periplasm.

UNITN-Trento,2015,Team:UNITN-Trento#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," realization of new houses, promoting the industrial potential. It may not look like it, but rebuild a house in many cases is cheaper than just keeping an old one for many years.
From our analysis we saw that the domestic energy consumption comes primarily from heating and cooling systems. In an ideal world we should reach a situation where the heating and cooling energy should decrease and gets close to zero. Do you think it is possible?
This is totally impossible! We must overturn the way we think, especially here in Italy. The only almost zero-energy houses that I can think of are the ones from the ancient Roman Empire.
What can be done to upgrade a house from an energy point of view?
You should definitely think about the construction of the house, especially the coating, taking into consideration walls, roof and windows. Citizens should be educated better on the subject. Another idea could be taxing luxury goods (i.e. cars, gasoline). People are often left unprotected, without any kind of help from the government. What anyone of us can do so far is follow some basic tips to save energy and money (i.e. turn off the TV when you are not home, etc.)
Can a solar panel truly reduce prices?
Absolutely not, this sector is heavily penalized.The photovoltaic has very low yields, requires high maintenance and the electrical system has to be extremely efficient. The efficiency of the produced current is very low, at about 5-6%. The energy cost is insane and the problem of disposing the panel when they are exhausted is remarkable.
Leaving out technical difficulties, which hostility can you see about placing on market our project?
You need to impress and amaze people when looking at you product. Esthetic and design play a fundamental role: people want to see the beauty in everything. It has to be clear and easy to understand. How could you like something if you don’t know what it does? Last but not least is has to be sustainable, economically and ethically.

During the lecure, we tried to show that scientists hire the cutting-edge technology to explore the complex metabolic process of organisms and creat new applications for practical use such as Genetically Modified Organisms and treatment for diseases at the same time.
The lecture also included brief introductions of our project this year. The leader shared with them information about the spliting of GFP protein and the aggregation of prions. In addition, he talked about the iGEM competition and our trial and errors and of course achievements in our experiments and researches. In this way we hope to evoke their passion to biological science, passing on knowledge and enthusiasm to them, which might encourage them to work hard and try to make innonations in this field in the future.
It seemed that they were very interested in our project and synthetic biology. Some of them asked questions about our project about the details and others communicated a lot with our team members after the lecture. We were glad to share our ideas and experiences with them. We wish they could improve their knowledge and ability during their courses and maybe next year, they will take part in the iGEM competition for themselves.
Let's get it all done!"

    Lactic acid bacteria are the most promising microorganisms to act as live vaccines as well as microbial cell factory which can produce various chemicals. During fermentation processing, they suffer from various stress conditions, especially acid and cold stress. Therefore, we aim to develop an ideal food-safe grade microorganism with enhanced acid and cold tolerance.
    Genome mutagenesis combined with high-throughput technologies was performed on Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 to screen acid tolerance strain. Next, comparative transcriptomics analysis was performed on mutant and parent strain to investigate the response mechanisms of microbial cells during acid stress. Based on the proposed acid tolerance mechanisms, one new anti-acid component—msmK was discovered. Also, an anti-cold gene cspD2 was selected. The constructed recombinant strain Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ 8149-msmK-cspD2 shows a significant survival advantage compared with Lactococcus lactis NZ3900/pNZ 8149, which means our product exhibited enhanced acid and cold tolerance.
    This study provides valuable insight into the development of robust industrial strains.

Achievement
Team
2017 NWU-CHINA is composite of 11 students from College of Life and Science of Northwest University. Though we all major in Biology, we master different skills, so we can finish our work by ourselves. This is our team first shot on synthesis biology, so we got together and thinking about what can we do. We search papers, do experiment, do social survey, acquaint public with synthesis biology and so on together. During this time, we get familiar with each other. In the process of finishing our project, we had been confused, met troubles, but with our teamwork, we overcame most of difficulties. At the end of the competition, we all benefit a lot from it.
We appreciate our instructors and advisor. They support us a lot as well when we had problem. We also thank to labs that offer us free help. Without their support, we cannot reach such achievement.

We handled cell line which is no chance for multiplication outside laboratory because of its frail character. No dangerous gene was expressed when we assayed because we checked only expression of promoter.
Both counter and CTC projects are confined to BSL1 and do not contain high risks parts compared with present BioBrick parts.
Advisors
On doing experiments, we handed in our plan of experiments to Professor Wakamoto, Ikeuchi and Ishiura, the bosses of the laboratories in which we conducted our experiments. These professors confirmed that our project observed the regulations. Professor Wakamoto provided us with almost all the materials for our experiments, Professor Ikeuchi provided us with a fluorescence microscope, and Professor Ishiura provided us with experimental facilities for the CTC detector project.
Our all experimental operations were under Professor's control and permission.

Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Foundations_-_-_TEXT.html,", we focused on a response to variation in temperature. We sought to not only show functionality and specificity of such a system but also to characterize baseline rates of our specific parts as part of our study.
The goal of our project was to build a band pass filter. Our system was thus broken into two components, a “high-pass” and a “low-pass” filter, with both parts operating with similar principles. The low-pass filter places an orthogonal transcription factor, σF, under the control of a RNA thermometer, a regulatory RNA sequence that only allows translation of σF when the bacteria are above a certain temperature. Downstream of σF, we placed a hrpS gene whose transcription was dependent on the presence of the σF.
The high-pass system was constructed in a similar manner, but instead of having a transcriptional activator regulated by the RNA thermometer, the Tet repressor was placed under the control of the same RNA thermometer. Downstream, a hrpR gene was placed under the control of PTet, ensuring hrpR would only be produced in the absence of TetR, i.e. when the bacteria are above the melting point of the RNA thermometer, they will stop producing hrpR.
Our end goal was to combine the high-pass and low-pass circuits in one multi-plasmid system in vivo so that expression of a downstream product only occurs within a specific frequency range of signal. This would be possible because the hrpS and hrpR genes act as an AND gate, as both of them together are necessary to drive transcription of a reporter under the control of the hrpL promoter. Transcription of the final product relies on a balance between production of σF and TetR and their respective degradation. They will only exist at the correct balance when the temperature is fluctuated at the appropriate rate for the system.
To test, we placed a reporter gene (sfGFP) downstream of an PhrpL promoter sequence.
In short, our system serves as a biological AND-type logic gate that requires that frequency of signal change not be too high (low pass) AND not too low (high pass), creating a functional range of frequency inputs to trigger reporter expression. When combined, they form a band-pass analogous to an electronic band pass.
Figure 1. Circuit overview. In practice, the reporter would be on the same plasmid as one of the filters, and mf-Lon would be on the other plasmid.
Figure 2. Electronic band pass. The low pass filter attenuates signals with high frequencies, and the high pass cuts off signals with low frequencies. Together, they"

University of La Verne Meetup
The UC San Diego team was part of the summer meetup hosted by University of La Verne, including UC Davis and TecCEM. Because it was the first time for a lot of people on our team, it was very helpful to meet with the teams and get feedback on our project ideas. It was very interesting to hear about the other teams’ project ideas, including ideas about encoding genetic data in bacterial plasmids, developing a mammalian biosensor, and wastewater treatment and PET degradation. We also got a lot of feedback about certain aspects to focus on for the wetlab design of our project, including the specificity of the MBD protein. University of La Verne was also extremely gracious in helping walk us through part of the Interlab protocol after our initial data set was rejected. As such, it was great to meet the other Southern California teams and get their advice. We also helped clarify some of the other team’s projects and were able to give tips on presentation and communication.
Imperial College
Imperial College is also developing a Communications Strategy Guide (CSG), and we were able to provide some feedback for their guide. In return, as a new team, they helped give us some tips for what to expect at the Jamboree.
Boston University Hardware Team
After our team decided to implement a microfluidic platform, we realized that we needed to understand how to integrate genetic circuit work with microfluidics. Thus, we first got in contact with Dr. Douglas Densmore, who serves as one of the primary investigators for the Boston University Hardware iGEM team. He explained the classifications of microfluidic devices and helped us understand the advantages and disadvantages of controlled flow devices and paper microfluidics. In addition, we had a follow up call with BU HW who helped us further understand some of the tools that the CIDAR Lab has developed in order to help expedite the microfluidic device fabrication workflow. They also got us into contact with Jana Healthcare who works in developing an optical sensing biosensor for glucose levels."

Beijing_Normal,2008,Team:Beijing Normal#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," room temperature, reaction set up below the optimal primer annealing temperature, which permits nonspecific primer annealing and extention.Undesired, non-specific primer extetion products formed this way may be amplified in the PCR, resulting in misprimed products and primer ologomers.In hot start PCR, DNA polymerase is withheld from the mixture until the system has reached a temperature that favours specific primer annealing. As a result hot start PCR can greatly improve specificity, sensitivity and yield in a PCR.
Effective Additives
The most simple additive in our PCR is DMSO(>=99.9% purity) at a concentration of 5%(V/V). It works well in most 'problematic' PCR, however, when DMSO fails in some case, we have to turn to a magic mixed additive (2.7 M betaine, 6.7 mM DTT, 6.7% DMSO, and 55 ug/ml BSA) for help. This excellent additive has solved several PCR where even 5% DMSO fails.
In certain PCR there is no yield without this additives, for example the ones by which we amplify bphA1A2A3A4 and bphBC.
Explanation
One major factor limiting the output of PCR routines is that a number of DNA sequences are poorly or not amplifiable under standard reaction conditions, either because of their high GC-content or/and their instrict propertoties to form secondary structures. This protocol is intended for GC-rich DNA sequences. This is a concentration dependent combination of betaine, dithiothreitol, and dimethyl suloxide. According to the references the concentration ratio is: a mixture containing 2.7 M betaine, 6.7 mM DTT, 6.7% DMSO, and 55 ug/ml BSA. It is stable at -20℃ for at least 3 months.

We got inspiration from 2016 Sydney Australia. They used regulating circuit in ethylene degradation bacteria as sensor gene and used chromoprotein gene as reporter gene to develop an ethylene detection bacteria. They applied this to evaluating fruit ripeness. We are inspired from this method. Based on our lab′s researching, we hope we can utilize the circuit regulating alkane degradation in P.a to construct an alkane detection bacteria."

4.    Observe GFP signal under confocal microscope
Cell Culture and Transfection
We cultured HEK293FT cells following American Type Culture Collection’s standard procedure, except that we used DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in our culture medium. For transfection, we followed the manufacturer’s protocol of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and used serum-free and antibiotics-free DMEM to form the DNA-lipofectamine complex.
Result
Figure 1. CMV promoter drives expression of GFP. HEK293FT cells transfected with Pcmv-GFP gave GFP signals. HEK293FT cells transfected with the commercial pEGFP-N1 showed similar results, while the same construct without any promoter did not give any GFP signals. Scale bar = 10µm.
Conclusion
CMV promoter was observed to drive expression of GFP in HEK293FT cells and green fluorescence signal was obtained under confocal microscope.
