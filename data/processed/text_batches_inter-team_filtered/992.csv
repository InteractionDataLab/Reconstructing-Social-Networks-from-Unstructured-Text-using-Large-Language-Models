Prototype
The detection of snake venom in human blood samples is an important part of our project. We aimed to create a spectrophotometer that could be attached to a mobile phone and a device that could prepare the blood for being analyzed with it.
Spectrophotometer
Figure 1: Spectrophotometer.
The creation of a pocket-sized spectrophotometer allows for more applications. A spectrophotometer is now available to more people in developing countries, due to its low cost, size, and convenient design.
The spectrophotometer’s 3D-model can be easily modified to fit most smartphones as well as any optical filter. The fact that it only needs the smartphone and does not rely on an arduino or other external devices, nor needs any external power source, means that it is very portable.

App
Figure 2: SV Detector app.
The SV Detector app is developed to work with the spectrophotometer and is capable of analysing pictures of the samples. The app captures the spectrophotometer’s output that is then analysed in order to give the operator feedback on the type of snake that the victim has been envenomed by, if envenomed.

BIOSINT_Mexico,2015,Team:BIOSINT Mexico#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," function as a biological film, such that the projection of a pattern of light onto the bacteria produces a high-definition (about 100 megapixels per square inch), two-dimensional chemical image.
Plants and some bacteria use a class of protein photoreceptors known as phytochromes to control phototaxis, photosynthesis and the production of protective pigments. Phytochrome consists of two identical chains. Each chain has a PAS domain and GAF domain. The PAS domain serves as a signal sensor and the GAF domain is responsible for binding to cGMP ( regulator of ion channel conductance, glycogenolysis, and cellular apoptosis) and also senses light signals. Together, these subunits form the phytochrome region, which regulates physiological changes in plants to changes in red and far red light conditions. Photoreceptors are not found in enterobacteria, such as Escherichia coli. So UT Austin group designed the red sensor cph8 using the cph1 (photoreceptor) and EnvZ (response regulator of OmpR).
In 2011, the Uppsala University design systems capable of detecting multiple wavelengths (red light, blue light and green light), focuses on improving the existing multichromatic sensing systems by expanding the number of useful wavelengths. The system can regulate the expression of three different genes independently from each other using three different wavelengths. These ""multichromatic coliroids"" upgrades the present coliroids, much like upgrading black-and-white movies to color TV.
Considering the design by the University of Texa, the same red sensor (cph8) was used and only changed the production of LacZ for RFP to give the red. For Blue, Uppsala use a new blue light sensor (YF1) designed by Andreas Möglich in 2008. YF1 is a fusion protein of YtvA (B subtilis) and FixL (B japonicum). The chromoprotein that was used in YF1 is amilCP. For Yellow, Uppsala used the green light sensitive sensor (ccaS) from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The chromoprotein that was used in ccaS is amilGFP.
Overview
This project aims to bioengineer  E. coli  in order to  serve as a biosensor that expresses chromoprotein reporters. Two light receptors were used, one for red light-sensing, cph8, and one for the blue light-sensing, YF1.
Both of this membrane receptor phosphorylate the transcription factors respectively associated to the"

III. Assembly of the Purified Proteins Constructs and Assembly Time Assays
Purpose: To assemble all other protein constructs into VLP’s using the standard VLP assembly buffer and to observe VLP assembly at different stages of time. Construct 3a was also purified and assembled under acidic and basic conditions to confirm the results from the first VLP experiment.
Materials and Methods: Construct 1 (HisTEV-CA-NC) insoluble proteins were purified into acidic VLP assembly buffer, and then some proteins were separated for His-tag cleavage. Construct 2a (His-TEV-CA1) was also purified and had it’s his-tag cleaved. Construct 3a proteins taken from the last protein purification stock its VLPs were  assembled under acidic and basic conditions. During the water bath incubation, Construct 1 VLPs were removed at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours. Only 100 ng/ul of protein was used for all assemblies. All VLP samples were observed under the TEM at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
Results and Discussion: Many of the samples observed under the EM showed little to no VLPs suggesting that something had gone wrong during the assembly process. This suggests that the full gag construct may not react well in an acidic assembly buffer, however there were very little VLPs observed for Construct 3a assembled at acidic conditions; a protein that has already been proven to assemble under acidic conditions. However, some VLPs were observed in the Construct 1 assemblies (Figure 1-3). This experiment would have to be repeated in order to obtain more reliable results. Construct 1 VLP assembly may have to be tested under neutral or basic conditions to verify optimal assembly conditions for the full gag, or more protein should be used for the VLP assembly instead of 100 ng. Construct 2a, which consists of a capsid protein of about 37 kDa in size, did not reveal any VLP’s under the EM (Figure 4). Since the capsid for construct 3a also did not assemble as it should have, it is reasonable to assume that the assembly reaction may have prohibited by some confounding factor.

Bisphenol A
The organic compound bisphenol A (BPA) is a key monomer in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Since polycarbonate is clear, heat stable and nearly shatter-proof, it is used in many common products like baby and water bottles, electronics, CDs/DVDs and eyeglass lenses. Epoxy resins are used as coatings on the inside of almost all food and beverage cans. BPA monomers can leak in small doses from these plastics into aqueous solutions. This leads to a daily exposure to BPA. Due to safety concerns, BPA use in the production of baby bottles is forbidden in the European Union and in Canada.
Bisphenol A and its effects on mammals
Due to the leaking of BPA monomers into aqueous solutions from BPA containing plastics, it may be absorbed by humans or eventually contaminate the environment. The exposure of BPA-based platics to heat under acidic or basic conditions accelarates the hydrolysis of the ester-bonds between the BPA monomers resulting in an increased release of BPA ( Richter et al., 2007 ). It has been shown that the exposure to even low doses of BPA during development has persistent effects ( Richter et al., 2007 ).

REU luncheon
On June 5, 2017, the Rice iGEM team collaborated with the Rice University Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB) to give a presentation for the participants of the BioNetworks NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. In the one hour presentation, our team gave an overview of synthetic biology, iGEM, our iGEM project last year, our brainstorming process, and our iGEM project this year.
The participants in the REU event were undergraduates enrolled in the NSF REU BioNetworks Program at Rice University. Participants were in their 1st week of the 10 week training program, and as a result still had little exposure to biological research projects.
SAST presentation
On June 22, 2017, we spoke with high school students from the Science Academy of South Texas (SAST) about the basics of synthetic biology and our experiences doing undergraduate research both through iGEM and in other research groups. We also spoke briefly about our iGEM project and last year’s iGEM project.
The participants in the SAST event were high school students and science teachers from the Science Academy of South Texas in Mercedes, Texas. Most of the students when asked indicated that they had an interest in pursuing STEM degrees/careers.

Abstract
Because thiosulfate and tetrathionate are indicators of intestinal inflammation (Levitt et al, 1999), this system can be used to detect it noninvasively. Although the detailed process and reasons for their production are still unknown, it has been established that the level of thiosulfate and tetrathionate is directly proportional to the seriousness of intestinal inflammation. Until now, scientists were able to detect thiosulfate and tetrathionate using a detector based on a two-component system, which includes two parts: detector and reporter. The detector was derived from a marine Shewanella species, and previous experiments on the detection of intestinal inflammation used sfGFP to show the result. However, we thought this method can be further improved.
The SHSBNU_China team worked on changing the reporter part to display the results more clearly and visibly, not requiring specially-produced ultraviolet light or prolonged contact with oxygen. In our system, E. coli would produce a chromo-protein to change its color (even in an anaerobic environment). Furthermore, to enable the result to be observed more easily and to ensure its safety, we planned to produce a pill in which the modified E. coli is stored, with special walls that would only allow small molecules to pass through. In addition to the conventional chromo-proteins it can produce, we designed and produced an additional plasmid using violacein as the reporter. Violacein was successfully produced and the corresponding strain showed obvious purple color under anaerobic conditions. The special reason for choosing violacein is that this compound can cure or at least slow down the inflammation to some degree.
The two-component system detector used in our project has the potential to be further modified to produce additional treatments upon detecting inflammation. We also came up with solutions to reduce potential risks in practical treatments. For example, we have discussed creating kill switches, using DNase to destroy the engineered gene to prevent its spread into the normal gut flora.

Trademarking Internationally
In order to get a trademark worldwide, you must apply for an international trademark from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). In order to qualify for an international trademark (if you are based in the UK), you must:
1. Have an application or a registration in the UK on which to base your application
2. The International application must be for the same mark as the UK application or earlier registration
3. The goods or services in your International application must be covered by your UK application/registration
4. The proprietors details must be the same
The total cost for an international trademark can be as high as $20,000 as it covers 90 countries, each with their own trademark offices.
Intellectual property
The three components of Darwin Toobox cannot currently be patented as there is no “inventive step” in making these pre-existing technologies smaller/portable. Thus, Darwin Toolbox cannot be patented as it does not meet the required criteria under the European Patent Convention . However, in order to protect any future intellectual property that might arise, it may be prudent to require any parties spoken to by the Darwin Toolbox team to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements in order to prevent others building on work carried out in the development of Darwin Toolbox.

There are several differences between the patent system in the USA and in Europe, below is a quick guide of the major issues.

Until March 2013, the USA operated under a “first to invent” system when granting patents. This meant that whoever came up with the invention first was given the patent when two parties tried to patent the same thing. However, since March, the USA mirrors Europe’s “first to file” standing, where the first party to file the patent is granted it, regardless of time of invention.
2. Grace Period
In Europe, if an invention is made publicly available in any way (lecture, presentation to investors, iGEM presentation) before the patent is filed, it is automatically rejected. In the USA, there is a one year grace period where the inventor can still obtain a patent. However, this grace period is lost if the individual who revealed the invention is a third party, as this negates the novelty of the invention.
3. Best Practice Requirement
In the USA, to obtain"

T7 Promoter Variants
Introduction
The success of any piece of biological circuitry, like the kind we are presenting in our system, hinges substantially on the time-scales required for the activation of its components. If one component reacts more quickly than another, the whole system will desynchronize and all pertinent biological information will be lost.
In our case, one of the key steps is the activation of the lysis cassette which is controlled by the T7 promoter. The rest of the system -- including any reporter systems that would lead to T7 RNA polymerase binding to a T7 promoter -- may depend on other parameters that affect the timescales in very delicate ways. It becomes crucial to have a variety of T7 promoter variants on hand, each of which has different strengths and efficiencies in order to accomodate the various system time-scales.
We made two families of T7 promoter variants. Each family has six designed mutants and three randomer mutants. The only difference between the two families is the addition of a lac operator sequence downstream of the T7 promoter.
These promoter variants were characterized using fluorescence, revealing a wide range of promoter efficiencies. To find out more about how these T7 promoter variants were made, please click here .
Here is a version of the T7 promoter consensus sequence:

The result of the homology search is shown as annimated gif in Figure 28 (please see our How To for an introduction). The protein was dialysed against 1x CD-buffer and subsequently a circular dichroism spectroscopy was taken (learn about CD spectroscopy ). The CD spectrum was used to predict the secondary structure content of the NanoLuc which could be determined to 35.1% helix, 27.6% b-strand, 18.5% turn and 18.8% random. As there is only a poor homology present, a detailed comparison of the determined  and the predicted secondary structure is not possible. But it can be stated that both show a balanced content of different secondary structures and that the produced protein is present in a folded conformation. The mixed secondary structure content is also in consistance with the predicted secondary structure shown in the AutoAnnotator sequence window ( click here ).
Activity determination of Luminescense
Figure 29: Activity dependence of the NanoLuc luciferase on the pH.
Figure 30: Activity dependence of the NanoLuc luciferase on the ionic strength.
The activity of the produced NanoLuc was investigated by its luminescense. The assay was performed in white 96-well plates (Nund) and the bioluminescense was determined at 460 nm in a BioTeK II plate reader for 1 sec per well. For every reaction 50 µl of the NanoGlow substrate (sponsored by Promega) was mixed with 50 µl of the NanoLuc preparation. In a first experiment a dilution series of the NanoLuc was performed in order to find the apropriate dilution of the enzyme (data not shown). Finally the 1:100 000 dilution was used for all experiments as it resulted in intermediate luminescense values within the dynamic range of the plate reader.
The dependency of the luminescense reaction on the pH value of the buffer was assayed by an experiment in which the NanoGlow substrate was diluted in water instead of the provided buffer and the pH was adapted by 100 µl of 500 mM buffers. The resulting luminescense is shown in Figure 23 and shows a clear optimum around pH 8.0 to 8.5. A luminescense value of more than 50% can be expected"
USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#model features_-_-_TEXT.html," Reaction. A template reaction describes the core structure of reactant that causes the reaction to happen and provides a specification for generating reactions with the same mechanism. This could be understood more clearly by dividing parts in a species into functional groups -- a reaction template describes the interaction mechanism of these functional groups. For example, pTetR promoter is deactivated in presence of TetR dimer. The template species are pTetR DNA template and TetR dimer protein template (see Figure 5) and the functional groups are pTetR promoter and TetR dimer. All the parts of ANY should also be counted as a functional group, though they don’t have functions in this reaction. Any pair of species which partially contain pTetR DNA and TetR protein dimer respectively would bind according to the description of this reaction template. Modeling with templates allows users to define species and reactions only once for one certain family without rewriting them again in database.
Figure 5: Template reaction
We are still looking for more substituents. We are planning to have more detailed substituents that can replace certain number of parts on certain number of chains. Even the arrangement of parts and chains can be specified. We believe it will make our template modeling more powerful.
A Standard Language
MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models. We will discuss a few relevant topics in the following sections.
Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling Database Language
With plenty of information for automatic modeling needs to be stored, we design our database, and develop a standard language of describing the database. We call the language: MoDeL.
MoDeL (Standard Biological Part Automatic Modeling DatabaseLanguage) is a database representation format for synthetic biology automatic modeling. This project of MoDeL aims at providing a language and syntax standard for automatic modeling databases used in synthetic biology models on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulations, and so on.
MoDeL is developed as a machine-readable format in XML fashion, programming languages with XML library API (such as libxml2 for C++) are strongly recommended for reading MoDeL database. USTC_Software has been devoted to the standardization of MoDeL. Documents can be found here . Example of database written in MoDeL can be downloaded on our GitHub page .
MoDeL is an attempt to define a universal database markup language for synthetic biology automatic modeling. It supports descriptions of a wide variety of different parts, including biobrick, compound, compartment, substituent, and so on. It"

7/1 We started the morning in the Jewett Lab shadowing a grad student who was carrying out a cell-free reaction. We decided to split the team in two.  One team focused on harvesting three strains of E. coli cells and the other dealt with the initial steps of cloning.  All of us continued researching promoters since the cell-free system uses T7 bacteriophage and the promoters we had initially selected from the Chris Anderson list were incompatible.  For cloning we used the 5 promoters which we originally planned to use. The T7 compatible promoters from the iGEM registry were not present in the distribution kit, so we need to order from IDT or some other similar company.  We also obtained a sample of Pseudomonas cells (one of the non-model strains) from the Wang lab which was incubated overnight.
7/2 Mitch and Sharon teamed up to harvest cells. We calibrated the spec by making serial dilutions and making a linear curve. We finished growing the starter culture and inoculated appropriate concentrations in 2x YTPG media. We grew these for a few hours and collected the cells by cycles of centrifugation. We used S30 buffer for extraction. We also had a meeting with Anthony, a grad student, who agreed to help us out by providing the non-model organism, streptomyces.
7/3 We transformed plasmids into competent cells and then plated them.  We designed primers for the inserts that we obtained the day before. We put the Pseudomonas cells in a frozen stock, while Karthik gave us an article about spinach aptamer to read.
Week 4
7/7 We continued the lysate making process by resuspending and sonicating cell pellets. We made frozen stock of successful colonies from previous plating, but started another round of cloning using the same 5 plasmids and DH5alpha cells as before in the hopes to get better cell colonies. We also made a RAM chart to keep tasks and priorities organized.
7/8 Tiffany and Adam had a meeting with Joe to talk more about mathematical modelling. All of us also had a meeting with the professors in which we talked in depth about outreach, T7 promoters, and judging criteria for the various medals. We continued to do cloning and cell free protein synthesis, and we had a review of primers with Will.
7/10 We started the day by autoclaving beakers and flasks. David, Adam and Tiffany had a meeting with Joe to further discuss modelling. We grew two cultures of Pseudomonas cells in parallel from a"

Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Notebook#Journal#Transformers_-_-_TEXT.html," the first trial we used frozen B. subtilis cells (1% xylose, 10% glycerol). The plates did not contain any colonies on the selective pates. Therefore, we concluded that there may have been a problem with our stock. We tried again using a different batch of comK cells (1%xylose). The results are shown below.  We successfully transformed B. subtilis using DNA amplified from the thrC vector using primer set 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (500-125 bp of homologous sequence). We were unable to successful transform bacteria with primer product containing 50 bp of homologous sequence, this was expected based on the literature. A few of our selective plates showing  transformed with PCR product and digested thrC vector (plate A) are shown below. We got a single colony for B. subtilis transformed with PCR product using primer set 2 and 4 (215 bp and 125 bp of homology, respectively). It was surprising to see higher transformation efficiency using primer product 3 (190 bp of homologous sequence) compared to primer product 2 (215 bp of homologous sequence) since transformation efficiency is found to decrease with a reduction in homologous sequence.  We did not control the DNA concentration which could explain these results.  Furthermore, we used B. subtilis stock cells that were made competent using 1% xylose and stored in 10% glycerol. We are currently working on optimizing the Zhang protocol, we expect to see greater efficiency once we confirm  the best conditions for inducing competence.
Figure 3: B. subtilis was transformed with DNA containing various lengths of homologous sequence and was plated on selective spectinomycin plates. Plate A shows B. subtilis colonies transformed with digested thrC vector  (700, 1300 bp of homology). Plate B, C and D show B. subtilis transformed with PCR product 2,3 and 4 respectively (215 bp, 190 bp and 125 bp of homology).
Week 19: September 2 - 5
We continued to work on transformations but we were consistently unsuccessful.  After trying to transform cells that were made competent the day we transformed them, we turned to transform with glycerol stocks of competent cells that we had made earlier. Unfortunately, neither the fresh nor glycerol stock cells led to successful transformation.

USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software2_-_-_TEXT.html," the original promoter any more. This is an example where binding changes the properties of node. Since we do not store all the possible property alterations within one part, the solution is to replace the old part with a new part that stores the correct properties.
Available nodes can be both a part on a chain or a node of binding site, which leaves a lot of possibilities in constructing complicated binding structure. Again, there are no restrictions, but parts of compartments are not suggested to appear in a binding structure.
The Basic Assumption
The basic assumption of Chain-Node Model is that a part ALWAYS carries its properties wherever it is placed in an instance of Chain-Node Model. This means no matter how complicated the complex is, you can always keep track of the location and properties of every single part. By letting complex inherits its parts’ properties, the assumption saves modelers from rewriting the structure and function of each new complex. However, we should address that the assumption is not suitable for all circumstances. For example, under this assumption, a fusion protein will carry the properties of the fused proteins, which is not true in many cases. A fusion protein may not remain its old properties and even have new properties that none of the original parts have. In this case, our suggestion is to define the fusion protein as a new part. So it is suggested that users choose different strategies of describing the same thing in Chain-Node Model base on different situations, instead of modeling everything in the same way.
Examples
With great power there must come great responsibility. In order to use the powerful Chain-Node Model correctly, please have a look at a few examples we presents.
Example of a species: E.coli cell
In MoDeL, the cell of E.coli is described as a species with only one part of E.coli(see Figure 1). Since the concept of part has been extended greatly, living cells can be described in the same way other species. Compartment belongs to “Non-sequence”, so it is suggested that E.coli only exists as a one-part-species.

Example of a species: pLacI*:LacI4 and its tree structure of binding.
Here is another example of template species with more complicated structure.(see Figure 2) In biology, LacI tetramer (or LacI4) can bind with promoter pLacI as a repressor. When bond with LacI4, pLacI is repressed and its transcription speed will decrease significantly. In order to express this alteration, as"

Overview
Modeling is an art of description. Grounded on experimental data and theoretical principals, the modeling practice combines both of them and expectedly will produce feedbacks unnoticeable by direct data analysis (though almost every modeling starts from this process).
The goal of our project is to build engineering bacteria with the ability to detect ammonium in water. By data analysis, we select the delay time (detailed definition is explained in the RESULT PART) as the signal to report the concentration of ammonium. To quantify the effect,we build models of bacteria growth under different concentration of ammonium. Also, we apply analysis method in dynamic systems to mathematically explain the promoters’ function feature: sudden transition from close to open at the threshold ammonium concentration. This proves that choice for delay are not only practically practicable, as is supported by experiment data, but also theoretically reasonable.
We divide our model into 2 sections. In part 1, we employ numerical algorithm to describe bacteria growth with accuracy and perform a deep-going analysis, using statistical methods. Part 2, we abstract the mechanism of these promoter into a TCS (Two Components System), which helps to get the evolution equation of the system. With methods from dynamic systems researches, we successfully explain the mechanism of the promoters we applied and this might be universal for common TCSs.
Bacteria growth is a fundamental issue in synthetic biology and the TCS is commonly used in synthetic biology. Our model is conducive to the core of the project, finding a suitable signal, and  potentially useful for modeling of other projects.

After a brief talk, they thought that they can helped us to test the level of gene expression of Hsp70A-Rbc S2 Promoter. Meanwhile, we helped them to test the expression of tCas9-CIBN and got the accurate data about the induced concentration of arabinose.

Collaborations with SDSZ_China team
    SDSZ_China team helped us to get some important response to our handbook from Cote dlvoire internationally students. Their responses were very essential for us because they offered the real conditions in West Africa. His gave us feedback as following. 1. You can add more information about the geographical distribution of different types of mosquitos that can carry different kinds of diseases, so that people from different parts of the tropical and subtropical areas can have a better understanding of what they need to be worried about. 2. I think most people actually living in the regions where mosquitos-carried diseases are prevalent already know the symptoms and basic ways to prevent them. Maybe your handbook will be more useful to tourists. So you can consider contacting local travel agencies and distributing your brochures to them.
 
 
 
Collaborations with SCUT-China_A team
SCUT-China_A team members are troubled with the mosquitoes in Guangzhou. Because of it, they gave us some practical suggestions about how to use our products in the natural environment. They provided some environment parameters which are typical factors in the areas which are suitable for mosquitoes living. Based on their ideas and model, we tried to figure out the demo about how to make use of our products to control mosquitoes in the natural environment. If"

Heidelberg,2008,Team:Heidelberg_-_-_TEXT.html,"1000 gene building blocks, due to the continuous development of new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.
The Heidelberg team consists of 15 students of the University of Heidelberg and one student of the TU Darmstadt, all with a different scientific background including Molecular Biotechnology, Biology and Mathematics. The students are supported by advisors from the group of Victor Sourjik (ZMBH; University of Heidelberg) and from the division of Roland Eils (University of Heidelberg and DKFZ). The project itself is carried out in the newly founded Bioquant building, a center for qualitative analysis of molecular and cellular biological systems.
The Heidelberg team is developing a biological machine that is able to detect and specifically kill pathogens or even cancer cells. In a proof of principle study the team has genetically reengineered two E.coli strains into a prey and a killer strain.
The system consists of two modules: a module for the recognition of the pathogen-presenting prey cell by the killer strain, and a module for directed movement of the killer cells towards their prey. The team utilizes the natural sensing and movement system of E. coli bacteria, which in nature is used to sense nutrients, by redesigning the receptors of the killer strain to sense a molecular cocktail secreted by the prey strain.
After arriving at the prey, an additional gene module is activated which then leads to the death of the pathogen or the cancer cell. The Heidelberg team follows two different strategies to achieve the killing. The first strategy focuses on bacterial toxins, the other one uses viruses specific for bacteria. Toxins are normally produced by certain bacterial strains to kill other bacteria. However, these toxins are also able to kill cancer cells, making this approach possibly suitable for the elimination of cancer cells. For the test system the team uses genetic information of bacterial toxin production. This information will be introduced into the killer-cells and modified to only become active once the killer strain reaches the prey strain. Activation then leads to toxin production and release, finally resulting in killing of the prey-cell.
The second approach for killing the prey uses bacterial viruses, which naturally infect E. coli cells. During infection the phage inject its genetic information into the bacterium, forcing it to produce new phages, which are released afterwards. Free phages are then again able to attack other bacteria. In this approach the team specifically takes advantage of the domino effect, which allows killing a high"
AHUT_China,2018,Team:AHUT China#HP FOR SILVER_-_-_TEXT.html," our project. At the same time, we have learned that the biomembrance process can not only treat sewage, but also can be applied to the treatment of organic gases. The pollutants in the organic waste gas are first contacted with water and dissolved in water, that is, diffused from the gas film into the liquid film; The organic pollutant components in the liquid film are diffused to the biofilm by the difference in concentration, and they are captured and absorbed by the microorganisms therein; the organic pollutants entering the microorganisms are decomposed as energy and nutrients in the metabolism of the microorganisms themselves. This provides us with some ideas on the combination of theory and practice.
Through a visit to the Biofilm Process Water Purification Laboratory in the afternoon, we learned about the biofilm treatment of sewage. At the same time, we also learned the necessity of our project. The impact of greenhouse gas CO2 cannot be underestimated. We also hope that our project can be applied to practice. The knowledge of biofilm processes in the treatment of organic waste gases has also given us some inspiration, and we may be able to use this knowledge when dealing with CO2.

    8. Collaboration with Harvard
iGEM competition is coming to an end, and a lot of teams have put out applications for various collaborations on the iGEM website. Fortunately, we got an opportunity to be part of the team Harvard (Fighting Stigma Against Synthetic Biology), and we also wanted to promote communication between us through the cooperation.
This year, Harvard wants to work with other teams to end the misunderstanding of synthetic biology. We found that human exposure to bacteria tends to have negative effects, which are considered as something dangerous. As an iGEM team, we understand that genetically engineered bacteria are largely untapped resources, helping us show the world the true potential of using such a bacteria for treatment, diagnosis, environment and so on.Harvard plans to release a series of articles to show all the cool things and germs the team is working on. Besides, they want introductions of other teams’projects, so we send ours to them on request.
Here is the introduction of our project. In the wake of the increasing greenhouse exerting more serious impacts on the global environment, the question of how to efficiently deal with CO2 is particularly critical. However, the traditional gas collection technology featured by high energy consumption and low efficiency is not yet mature enough"

Gas vesicle protein quantitative analysis
In order to quantitative analyze the expression of gvp gene inside the cell, we design a genetic circuit that could be realized by inserting the gvp gene alongside GFP as a polycistron[5]. Using this part, we can know the expression level of Gvp protein by the detecting the fluorescence of GFP.It will be transcribed into an mRNA and the two genes each have a same promoter (BBa_ J23106). So we can through the expression of GFP to detect gvp gene expression of roughly quantitative. GFP expression can through the determination expression of the specific excitation wavelength of fluorescence value to calculate. [5][6]
We made 2 polycistron circuits of gvpA/C and gfp genes.
Our devices are:
Constitutive GvpA and GFP generator (BBa_K737006):
Promoter (BBa_J23106) + RBS (BBa_B0034) + gvpA + RBS + GFP + terminator (BBa_E0840)
Constitutive GvpC and GFP generator (BBa-_K737007):
Promoter (BBa_J23106) + RBS (BBa_B0034) + gvpC + RBS + GFP + terminator (BBa_E0840)
In order to check out the expression of polycistronic genetic circuit .We use the SDS-PAGE（protocol）to get the intracellular total protein. Here is the result of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (Figure22) We can see GFP and GvpC protein directly. Lane 4 is top10 control group, lane 3 is constitutive GvpA and GFP generator, lane 5 is constit"

Moreover, Jean-Jacques Dumas, a teacher in industrial products design, helped us in this task, especially with respect to the fixation of the Sunwaterlife membranes, its reusable capacity and its simplicity of use. This allowed us to better imagine and adapt it to the requirements of the customers.
To go further, the device was printed in 3D with a ""Stratasys"" 3D printer, used for industrial applications. The material used to print the prototype is ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) which is a plastic polymer that is simple to machine and shock-resistant.
Modeling with Solidworks
Machining parts in the 3D printer
Finally, we are proud to present you our device:
Conclusion about the device conception
The device has been designed to meet as many criteria of the scope statement as possible. Containment of GMMs is achieved using membranes provided by Sunwaterlife. The materials used, the size and the content of the sachet have been studied in order to create a cheap, easy to use and portable device. A prototype of the product was modeled and printed in 3D. With a bag of 10 cL containing 7 g of both microorganisms, it can treat 5 liters of water in about 1 hour (excluding the rehydration time of the microorganisms and assuming that the water is homogeneous).
Obviously, some areas need to be improved:
the use of biodegradable materials;
the treatment capacity that should reach about 11,000 L of water in one week for a village of 18 families. A scale up of this prototype is needed;
if the time required to rehydrate and activate the microorganisms is longer than the diffusion time of the medium’s nutrients, over-dilution will occur, creating an osmotic shock and killing the microorganisms. The rehydration and activation steps must be carried out in a smaller volume of water, set to avoid nutrient over-dilution. Then, once activated, the device can be transferred into a larger volume of water;
in order to optimize the diffusion of water and molecules through the Sunwaterlife membranes, it would be necessary to equip the tanks of water to be treated with stirrers. This would reduce the water treatment time. However, this is difficult to implement in cholera-affected villages and this would make our product too complicated to use.

BBa_K2705005 : PgltAB-GFP
Design
This part includes the promoter PgltAB and green fluorescent protein, the expression of GFP is repressed by high level cellular glutamate because PgltAB is upregulated by GltC, which is repressed by high intracellular concentration of glutamate. A restriction enzyme KpnI cutting site is added between PgltAB and GFP.
The part was applied to test the repression function of GltC to PgltAB, for which we fermented under different glutamate concentration and tested the fluorescence level changes in LL3.
Proof of Function
Detection of gltC transcription level in LL3-PgltAB-GFP under different glutamate concentrations
LL3-PgltAB-GFP was cultured in M9 medium with different extracellular glutamate concentrations. From the 6th hour, we extracted the total RNA of LL3-PgltAB-GFP every 3 hours and tested the transcription of gltC together with the respective intracellular glutamate concentrations. Transcription level of gltC in plateau phase is shown in Fig. 1. It could be indicated that the transcription of gltC was repressed with the increasing intracellular glutamate concentration. Primers used in the assay are listed in Table 1.

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.
Conclusion
To conclude, in part 1 we successfully model the bacteria growth in our project. We use Baranyi & Roberts model and we apply Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm to get the parameters using the experimental data. This gives a rough prediction for the delay time signal.
In part 2, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction.
With all these analysis and experimental data supported, the final conclusion of the modelling is that the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental ammonium concentration.

9.The iGEM Booklet
To spread public awareness of our project, we completed a iGEM booklet to introduce ""What is Synthetic Biology?"" and ""What is solid tumor and how to treat it"". As an educational booklet, knowledge is carefully summarized. Background information, social situation, and critical learning questions are all included so that people with limited Biology background could easily learn something from the booklet.
We have already shared our booklet with teachers all over the city, the country, and even the world! Here in Jilin University, we joined a TED JLU talk and our booklets were present as a gift to the teachers and students. In addition, we have given our booklet to students, teachers, and people from other walks of life all over the state. In the HUST-Cheering Meeting,we provided our booklet to other iGEM teams and exchanged ideas with them. Two students helped bring some booklets to Los Angeles, America, as well as Stockholm, Sweden. And in Boston, during the Gaint Jamboree, we will hand out our booklet to others as well.
Three Different edited version of the booklet have been printed, better and better. And we are still working on fulfilling the information for our booklet. Currently, we are working on providing the some updated statistics so that people can have a bigger view of tumor.
The information we provided and taught to students and adults will inspire them to look into Synthetic Biology. We have already received many positive responses and we feel certain that this enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology will carry them into the future. Additionally, people learn about tumor and a healthy style of life will be pursued. Our educational synthetic biology activities booklet will be available online for anyone to use for free as soon as we get our final edition.
10.TV Interviews
Our iGEM project gets high attention and positive responses from all life sciences teachers and even directors of the Academic Affairs Division Office at Jilin University.
To support our project and spread the influence of iGEM, our Jilin University News Network interviewed our Jilin_China 2016 iGEM Team early in 2016. Through this educational TV exhibition, we shared our project idea as well as basic synthetic biology concepts with the public. We are informed that the interview about us reached a vast audience throughout the whole University.

New year, new project. This time, let's try to make an epigenetic switch!
Before the end of the classes and during the spring, this sub-team has outlined the project by  organizing weekly meetings to discuss about the design of our project and the strategies to carry it out.
Week 1 (July, 4-8)
Initial contact with the lab. First of all, it is necessary to amplify some vectors that will be used in the construction of the modules, Pnmt1(41X) and Purg1, as well as two constructions that have been gently sent from the Dr. Attila Becskei from the University of Zurich. On the other hand, I have designed some primers that will be used later.
There are still lots of things to do.
Week 2 (July, 11-15)
Short week. The order of synthesized part tetR-CSD has just arrived to the Lab, so I can start to build up the compaction proteins modules. First of all, I have had to transform the plasmids into E. coli. Also, I made a PCR to amplify swi6 from the genome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and sir3, from a plasmid. The objective was to get enough DNA of these parts and, by using appropriate restriction sites that were introduced into the designed primes, start assembling the  fusion proteins for this module.  Next week we will see if the experiments have worked out as expected.
Week 3 (July, 18-22)
This week I have started to assemble the DNA fragments that will be used for the compaction protein modules, so firstly, I have had to made sure that all its parts"

Densities (of cells).
Volume fraction of gas vesicles (needs to be determined how best to estimate this), to check the relationship between the density of the rest of the cell and the presence of gas vesicles.
(Relative) promotor strengths? (We should be able to relate this to gvp/transporter expression in some way!)
DONE Reality check for buoyancy with arsenic.
Model accumulation of arsenic in E. coli.
DONE How well does ArsR(+fusion protein) bind to its binding site.
TODO How well does ArsR(+fusion protein) bind to arsenic.
DONE Reaction rate(s) for binding, unbinding, production and degradation of ArsR(+fusion protein)?

GVP (1pers):
Place three different constituive promotors with low, medium, and high activity in front of GVP-cluster
→ DONE cutting the vector with promotor sequence resulted in a fragment of about 50bp and was difficult to locate on 1% agarose gel
→ DONE gel purification of cut vector with GVP resulted in such a low concentration (4.3 ng/μL), it was not usable in the next step (ligation)
→ DONE next option is cutting out GVP-cluster, and ligate it into the promotor vector (other way around).
The cutting and ligation was one of the more serious issues of Melbourne 2007 team, and might give us the same problems to keep in mind
→ DONE check if transformation/ligation has worked (failed)
Isolate new plasmids of GVP and the three promotors to continu work
→ DONE grow new cultures of each from the glycerol stocks
→ DONE determine concentration with nanodrop
Create (and test) variants of GVP vector with/without Ori+resistance between the E and X sites???
→ TODO get in contact with Kloosterman for protocols for working with small fragments
→ DONE isolate cut promotors from gel (failed)

17th June:        Attend the Asian Workshop meeting.
17th July:        Meet up with Tsinghua Team, and learn fron their experiences.
25th July:        With Invitrogen.Co. Ltd and Tsinghua team to sign up a contract.
27th July:        Have a discussion with Tsinghua team about the transformation efficiency.
We generalize some key words from the discussion:
1. Make sure the concentration of the plasmids from the biobrick is enough for transformation.
2. Keep a low temprature when enzyme digestion is performed
3. The transformation product are always incubated for more than 1h.
9th September:   We and Tsinghua team get together in our lab. We have a happy time together and share a lot.
10th September:  We provide Tsinghua Team with the cells harboring pSB1AC3 plasmids. We did the the tramsformation for them. Because they found their transformation effeciency is relatively low.
17th September:  Tsinghua Team told us that the vector that we provided proved to work well. We were all pretty happy about this positive result.
3th October:      We and Chiba Team had a happy conversation via googletalk today. We share all the success and frustrations in the process. And we exchange our opinion about promotor function measurement. They told us that they have used BBa_T9002 because their project uses quorum sensing and the part(T9002) was GFP producer controlled by 3OC6HSL Receiver Device.And their result is pretty satisfying.
5th October:      We share the experience of measurment with Tokyo Tech University Team. They tell us to use BBa_I13522 ( http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13522 ) as a positive control when we measure the function of promotors.
9th October:      We test the founction of Part BBa_I719015. The result indicates that it works well. The cells (BL21(DE3) as host) turn  green when induced by IPTG.
15th October:      Our T-shirt is designed today. It is very pretty. See image below.

COLLABORATIONS
In addition to working on our project, our team also assisted and collaborated with various other iGEM Teams. These interactions allowed us to form stronger connections in the iGEM community and ultimately benefited the projects of all parties involved.
UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA
Our main collaboration was with the University of Georgia iGEM Team’s Archaea Collaboration. This team’s goal is to help incorporate archaeal chassis into iGEM, so they asked several teams to help them characterize a ribosome binding site (RBS) library they had prepared. Our team was asked to compare mCherry fluorescence readings from 28 archaeal cell extract samples that they provided, each with different RBS point mutations. As each participating lab’s instrumentation is different, we had to develop our own protocols for measuring these values based on a standard set of guidelines provided by UGA. We used a fluorescence plate reader to measure the values, first setting a standard curve using their highest samples. We then had to calculate dilutions that put each of their samples in the linear detection range for this device, so we diligently ran two dilutions for each of the 28 samples. We reported our data to them, and also took a survey about our experience and an additional, more minor experiment in which they asked us to report how much dry ice was left in the package that they sent (from the above experiment). This helped them optimize their large study for amount of dry that was needed based on locations were packages were sent.
TÜBINGEN UNIVERSITY
We also provided the Tübingen University iGEM team with a construct previously used by the UCSF team. We sent them an E-Cadherin construct in a plasmid that targets the protein for surface display (pCTCON2). This part is a calcium dependent adhesion transmembrane protein, which plays a vital role in the formation of tissue, epithelial cell behavior, as well as the suppression of cancerous cells. We are excited to see how they used it!
WIKI FLICKS
To go above and beyond in terms of our policy and practices, we have introduced our innovative program WikiFlicks (please see more on our Wiki Flicks Page ).This feature acts as an extension of the annually required team Wiki pages which aims to bring science to a level in which everyone can understand. The teams involved this year were:

SAPs have been used as a scaffold for cell culturing and drug delivering in tissue engineering and medical technology. For example, RADA16-I self-assembles nanofibrous forming hydrogel and is used for 3-D culture such as neural stem cells (NSCs), bones, cartilage tissues. However, SAPs are seldom used in iGEM, and the only past examples are ones such as EAK16-II ( 2008 iGEM Imperial College London ) and RADA16 ( 2009 iGEM Slovenia ). We need to construct new application methods and use them more often.
Enhancement of enzymatic activity
Improving enzymatic activities is needed to promote chemical reactions. Enzymatic activities can be enhanced by various ways including amino acid substitution, enzyme compartmentation, circularization, and multimelarization. For example, 2014 iGEM Heidelberg team constructed covalently linked circulated enzymes by using intein and extein to increase the enzyme stability.  Having been inspired by their projects, we worked on circularized enzymes using SAPs. This led us to an idea of constructing circularized multi-enzyme. Finally, we focused on these two projects.
Parts designing
We designed parts using Benchling tool and employed free DNA synthesis gBlocks® Gene Fragments from IDT . IDT gBlock DNA can synthesize 125~2000 bp. Because some parts are over 3000bp, we ordered splitting parts with restriction sites, which were subsequently cut by restriction enzymes and ligated to other parts.  GC rich or repeating sequences are difficult of synthesizing. Although we worked hard on the experiments, it is most unfortunate that the sequences proved to reject synthesis, yielding unsatisfactory results. However, most of the sequences turned out to be profitable.

Troubleshooting the transformation
Followed the competent cell protocol from the third boot camp with the cells we grew overnight
Placed 5 mL LB and 50 uL of cell culture into each Falcon tube, then placed in the incubator for ~3 hours
After making competent cells, we followed the iGEM transformation protocol using the competent cells made that day, competent cells that Kelly brought us as a control, and control competent cells with kanamycin resistance
With these controls, we should get a better idea of whether the transformation failure was due to the DNA volume typo on the iGEM page, bad chloramphenicol, or badly made competent cells.

Glasgow,2014,Team:Glasgow#Project#Measurements#Gas Vesicles_-_-_TEXT.html," DNA from the transformants was sent for sequencing to confirm the presence of an unmutated construct. The confirmed transformants were then observed for their ability to float.
Cells were first grown in LB until mid exponential phase had been reached, and then grown a further 2 hours with either 0.2% glucose, or 0.2% arabinose to induce GvpA and GvpC expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and re-suspended in filter sterilised 0.15% NaCl. The samples were observed at intervals over 5 days but no difference was visible between the induced and non-induced cell samples. Both sets of cells contain the pBAD33-gvpAC plasmid, but one had been induced with arabinose and the other had not.

Valencia_UPV,2017,Team:Valencia UPV#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," fluorescent signal.
However, viral vector strategy underlies some drawbacks. Thus, usage of mRNAs as long-distance signalling molecules postulates as a good alternative to develop in future steps, due to its ability to deliver a signal in its non-functional form. Additional advantage is provided by the long-distance movement of mRNA over protein trafficking, since translation of the transcript occurs specifically at the target site. Moreover, an mRNA molecule can be translated to numerous copies of a protein being plainly more efficient than traffic several copies of them (Spiegelman, Golan & Wolf, 2013).
MODULE 2: Plant – Human communication channel
As far as communication is concerned, a bidirectional channel must be established. In our work, we demonstrate that not only delivering orders into plants is feasible but also that plants are able to notify us of any change in their status.
A leaf’s colour change triggered by a viral vector approach apprises us whether plants are affected by any stress through our Colour Code System. Thus, we resolved to control biotic and abiotic stresses using a modular and orthogonal genetic AND gate in order to decrease leakage possibilities.
CHARACTERIZATION OF PhiC31 RECOMBINASE ACTION
PhiC31 is a serine recombinase with the ability of performing site-specific recombination between two attachment sites attP and attB (Keravala et al., 2006). We demonstrate that PhiC31 allows an accurate regulation of luciferase expression when it performs the inversion between its attachment sites. Following this experimental design we were able to characterize recombination performance under weak and strong plant-specific promoters (Pnos and p35s respectively).
Reporter assembly construct is composed by a 35s promoter sequence and Mtb terminator flanked by two opposing PhiC31 site-specific recombination sites (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Graphic representation of Plant-Human genetic circuit with the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by ΦC31 attachment sites. a) In presence of PhiC31 integrase, recombination occurs allowing the expression of a translation of a nonsense sequence or stuffer fragment . In this case, the circuit is in OFF state b) Graphic representation of the toggle switch in ON state only when PhiC31 and gp3 are expressed. Only when the promoter is activated under stress conditions, corresponding color protein will be expressed.
These results showed a counterintuitive correlation between the recombinase and luciferase. The higher the expression of recombinase is, the lower the probability that inversion occurs is. That is, the more concentration of recombinase in plant cells"

Q1, When shopping, do you buy ""not genetically modified food”?
[ Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / I have never seen such an indication ]
More adults avoid “genetically modified food” than students. Especially, we think, full-time house makers have a lot of interest in food safety because they go shopping and buy foods nearly every day.Mean while, students worrier about the price than about the safety. And they are from different generations. Students today have studied about “genetic engineering” before.
Q2,What do you associate with [ genetic engineering / biotechnology ]? (※Please circle all that apply)
[ Clone / GM crops (foods) / Patent / DNA / Genome / Medicine / Cosmetic / Bioethics / Virus / Artificial Life / Novel Prize / Environment / Biological weapon / iPS cells, ES cells / Biofuel / Biohazard / Others( ) ]
The top three are ”Clone”, “GM crops(foods)” ,”DNA” in any jobs. “Genome” is lower than we thought. Include “iPS cells, ES cells”, these are academic language. So these are little understood popular expect students in sciences. Among students in arts, there are remarkably few people who think that “genetic engineering” or “biotechnology” is associated with closer to their lives, for example, medicine and cosmetic. In others (not students), they don’t know academic language"

Open University
     The Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) organizes a popular (and free entry) meeting named “Universidade Aberta” (translated as “Open University”) since 1998. The major goal of Open University is to increase the interest of young citizens for the knowledge, science, as well as for academic careers that lead to a profession. People of all ages can attend the event, but the main target audience are high school students. The Open University is one of the most important academic event in the north-central region of São Paulo State, where live nearly 2 million inhabitants. This year, in September 22th and 23th, around 15,000 visitors from São Carlos and neighbor cities attended to the meeting, a special moment that integrated people from society and academy.
      We (members of Brasil-SP Team) presented about the perspectives of the Biotechnology career in Brazil, the Biotechnology Course offered by UFSCar, and as well as about Synthetic Biology. Presentations include one lecture, eight guided visits to molecular biology and microbiology local laboratories, and a total of 24 hours of interaction activities, from reception to dialogue with visitors at our stall, based on a rotating schedule of members (14 hours in Sept 22th and 10 hours in Sept 23th). In the labs, attendees received information about infrastructure, basic and applied research, and observed the differences between non-transformed bacteria compared to recombinant bacteria expressing GFP.

Week-end Brainstorming
Staff Event
Throughout the year, our team participated as staff to three sports events, in order to raise funds for the project and the Boston Giant Jamboree.
We spent a few weekends on these events: most of the times, it meant going on site very early in the morning to help the « official staff » on the logistic. We then had various roles, going from road blocking to medal handling, through dicing fruits for the runners… We once had to run the main stand for the whole day, and welcomed every runner, gave them their bags, maps, etc ! We also had some more uncommon roles, such as helping bike runners go down stairs under the rain… These events could sometimes be hard, but they always were very fun, and we were on a very good mood all day long: no matter how tired we were, everyone was here for a greater cause, and we got to meet very nice people there. These events were also great occasions for team building and group cohesion, as we had to work together fast and efficiently, just like during the iGEM competition.
We helped the staff of these events:

Very valid questions were raised by the audience, and many useful suggestions were   given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant Jamboree, and tackle   each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as to give our first time   participation in iGEM the best we have. This meetup was indeed a great learning experience, and   has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
Surveys
iGEM mandates organizing of surveys as public outreach practice for all participating teams and  for a good reason. Advancements in Biotechnology in recent years have created a buzz in   blogger communities, newspaper reports and science and technology television shows. A lot of   ideas have faced severe opposition on grounds of ethics, religion and simply uninformed   knowledge. Rise of GMOs in agriculture and medical care brought forward debate on the table   where many raised rejection of these products because of unfamiliar nature and impact of   convoluted ideas presented in scientific fiction. Since all iGEM teams are tinkering with the   biological entities to manufacture artificial life forms which can perhaps be in future transferred   as a routinely used technological platform like smartphones, computers and internet. It is   important that public’s opinion be sought, their contributions considered and their information   gap improved. Inspired by a plethora of surveys conducted by previous iGEM teams we developed some ideas  of our own. Since our project is based upon development of a household level device capable of   detecting microbial food spoilage which itself functions upon a synthetic bacteria (an improved   strain of E.coli DH alpha). The improvement is attributed to introduction of a single plasmid   possessing a luxR-­AHL quorum sensing detection system which upon presence of AHL (Acyl Homoserine Lactones)   beyond threshold level initiated the transcription of reporter gene and thus determining if food   product in question is spoilt or not. We launched two surveys. One of them essentially focused on Food Spoilage , and the second survey was aimed at gathering data to help newbie iGEM teams get the necessary information to get ready for future participation in iGEM.
Food Spoilage Survey
Our first survey was in the form of a questionnaire to know how often people face the problem of food spoilage and what solution they take to deal with that. This data will help us to modify and optimize our"
Imperial_College,2013,Team:Imperial College#Growth Assays_-_-_TEXT.html," 2013 iGEM.
Proteinase K growth assay. MG1655 E. coli display strong growth with the induction of BBa_K1149007 , though it is not significant as a two-tailed t-test gave p = 0.1471. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Proteinase K induction assay. When induced, there is a very clear increase in fluorescence for BBa_K1149007 , however t-test analysis gives p = 0.0595 > 0.05 for this, thus the fluorescence does not significantly differ from uninduced. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Empty Vector Control
Empty vector (EV) induction assay E. coli (MG1655) transformed with empty vector (EV) control plasmid were grown with either 0uM or 6uM Arabinose. Growth was at 37°C with shaking.  Error bars are SEM, n=4. Figure made by Imperial College London 2013 iGEM.
Conclusions: Extracellular proteinase K fluoresces significantly more than uninduced extracellular proteinase K. None of the biobricks had significant decreases in their growth rates when induced by the respective inducer - be that Arabinose or Xylose. The remainder of the fluorescence assays did not show a significant difference between induction and no induction. This said, the data still requires normalising, this process might elucidate finally as to whether any other biobricks have significant fluorescence when induced. The empty vector control whether induced or not shows similar growth, proving its functionality as a control.
Growth assay characterisation of existing biobricks
Stress biosensor characterisation (BBa_K639003)
Originally we intended on using BBa_K639003 to detect whether our cells were stressed when grown with an array of potentially toxic plastics and degradation products. However, as the data below shows, the promoter is leaky and expresses mCherry in a non stressed state. As an alternative we utilised the stress sensor as a marker for our chassis E. coli (MG1655) for an array of qualitative and quantitative waste growth and toxicity assays.
Note: The stress sensor induces mCherry production through a mechanism involving the ppGpp stress response. Induction with IPTG bypassess this mechanism through an inhibition of LacI, resulting in m"

ATOMS-Turkiye,2014,Team:ATOMS-Turkiye#Testing_-_-_TEXT.html," and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be taken up by roots (albeit under controlled lab settings) is new and was only published last year[4].
As the amount of IAA needed for enhancing plant growth depends on whether our bacteria are producing the compound outside or inside the plants, we attempted to replicate these findings.
In preparation for confocal imaging, we met with Dr Martin Spitaler and Mark Scott who advised us on how to prepare samples and image them. Confocal microscopy is much more precise than conventional light field microscopy as it eliminates background light by focusing the laser through a pinhole (Mark Scott, oral communication). The confocal microscopy we conducted was focused on imaging GFP expressing bacteria inside Arabidopsis roots to show that uptake of the bacteria takes place.
In an imaging trial run we found that natural fluorescence can be measured in roots in a spectrum that does not interfere with measuring the superfolder GFP expressed by our E. coli cells. In addition, the autofluorescence is strong enough to enable us to identify individual cells (Video 2). We did therefore not need to dye the roots before imaging.
Video 2: Stack of wt Arabidopsis root. The root can be imaged at around 488 nm. Imaging carried out by Dr Martin Spitaler for Imperial College team iGEM 2011.
In order to prepare the GFP-expressing bacteria for plant uptake, they were spun down and media was exchanged prior to incubation at 37°C to reach exponential phase. Bacteria were then spun down and resuspended in wash buffer (5 mM MES) to reach OD 30. 8 ml, 4 ml and 2 ml were added to separate flasks, containing 100 ml of half-MS media each. 4 ml and 6 ml of wash buffer were added to the flasks containing 4 ml and 2 ml bacteria, respectively. 8 ml of wash buffer was added to the negative control. Ten Arabidopsis seedlings were distributed into each of the flasks. Incubation was carried out for 15 hours prior to imaging.
Prior to imaging, roots were washed in PBS to wash off bacteria and facilitate imaging. We imaged the plants incubated with 8 ml of bacteria and were able to find bacteria inside one of the roots. A 3D picture was taken of uninfected roots and roots containing bacteria by taking a Z stack image using confocal microscopy (Video 3).

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," over others2.  That is why the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has created the initiative for what is known as the “Registry of Standard Biological Parts” where it indexes biological parts that are currently being built. A standard array of modular gene switches or parts that can be found from a common library and can be mixed and matched in various combinations, which is the goal that synthetic biology targets. This is a similar path as what happened twenty years ago when software became standardized and allowed Microsoft to become a monopoly. The issue in the air currently is if this could happen with the synthetic biology industry3.
Advantages
Open-sourcing has been an idea that has been the basic foundation of synthetic biology throughout the years. Supporters strongly believe in a world where companies and academia will be able to develop and share parts freely for the advancement of the whole field, not just a singular firm or university4.
A term that is used commonly in this industry is called network effects. This means that the more a product is used, the more attractive it becomes. Over time as each part is used repeatedly on a specific metabolic pathway, especially when in successive experiments, its cost goes down. With the limited data that is available, it is predicted that total project costs could be cut down by 25% after its first successive use. It is also likely that these costs would be cut down several more times until it flattens as with each subsequent experiment more knowledge on that part is gained and intuitively, less errors are made.
One such example is with Amyris’ artemisinin project that spanned over the length of five years, costing $20 million. It was reported that 95% of the time spent was on finding and fixing unintended interactions between parts.
Due to the fact that one part must be used in conjunction with other sets of parts gives incentive to companies to create whole libraries. This is very similar to how software companies develop several programs that are able to cover multiple applications. Not only that, but there is opportunity for these companies to make profit by patenting some of these parts and making others openly available due to the strong modularity of the open-parts approach.
It is expected that companies will have their own individual parts needs. This means that other companies cannot just sit around and wait for another to develop a part. This also gives a type of competitive advantage as companies that share parts will not be losing their, ‘technological edge’ to other competitors. Since different companies have idiosyncratic needs and hence expertise, it proposes that community-based libraries will outperform individual companies. The industry will probably have a large number of small"

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html,"36 illustrates the electrical power as a function of time for the wild type E. coli KRX and a genetically modified strain of E. coli KRX containing the BioBrick (<bbpart>BBa_K1172502</bbpart>) with the oprF gene under control of the T7 promoter.
Figure 36: Results from cultivation of Escherichia coli KRX expressing OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172502</bbpart>) in contrast to Escherichia coli KRX wild type in the fuel cell. M9 medium, including 10.2 g L-1 was used with mediator methylene blue, the resistor between cells was set to 200 Ω.
The general course of the measurement data shows, that the used strains cannot produce a high power output for a long period of time. For both measurements the maximum voltage is reached after approximately 30 minutes and the voltage values decrease simultaneously after this point. The exact reason for this performance cannot be determined. Possible reasons for this might be the supply of nutriments, aeration problems or the insufficient ability of the cells to maintain their metabolism under conditions of anaerobic respiration. As a constant power output is necessary for generation of significant polarization and power curves, the temporal process of power, respectively the average power output, was used to characterize different BioBricks.
Because of the identical cultivation conditions, using two identical MFCs with equivalent cell numbers in a temperature stabilized cultivation chamber and synchronized aeration with nitrogen, the visible difference shown in Figure 36 has to be a result of the BioBrick inserted in the OprF expressing strain. The expression of the OprF protein leads to a higher power output of nearly 500 µW for a 200 Ω resistance, while the KRX strain reaches only 150 µW.
Looking at the measurement curves presented in Figure 36 a distinct fluctuation of the calculated power values becomes visible. However this fact can be explained when considering Figure 37. It shows a small field of view of the voltage values, which were recorded to calculate the power values presented in Figure 36.
Figure 37: Illustration of a small segment of the cultivation, shown in Figure 36 with interrupted axes, to underline the characteristic course of voltage course, caused by the aeration of the anode chamber.
It is apparent, that the fluctuation is nearly identical for both voltage values. A closer look at the different parameters reveals, that this is caused by the aeration of the anode chamber with nitrogen. The periodic aeration intervals correspond directly with the variation of measurements values. Because"

TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," This might be a good indicator for the confidence athletes would put into these therapies.
We believed people are generally in favor of very strict doping control, since doping is a word we associate immediately with something that should be prohibited.
Indeed, the majority is in favor of strict doping control maintenance. In The Netherlands almost 90% wants to maintain very strict doping controls and in China 70% wants this.
We hypothesized that people generally don’t think gene doping could make sports fairer.
We thought people would naturally reject this and tried to challenge them in the debate before, comparing it to the natural unfairness inherent to gene distribution. In China 13% believes gene doping can make sports fairer. In The Netherlands 11.2% thinks the same, which is what we expected.
We thought that people think gene doping should also be accessible to athletes to avoid large discrepancies between athletes and the rest of society.
In The Netherlands however, 66.5% thinks gene doping in sports should then still stay prohibited. Thus, most likely our detection method will have a market for many years to come.
Reducing survey response effects
Firstly, we were aware of a threat for endorsement effects. Endorsement effects are effects of expected preference that influence the respondents. Of course we explain who we are and that we are developing a detection method for gene doping. Nevertheless, during the discussions we actively kept an open mind on the topic and challenged people to think out of the box, adopting a neutral position ourselves by challenging the future of our method. We would not elaborate on our personal opinions before handing out the survey. On top of this, we hoped to circumvent any reference effects by having fully anonymous surveys that did not ask for any classification that could be associated with answer preferences. Then there often is the problem of question order effects, which we addressed by rephrasing several questions at different points of the survey. In the athlete survey we on top of this evaded the word “doping” to circumvent any bias that is directly inherent to this word. Instead we used words as genetic alterations and gene editing, which generally have less strong negative feelings attached to them.
The trains and public transport locations were chosen to reduce nonresponses and to have a highly representative population. Subsequently, we started off our surveys with several clear hypotheses and had 181 respondents in the Netherlands and 126 respondents in China.

Introduction
The microbiology team aims to identify wine stain degrading microorganisms.
Basing this bioremediation-inspired approach on the two following articles:
Bioremediation of phenol by alkaliphilic bacteria isolated from alkaline lake of Lonar, India
P.P. Kanekar, S.S. Sarnaik and A.S. Kelkar. Journal of applied microbiology supplement 1999.
Bacteria Subsisting on Antibiotics
Gautam Dantas,  Morten O. A. Sommer,  Rantimi D. Oluwasegun, George M. Church. Science2012
We hypothesize that these microorganisms could be preferably discovered in vineyard soil samples.
Indeed, it is highly probable that a rich-anthocyanin environment such as a vineyard, would host microbes with the desired degradation skills. In addition, the chance to find a microbe able to digest efficiently a wine stain, with its proper anthocyanin composition, in terms of anthocyanin diversity, and abundance, is theoretically increased.
To ensure the widest microorganisms diversity, we used soil samples from all around the world (Australia, Spain, Namibia, France, Croatia), particularly through collaboration with different iGEM teams.        This bacteria identification was based on two different approaches:
We are creating a bacterial database. It implies culture of the bacteria on different selective and non-selective media, and characterization of the strains. This identification was managed through 16s rRNA PCR, known as the most common housekeeping genetic marker in bacteria. At the end, we would test the database directly on fabrics stained with wine, or only anthocyanin, looking for color degradation. We also plan to build a phylogenetic tree based on our database that would help us understanding how related are the species able to degrade anthocyanin.
The main advantage here is to select"

We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small distances, so some currents are present. Bacteria and beads were left together for ~30mins to allow time for adhesion. No movement has yet been seen when the bacteria and beads are not left to adhere. We will look again at this, as we may have not previously looked closely enough (photographing over a time course of a few minutes).

Circles represent position at 0 mins, one colour for each bead. For example, the bead that starts in red circle    moves down and right, while that in the yellow circle moves left.
Chemotaxis assay (Yu, H.S. et al. (1997) FEMS Microbiology Letters, 156, 265-269.) has not worked so far. Currents can be seen flowing from the aspartate plug, pushing bacteria away. The focus of this week will be on getting this fixed, with a view to combining chemotaxis and the ability to move beads, allowing us to move beads in a particular direction.
The GRN for switching on the chemotactic response by binding to a bead, and signaling to nearby bacteria that a particle is in the vicinity, is almost finalised.

Glasgow,2015,Team:Glasgow#AzureA_-_-_TEXT.html," of Azure A was a change of colour not normally seen in use of the kit; after addition of yellow Buffer QG for the fragment melting stage the colour changes to green, due to the interaction of the blue and yellow dyes in the gel fragment and QG respectively. N.B. This is not the same erroneous colour change that is warned about in the protocol due to issues with pH.
Figure 6: The inconsequential colour change observed after addition of Buffer QG from the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.
Comparison of Azure A staining to Ethidium Bromide staining
We attempted to demonstrate the DNA staining sensitivity of Azure A and Ethidium bromide through a repeatable, directly comparable experimental protocol. iGEM transformation efficiency control DNA (J04450 (RFP) in pSB1C3) was transformed into chemically competent DH5a cells, and then a resulting transformant colony was inoculated into a 10ml overnight culture. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 4.5ml of an overnight culture following the standard QIAGEN “QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit” protocol.From the resulting J04450.pSB1C3 miniprep a 1/100 dilution was created and  OD260 was measured in a spectrophotometer to determine the DNA concentration. DNA concentration of the miniprep DNA was calculated to be ~285ng/ul from the spectrophotometer reading. Restriction digests were set up with EcoRI-HF enzyme and an “uncut”control Serial dilutions of the cut and uncut DNAwere made  in order to get a range of known DNA concentrations to load onto two gels; 1. Stained with Ethidium bromide and imaged in a Bio-rad Gel Doc XR imager, 2. Stained with Azure A (destained repeatedly over 2 hours) and imaged on a standard office scanner between two sheets of acetate. The results (Fig 7 & 8 below) show that Ethidium bromide could resolve bands of DNA as low as 2ng, whereas with Azure A band with ~17ng of DNA was the lowest resolvable on an office scanner after 3 hours of destaining.
Figures 7 & 8: 1% Agarose gels loaded with an identical dilution series of prepared DNA of known concentration; one gel stained with Azure A and one gel stained with Ethidium bromide (For EtBr staining method see: Protocols)

The transformed colonies took over 24 hours to grow - something unusual for this strain but something Ashlee had observed since after she inserted the HMF pathway and attempted to insert dCas9. We picked six colonies for overnight growth to do more cloning tomorrow.
Design of GFPs continues as Clay works on program to optimize genes. Question asked: which GFP should be optimized? GFP mut3b and superfolder GFP both present advantages and disadvantages. Met with Chiam Yu to discuss effects of codon optimization on translation. Acquired data from previous codon optimization project, which will serve as the basis for our fast/slow codon optimization.

Memorial Day Weekend? How about lab cloning weekend! Only one of the 5 terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 ligation colonies grew. Ashlee conducted plasmid preparation of the terminator/HMF/pSEVA251 vector and digested this (the backbone) and the dCas9 system (the insert) with restriction enzymes AatII and AflII.
More RBS library calculations run. Problem: since TIR is dependent on the first 60 bp of a coding sequence and our variant GFPs will differ in this region, how can we ensure that an accurate library is developed?
Sunday, May 25, 2014
The 5 colonies still did not grow. Ashlee prepared a gel and ran the dCas9 and backbone digestions and gel purified them. Colonies had not been growing well for Ashlee in the latter half of the semester as the plasmid size increased above 12 kb, so a new strategy would have to be pursued.

Monday, May 26, 2014
Due to a string of failed clonings with the broadhost vector pSEVA251 and the large inserts, new designs are evaluated! Instead of creating a plasmid with the HMF pathway (7.5 kb) and dCas9 system (5.5 kb), we shall add the HMF pathway and dCas9 to the P. putida genome using homologous recombination.

Activity Analysis of BHAL
Initial activity tests of purified fractions
The resulting fractions of the cultivation and purification of BHAL (fraction 1 to 5) were analysed with activity tests. After rebuffering into deionized H2O and incubation with 0.4 mM CuCl2 for 2 hours, the samples were measured with 140 µL sample, 0.1 mM ABTS, 100 mM sodium acetate buffer to a final volume of 200 µL. The change in optical density was measured at 420 nm, reporting the oxidation of ABTS for 5 hours at 25°C. An increase in ABTSox can be seen (Figure 5), indicating produced BHAL laccase in each fraction. Fraction 2 shows the highest amount of ABTSox (55%) reaching saturation after 3 hours. Similar to BPUL laccase, BHAL is capable to reach saturation after 3 hours with approximately oxidizing 55% of the supplied ABTS. Therefore BHAL is going to be characterized further.
Figure 5: Activity test of BHAL fractions after purification. Reaction setup includes 140 µL fraction sample (CuCl2 incubated), 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium actetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL. Measurements were done at 25°C and over a time period of 5 hours. Each fraction shows activity, especially fraction 2, which therefore contains most BHAL laccase. (n=4)
Since Regionals: Initial activity tests of purified fractions
Different fractions of the purification of a new cultivation since the Regional Jamborees in Amsterdam were tested regarding their activity of the produced BHAL. Before and after re-buffering the protein concentration was determined. The initial activity tests were done in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) with 0.1 mM ABTS at 25 °C. The protein amount was adjusted in each sample for a comparison. One distinct fraction showed the highest activity: fraction 5% 3 (Fig. 6). The contained laccase amount was calculated by assuming that the most active fraction contains 90 % laccase. This leads to a BHAL concentration of 10,9 ng mL-1.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportBiosafetyBiosecurity_-_-_TEXT.html," in the perspective of the “rejection of novelty”. The Synbiosafe report wonders about reliance on new protocols in order to answer to the new risks when some people say that nothing is new in synthetic biology, referring to risks in life science in general. The European initiative retaliates to those critics, underlining the contradiction of their purpose : how can we promote such “novelties” in synthetic biology and, in the same time, claim that nothing new is happening about risks?
Discourses we are about to analyze, in the preventive dynamic of the ethical reflexion, have to be thought of in the stages upstream of the incident and challenged to find “efficient answers” even if problems are not yet present to us.
How to evaluate risks?
As already mentioned, risk evaluation seems to be a necessary preliminary step to any satisfying ethical reflexion. Are we able to understand the stakes? Through what means and what formulations?
One of the new ways to perceive ethical stakes can be find in the TU Delft ethical report, by mathematizing the analysis of the risks.
« When making a decision, like the decision whether or not to use Synthetic Biology in an application, one balances the risks against the benefits. But is actually meant by “risk” isn’t always clear. Textbooks state that the Risk is the magnitude of the Hazard when it takes place, multiplied by the Frequency in which these hazards actually occur (R = H * F). These risks are partially factual risks, which can be scientifically assessed, like assessing the chance that an organism will share DNA with surrounding organisms upon deliberate release into the environment. There are also virtual risks, like exploring the probability of creating a biological weapon with open source BioBricks. When the future impact of a certain decision, like in the case of using Synthetic Biology in increasing levels of artificialness, risk assessment actually becomes risk perception: the response of the public, NGOs or consumers are unknown, as well as the scientific possibilities and application areas. If the risk is “low enough” (and one has to wonder who decides that), a certain action can be justified. Some would calculate the Justification of a decision as the Impact of something going well, times the Chance of it going well, minus the actual risk (J = I * C – H * F). »
That pragmatical perspective create a balance between possible risks and benefits of an application, putting that balance in the moment of the design of that application. After that demonstration, the author of the report has to concede its limits, mainly in the arbitrary choice of the variables. Degrees of certainty and strategical variability in"

There could be several explanations for the failure of this experiment. Firstly, it was the first try, meaning that, due to lack of experience, many errors could have been made during the experiment and the procedure was not optimized. Second, there are many bands on the gel, meaning that the sample was impure and hence the purification was improper. Due to time constraints, we could unfortunately not repeat the experiment to avoid the mistakes made during the first try.
Hypothesis 7: Increased expression of sialidase due to increased osmotic pressure, using a mucin concentration gradient
To further connect the parts of our project, we aimed to express sialidase with our OmpR responsive promoter in a mucin concentration gradient. However, due to time constraints we were unable to perform this experiment.

Collaboration with NCTU_Formosa
Since we are a fairly new iGEM team, we are not familiar with the details about iGEM competition. Therefore we turned to NCTU_Formosa, who hosted this meetup on Aug 24th, during which we took turns presented our project, gave each other feedbacks             and suggestions. NCTU_Formosa is especially very helpful on our wiki page. As almost all of our team members are in biology background, building wiki page is truly a huge challenge for us. In this meeting, NCTU_Formosa spent a lot of time teaching and troubleshooting our problem on building wiki pages (Fig. 1), for which they prepared a 2-hour-course containing content list below. This is truly a very successful and helpful collaboration. After the meetup, NCTU_Formosa stayed in contac with us by messenger to further assist us with constructing wiki page.
Team NCTU_Formosa gave us a tutorial about html. During the tutorial, we learned:
1. Basic tags and elements for html
2. Image scale and website format adjustment
3. Styling html with CSS and JavaScript
4. Conversion of websites in PC and mobile version
Fig. 1. NCTU_Formosa taught us building wiki pages.
Thanks to NCTU­_Formosa’s guide, discussion and their generosity to assist our problems through messages after the meetup. We both learned a lot from each other.
