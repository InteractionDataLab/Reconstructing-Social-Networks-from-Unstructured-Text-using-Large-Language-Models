SZU-China,2018,Team:SZU-China#InterLab_-_-_TEXT.html," according to the requirements of Measurement Committee, we measured the fluorescence data of E. coli strain DH5-alpha and obtained some relatively precise data. To be brief, we succeeded in reducing lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs).
Feedback
In the protocol: Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E.coli cultures——Step 1: Starting Sample Preparation——2. Dilute your overnight culture to OD600...——Do This in triplicate for each culture , I think that should be added one more friendly reminder. That is, all cultures should be freezed in the ice in case the E.coli grows up quickly and influences the results of Step 3: CFU/mL/OD Calculation Instructions, in which we should have obtained a good data such as 1250, 125, 12, but acutually we had got some bad data like 1150, 988, 455 at the first measurement."

Team:Sheffield/8 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 8th July - Meeting with Qaiser in the morning about the meeting in the afternoon. Unfortunately we couldn't do any more labs, as we're missing the DH5-alpha strain, but we had a funny email from Kate to lighten our moods. It read:
Hi all,
Hope you had a good gay yesterday - I'm still ploughing away with this work which I have to hand in tomorrow, but will be there tomorrow fingers crossed!
Hope it's all going good...
Kate
Note the spelling mistake. Yes, we are immature for laughing.
We worked through lunch ordering parts and plasmids. As we have not yet found the CqsA plasmid that 2008 used, we ordered another sample from the Bonnie Bassler institute, in the hope they'll once again be kind enough to supply us again. At 2pm we met with one of our microbial systems experts, Professor Jeff Green to talk about our idea and whether everything makes sense. He confirmed everything seems in order, but also liked our idea of trying the system two ways.
We should probably record how far the planning has gone - so here goes: Plan BarA is a sensory histidine kinase that sits in the E.coli cell membrane. CqsS is a cholera sensory histidine kinase, which detecs cholera autoinducers (quorum sensing molecules secreted extracellularly). We want to swap the outside sensory domain of the BarA protein with the outside domain with CqsS, then put the recombined BarA gene (with CqsS extracellular domain) into a high copy plasmid.
Meanwhile, we want to put a visible reporter, one of Cambridge's vibrantly coloured E. chromi protiens into the operon affected by the BarA internal kinase mechanism. This will be made in a BarA knockout strain (which we've ordered and hope to receive soon).
The alternative, which we will also give a go, is transforming the whole cholera CqsS system into E.coli, again with a visible reporter downstream.
When we arrived back from the meeting, productivity took a gradual decline and instead we finished the day discussing music and listening to Rhianna on youtube.

Alkane Metabolism Model
ASS enzymatic reaction model
Formation of alkylsuccinate is the first step of alkane metabolism. The enzyme involved was reported as alkylsuccinate synthase[1].
 
The overall enzymatic reaction:
The mechanism of this enzymatic reaction includes three main steps, H-abstraction, fumarate addition and thiyl radical regeneration [2]. This model used n-butane as the modeled chemical and we assumed the general n-alkane will follow similar reaction mechanism. Each reaction was treated as a sub-mechanism consisting of 3 steps, reactant complex (RC) formation, transition state (TS) crossing and product separation. The following are the rate constants involved in the sub-mechanism
 
The H-abstraction step (1) are modelled as,
The fumarate addition step (2) are modelled as,
The thiyl radical regeneration step (3) are modelled as,
Assume
(1)   The system is in a closed homogeneous batch reactor with infinite capacity
(2)   The reaction proceeds until final alkane concentration is negligible
(3)   Each step of the mechanism follows the Law of mass action
The reaction rates of each component are modelled as a system of ODE
Assume pseudo-steady state for the enzyme and intermediates, such that
Figure 3. Alkane degradation rate catalyzed by alkylsuccinate synthase
 
Discussion
From this ASS enzymatic model, we obtained specific pseudo rate constant with respect to alkane equals to 2.48 X 10-5s-1
while we noticed that hexane reaction flux in shewanella is 6.04 X 10-7 mmol/gDW-h
from the FBA model.The slower prediction in the FBA model might due to limited transport rate of large alkane molecule into the cell.
Assume in 1 L batch reactor and general cell density for one unit of OD600 is 0.3 gDW/L, the hexane uptake rate is estimated to be by the following"

Procedure:
Streak Escherichia coli DH5α cells onto LB-agar plate with no antibiotics and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Pick one colony and place it in a 50 mL tube with 20 mL LB medium. Incubate overnight on a shaker at 37°C and 350 rpm.
Add 250 ml of LB medium to a flask and add the overnight culture until an OD600 of 0.1 is reached.
Place the flask on a shaker at 37°C, 350 rpm until an OD600 between 0.4-0.6 is reached.
Transfer the diluted culture to 50 mL tubes.
After this step, the cells must be kept at 4°C at all times. Place the cells on ice for 15 minutes.
Cool the centrifuge to 4°C.
Centrifuge the tubes for 10 min at 8000g at 4°C.
Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellets with 10 mL cold sterile water by pipetting. Add the rest of the water to a total volume of 50 mL.
Centrifuge a second time for 10 min at 8000g at 4°C.
Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellets with 10 mL cold sterile water by pipetting. Add the rest of the water to a total volume of 50 mL.
Centrifuge a third time for 10 min at 8000g rpm at 4°C.

Overview
This year, our project has focused on the cardiovascular health issues, and our human practice has made great contributions to integrate laboratory work with community practice. We interviewed medical staff and patients to learn about the current clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases. It helped us to improve the design our project to meet translational needs. Also, we conducted detailed data analysis for past iGEM projects, and found that cardiovascular area was under-studied compared to other areas in the Health & Medicine track, i.e. antibiotics. We hope this area could be promoted by our work. Moreover, we spent time in communicating with a wide audience of iGEMers, cardiovascular experts, legal specialists and local residents to promote the healthy lifestyle of cardiovascular prevention, security of gene technology and knowledge of synthetic biology. All our HP work emphasized the social responsibilities of scientific staff, letting scientific project exert real impact on the society.

Beyond the Bench and Back to the Bench
We have spared no efforts to connect our human practice with laboratory work. We tried to make our human practice run through the experiments. Firstly, we searched and read plenty of papers, reports and past iGEM projects and analyzed the data we gathered. Secondly, we interviewed the doctors about present cardiovascular treatment and asked for advice of project design. After that, we had the first team seminar to talk about talent training and attended an important conference to present our initial idea and got lots of helpful and instructive feedbacks. After improvement, we implemented experiments and gained preliminary results. And then we had a dialogue with doctors to show the results and had the second team seminar to discuss how we can connect the modeling with our experiment. With abundant suggestions, we polished our project design again and gained more positive results which made us excited. Next, we made great contributions to promote the idea of gene therapy based on synthetic biology to those who are concerned about our project. We tried our best to have a dialogue with patients and discover their real living condition, and we introduce our new method of synthetic biology to acquire their precious thoughts and suggestions.

We ran the gel with our 19(!) digestions from yesterday and got very pretty results. So, our ligation using 2A assembly (finally) worked.

But we have the feeling that we are getting there...
Mind the Gut promoters
Yesterday we got new backbones with Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance. So now we can finally clone the promoters Gad, Gad+RBS and PyeaR into these backbones and start assembling them with effectors. Today we started this process by digesting the backbones, a small but important step which we forgot to do last time,and the promoters with EcoRI and SpeI.

The colonies of the promoters grew well, we got colonies on all three plates and they all showed green fluorescence! Hurray! So we picked three colonies from each plate to make glycerol stocks which we are going to use for the final step which is making liquid cultures that we are going to use for measurements. Hopefully, we can finish the Interlabstudy next week.

Harvard_BioDesign,2015,Team:Harvard BioDesign#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," tested in the development of traditional small molecule cancer therapeutics. Thus, we must devise tests and assays which are relevant to the specific therapeutic mechanism of BactoGrip for preclinical trials.
Finally, Dr. Sonis mentioned that we should consider whether microbial therapeutics could have deleterious consequences in immunocompromised cancer patients. He suggested that pre-clinical trials should explicitly test the therapeutic on immunocompromised mice, considering that cancer patients often have compromised immune systems. To this end, we incorporated his feedback and researched other candidate chassis organisms that would be less immunogenic compared to E. coli K12 from our proof-of-concept assays. We realized that E. coli Nissile has be used as a probiotic and is thus a more desirable chassis for our therapeutic. We transformed our system into this strain and determined that our BactoGrip pili system is compatible with the strain. In future assays, we will continue testing BactoGrip adhesion using E. coli Nissile cells. By incorporating Dr. Sonis’s feedback about immunology of microbial therapeutics in our system, we have taken the first steps to translating BactoGrip from the lab into people.
Public acceptance of microbial-based oncological therapies
We asked Dr. Jerome Ritz, the Executive Director at the Connell O'Reilly Cell Manipulation and Gene Transfer Laboratory in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, about whether he thought our microbial cancer therapeutic would be welcomed by patients at his practice. He emphasized that while there is understandably public concern over introducing engineered E. coli into the gut microbiome, we can assuage these concerns through showing safety of our product in preclinical and clinical trials, and ultimately showing that microbial therapeutics work. Dr . Ritz said that patients he encounters generally receive experimental treatments positively and are focussed primarily on whether the therapy can help them overcome their disease. We realized that the public is already aware of how controlling their gut microbiome can have positive health impacts with stories in the popular media such as using “ poop pills ” to restore healthy gut microflora. He told us that our concept therapy is “an innovative approach,” and that we should really strive to continue development of such unique therapeutics. From this conversations, we are confident that our system could achieve widespread public acceptance, but that this is contingent on showing efficacy and addressing other safety concerns around synthetic microorganisms.
Conclusions, experts informing our design, and next steps
From our discussion with experts in academia and private enterprise, we learned that BactoGrip therapeutics are worth pursuing as a cancer treatment"

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Project Introduction_-_-_TEXT.html," et al. |[11] built scalable  timers in yeast from a library of promoters of different strength. For systems to behave predictably, it is an obvious requirement to have well-characterized parts and devices at hand. A very high standard for device characterization has been proposed [12] , but most registry entries remain uncharacterized.
The majority of the teams uses E. coli as chassis. Concerning eukaryotes within the iGEM competition most projects focused on yeast as chassis. There are very few teams which actually worked with mammalian cells. One of them was the Slovenia team of 2006 whose chassis was the human embryonal kidney cell line HEK293. Apart from iGEM there are a few labs that are concerned with synthetic biology in mammals. Research was focused on regulatory cascades, epigenetic toggle switches and even entire ecosystems with synthetic intra- and interspecies crosstalk [13] . However, no systematic approaches to Synthetic Mammalian Biology (SMB) exists, especially in the iGEM community. SMB therefore requires the accomplishment of a variety of tasks that have successfully been approached in bacteria, such as promoter measurement [5] , the definition of mature cloning standard and, finally, the creation of an encompassing collection of parts and devices. All in all, SMB is a new and open field. The potential applications of SMB are manifold and include virotherapy to disease [19] and drug development [20] .
We decided to approach some of the most pressing issues of SMB systematically and, wherever possible, in analogy to the well-accepted  work that was done in bacteria. We analyzed all cloning standards proposed so far [14] and found Tom Knight's BB_2 proposal to be the most mature. Therefore, we suggest do make it commonly used in SMB. We adopt the defining publication of promoter measurement in bacteria [5] to mammalian cells by applying state-of-the art promoter measurement techniques [15] . Recognizing gene regulation as a most central issue in SMB, we reviewed literature on the design and production of synthetic promoters( [16] , [17] , [18] ) and were inspired to the development of two entirely novel procedures - one for the design , one for the synthesis of promoters.

Abstract
Audiogenetics is a useful tool for high-efficiency cell regulation. Compared to chemical genetics, it stimulates cells with better precision and less toxicity. Furthermore, signals are conveyed to target cells with little delay, leading to a shorter response time. To achieve our goal of audiogenetics, membrane mechanosensitive channels (TRPC5 and Piezo) are chosen as receptors. Fluorescent calcium indicator (R-GECO) is employed to indicate cytoplasmic calcium level. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and YFP are used as downstream indicators to quantify the regulatory abilities. Microfluidic channels are also utilized in the pre-study in which shear stress, similar to sound waves, is applied on cell surface as signal input to explore the basic parameters. A sound generator is constructed to test whether sound can trigger the channels as expected. Additionally, we use directed evolution to improve channels' selectivity for specific sound frequency and their sensitivity to sound of lower intensity.

I'm HongYuan (Fred) Fan from The Winchendon School. As a dry group member, I focused on the human practices such as social research, publicity work, and team website, almost all the work except for experiment. iGEM was a brand new experience for me. I had some lessons before the experiment started and participated in the discussion, and later I joined the dry group and deal with the work mostly concerning Human Practice. I also went to the laboratory on my free time to help other team members, as well as improving the understanding of our topic. This experience teaches me how to do better on social research and write webpages. I expect to have a fun experience on the final competition!

In the programmable lifespan timer, we will knock out the mating gene of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains so that they will not be able to recombine or render the controlled lifespan useless.
Further Comments
In the Programmable Lifespan Timer, we have been creating knockout cassettes for a number of genes that involve telomere length and telomerase regulation. For the De Novo Synthesizer, we have been proving the function of TdT and setting the protocols for specific synthesis of DNA in vitro. In our binary plasmid system we are using E. coli K-12 strains as the chassis organism, along with reporter genes that do not confer any known toxicity.

What is synthetic biology
What’s there better than asking those successfully working in synthetic biology for many years?
We embarked on realizing a video project that, for the first time, collected the opinions of renowned synthetic biologists on crucial questions about the field they (and we) work in. It has been challenging to recruit them for this project, but eventually we managed to convince several of them to share with us their thoughts on synthetic biology.
The project was structured this way: we sent personalized emails to invite very famous synthetic biologists to participate in the video project. We sent them a list of questions (Table 1) from which to choose, and asked them to film themselves while replying to one of these questions.
Can you define synthetic biology?
How does synthetic biology impact society?
What has been the biggest struggle you have had working on synthetic biology ?
Throughout the years how did your opinion on synthetic biology change? Did you accomplish something that you thought would never be possible ?
What is the biggest risk associated to synthetic biology?
Which is the best way in your opinion to educate the new generations in synthetic biology?
How far is a future where synthetic biology applications are part of everyday life?
What would you say to convince a student to undertake studies in synthetic biology?
What are the qualities that distinguish a synthetic biologist from other scientists?

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," introducing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase which oxidises hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid into E. coli. Both pathways figure to remove excessive ammonia and facilitate fish to live healthily in aquaculture water.
We employed a two-step model to describe and analyze our sensor system. In the first model, the cell growth curve is fitted with Baranyi   Roberts model by applying Runge-Kutta method and PSO algorithm. This gives a rather effective description of cell growth despite of random noises. In the second model, we studied the fluorescence intensity generated by unit cells. We resolved the evolving law of our TCS system into a differential equation by Markov methods,the general behaviors of which was solved through dynamic system analysis. The total flourescence intensity is the product of the two variable that we studied, therefore we are able to validate the effectiveness of our methodologies in hardware design.
Fish provide us with abundant proteins, which is a main reason for its consumption. Yet we might not notice that in aquaculture water, ammonia concentration is always high due to fish excretion and decomposition of organics in sediment. In pond water, this is particularly deteriorated because of a lack of fresh water, which leads to continuous accumulation of excessive ammonia. High ammonia concentration harms aquaculture creatures in a variety of ways. With its high lipid solubility, it readily diffuses through cell membranes. Once it enters  the central nervous system and disrupts the homeostasis by disturbing the equilibrium between α-Ketoglutaric acid and glutamate, severe consequences can occur, including death. Accumulation of ammonia can cause lowered growth rate and reduced disease resistance as well as poor feed conversion. If exposed to continuous high-ammonia stress, fish will be more susceptible to bacterial infections, and eventually succumb to disease or starvation. Ammonia can also affect the reproduction system of aquatic organisms and ultimately affect the total output. Thus, a resolution to high ammonia threat is in urgent need.
This year, our project aims to resolve this problem by creating a sensitive ammonia sensor and an efficient ammonia utilizer to secure healthy living of fish.
Design
To facilitate reliable and convenient judgement of ammonia concentration in aquaculture water, we invented a bacterial ammonia sensor. Considering the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium, ammonia concentration can be deduced from ammonium concentration under specific pH and temperature [1] . Therefore, we exploited endogenous nitrogen metabolism regulation system of E. coli.
In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two"

According to encyclopaedia algae have wide strand from unicellular to multicellular and they are photosynthetic. They are really good species to study on to produce biodiesel as a lot of people do. We choose working on algae for four major reasons:
Firstly; getting protein from algae is cheap and they can grow in wide area from soil to pink water. When we added our plasmid backbone to biobrick database other group can use it to get protein easily and amount also is a major problem for getting it from prokaryotes to clinical usage.| Secondly; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a common used model organism and it is easy to handle. With last decades people are really condense studying on it. This organism can also grow in dark with adding acetate as a source of carbon.
Thirdly; trinitrotoluene is a toxic material for the environment. After Edinburgh Team project we recognise it could be improved by this way. We have chosen NfsI gene as a nitroreductase which isolated from Enterobacter cloacae.  Efficiency of NfsI gene for TNT reduction is good to accept to work with it.
And lastly; losing a family member because of mine is enough reason to put effort on it. We could have been a child of a dead man. Reality is that hundreds of thousands of people have been injured or killed by anti-personnel landmines. In Afghanistan, 350,000–500,000 have been killed or injured due to landmine explosions, and more occur daily. In Angola, there are approximately 26,000 amputees, and in Cambodia 30,000.

Project description
The development of sensitive and selective biosensors is an important topic in synthetic biology . Biosensors can be used in a wide range of applications - from the detection of toxic compounds in the environment up to clinical diagnostics. Because cells have to sense their surroundings, there are a lot of natural systems that can be used as biosensors. Unfortunately, cellular biosensors often have interfering properties that preclude any practical application. Common problems are the limited use outside the laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because of the usage of living cells and the appearance of undesired signals induced by endogenous metabolic pathways.
To solve these problems, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2011 aims at developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. Bisphenol A is a harmful substance which is used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA, it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by an NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon . Both enzymes are fused to S-layer proteins which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and are attached to the surface of beads. By providing these nanobiotechnological building blocks the system is expandable to other applications.
An overview of our project is shown in Figure 1. The background and the state of the art of each subproject is described below this figure . To have a quick insight of what is happining in our"

SILVER
Experimentally validated the expected behavior of 4 RiboTALe constructs, parts BBa_K1212011-BBa_K1212016. Please refer to the Parts page
Provided the characterization data for these parts on the 'Main Page' section of those parts' Registry entries
Submitted these parts to the iGEM Parts Registry
We have discussed any safety risks associated with our project and the steps we took to mitigate those risks on the Safety page of this wiki
GOLD
We have improved two existing parts, the pSB3K3 backbone as well as part BBa_K750000 (GFP under the regulation of pBAD and with an LVA degradation tag) by subjecting them to site directed mutagenesis in order to make them Golden Gate Assembly compatible. That is, we removed internal BsaI restriction sites. We created pages for the new parts, BBa_K1212002 and BBa_K1212006 , respectively, and have submitted them to the Registry. We also altered the expression behavior of five of the constitutive Anderson promoters ( BBa_J23100 , J23101 , BBa_J23105 , BBa_J23106 , BBa_J23109 ). By placing a TAL binding site downstream of each promoter, we were able to make each constitutive promoter repressible by our TALE in the presence of theophylline and arabinose. See BBa_K1212021 , BBa_K1212022 , BBa_K1212023 , BBa_K1212024 , and BBa_K1212025 for more details.
We hosted a midsummer regional iGEM meetup, which was attended by the teams from Berkeley , Stanford-Brown , and UC San Francisco . During this meetup we introduced and held an open discussion about our respective projects, asking key"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,". Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

iGEM is about making teams of students making synthetic biology projects. We encourage teams to work with parts and build biological devices in the lab. But we are inclusive and want all teams to work on many other types of problems in synbio. Robotic assembly, microfluidics, low cost equipment and measurement hardware are all areas ripe for innovation in synbio.
Teams who are interested in working with hardware as a side project are encouraged to apply for the hardware award.

Project Summary
Abstract will go here....
Why is this important?
If we can determine the genes essential to the function of the pathway responsible for catabolizing furfural and HMF toxins, we can in principle engineer any bacterium to have these genes. Engineering E. coli to have the HMF pathway will allow this well-studied, easily manipulated and fast-growing bacterium to live in the presence of toxins released during biomass pretreatment, and even use furfural and HMF toxins as fuel!
Therefore, industry and academic researchers can subject biomass to more intense pretreatment processes – which release more toxins. Engineered bacteria will be able to live in the presence of these toxins and more sugars will be available for hydrolysis and fermentation, increasing biofuel yields from the same initial amount of biomass.
Background
Greenhouse gas emissions and dwindling fossil fuel reserves have pushed developed countries like the United States to explore renewable fuel sources. “Biofuels” are an attractive sustainable energy technology because they can be produced from plant biomass, which includes wood, grasses, and agricultural waste. Bioethanol and biodiesel can be blended or used as automobile fuel, among other uses. One way to produce biofuels from biomass is by using bacteria to ferment the sugars in plant matter"

In the swarm plates that are presented in figure 1, only four of the positive controls (strain 4) showed signs of motility. In 1D, strain no. 2 is swarming. This was the only detected instance of swarming for these fifteen swarm plate assays (three replicates of assays for five different strains). Based on the absence of swarming in the positive controls, we concluded that the swarm plate assay was not reliable.
To improve the performance of the swarm plate assay, we changed the culturing conditions to prevent the swarm plates from drying out. Swarm plates were directly inoculated from restreaks or from frozen stocks, wrapped in parafilm and then incubated at room temperature for two days. The results of these extra motility plates are presented in figure 2.
Figure 2. Swarm plate assays performed at room temperature. Strain 1 and 2 were inoculated from restreaks, while strain 3, 4 and 5 were inoculated from frozen stocks.
The following strains are present in the figure:
1) positive control (RP437 with empty pSB1C3 plasmid) [220]
2) negative control (UU2685 with empty pSB1C3 plasmid) [216]
3) B0034_J23100-cheZ (UU2685) [170]
4) B0034_J23113-cheZ (UU2685) [171]
5) B0034_J23114-cheZ (UU2685) [172]
On all plates presented in figure 2, positive controls (strain 1) swarmed, while negative controls (strain 2) did not swarm. The altered protocol for the swarm plate assay was thus able to distinguish motile strains from non-motile strains.
Strain 3, containing a cheZ expression cassette with the J23100 promoter, swarmed all six times when it was tested, though not to the same extent as the positive control. Strain 4, containing a cheZ expression cassette with the J23113 promoter, also showed to be motile, although it only swarmed to a small extent.
The result of the strain containing the cheZ expression cassette including the J23114 promoter (strain 5) is not as clear as that of the other two constructs. The structures that"

Figure 8: CY5-labeled biotinylated nanoparticles
Figure 9: Negative control : biotinylated nanoparticles
We can see that the nanoparticles were successfully labeled. However, there were many clusters. Hence, a second image was taken (using a fluorescent microscope) after sonication which separated the nanoparticles from each other.
Figure 10: Sonicated CY5-labeled biotinylated nanoparticles
Making loaded nanoparticles :
We made two new batches of gelatin nanoparticles using the same modified two-step desolvation method. This time, we loaded them with recombinant GFP (molecular weight of ~25 kDa) and FITC-labeled dextran (molecular weight of ~150 kDa), both of which are fluorescent. The new nanoparticles have a mean diameter of about 200 nm, as shown by the DLS measurements. We tested the loading by microscopy. Though the FITC-dextran was successfully introduced into the nanoparticles, it was not the case for the recombinant GFP. It is probably due to its smaller molecular weight, which allowed it to come out of the nanoparticles. What's more, the procedure implies incubation in acetone, which denatures proteins.
Figure 11: DLS measurements of the FITC-dextran loaded nanopartciles
Figure 12: DLS measurements of the rGFP loaded nanoparticles
Figure 13: FITC-dextran loaded nanoparticles
Biotynylating loaded nanoparticles :
The FITC-dextran-loaded nanoparticles and the rGFP-loaded nanoparticles were biotinylated using the same activated biotin as for the previous nanoparticles. Biotinylation was successful, as shown by the ELISA-like assay.
Figure 14: Fluorescence measurement of the different samples used in the ELISA-like assay with FITC-Dextran loaded nanoparticles
Figure 15: Fluorescence measurement of the different samples used in the ELISA-like assay with rGFP loaded nanoparticles
We thought about making a third batch of nanoparticles, loading them with antibodies. However, we wanted to test first whether they could survive the low pH and the acetone, both of which they would have to endure during synthesis. We found that the low pH (2.5) didn't denature antibodies. However, the acetone does. Thus, what could be done is to chemically attach antibodies on the nanoparticles surface, as done with NHS-ester dye (see above). Something similar has been done"

Welcome to iGEM Göttingen
iGEM is an international competition hosted by the MIT in Boston, USA, for undergraduate students of disciplines related to molecular biology. iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine competition. One the one hand, it targets to combine aspects of education and social collaboration among undergraduate students, on the other hand, it provides a library for standardized and interchangeable parts which can be used in living systems, particularly in model organisms like E. coli. Student groups from all over the world will receive a requested kit of biological parts, also called ""biobricks"", and work over the summer on an individual research project. Every year, the ""Registry of Standard Biological Parts"" is upgraded with further biobricks by the participating iGEM teams. These biobricks will be accessible to the iGEM community in the following years in order to use these parts for their own projects.
The iGEM competition started in 2003 as a course for students of the MIT only. 2011, already"
Georgia_Tech,2012,Team:Georgia Tech#sandbox#HumanPractices#_-_-_TEXT.html," with a local high school that is in the process of forming their own iGEM team. The GT iGEM team will provide the high school with technical assistance throughout their own competition. To begin the collaboration , the GT iGEM team took a trip to Lambert High School at the request of teacher Janet Standeven to visit the Biotechnology Class and newly forming iGEM club team. Lambert High School is currently the only high school in Georgia to begin forming an iGEM team, and we were excited to assist in this process. The students were mainly Juniors and Seniors who have taken biology courses before. We spent an hour and forty minutes with each class discussing synthetic biology and quorum sensing to give them perspective on opportunities in synthetic biology and iGEM.
Quorum Sensing Activity
We started with a simple quorum sensing activity designed by Dr. Mark Styczynski to get the students up and moving. We gave each person a card with a shape and two colors, and asked them not to share their card with anyone else.
There were six cards of each shape, each with varying colors. In the first round, students could pick one person to ask what their card had on it. If the two cards had the same shape and one color matching, they became a pair. If not, they returned to their seats with no pair. In the next round, each student could ask one person about his or her card.   The pair could only ask one person as a team, but the color could match any of the colors in the group (the shapes would have to all the same). After asking their one person, they had to sit down again. Rounds repeated like this until the whole group of six was found. Prior to the start of a round, if there was a group of three, they could announce one of their colors. If there was a group of four, they could announce their shape. The numbers of singles, pairs, threes, etc. were counted after each round.
The point of this activity was to show the students that bacteria communicate with certain types of molecules, ones only certain bacteria can receive. When these bacteria that can communicate get together in large groups, they have an advantage over the single bacteria because express new genes and alter their phenotypes. The rounds were to simulate the time lapse of bacterial communication in a large population. At first, everyone was mixed up and no one was in pairs. It took several rounds for the students to form a “quorum”, enough to express new phenotypes. However, after being given the ability to broadcast their shape and color, groups"

Discovery Day- 16th June 2018
Nottingham iGEM took part in Discovery Day 2018 at the University of Nottingham! We put on a range of fun activities for kids aged 4-10 to learn more about synthetic biology and bacteria microbes!
First, the children got the opportunity to make their own plasticine microbes and put them in petri dishes! They used inspiration from our fun cuddly toy bacterium friends and produced some amazing results.
After that, both kids and adults had a go at guessing which mode of transport had the most bacteria- bus, train or plane. The answer- bus surprised a lot of people- including the adults!
Finally, everyone had a go at seeing how much bacteria was on their hands by using a special gel, then showing their hands under UV light to see how dirty their hands were. It seems that the kids had cleaner hands than most of us university students!
Overall it was an amazing day where we educated kids all about synthetic biology! The parents feedback to our team was incredibly posititve and the kids loved the activites. This was our first outreach activity and we think it was a massive success at engaging kids with iGEM and synthetic biology at such a young age!

Scientific researches and the public should not be separated; in fact, there are close interactions between them. It is hard for a product to serve human well if it is made in a closed door.
Part one: Absorb nutrients from the outside world
Many Chinese students are taught to study alone in order to avoid external disturbances, but it is better to listen to different voices when doing researches. As the proverb goes, ""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" The same is true for a bio-synthetic project. This part contains:

Interviews concerned on important application fields
Our project is mainly for academic uses. However, miRNA inhibitors’ role on medical treatment cannot be ignored. Therefore, we conducted interviews about it. Click here to see more information of the interviews.
Cooperation among groups:
At the end of August, we attended Conference of China iGEAMer Community, an idea exchange meet-up for China region. click here to see what we have done!
Part two: Bear social responsibility
Our project this year is to establish a novel approach for miRNA inhibiting, but that is not the whole picture. As an integrated project, our work has far more practical tasks and aims than just pure research:

This system has no specifity for DNA, therefore B.     subtilis can take integrate plasmid DNA, phage DNA or chromosomal     DNA. [31]
Figure 9. Natural competence of B. subtilis
Storing of spores
Bacterial spores are tough, non-reproductive structures produced     by bacteria. They are highly resistant to aging, radiation, heat     and chemical damage. Endospores formed by Bacillus subtilis could     be found viable after millions of years [32] . These properties make     them the ideal storage medium for data in DNA.
During freeze-drying water is removed from a substance to     increase the storage-life and to make shipping easier. The most     effective method for long-term storage and thus for shipping of Bacillus subtilis spores appears to be freeze-drying [33] .     Freeze-drying is commonly used for long-term storage of bacteria [34] and spores of B. subtilis. On top of the fact that spores are     highly resistant under different harsh conditions, Fairhead et al.     showed that spores of B. subtilis are very resistant to several     cycles of freeze-drying [35] . The sending process is demonstrated in Figure 10.

IIT_Delhi,2017,Team:IIT Delhi#Write Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the total DNA (DT), at any time, can be represented as –
Thus, the model of the system, based on mass action kinetics and conservation relations can be represented by
Note that in this model, we have taken the rate of change of Do and DA as well, which are DNA molecules. This is because here the DNA concentration also changes because the DNA switches states.
Now, solving this model and simulating, we get the following results -
From the above results, we can see that the time taken for achieving steady state for all the variables (A, Do, DA and B) is more or less similar, and takes about 4-5 hours. This goes against the intuition that the binding and unbinding happens faster, as compared to the production of A and B, which should take a larger time. We see that this does happen, when we run the system of equations for α = 100 nM/hr (results not shown). Thus, the time scale separations become more prominent as the value of α increases (time scale separation was further more prominent for α = 500 nM/hr).
Further, upon varying the values of k1 and k2 by 100 fold, we see the following –
In all of these plots, data1, data2 and data3 represent k1 = 0.01, 1 and 100 respectively. We see that on decreasing the value of k1, the effect on the steady state values is not significant. On the other hand, increasing k1 by 100 fold changes the steady state values, and brings down the level of B ultimately produced at steady state. This is because if k1 is high, that means that more A binds to the promoter of B, repressing it. Therefore, a lower steady state level of B is observed.

Slovenia_HS,2015,Team:Slovenia HS#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," get to work!
 
We visited the the company AlgEn, which was a unique exprence which helped us shape our ideas for our project and design the experiments better. Afterwards, we started regularly working in labs of the National Institute of Chemistry and the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different media to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different media again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for"
BostonU_HW,2018,Team:BostonU HW#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," for each flow rate was then calculated to obtain a final set of 15 empirically C values to see how they differed between flow rates. The plots below display the results of our modeling experiments
Figure 1. Plot of the average experimental droplet volume versus the predicted volume from the static model.
Figure 2. Plot of the correction factors calculate based on the experimental volumes at various flow rates against the average correction factor.
Unfortunately, these experiments did not result in a consistent correction factor that can be used across different flow rates. Instead, the correction factor on average increases across flow rates. While we observed an increase in droplet size as flow rate increased, we concluded that our current model lacks parameters that account for other physical phenomena in droplet formation and that more data was necessary to identify an empirical correction factor. However, we learned other important information to adjust the current static model. Because of this we decided to multiply the static model by a factor of 1.33 to account for the difference between average and static model.

Distance Traveled to Dispense Fluid
In order to accurately dispense the output into the desired wells, the plane needed to travel the right amount of steps depending on the well plate. Therefore we needed to calculate how many steps of the stepper motor is required to move from one well to another. Below are the steps and calculations that went into determining this:
To do so,  we first determined the distance from center of well to next center well for each microtiter plate.
Next, we measured the circumference of our pulley.
After obtaining these values, we found the distance it is possible to travel per step, and finally the steps per well. From the documentation for the NEMA-14 stepper motor, we know it steps 200 times in one revolution and has microstepping features up to 1/32 microsteps.
From there, since we know how many steps is required for 96 wells, we calculate the microtiter plates with different amounts of wells.

ESBS-Strasbourg Team
We are a student-run team from the trinational graduate school ""École supérieur de Biotechnologie Strasbourg"" (ESBS) located in the capital of Europe - Strasbourg, France. The ESBS is a joint-venture of the Universities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe in  Germany, the University of Bale in Switzerland and the University of Strasbourg  in France. Students come from all four partner universities and furthermore from  all around the three countries.
This is the second year that the ESBS-Strasbourg participates in the iGEM  competition. Our team consists of 12 students coming from different  scientific backgrounds prior to the ESBS. This will help us to deal with the  difficulties coming up during this interdisciplinary project. Our shared  education at the ESBS however enables us to communicate more easily with each  other. An overview of the people involved and our competences can be found on  the team page.

iGEM Aachen - iGEM Worcester
Research Collaboration
In the research phase of our project, there was also an exchange with other iGEM teams who had decided to work in the field of environment and water pollution. During the first Skype talks with the      iGEM Team Worcester it soon became clear that there were many overlaps between our projects.
At this time, the iGEM Team Worcester worked intensively on a biosensor system in which organisms can display the lead content in a body of water and can also absorb this lead to clean the water from heavy metals.
In the discussions we found out that both projects relate to a local problem in the region of the respective team. The question quickly arose as to whether this problem with the drainage of      drinking water is also a problem in Germany and whether American waste water is contaminated with salts as well. Because both teams had difficulties with this research, which was also due      to language barriers with German literature team Worcester needed, we opted for an investigation collaboration between our teams.
We investigated the contamination of drinking water with lead in Germany and translated, among other things, the German Drinking Water Ordinance, the government's information material to     lead"
Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a lot of data about how much money there is used for the research of malaria, but I wouldn’d be able to give you “the right answer”. In my personal opinion, I think, money on research on malaria has been at a pretty good level for a while. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation set out millenium development goals, in which malaria is one of the biggest things they wanted to tackle. They invested a lot of money in that. The biggest change we’ve seen in recent years has been a move towards novel technologies like gene drive and other genetic based technologies. There is certainly more funding, that exploded in terms of funding, not only from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation but others from this entrepreneurial groups. And also with local funding from [...] the american defence agency and they’re interested in investigation in these technologies which is quite cool.
iGEM Hamburg: What is the biggest problem about malaria? Could you give an overview of the effect of malaria on the society or the countries especially affected by this disease?
Dr. Hammond: Since the millenium developing goals in 2000 we’ve seen massive reductions in malaria because of a huge success in primarily bed nets and insecticides, which really works well. Unfortunately, I think last year was the first year that we have not seen a further reduction in the number of deaths, it actually gets worse for one year. This does not mean that the interactions are not working, because you expect some variations, but this is striking as the first year we did not see an increase in the benefits. This might point to somebodies fears that people are having that there is a growing resistance of mosquitoes to the interventions that we are developing, particularly in insecticide resistance. This is a massive problem which threatens all of the main interventions that we are using now. I think that the world health organisation prefers the strategy to try to eliminate malaria from the majority of sub-Saharian Africa within the next 15-20 years. This expectation was based on existing interventions plus an extra of 6 billion a year, which is an ortholog more that we are currently spending. That was assuring that the problem of resistance [becomes] the hell worse as it already is. And it may get worse. The money may not be there. So what we have to think about are other technologies as a solution, so that we can complement what we are doing. Not to replace them, but there are many possible technologies. We have to use as many as possible and try to find the best way to use them. On the one side, economically, but on the other hand we"
WLC-Milwaukee,2014,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Anthropology_-_-_TEXT.html,"Blood , engineered by UCLA Berkley students, which is a substitute for red blood cells. Although BactoBlood was not successful, it still provides a strong starting point for all RBC (red blood cells)-related biotechnology work hereafter.
Out of all of these advances in biotechnology, it is no small wonder that scientists are attempting to find ways of curing one of the world’s greatest issues: world hunger and malnourishment. But western attempts in other places have failed before. This puts them in a precarious situation, and thus begs the question, “How can we help indigenous people fight crop failure, without over-stepping cultural boundaries?” Culture, in its purest sense, is a staple in civilization. Civilization marks the progress of humans, be it social, economic, agricultural, etc., through a time period, and through each successive landmass. There are multiple cultures within each, which define the civilization itself.
During the Age of Exploration, the western civilization was marked by religious teaching, primitive medicine, and an uncanny thirst for knowledge—so long as the ruling classes approved it. Equally during this time, eastern civilization was marked by mostly the exact same concepts. It was their multitude of cultures that set them apart. Now, in 2014, the eastern cultures are widely conservative, clinging to the traditions of their parents, grandparents, even distant ancestors. In the west, the proverbial rules are routinely broken; tradition is largely viewed as simply a holding place for outdated ideals. For example, filial piety, first taught by Confucius, has a stronghold in modern Eastern Asian countries; it is among the greatest sins to disappoint or neglect an elder . In the west, there is nothing comparable. Elders are left in nursing homes, all but forgotten, and there are no laws to enforce care, but only to punish elderly abuse.
For now, let us put focus on Africa. Many of their traditions revolve around food; pastoralists rely on wild game for sustenance, horticulturalists will plant roots, berries, and other plants for consumption by family, and foragers will hunt game and pick berries and roots. These are methods practiced in small communities. Most Sub-Saharan African farmers are subsistence farmers , only growing enough for their families. If and when there is extra, it will be sold. But there has not been extra, not in a long time. Not even sorghum, a hardy root, has been able to withstand drought conditions without blight. The bellies of children, though they are distended, are empty.

Prepare for the competition
Experiments don't work all the time, that is not a problem if you can find out the rea-sons. The real problem is irresponsibility. Anyone who doesn't do clean up after experi-ments, writes a lousy lab logs, or commit any actions endangering the safety of the lab shouldn't be allowed to conduct experiments further.
The principle is don't make troubles and let other people to pay the price.
iGEM is not an easy job. A strong team with tight relationship is essential.As the founder you need to set an example and motivate your teammates in any way you can like your passion, your charisma and your determination. Proper incentive and resting is also im-portant.
Interaction with teammates
Each teammates has their own impression or comment to you but you should stick on your original feeling about yourself.
As a leader, you need to understand each individual's uniqueness, learn how to get along well with them and deal with all sorts of stuff. Delegate properly and make sure eve-ryone's is working in their forte.
The competition is still continuing and many things I have yet experienced. This piece of article is limited by my own experience. If it helps you in any way, I will be excited and honored. Love and peace~

Prof. Dr. Dr. Edith Huland
Founder & Managing Director of Immunservice GmbH
Medical Professional
Prof. Huland developed an inhalative interleukin-2 immunotherapy and is an international expert on the development and implementation of therapeutic and diagnostic innovations. Her impressive career comprises the responsibility as principal investigator and co-investor for various international clinical trials as well as scientific advisor for international government, university and industrial advisory boards.  Giving her immense expertise, we discussed our directed evolution approach with Prof. Huland. She was impressed about the implications that the PACE and PREDCEL technology could offer in therapeutic inventions and research. In fact, she immediately came up with many creative and innovative ideas about proteins that could be evolved to benefit therapeutic applications.
Prof. Dr. Philipp Stoellger
Theological Department
Heidelberg University
Should humanity harness the process of evolution for their own benefit? In fact, humanity is doing so since thousands of years by breeding animals and cultivating plants for their own demands. However, transferring a directed evolution approach to the laboratory could raise concerns in the general public.
We wanted to discuss our directed evolution approach with experts in the field of interdisciplinary ethics and philosophy of religion. Hence, we talked to Prof. Dr. Philipp Stoellger from the theological department of Heidelberg University. Prof. Stoellger pointed out that he, as a theologist, has no general concerns about intervening in evolution and harnessing its potential for human benefits as long as the experiments are kept under strict laboratory conditions . Nature is a natural field of cultural practices. However, ethical questions arise, if powerful and efficient techniques like PREDCEL and PACE are misused for military, economically or potentially harmful purposes or if modified organisms are released into the natural ecosystem. It is the duty of each and every scientist to reflect about the consequences of their research. Could this new discovery or invention be misused in any way? Which safety measures and precautions can be taken to prevent misuse?
To face ethical concerns about directed evolution approaches, Prof. Stoellger recommended to firmly integrate professionals from other fields into such substantial projects and proposals, like hermeneutics, ethics, theologies or even artists and politicians. This is reasonable because only an interdisciplinary group of professionals can make decisions with consequences affecting all humanity. His message to the natural sciences is: professionalize your unprofessional limits of research, and make use of professional competences where you are not competent.  That message may affect your experimental constellations, your methods and your theory of science up to the members of research groups."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," order to help our engineered bacteria accustom to the practical water condition, we collected water samples from fish ponds and analyzed the composition of the water sample. We then cultured our bacteria in the culture medium that stimulating the practical fish pond water condition.
Analyze composition of fish pond water
Beijing, China; Mumbai, India;Hangzhou, China
We received help from ICT-Mumbai and ZJU-China. We analyzed the inorganic components and the amino acid components of the fish pond water sample to help us know better about the practical water condition.
Key point
The ammonia concentration in fish pond water is actually rather low, even though it can do harm to the fish
The sensitivity of our device should be high enough to detect the fluctuation of ammonia concentration
There is not enough nutrition in the fish pond water for our bacteria to gcolumn with.
We probably need to add some culture medium into our device to breed our bacteria
What we learned from the data is of crucial value for the design of our device and sensor. Let’s make our device more sensitive and add culture medium into the device for our bacteria!
Beijing Tianjin meetup
On Oct 7th and 8th, UCAS iGEM team invited other 4 undergraduate teams and a high school team to our school and held a meet-up, including Zhejiang University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tianjin University of Science   Technology and The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China. During the two-day activity, six teams gave presentation of their project, shared ideas and opinions.
For Farmers
Publicizing knowledge of ammonia
In order to help more farmers to know the harm of ammonia pollution in ponds, we contacted with the official account of Chinese aquaculture website, and publicized our article though it. The article gained more than 4000 clicks, and fish farmers from all over the china came to share with us their problems or solutions towards ammonia pollution.
Contact with farmers and paying visits to their ponds
We visited some fish ponds around Beijing to find out their problems in dealing with excessive ammonia and other questions they may be faced with when breeding fish. They provided us with useful information and we also solved their questions about science and technology. We helped them to have better understanding of biotechnology especially the most controversial transgene technology.

We tested the cell stabilization properties of these BioBricks by drying E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that produce these proteins and measuring their viability. Apart from cell survival data, we also provided a possible improvement in their protocol. Instead of washing the cells with water, we proposed to wash with PBS. In our case, it provides a significant improvement in cell survival for 1 out of 3 BioBricks. The protocol can be found here and the results can be found in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Results of the BioBrick testing for iGEM TUDelft. We tested viability of E. coli cells with three different constructs (T4, T6 and T10). Viability was measured as viable cells per 108 cells plated.
Preservation in kaolin clay
In return, iGEM TUDelft tested another preservation method for us. We tested an easy method to dry and preserve cells: in kaolin clay. More about this experiment can be found on our demo page . TUDelft performed the same experiment for us using the same clay. This gives us more data on this procedure and feedback on the comprehensibility of the protocol we created. The protocol can be found here.
The results of this experiment performed by iGEM TUDelft were inconclusive. Either zero colonies were counted, or the plate was overgrown. However, we received valuable feedback on our cell preservation method. They used E. coli BL21(DE3) whereas we used DH5a. Since their results are inconclusive, the strain of E. coli might have an influence on the success rate of drying. Due to time constraints this could not be validated. Moreover, in their opinion this drying protocol was not easy nor practical to perform. Scraping the dried cells of the plate is a lengthy process and high concentrations of kaolin made it troublesome to distinguish colonies on the plates. From this, we conclude that our protocol is far from ideal. Although this preservation method is cheap and does not require expensive equipment, it may be more labor-intensive than expected and not as reproducible as we hoped. A next step would be to perform this experiments in different strains of E. coli and measure viability and reproducibility, as well as looking further into preservation methods. In this research, the use of Tardigrade proteins can also be taken into consideration.

Introduction
The Peking 2010 iGEM team characterized Antigen 43 (AG43) using a T7 promoter expression system in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and submitted the coding sequence with no promoter or ribosome binding site (RBS) to the parts registry (BBa_K364007). In order for AG43 to be used, BBa_K542009 was assembled to include the required regulatory elements. The pLacI promoter and RBS were added to the coding sequence for AG43.

Sedimentation by Antigen 43
E. coli DH5α cells expressing BBa_K542009 were monitored for sedimentation and compared to sedimentation of uninduced cells.
Materials and Methods
Overnight cultures E. coli DH5α containing BBa_K542009 or BBa_J04500 (blank control) were grown with the appropriate antibiotics. Three 50 mL LB cultures – BBa_J04500 (control), BBa_K542009 (induced), and BBa_K542009 (uninduced) – with the appropriate antibiotics were inoculated to an OD600 of 0.1 and incubated at 37°C with shaking.
At OD600 of 0.4-0.6, the cultures were induced (excluding one of the BBa_K542009 cultures) with IPTG to a concentration of 0.001% and growth was monitored to a final OD600 of 1. The cells were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min and the supernatant discarded. The cells were resuspended with 5 mL of 1% PBS (with 0.15 mM NaCl) and transferred into test tubes."

However, this chamber is about 100 μm deep and could grow E. coli far more than monolayer. As time goes by, the oscillation in a single colony signaling by AHL could never go back to the original baseline, and the oscillation curves have a tendency like the following graph (Fig. 3-3).
Fig. 3-3 Simulation curve for our oscillation in ""Swimming Pool""
2.Advanced ""Passage""
According to what we have discussed above, the microfluidic device should be able to provide flowing fresh media and maintain a constant bacteria population with single-cell resolution. Because ""swimming pool"" has a cell stacking problem, we designed a new passage-like device as shown below (Video 1).
Video 1
Channels and Chambers
This device is composed by two parts: the flowing channels and near 3,000 square trapping chambers, and their layout is like there are many passages with symmetry rooms distributed on both sides, so we call this array ""passage"" model. Firstly, cells are loaded from the cell port. When the loading stops, most cells would remain in channels, but if the loading cell density is dense enough, many cells would be pushed into chambers and form a monolayer of Escherichia coli growing in it. This is the time for running LB to get in. Fresh LB is loaded from the media port with Tween 20* and appropriate antibiotics. Flowing LB does not only permit a constant nutrition and exponentially growing cells for more than two days (that's the longest time we have tried), but also washes away newly generated cells to sustain a certain cell density, which is crucial for the determination of fluorescence strength.
Size
It has been stated before in the Mechanism part that most quorum sensing systems have a critical cell density requirement, so the trap size is designed neither too big nor too small to capture enough cells and allows for nutrients to permeate to every corner of the chamber.
You may also notice that the height of the chamber is extremely small, which is really demanding for the researcher's skills, but it's important for the observation. The oscillation could only be seen when the height of the chamber is in a particular range as our modeling predicted for many complicated reasons. For more details, please refer to the Modeling part.

Approximately 3 hours before the fluorescence measurements, the OD of the cultures was measured and they were diluted to OD600=0.3. After growth for the remaining three hours, growth was halted by cooling the tubes on ice, OD was measured and samples were taken from the cultures for measurement of expression levels. Samples were loaded into 96-well plates in triplicates together with blank which was IMX581 transformed with the p416-TEF1 plasmid without GFP. Fluorescence levels was measured with a BMG Labtech FLUOstar Omega plate reader. Excitation/emission wavelength was 485/520 nm.
Results
The raw data from the promoter study was corrected against OD600 of that sample, and the mean value of the negative control (cells with p416tef without GFP) was subtracted. The results are shown in Table 1. Note that the fluorescence intensity should not be compared to other studies as it strongly depends of the settings of the machine used to make the measurements. Furthermore, the levels are depending on the cultivation time, which differed between the two conditions, and the results needs to be normalized before comparison.

Heidelberg,2013,Team:Heidelberg#Project#Tag-Optimization_-_-_TEXT.html," reaction volume was adjusted to 6 µl with polymerase master mix (Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer, NEB #M0531S/L). The CPEC reaction was carried out under the following conditions:
initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s
5 cycles with:
denaturation step at 98°C for 5 s.
annealing step at 53°C for 15 s
elongation/filling up step at 72°C for 20 s/kbp of longest fragment.
final extension at 72°C for three  times the calculated elongation time.
(Optional: Hold at 12°C )
After CPEC, 5 µl of of the reaction mixture were used for transformation. The remaining volume was used for quality check on a gel with small pockets (10 to 20 µl in volume).
Generation of cdB-indC Construct
To minimize the background colonies when exchanging the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase we generated the ccdB-Ind plasmid  where we replaced the indC T-domain with the ccdB gene (Modul structure: AoxA-ccdb-TE) which kills E. coli TOP10 cells but not E. coli OneShot ccdB survival cells. Test-transformation in both E. coli TOP10 and the E. coli OneShot ccdB survival cells showed that background colonies could be eliminated by this strategy. We used the ccdB-Ind for all further CPEC experiments aiming to swap T-domains. Primers for the backbone CPEC fragments were designed to facilitate the amplification of the entire ccdB-Ind plasmid while omitting the ccdB sequence. Assembly of the finale indigoidine synthase products with exchanged T-domain was achieved by CPEC as described or above or HiCT ( RFC 99 ).
Examination of T-domain Borders
We exchanged the T-domain of indC with the T-domain of bpsA and varied the size of the exchanged DNA sequence, thus examining several domain borders (Figure 5a). We used the CPEC assembly method and the indC-ccdB plasmid for this approach. For the investigation of additional T-domains from less related NRPS modules, we selected the border combination A2 which was positive in the test with bpsA. We used the T-domains of the following genes:

This study of the mSA2 and AzF distance is a promising result regarding the spatial disposition of the heads in relation to each other. We see that the distance rarely falls below 25 Å or above 125 Å, indicating that we should be able to graft most compounds to these heads. The distribution of the RMSD also shows that our platform does not radically lose its structure, but also confirms the great diversity of the possible positions of the linkers and their associated heads.
With these data, we selected the most represented overall conformation of our protein, and therefore the most probable, to continue our strategy. We wished to observe the protein's  behaviour and evolution temporally, now that we had studied its possible conformations stochastically.

Above, you can see a video generated from the structural data generated by taking snapshots every 0.5ns along our simulation. By observing its general structure, we can see that the linker sections are indeed very flexible but seem to adopt some preferred positions.
For example, the N-terminal linkers sticks to one side of the CBM3a domain due to hydrogen interactions. We can also see the biotin molecule exiting its binding site after around 15ns.
We also tracked the distance between the alpha carbon of the azidophenylalanine residue and the glutamic acid 32 residue. Extracting the raw numbers for each frame displayed allowed us to study its evolution closely, as you can see on these plots:

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#Simulation_-_-_TEXT.html," if both are in bound states or not. There are some exceptions for DNA molecule: since dsDNA has both forward and reverse directions, comparison between its forward and reverse chain is also needed.
If all chains are different in the first stage of sorting, we have already obtain the unique order of the chain list. However, it is not always so: equal chains in the above sorting may be equivalent or not. It is due to the assumption that two bound parts are taken as equal if both have same partReferenceand partType attribute values. Though the above sorting strategy takes binding positions into consideration, it ignores the binding details of those parts: the details are hidden in the nodes of all trees. Hence, similar to the chain sorting, we need to find another strategy to sort nodes as well as trees. Our weighting scheme will be first introduced below.
Assume the chains are sorted already. Each part will be assigned a weight based on its position in the chain list. The weight of the jth part on the ith chain is (i,j). For example, the first part on the first chain posses a weight (0,0) (in C style, counting number from zero). After assignment of parts' weight, we turn to weights of the nodes in trees. Since leaf nodes in trees are actually the representation of parts in bound state on chains, the weight of each leaf node could be inherited from the weight of its corresponding part. For parent node, its weight equals to the maximum of weights of all its children nodes (we define a weight (i, j) is greater than another (i',j') if i < i' or i = i' while j < j'). The recursive definition of nodes' weight of trees makes it possible to sort all children of each node, which is a prerequisite for generating Huffman codes (see below). And then the tree order in the forest could be uniquely determined by sorting the root node of each tree.
Exchange of the first and second chain. The tree structures are different before and after exchange: the two chains are not equivalent.
Back to the question above, if two chains are equal in the first stage sorting, which should be arranged in front of the other? The answer could be obtained by exchanging them. The exchange will change the parts' weight on both chains and thus the weight of some nodes of the trees and subsequently the tree and forest structure. If the forest structure is not changed, the two chains are equivalent, which means that it makes no difference to arrange either chain in front of the other. If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which"

Korea_U_Seoul,2015,Team:Korea U Seoul#Project#Biological Background_-_-_TEXT.html," inactivating intrinsic GDH (glucose dehydrogenase). Consequently, the improved NADPH production makes L-ornithine yield to increase, which may have the possibility of being widely utilized for efficient and economical applications (Cho J., Ko Y. 2012). To summarize, if we find a path with improved NADPH yield, we could get more products in other relevant paths.
In the same context, if the NADH yield is increased, the efficiency of the path using the NADH will also be enhanced. In addition, cells grown aerobically may possibly use the extra NADH for ATP generation through the electron transport system. According to the research on the availability of intracellular NADH (Berríos-Rivera SJ., Bennett GN, San KY 2002), the higher NADH availability dramatically increased the ethanol to acetate (Et/Ac) ratio by 27-fold. The cause of this amazing increase is proven by an experiment comparing BS1 (pSBF2), which is inactivated by the native FDH (formate dehydrogenase) that regenerates NADH, with GJT001 (pDHK29), the control, under anaerobic conditions.
For these reasons, our program suggests the paths in the order of the amount of NADPH and NADH production. Users will be able to get efficient and productive paths with the information provided by our program, with less effort.
② ATP
Another scoring factor which the program ‘Gil’ provides is the ATP quantity. This function is expected to be useful for synthetic biologists to design reaction pathway necessary for their experiments which are designed to have higher efficiency when there is increased ATP level. For instance, according to the research that used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate ATP from adenosine in the process of glucose breakdown into ethanol and carbon dioxide (Murata K, et al.. 1981), the ATP-generating reaction enhances the biosynthesis of Escherichia coli which synthesizes glutathione and Brevibacterium ammoniagenes which produces NADP. Therefore, substituting the biological reaction with the ones that have higher ATP yield, designed by the program ‘Gil’, will possibly increase the productivity of both organisms. The following KEGG compound number order is the examples of the reaction pathway: C00031 (glucose), C00394, C00035, C00144, C00044, C04895, C00084, C00469 (ethanol).

ECF41: An alternative sigma factor for building an orthogonal Delay Switch
The alternative σ-factor ecf41bli aa 1-204, which derives from B. licheniformis is a truncated version and binds to the target promoter PydfG. It is an orthogonal σ-factor since there are no cross-reactions with other native promoters. [5 ] The introduction of this loop leads to a translational delay.
FsrA: a small RNA Represses Expression of Succinate Dehydrogenase
Regulation of bacterial iron homeostasis is often controlled by the iron-sensing ferric uptake repressor (Fur). The Bacillus subtilis Fur protein acts as an iron-dependent repressor for siderophore biosynthesis and iron transport proteins. Furthermore it also coordinates an iron-sparing response that acts to repress the expression of iron-rich proteins (e.g. succinate dehydrogenase) when iron is limited. It has been shown that the downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is most likely caused by complementary binding of a small RNA, named fsrA, to the leader region of the sdhCAB mRNA, namely SdhC' (Fig. 5). In this project this principle is exploited to downregulate the translation of the immunity protein SdpI in a delayed response to the detection of the QS-molecules of S. aureus or S. pneumoniae. [6 ]

Overview
Our ethics team believes all the iGEM projects and products have corresponding ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) issues. We believe they also embody the ability to influence many E3LS issues. When asked to collaborate with the Guelph iGEM team in examining the E3LS implications of their project, we knew it was a great opportunity to explore the types of challenges a synthetic biology product may face and the possible impact it may have locally and globally.
Our collaboration with the Guelph iGEM team involved research into vitamin A delivery systems and an examination of the pro and con arguments related to ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social issues found in the public domain and academic papers for each of the approaches used to alleviate deficiencies.  This research was undertaken to establish perspective on the feasibility and potential of the Guelph iGEM team project; a synthetic biology approach to vitamin A delivery.
Findings
We have gathered information on methods used to alleviate Vitamin A deficiency in various countries and the pro and con arguments related to ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social issues found in the public domain and academic papers for each of the approaches.  If synthetic biology is to be successful, its pro/con list has to be seen to generate more pro and less con arguments and sentiments than already existing for applied intervention methods. One of the challenges of implementing a synthetic biology approach is identifying a population where it is appropriate. Supplementation is currently the primary method used to provide Vitamin A to people in developing countries and has proved to be efficient (1). Food fortification, which would include the synthetic biology approach, would have to assume the position of a complementary intervention in an overall effort to reduce Vitamin A deficiency.  Although a complementary approach in the short term, longitudinally, a synthetic biology approach, like other food fortification efforts, may provide more control of Vitamin A deficiency. However, implementing food fortification programs takes years (1). In addition to that, an innovative approach like synthetic biology may take even longer due to the fact it is not well known and gaining public acceptance may introduce yet another barrier.

Cas9 is targeted for site-specific DSB induction by the sgRNA. More specifically, a 20 bp region of the sgRNA, known as the protospacer, recognizes the target site through base-pairing. This 20 bp protospacer is easily substituted, allowing for a very modular system. The only restriction for the CRISPR-Cas9 system is the requirement for a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) in the target region. For the most commonly used Cas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes) this is the frequently occurring NGG sequence. Reproduced from Nødvig et al. 12

DESCRIPTION
We adapt the CRISPR-Cas9 system for use in Y. lipolytica in order to obtain a proof-of-concept of the construction of a stable production strain. We do so by a proof-of-concept integration of a gene in Y. lipolytica. In addition, we obtain a proof-of-concept of the knock-out of a native Y. lipolytica gene. With these proof-of-concepts, we envision that the metabolic flux towards a possible compound of interest could be increased, leading to tailored Y. lipolytica strains for cell factory engineering purposes.
Experimental design
The CRISPR-Cas9 system has previously been successfully applied to Y. lipolytica by Schwartz et al. 8 As this was a proof-of-concept study, the native Y. lipolytica PEX10 gene was targeted for disruption, which allowed for an easily selectable phenotype. This is because PEX10 codes for Peroxisome biogenesis factor 10, a protein that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis. Consequently, PEX10 disruption results in an inability to catabolize long-chain fatty acids. We set out to confirm the observed PEX10 knock-out. In addition, we set out to integrate URA3, a commonly used yeast auxotrophic marker gene which codes for Orotidine 5’-phosphate decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis.
We had obtained both a commonly used Y. lipolytica laboratory strain (PO1f, MATA URA3-­302 LEU2-­270 XPR2-­322 AXP2 ­ΔNU49 XPR2::SUC2; obtained from Schwartz et al. 8 ) and also this same strain with a knockout of the"

Overview
In order to lower down the repeatability rate of codons, we use intelligent optimization algorithm.  We exploit amino acid degeneracy and alternate nucleotides to reduce the repetition rate of bases of TALE DNA sequence. (See Figure 1) Then the optimized TALE sequence will be tested in wet lab to verify our conjecture whether TALE DNA sequence of lower repeatability rate works at higher efficiency.
Figure 1. RNA codon Table
For instance, we may change UUC into UUU to make one of the repeats different from others while the amino acid(PhenylalaninePhe) is identical.
By this way, we use two types of intelligent optimization algorithm to optimize TALE DNA sequence.
Genetic Algorithm(GA)
-Introduction of Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. The heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.[1]
GA has lots of applications in many fields, such as in bioinformatics, using GA to optimize DNA successfully made the sequences have better physic-chemical properties for PCR.
-Our strategy
Initialization
Create a population of hundreds of TALE sequences.
Mutation
Each sequence changes a base randomly under the premise that 1. Amino acids sequence remain unchanged 2. To prevent TALE sequence from being cut, no restriction enzyme site we exploit in experiment is allowed to be created 3. Mutation should not take place on the overhang of each repeat.
Crossover
In GA, crossover is a simulation of the process of synapsis. We randomly choose a point of amino acid, and two sequences exchange their parts from the point we choose to one of the ends.
Figure 2.The process of crossover is a simulation of natural synapsis of chromosome.
Fitness Scoring
We take two main factors into consideration:
1.Repeatability rate of the sequence
To judge the repeatability, we compare the changed sequence with the original one and count the Hamming distance between them. When a restriction enzyme site sequence occurs on the mutated TALE sequence, there"
Stanford-Brown-RISD,2018,Team:Stanford-Brown-RISD#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," this experiment, N-acetyl D-glucosamine (“NaDg”; analogous to a chitin monomer and widely used in the literature for assessing chitin binding) was first titrated into 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD and no isotherm was calculated because binding sites were not saturated by the ligand. Cu was then titrated into the 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD + NaDg complex and this resulted in a Cu affinity at Ka= 7.61 +/- 1.49x 106 M-1 that is largely comparable to 2x-HHTC-Re (no CBD) and lowerby an order of magnitude than 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD without bound NaDg. Data show 20 1 µL injections. 2x-HHTC-Re-CBD was selected as the candidate for testing because it displayed the most consistent and strong results during protein purification procedures, and seemed most promising for downstream applications (such as our filter). Work is in progress on optimizing the 3x and 6x fusion proteins and creating prototypes (thus far, protein production as been successful).
Figure 5: Isotherm and data produced by ITC for assessing the binding affinity of our fusion protein (2x-HHTC-Re-CBD) for chitin (represented by N-acetyl D-glucosamine) and Cu.
Tangential Flow Prototype Creation: Material Properties and Design Considerations
The first consideration when thinking about creating a mycelium biofilter had to do with the qualities and characteristics of the mycelium material. Would it be waxy? Would the chitin be exposed? Such questions and more could significantly impact the approach we picked for functionalizing any material produced. The first test we did was comprised of a simple dye being poured on a piece of mycelium to observe the hydrophobicity of the material and whether it could be easily penetrated (as seen in the video below).
It is evident that the mycelium surface is highly hydrophobic. While this may appear to be an undesirable trait for a water filter, we found that subsequent incubation of mycelium in moving water for a period of 48 hours allowed for the material to become permeable. In an interesting twist of synergy, the fusion protein we were attempting to produce was highly hydrophobic as well, and therefore probably showed good affinity for the mycelium material (Figure 6).

Finally, result showed that with application of acid resistance device, pH could be regulated to a suitable range (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 Intracellular pH is regulated by acid resistance device. To prove the function of circuit, initial pH was set up to 3.0, when glsA was activated. pH can effect the activity of glsA, while glsA conducts gaseous ammonia production. With the enzyme activity changing, pH will be finally stabilized at a suitable level.

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," Practices Project. The whole competition is also to raise awareness for synthetic biology [...]. We got the idea to conduct interviews with Public Health Specialists and Researchers who worked on chlamydia detection. On the one side to help us in our project and on the other to get input. [...]
Prof. Sachse:
Talking about the importance of chlamydia one has to distinguish, of course, between the situation in the industrialised countries of the northern hemisphere and developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Situations are basically different there. While in the industrialised countries the situation is more or less monitored, in some countries it is better monitored, like the U.S. and Scandinavia, and in some countries it is not so well monitored, like in Germany and other European countries. The basic problem here with chlamydia infection in humans is the STDs of course, whereas in the developing world you have the Trachoma, which has millions of cases every year, as seen in the WHO statistics.
    Trachoma is a great issue and [very] serious. In some areas endemic disease and despite several international aid programs that have been on their way the problem persists. This is mainly due to the nature of chlamydia, that you can't just easily eradicate it with a single vaccination and the diagnosis is also not so easy, because you can't readily grow them like ordinary bacteria. So you face different problems. In a way bacterial infections with chlamydia are unique and quite different from the classical bacterial infections. These are factors that you have to consider in your project. But I understand that you have addressed all these peculiarities of the chlamydia, which includes the difficulty in growing them and the needs of an intracellular stage of culture and also the inability of easy eradication, neither by a single vaccination nor by antibiotics. Although antibiotics can give the patient a temporary relief and can also resolve single cases. But generally the chlamydia have a mechanism of just evading the action of classical antibiotics.
Kai:
Can you give us a quick overview over your work on chlamydia?
Prof. Sachse:
I have been involved in chlamydia research for more than 20 years and my main focus was the veterinary chlamydia infection, which is the chlamydia infection in animals. But among these infections in animals there are a few zoonotic infections as well, like the Psittacosis which has been known for more than a century. And you also have, for example, infections originating from sheep that can also affect humans. And"
Jilin_China,2016,Team:Jilin China#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," considerations?
With the advances in modern DNA manipulation technology, humans can modify bacterial DNA, thus affecting human health. Many bacteria have been modified to synthesize molecules needed by humans, such as hormones, interferon, and antibodies. So we can say that after the transformation, bacteria can become a cure for disease medicine, to make greater contributions to human health.
The reasons why biotechnology companies have such high risk is that there are many biotechnology industry-related regulatory laws and regulations. Common legal risks in the biotechnology industry are the risk of intellectual property right and the risk of daily business activities.
Intellectual property rights are the basis for the survival and development of biotechnology enterprises. Relevant legal risks often occur in areas such as: early R & D contractual agreement, rights attribution, patent and trademark acquisition, use, maintenance, transfer, license, infringement, cyber squatting, fraudulent use and so on.
Risks of business activities. The biotechnology industry is heavily regulated. For example, individual consumers of the product efficacy and side effects of different reactions, easily lead to product liability complaints, litigation and claims, and even lead to public relations events, improper handling will lead to significant losses.
Critical Thinking about Law Related to Gene Technology from Professor Zhipeng He.
Zhipeng He, an excellent professor of Jilin University School of Law, who has written books in law, and is good at teaching and scientific research of Law, shared with us three law principles.
From his perspective, which is profound and thought-provoking, firstly, while there are phenomena in the society, it is not to say that there must be some law concerning the very kind of phenomena. It is the maturity of the society and the consensus we reached contribute to the forming of law. Any kind of radical law is not mature response to the society phenomenon.
Secondly, it is the development of life that leads the development of law. No vice. Thirdly, genetic research is a matter of hot dispute, however, the focus of law should be concerning relevant technology and social more. All in all, the law is passive.
Who can tell how the law will be in the future? We guess no one.  However, Chinese scientific research needs a more effective ethical regulation urgently. The more we human being have in technology, the more we are exposed to danger. We need the law so that we prevent mistakes happening again after we have done something wrong. But only the practice and real situation in the near future can better promote the development of law of gene technology. And when that day comes, the development in gene editing and therapy techniques may have greater breakthrough."
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Team_-_-_TEXT.html," of Calgary. My main research interests deal with the electrophysiology of the heart, using a combination of experimental measurements and computer modeling. I realized a couple of years back that many of the modeling methods used in my research also can be applied to an area I knew nothing about at the time: Synthetic Biology. This is the second year I have been involved in iGEM and, like last year, I think it is fair to say that I have learned more from the team members than anyone has learned from me! We have several Engineering students on the team this year and I am sure there will be even more in future years. The Biomedical Engineering Program here at the U of C is only a few years old, but we already have a great momentum going with lots of great students.
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY
The University of Calgary was founded in 1966 and since then has become one of the top research institutions in Canada. The wide range of Bachelor programs in 16 faculties and 36 research centers offer the almost 20,000 undergraduate students a large array of resources to develop their personal and professional lives in order to become successful. The iGEM team worked in well-equipped laboratories such as those found in the O'Brien Center and in Michael Surette's laboratory in the Health Sciences Center.

Alberta,2009,Team:Alberta#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"I am a first year student at the University of Alberta.  I hope to enter medical school in the near future.  I am currently taking part in mitotic-spindle regulation research from a genetics perspective.  I have a passion for science and enjoy sports such as basketball and soccer.  iGEM is an great learning experience not only in the cutting-edge field of Synthetic Biology but also in leadership and business management.  I will enjoy taking part in research that combines many fields of science as well as socialize with many of my team members who share common interests.
Justin Fedor
BSc. Honours Biochemistry
I have completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry this year and have began my PhD studies this September.  I play piano and am attempting to learn the cello.  My nerdy tendencies are obvious when I say that I like Star Trek TNG but not DS9.  Last summer I worked in the biomedical research lab of Dr. Larry Unsworth of the National Institute for Nanotechnology (NINT), which has further piqued my interest in the field of nanotechnology.  In the hopefully not too distant future I plan on becoming a researcher studying the mechanisms of membrane bound enzymes, particularly oxidoreductases. iGEM has proved a fantastic experience, it has served to mature me further as a scientist.
Jason Gardiner
BSc. Specialization in Botany
Jason is a veteran of iGEM 2007, where his team ""The Butanerds"" won first place in the Energy track.  His hobbies include Softball, Beach volleyball, soccer, as well as playing the guitar and fiddling with the iGEM 2009 Wiki.  Jason has applied to continue his education in graduate studies at the University of Alberta in 2010.  His degree in Botany focuses mostly on the molecular side of plants and he hopes to use this knowledge applying Synthetic Biology to plants. One day he hopes to solve all of the world's problems using plants and Synthetic Biology.

I completed my BSc. degree this year and plan to do graduate work in biochemistry.  After that - who knows?  I think iGEM will be a great experience, and that it's about time Synthetic Biology really took off.  In my spare time I like to read, play computer games (especially the Sims) and raise cats.

UCLA,2015,Team:UCLA#Project#Protein Cages_-_-_TEXT.html," to isolate the native cage and the mutant protein cage.  The purification of the native protein cage was done using SDS-PAGE (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Affinity purification of native protein cage.  Whole cell lysates were subjected to nickel-histidine affinity purification.
Assay for Protein Cage Formation
We assayed for cage formation by measuring hydrodynamic radius using dynamic light-scattering (DLS) (Figure 4, Figure 5).  DLS is based on the principle that fluctuations in the Brownian motion of suspended particles of distinct sizes scatter coherent light with fluctuating intensities(6).  Analysis of these fluctuating intensities allows for the determination of particle velocity, and thus size(6).  Unfortunately, protein aggregation was a complication, and the correct cage size of 16nm was not observed for either cage we tested.
Figure 4: Assay of Native Protein Cage Assembly. The purified fractions of affinity purified native protein cage was used to assay for protein cage assembly by measuring hydrodynamic radius (nm).  The expected size of the tetrahedral cage is 16nm.
Figure 5: Assay of Mutant Protein Cage 10 Assembly. The purified fractions of affinity purified Mutant Protein Cage 10 was used to assay for protein cage assembly by measuring hydrodynamic radius (nm).  The expected size of the tetrahedral cage is 16nm.
Future Directions
For future directions, the remaining mutants will be cloned, and the expression conditions will be optimized in order to obtain properly folded cages.  This will be assayed using techniques such as circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering.  Cages that fold properly will then be assayed for thrombin cleavage.  At which point, it would be possible to load the interior of the cage with drug/imaging molecules for release, or functionalize the exterior of the cage for specific receptor interactions.  Though the protein cage project is in a nascent phase, we hope to explore more possibilities that may shed light on using them for future applications in medicine.
Achievements
Used Pymol software to model our protein cage and design 13 different protein cage mutants
Cloned the top protein cage mutant based on our selection criteria
Verified expression and affinity purification the native protein cage using SDS-PAGE
