Week 24: October 7 - October 11
More of the plasmid containing the construct of the combined [A] and [B] ( BBa_K1189006 ) was prepared for future assays.
We also did a gel shift assay in order to test the ability of TALE B to bind to its intended target site [B] as well as the non intended target site [A] as a control (Figure 36). The gel shift failed, most likely due to an excessive concentration of protein in the loaded samples. This concentration was amended and optimized for following gel shift assays.
Figure 36. Gel shift assay of TALE B and the intended [B] and non intended [A] target sites. Five of the lanes contain varying concentrations of the intended [B] target site and two of the lanes contain varying concentrations of the non intended [A] target site. No contamination is observed in the controls with only the target sites. The gel shift failed, most likely due to an  excessive concentration of TALE B protein in the loaded samples. The gel was 1.3% agarose and was run at 50 V for 40 minutes.
Week 25: October 14 - October 18
This week we continued optimizing our protocol for the gel shift assay. After observing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or gel shift assay results (Figure 37), we can clearly see that the loaded samples of protein and target sites cannot leave the well. Some of the wells such as wells 8 and 9 clearly exhibit this problem. The protein remains stuck in the wells and cannot go through the pores of the native gel. In order to correct this, we decided to modify the percentage of the native gels and increase the acrylam"

These results suggest that the integrative vector actually works and that the selection marker is highly specific (no colonies appeared on the ""no DNA"" plate).
The correct phenotype of the S288C bearing these parts has still to be validated (by mOrange fluorescence measurement for the <partinfo>BBa_K300007</partinfo> part), as well as the actual integration position (by PCR).
<partinfo>BBa_K300010</partinfo> - PoPS-based self-inducible device
This is a PoPS-in/PoPS-out device.
The luxR gene (<partinfo>BBa_C0062</partinfo>) is constitutively produced by the <partinfo>BBa_R0040</partinfo> promoter and it can activate the lux pR in presence of the autoinducer 3-oxo-C6-homoserine-lactone (3OC6HSL or simply HSL). The PoPS input regulates the production of luxI gene (<partinfo>BBa_C0061</partinfo>). It encodes for the LuxI enzyme, which is able to produce HSL. The produced HSL can diffuse in the growth media of the cells that express LuxI. The lux pR produces a PoPS output when HSL reaches a critical concentration.
This device can be specialized by assembling a promoter upstream and a promoterless expression system with the gene of interest downstream. When a cell population expresses LuxI, the concentration of HSL is an increasing function of cell culture density and so the induction of the lux pR promoter occurs only when the cells reach a threshold density.
In this way, the upstream promoter autoinduces the production of the target protein at a critical culture density, depending on the HSL synthesis rate. The HSL synthesis rate can be tuned by assembling promoters of different strengths upstream of luxI.
This enables the construction of a library of self-inducible devices capable of starting the target protein production at a predictable culture density.
This device has been characterized in many different experimental conditions:
varying the strength of the promoter controlling the production of the signal molecule (Sender Modulation);
varying the copy number of vectors containing Sender and Receiver circuits;
varying the growth medium (LB or M9).
The results obtained are reported in"
NEFU_China,2016,Team:NEFU China#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious effect on protein separation). Introducing a 10% ‘spacer gel’ between 4% stacking and 16% separating gels considerably sharpens the bands for proteins and peptides of 1–5 kDa.
3. Adjust protein concentrations so that a suitable amount of protein can be loaded onto the gel. Concentrate samples, preferentially by techniques that do not increase the salt concentration (such as ultrafiltration). Roughly 0.2–1 μg of protein for each protein band (in 0.7 × 5 mm gel strips) is sufficient for Coomassie staining. Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg/ml–1 for each protein band. For silver staining, 100-fold less protein may be sufficient. Depending on the requirements of protein detection and analysis, concentration of the sample may be necessary.The maximal protein load can be limited by large amounts of neutral detergent in the sample and by high concentrations of lipid when solubilizing biological membranes. SDS must always be in large excess over neutral detergents and/or lipids. For isolated mitochondrial membranes (70% protein, 30% lipid), for example, the optimized maximal protein load of sample wells 0.7 × 5 mm is 20 μg. Increasing the applied amount of protein to 40 μg, for example, may cause the individual protein bands to disappear in a diffuse background. Around 0.4% neutral detergent in the sample can be tolerated for direct mixing with SDS-containing sample incubation buffers and application to SDS gels. The incubation buffers and volumes described in Step 4 set a tenfold excess of SDS over the neutral detergent. Setting the SDS/neutral detergent ratio to <10 may result in a surprising result after staining: normally separated, large proteins may be detected in the upper gel areas, but the lower gel areas may be completely clear with no small proteins detectable.
4. Mix samples with SDS-containing sample buffers. The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples. For low-density samples such as elution fractions from chromatographic columns, add 5 μl of reducing or nonreducing sample incubation buffer A or B (see REAGENTS) to 15 μl of sample. For high-density samples such as fractions from sucrose density gradients, add 5 μl of sample buffer C or D to 15 μl of sample. For pellet"

We used the cells highly expressing surEGFP as the sender. Images show that the HeLa expresses mCherry when contacts with K562-surEGFP, while mCherry won’t be seen in the condition that the HeLa don’t contact with K562-surEGFP (Figure 3) . Thus, we confirmed our SynNotch can respond to surEGFP.

Stripe modeling to study tri-response required conditions
To generate an antigen density-dependent tri-response pattern for SwordS, designing the gene transcription network in Stripe plays a central role. We model the transcription network of Stripe [Model: Network Modelling] to better understand the characteristics of it. The theoretical basis of our model is explained in detail in [Model: Theoretical Basis] . In silico modeling indicates that the key criterion for functional Stripe construction is the matching of orthogonal SynTF-SynPro pairs that enabled sufficient separation of the low and high thresholds. It enlightened us to create and characterize a set of SynTF-SynPro to achieve tunable intervals against tumor antigen with heterogeneity. To provide further insights into the modeling procedures, we have created an online software with dynamic interactions [Software: N"

We tested the board game in Fudan Board Game Club several times. Club members were so impressed that showed great interests in playing. Cell War was then for the first time introduced to the public on the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC 2017). We got everyone’s attention. Haoqian Zhang from Beijing showed great interest in our board game. Mr. Zhang was previously the iGEM team leader of Peking University. Now he is the CTO of Bluepha, a synthetic biology company. In CCiC, he first got to know our board game. After that, a close cooperation has been made. We made several sets of board games and send them to Beijing to distribute in Peking University Affiliated High School.

Overview
We used Team Harvard BioDesign 2015’s method for E. coli to bind to colon cancer cells by inserting the binding peptide RPMrel into the FimH protein and took their project to the next level by forcing the E. coli to produce butyrate upon binding. For the production of butyrate we used the enzyme But-CoAT which allowed for the direct conversion of Acetyl CoA into butyrate.
Achievements
We have succesfully cloned our genes of interest into pSB1C3.
We have confirmed that clones were obtained properly through the PCR amplification.
We have succesfully characterize the fusion of FimH together with GFP and ButCoaT together with RFP  and their compatibility.
We have obtained the Protein gel of previous year CAD1 gene that submitted in 2015.
We have optimized the  Co-culture protocol for our binding and treatment purposes and we have found that the optimal Co-culture time is 6 hours.
Harvard Bio Design’s Results
Team Harvard BioDesign 2015 had used a dot blot protocol in order to prove the specified binding of their cells to colon cancer cells. Their protocol involved dotting Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells, introducing their cancer-binding E. coli then staining the blots with certain antibodies to show binding. Their results, much like ours, were positive and indicated binding of the E. coli to colon cancer cells.

UChicago,2015,Team:UChicago#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," oscillations may be dampened due to even a slight decrease in KaiA, we can still select for the most robust oscillations using different concentrations of KaiA.
          Our results indicate that for KaiC, fluctuation in protein concentration is minimal compared to KaiA pre- and post-shock. This is a positive indication, as KaiC protein amounts need to remain constant for robust oscillations. The present rhamnose concentration of 0.5% however, is evidently too high as the levels (ng) of KaiC are very little compared to the levels (ng) of KaiA. This throws off the 1:3 KaiA:KaiC ratio seen in vitro. For our next experiment, we plan to obtain a better gradient characterization of the L-rhamnose promoter to obtain lower expression levels of KaiA.
          Our results for KaiB indicate a decrease in KaiB protein throughout the time course pre-shock and a stable level of KaiB post-shock. This could indicate a rapid degradation rate of KaiB until KaiB reaches a low steady-state concentration. However, because we changed media between pre- and post-shock samples, we cannot determine if the stabilization was caused due to KaiB reaching steady state or because of the minimal growing conditions post shock. We speculate however that these results are caused due to issues with the western blot of KaiB itself (Figure E). Looking forward, we aim to repeat this experiment to obtain a better western blot result.
Lastly, our results provide evidence that the Kai proteins are being expressed in E.coli! (Hey, gotta start from somewhere right? J )
Note: Please check out our notebook ( https://2015.igem.org/Team:UChicago/Notebook ), in order to see data and evidence for constructing out beloved oscillator biobrick.
After this induction time-course experiment we performed an assay to test for oscillations. We hope to present our findings for the first oscillation test in our presentation at the 2015 iGEM competition.

B Company visit & Game optimization at“Perfect World”
     To impose a greater influence on our younger community members, we further revised our two web games by visiting one of the China’s biggest internet entertainment giants “Perfect World” where we got a lot of useful advice on our games and work. Click here for more details about our games.
About Perfect World
‘Perfect World’ business covers both the perfect world game and the perfect world film and television , which is China's largest film and computer complex. In 2004, perfect world game was officially founded, and the launching of independent development of 3D engine got great success. In July 2007, the perfect world game was successfully listed on Nasdaq. In 2008, the perfect world film and television was set up, and in December 2014 it successfully flanded in A-share market.
    During the visit, we had a deep communication with the company’s staff. First the company’s HR gave a brief introduction to the company. Then we talked to a senior game designer. He gave us some advice on how to make a game more playable. Next, we visited the art design group and they taught us how to design beautiful game characters in a limited time.
    In the end, we provided our first version of games to the company’s employees and proposed issue about games’ balance between playability and authenticity. If we focus too much on authenticity, the playability of the game decreases. In a similar way, if we focus too much on the playability, the games will lose their authenticity and scientific meaning.
    After listening to their advice, we made some changes to our game.First, players can choose whatever characters when initializing but can only initial 10 characters.Besides, one side wins when the amount of this side surly surpasses the other.(A minor advantage is not cinsidered a defeat if we take fluctuation into account) These improvements will help our web game playable while remaining its authenticity.

Description
We aim to create a genetic circuit functional in E.coli which allows the             gene expressed to change after each cell division. Specifically, the E. coli             will be expressing GFP, RFP, and CFP after subsequent cell divisions and will             loop back to expressing GFP again.
This will be achieved by the use of the Pnrd promoter to sense to cell division,             sigma factor/anti-sigma pairs control transcription, and a toehold switch to create             an AND gate required in the circuit.
Our project would be able to exhibit, in E. coli, that despite carrying the same             genetic information, different phenotypes can be expressed across generations.             Much like the phenomenon seen in epigenetics. Moreover, this technology could             potentially be applied in field to carry out certain tasks automatically without             the need of external input eg. to make engineered cells automatically carry             programmed cell death after a certain number of divisions.

Parts Improvement
Stanford-Brown iGEM 2012 documented the promoter Pnrd ( BBa_K847211 ) which activates during cell division and confirmed its functionality. However, since it was submitted in RFC[23 ] standard, we decided to improve the part by using redesigning the part in RFC[10 ] ( BBa_ K2070012 ) in order to deal with the disadvantages of RFC[23 ] standard. Details on the RFC[10 ] and RFC[23 ] standards can be found on the iGEM wiki.

Conclusion"
Bordeaux,2016,Team:Bordeaux#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," the formula we used for the volume is V = Vμ∗2μ⁄ln(2) where μ is the growth rate updated at every step.
Hence, after substrate uptake and metabolism, the growth rate of each bacterium is updated, and its new volume is calculated.
At this point, if the bacterium volume falls below a minimum volume, the bacterium dies and the agent is deleted from the lattice.
On the other side, if the bacterial volume becomes superior to the volume at division, the bacterium divides in one of the unoccupied squares of its ""division neighbourhood"" if there are any. For example, in figure 2 you can see a representation of one part of the environment/grid with some bacteria in it. The possible squares where the central bacterial cell can give a daughter cell are marked in red.
Figure 3: Possible positions for the daughter cell
Bacterial growth based on Indisim methodology
Contrary to the precedent model which is based on the cell volume dependence to its growth rate, this model takes into account biomass growth dependence.
Bacterial growth, as modelled by Indisim, can be divided into different steps :
nutrient uptake
metabolism
eventual reproduction
eventual death
For nutrient uptake, a bacterium can take nutrients from the square where it is located. Two factors are then taken into consideration : the nutrients capability to reach the cell surface and the cell's ability to metabolize those nutrients.
Nutrient are consumed in accordance to the following formula :  U(max) = Z(cmα), where :
U(max) is the maximum number of nutrient particles that can be taken by the bacterium.
Z is a random variable with mean Umax and standard deviation σ.
c is a constant
m is the mass of the bacterium
If U ≥ kS , where k is the percentage of nutrients that will actually be consummed by the cell ,then the actual uptake by the bacterium is U = kS. On the other hand, if kS < U then only S − U nutrient particles remain in the square.
The nutrients absorbed are then metabolized into biomass. For modelling metabolism, we use a metabolism constant, Y, which represents the rate of synthetized biomass units per metabolised nutrient particles. After metabolism, the bacterium grows, and the new bacterial mass is m+B, where B = UY.
The reproduction step in Indisim differs from the precedent one, as the bacterium won't divide instantly when reaching a specific mass. There will be a time-lapse before the bacterium can divide.

March - Building the Team
During this first month we divided the team roles and we started to brainstorm about project ideas and read a lot of literature for inspiration. Every week we had a meeting to discuss our progress and exchange ideas.
April - Constructing the Constructs
After a lot of brainstorm sessions we started to design our constructs and had meetings with our supervisors to finetune the idea. During the end of the month we started working on designing the DNA of the constructs. We also had a first session for our Human Practices as a preparation for SYNENERGENE at the end of the month.
The first round of gBlocks were designed in such a way that they can be used with the gibson assembly method. We used the cloning guide from iGEM team Eindhoven 2015 as a starting point. For detailed information on our protein design click here.
Week 1 - 03/04 - 07/04
The first draft of our idea was made and the two constructs were designed:
a 14-3-3 tetramer with a n-term GFP and c-term ExoS peptide & CT33 fused to a strep-tag and mCherry.
Week 2 - 10/04 - 14/04
Due to busy exam weeks we did not have a lot progress this week. However, we did have some meetings with professors to talk about our project and to finetune the idea. Especially developing a model to predict the behaviour of network formation was something that they were interested in.
Week 3 - 17/07 - 21/04
This week we had our first meeting with our supervisors about our two constructs. Several changes were made and we also had a small brainstorm about the eventual applications of our network."
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Acknowledgement_-_-_TEXT.html," medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time of glnAp2. Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

HUMAN PRACTICE
Week 1 (25.06-29.06)
We entered the lab and got the general idea of where things were and how we are going to work there. We had a talk with our instructors on how to divide the work, what we have to prepare first and what we will need in the future. We started off with locating two constructs with listeriolysin. We prepared the competent E. coli strains: TOP10 – 80 eppendorf tubes, BL21 – 40 eppendorf tubes, and MC1061 – 40 eppendorf tubes. We tried a control transformation of all three strains with 2 ul and 5 ul of DNA. We also prepared plates with ampicillin and retrieved GFP, RFP and YFP from the distribution plates. We also transformed TOP10 strain with the construct with listeriolysin ( BioBrick BBa_K177026 and received transformant colonies. We also prepared a lot of plates with LB agar with and without antibiotics. After the transformation results we chose TOP10 for subsequent experiments, as the most effective E. coli strain.
Week 2 (2.07-6.07)
We tried our first PCR without template – since we didn’t know which concentration of primers will work best, we tried 3 ul and 5 ul, 10 ul Taq master mix and filled the tubes with nuclease-free water up to 20 ul. Gel electrophoresis of our PCR products showed we had products in both! We proved our new technique works! We had significantly more product where we used higher concentration of primers, so we used 5 ul of primers in our following PCRs.
One of our instructor conducted Clone Manager workshops. We learned how to use the software and how to create and modify DNA molecules, how to design primers for the existing ones and how to check restriction sites – e.g. which enzyme to use when. Thanks to that we could start preparing primers to produce our new parts (through PCR without template) – the promoter, RBSes and terminator for B. subtilis.

Generating a Cre-Lox System for Stable Thermosensor Output
The Goal: Since temperature increases are likely to be transient, we desired to link the thermosensor to a stable output that would maintain a signal long after the temperature increase was gone. To do this, we used the well characterized Cre- Lox system. Cre is a recombinase which removes DNA between flanking LoxP sites. Thus, we linked Cred to the thermosensor (the ATG of the thermosensor now serves as the ATG of Cre), and then also linked a reporter (GFP) to a promoter that would only work when Cre was expressed.
Take 1: Testing a Cre-Lox system. First, we attempted to create a Cre-Lox system that could be tested independent of our thermosensor. To do this, we constructed Cre that was expressed from an arabinose-inducible promoter (pBAD). This construct also had a reporter gene (GFP) downstream of a constitutive promoter(PCon). Between the GFP and its promoter, we placed a loxP cassette which consisted of a LoxP site followed by a gentamicin resistance gene, a terminator, and another LoxP site. Thus, when Cre was induced with arabinose, the gentamicin resistance gene and terminator would be removed, allowing GFP to be expressed from the constitutive promoter. We obtained a plasmid containing the LoxP-Gentamicin resistance gene-terminator- LoxP from the Joel Griffitt's lab at BYU and made the following construct.
PBAD--Cre--PCon--LoxP--Gentamicin resistance gene--Terminator--

Interactive Metabolic Pathway Tools (IMP Tools) is an open source, web based program that involves model-guided cellular engineering where new metabolic functions can be added to existing microorganisms. This program will assist in the design stage of synthetic biology research. IMP tools is written primarily in python using the Django web framework. It takes a user-defined input compound, output compound, and weighting scheme and determines the ideal pathway from the starting to the ending compound. Our program presents an exciting capability to help transform important processes in the world for applications ranging from bioremediation to biofuels.
IMPtools utilizes the reactions stored in the Kegg (Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes) database to create a metabolic pathway that is in some sense optimized for the production of a desired by-product while consuming some desired input. After inputting your desired input and output products, our program searches for the optimal metabolic path connecting the input and output compound. Our program has the ability to provide different pathways according to user defined weights; as an example, least ATP consumption or fewest changes to host organism. The end product we give you is a collection of metabolic pathways and their associated gene sequences. Along with the sequence, we also give you useful information necessary, such as a graphical representation and stoichiometric matrix, to carry out experiments in order to validate our results. Our long-term goals include being able to determine what intermediate BioBricks would be necessary to activate the required enzymes for production. In future years, this tool may be useful for other teams to predict some of their synthetic biology ventures.

Nevada,2011,Team:Nevada#Notebook#Temp2_-_-_TEXT.html,"72-50 degrees Celsius. Controls of only DNA and only Primer were run with the samples. 10 ul samples were run for each temp gradient
7/18/11 - PCR results were run through a 1% agarose gel. Best results came from ‘F’ which ran at 54.3 Celsius. The DNA from this band was extracted and purified using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit
7/19/11 – PCR 50 ul of ThiE at 54.3 Celsius for backup stock. TOPO cloned ThiE that was extracted from gel yesterday. Plated TOPO cells at 100 ul, 75 ul, 50 ul and 25 ul  concentrations then placed in incubator overnight
PCR reactions only need one control, of just the primers without DNA.
7/20/11 – 5 colonies of TOPO bacteria grew overnight. Cultured all 5 for purification and confirmation of proper insert (ThiE) Ran gel to confirm that 50 ul ThiE PCR worked, nice clean band at 1 kb marker, saved the rest of the 50 ul stock in -20 C freezer for further use. PCR done on  the additional pieces (CmR, PetBD and GLF) used same temp gradient as done with ThiE. Will run a gel of these tomorrow to see what optimal temp is for each sample. If clean bands are seen, we will perform a gel purification and re-PCR those samples. Spoke with Shintani, these additional pieces should just be amplified through PCR until a clean stock is created, then this stock will be used in Gibson.
7/21/11 – Miniprep purified TOPO cultures. Sample “1” did not bloom in culture but grew on stock plate. Purified “2-5” and will save “1” as a backup if no other  colonies have the correct insert.  Ran temp gradient samples through gels.
GLF had very light bands at 67.6 and 63.5 Celsius temps, the average temp of those two is 65.5 – will try to run more DNA at this temp to see if we can get stronger bands. Maybe increase DNA concentration in solution.
*Shintani gave me his master stock solution of GLF (in puc vector) for next run of PCR. Diluted 1:9 of his solution and stored in freezer in PCR tube (with orange label) will try to PCR this stock at 65.5.

1. Environment impact
(1) Drawbacks of traditional Nitrogen fertilizer
Nitrogen fertilizer is the chief culprit of eutrophication, which will cause algal bloom, loss of oxygen, loss of biodiversity. (Lassaletta et al, 2010 & Mian et al, 2009)
Some of the unabsorbed chemical nitrogen fertilizer runs off because of rainfall and irrigation in the form of compound, but most of them runs off in the form of soluble salt, such as NH4+,NO3— or volatilizes in the air and drops back to land with rainfall . (Bouwman et al, 2001 & Pan, 2009) In China, less than half of the fertilizer N applied was taken up by crops Zhang et al (2008) and Ti et al (2011) reported that Chemical fertilizer accounts for 56.3% of N input and in oil rape (such as soybean , including peanut) field, but 4.35 % leaches, 3.19% Runs off and 5.5% volatilizes.
All of these ways will disturb the hydrosphere and cause underground water pollution and surface water eutrophication. (Huang et al, 2009)
In China, stream total N concentration has been increasing since 1980s. (Yang et al, 1999). According to Xu’s (2014) research on total nitrogen concentrations in surface water of typical Agro- and forest-ecosystem in China between 2004 and 2009, the median total N concentrations of still surface water were significantly higher in the agro-(1.5mg•L-1) and oasis agro-ecosystem (1.8mg•L-1) than in the forest ecosystems (1.0mg"
USTC_Software,2010,Team:USTC Software#modelFeatures_-_-_TEXT.html," container contains definitions of various species defined by Chain-Node Model. Each component stores the cnModel structure of chains and trees. Related reactions are also stored. It is suggested that the constructor of a database stores template species instead of real species in this container. Only in this way can he make use of the power feature of template modeling of MoDeL.
:: Reactions: This container contains definitions of various reactions. Each component has its own compartments, reactants, modifiers, products, substituent transfers, and kinetic law. This forms a detailed description of reactions. Again, constructor of a database is suggested to store template reactions instead of real reactions.
The organizational structure of components in MoDeL is shown in the following figure.
Figure 6: Structrue of MoDeL components
As mentioned above, reference relationships are stored in most components. The following figure shows the relationship between different components, the pointer pointing to a component indicates referencing to that component.
Figure 7: Reference relationship of MoDeL components
It is worth noting that MoDeL does not attempt to include all information about each component. In PartsRegistry, a long list of data in XML format is provided including part author, status, sequence, and even group access information. Such data are redundant for our database since they are not necessary elements needed to construct reaction network. Only the useful data is retained.
Relationship with SBML
SBML(The Systems Biology Markup Language) is a machine-readable language in XML fashion. It's oriented towards describing systems where biological entities are involved in, and modified by, processes that occur over time. As a widely used model exchange standard, SBML is chosen to be the output of our auto-modeling module.
Generally speaking, MoDeL needs not to be conformed to any constraints set by SBML. However, since SBML is a widely used standard, it is better for MoDeL to share common concepts and components with SBML as many as possible. For example, MoDeL still uses rules, function definitions and unit definitions in SBML. By doing so, it will be easier for software tools to change formats between MoDeL and SBML.

3.3 Complexation and dimerization
Before the proteins can bind the promoter region, they first have to make complexes. cI and penI form homodimers, while LuxR first forms a heterodimer with AHL and afterwards forms a homodimer with another LuxR/AHL dimer. This next part will describe the kinetics of such complexation. We only need the parameters of LuxR and cI, because the Hill function found for penI already was adapted for the protein in monomer form.

Munich,2018,Team:Munich#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," TXTL qPCR protocol (add link).   We used two selected cell extracts (P15 and E10), which reached similar phage titers compared to the commercial cell extract  (myTXTL) in previous experiments.    We compared the replication potential in comparison to myTXTL.
The addition of dNTP to the reference reaction leads to an increase in DNA concentration by a factor of 15 in the reaction after 4 hours (290 ng compared to 19 ng). This is higher than in the myTXTL reaction without additional dNTPs, where a 1.8-fold increase in DNA (91 ng compared to 51 ng) after the 4-hour reaction is observed.  The home-made cell extracts P10 and E15 however do not resemble this behavior.
It would be desirable to increase DNA amplification in our cell extracts. We therefore conducted a cause analysis, focusing on the T7 replication system. A more than 250-fold increase in processivity of the T7 DNA polymerase is achieved by its binding behavior to E. coli thioredoxin1. We suspected reduced presence of this factor in our cell extract. Thioredoxin could be added to a phage assembly reaction to further test these assumptions. However, our proteome analysis did not confirm that there were low levels of thioredoxin present in our cell extract.
DNA replication within cell extracts, E15 and P15 are self-prepared cell extracts, which reached similar phage titers compared to the commercial cell extract (myTXTL). ctrl = control without dNTPs.
Modular Bacteriophage Composition
Bacteriophage modularity can be achieved by protein engineering without changing the genomic DNA of the bacteriophage and synthetic genome engineering.
Protein engineering
His-YFP-HOC protein structure.
In the TXTL system, it should be possible to modify phage proteins without altering their genome. This was attempted by modifying HOC (highly immunogenic capsid protein), which is part of the capsid protein structure of the T4-phage. Therefore, His-TEV-YFP-HOC was separately expressed and the purified protein was applied to our phage assembly. 5
For protein modification of the T4 capsid protein HOC, a plasmid for protein expression was cloned and His-YFP-HOC (82kDa) was expressed. The plasmid was transformed into BL21, expressed and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration.

The assembly product has no restriction sites for Bsa1 but is flanked by inverted, convergently orientated BpiI sites. The Level one acceptor must be chosen according to which position the construct will occupy in the prospective level two construct (see Figure 4).
Figure 3: Level two cloning allows assembly of multiple, whole transcriptional units into one construct in a single step. The Bpi1I sites are convergent on each level 1 part and divergent on the level 2 acceptor, therefore will be removed by the process of cloning. The product of this assembly is multiple transcriptional units within a level 2 acceptor, creating a level two, multigene construct in which neither Bsa1 nor Bpi1 restriction sites remain.
Multiple level one constructs can be assembled into a multi gene (level 2) construct whilst still maintaining high efficiency. “Endlinkers” join the compatible overhang of the final construct to the GGGA of the level 2 acceptor, according to the number of genes in the assembly as shown below. “Dummies “can also be used to substitute for any position.
Figure 4: Design of a level 2 cloning reaction showing the Endlinker to be used according to the number of genes within the construct.
What antibiotic selection for successful clones does Golden Gate exploit?
The antibiotic resistance of the acceptors is different for each level, allowing selection of the new, desired construct. This is also standardised: level 1 acceptors are carbenicillin/ ampicillin resistant and level 0 and 2 acceptors are spectinomycin resistant.
Domestication of the parts is required before use in Golden Gate cloning reactions. This involves removing internal recognition sites already in the part to prevent internal overhangs from annealing to desired overhangs, creating incorrect assemblies.
What is Golden Gate's technology niche within synthetic biology?
Whilst BioBrick assembly is a powerful tool in Synthetic Biology due to the large quantity of standardised parts available through the Registry, genetic assembly of complex multigene constructs using conventional cloning is time consuming as only two parts can be assembled in each reaction. Golden Gate technology is a reliable alternative, which can dramatically speed up the assembly of larger constructs as multiple modules can be assembled in a single dig-lig reaction. Development of the MoClo standard allows laboratories to access the increasing number of available parts, allowing research collaboration.

Also, what  risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant  to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
The effect of mutation part may be enlarged to get more kinds of goal strains, so more uncertain factors will be added in.The possibility of new type of bacteria’s birth will increase sharply.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
(For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis,etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
Yes.All of bacteria that contain mutation part is auxotrophic.One of special genes of them has been knocked out so they can hardly survive in normal environment.In addition,our part of mutation stimulator will be destroyed in high temperature so as to get rid of spreading.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?

J23106 perform best in                     the group. We compared the effect of pucL together in this group.
As for YgfU, we have mentioned that we couldn’t detect the protein expression via SDS-PAGE. We constructed the part BBa_K2334006,                     which consists of K2334004 (J23100 + RiboJ + B0034 + YgfU, Urate Transporter Generator) and K2334001                     (J23100 + RiboJ + B0034 + pucL, Urate Oxidase Generator).
We tested the function of YgfU by detecting the urate concentration in the overnight cultured LB medium. In this experiment,                     we used pucL(K2334001), pucL + YgfU(K2334004), eGFP(J23100 + RiboJ + B0034 + eGFP, not submitted) in                     pSB1C3 vector (transformed E. coli BL21). The result shows that, those constructions can’t reduce the                     urate concentration in the LB medium (Figure 6).
Figure 6 pucL, YgfU + pucL & eGFP were cultivated in urate LB medium overnight (Urate concentration was about 500uM). The                     initial OD600 of the LB medium was controlled at 0.02. Urate concentration in the LB medium was detected                     by HPLC. The values we showed are the raw peak area data.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"onged approach to combating malaria we had the pleasure to talk to is Dr. Andrew Hammond, one of the leading researchers in the field of malaria control through genetic based technologies. He is postdoctoral researcher at the Imperial College in London. Dr. Andrew Hammond helped pushing our project further by sharing his expertise on project development and legislature with us. He especially gave us a lot of suggestions regarding the experimental design, for example in conducting mosquito experiments and testing odour baits. We got an overview of possible locations for the S.H.I.E.L.D. to be placed for maximal impact. Specifically close to possible breeding sites, such as stagnant freshwater, close to bushes and on the outside of houses by eaves are optimal locations to ensure mosquitoes are eliminated before they get in contact with residents. The latter would allow us to use the natural odours that emanate from households through  the eaves  to lure in the mosquitoes in addition to our bait system, and eliminating them with our trap before they actually enter the houses.
We would like to thank everyone who gave us their priceless input in order to help us improve our project and its implementation even further.
Student Research Center Hamburg
Since we know how important it is to spark interests at an early age, we wanted to promote knowledge about life sciences and synthetic biology, as well as share our passion for science in general. What better place to do so than Hamburg’s Student Research Center (Schülerforschungszentrum, SFZ)?
Founded in 2017, the Student Research Center is a relatively young institution that gives students of all ages from different schools the chance to work on their individual research projects in their free time. Since the biology and biochemistry lab is not ready yet, we had the opportunity to advise how to equip the lab. We have also planned project days for students once the lab is fully equipped.
We were delighted to give a presentation on synthetic biology, iGEM and our project on the first ever Pizza Friday, an event where all students and advisors working at the SFZ come together to exchange information about their projects. Afterwards, we had a lively discussion with the students. In the long-term, we are available as mentors to students doing research at the SFZ and to help with questions they might have about their projects.
Who knows, with our help there might even be an iGEM Hamburg high school team in a couple of years.

Windstott Farm
Genoa, NY
Windstott Farm has robotic milking machines, unlike other farms. We spoke to Bill Kilcer, the owner. Robot farms require very little human interaction - cows step into the machine as they need to, and sensors detect the teats before latching on. We watched the process and noticed that the iodine spray was automatically sprayed after milking, unlike other farms where a person had applied it manually. Bill told us that our ideas of having a temperature sensor and iodine spray built into the shell were already incorporated into the robots. He also said that our app would not be helpful for him because all the metrics that the milk samples are tested for, such as conductivity, temperature, and amount of fat and protein, are already stored in a computer. In addition, there was no need for CowMD since most of the farmers do not need information about symptoms. This feedback made us realize that our idea would be most helpful for bigger traditional dairy farms.

Scipio Springs Dairy
Union Springs, NY
Scipio Springs Dairy is a large farm with 800 cows. We met with Bill Morgan, who looks over the operations of the dairy farm, and the herd manager of the farm. Bill was interested in implementing bacteriocins on his farm instead of traditional antibiotics. He was impressed by our modular idea for the shell because he believed that it was an all-encompassing prevention to bovine mastitis. Bill believed that the UV light would be a great alternative to the traditional use of heat because heat changes the functionality of the proteins in the milk as well as the milk’s flavor. He liked the temperature sensor idea because Gram-negative infections  typically cause an increase in temperature. Bill Morgan was supportive of our idea, and was interested in testing our prototype and app once we finalized them.

Ithaca, NY
Dairy One is a dairy data management company that assists farmers in making farming decisions. We spoke with John Tauzel and James Zimmermann for feedback on our app. Dairy One supported the Somatic Cell Counter idea because it is convenient and innovative. For the cost calculator, they noted that calculating the overall profit/loss of the farm would be more beneficial than looking at individual cows. They suggested that the cow data show the effectiveness of the farmer’s practices, so that the farmer can review productivity and make long-term decisions.

We showed that it is toxic to E. coli RP437 ∆FliC but not MG1655. This adds to the argument presented in the original literature that Microcin S’ antimicrobial capacity is narrow-spectrum and has some degree of strain specificity. More cells are killed at 30°C than 37°C, likely a combination of higher peptide efficiency and lower growth rate at that temperature.

From the data we can clearly draw 2 conclusions: 1. MccS is more toxic to RP437 than MG1655, to the extent where even low induction (0.002% arabinose) inhibits cell growth in RP437 almost entirely. 2. MccS appears more toxic at 30°C than 37°C.

Introduction
Guiding Questions
How much GSR to maintain in the lens? (GSR Function)
How to maintain that amount of GSR using nanoparticles and eyedrops? (Delivery Prototype)
Focus of Models
Since our construct is not directly placed into the eyes, how our synthesized protein impacts the eye after it is separately transported into the lens is of greater importance.  As a result, we create models with the intent on understanding how GSR and CH25H impacts the eye, and how we can control its impact with a well-designed delivery prototype.
Figure 4.0: Overall Modeling Approach. We go in reverse order, starting with our final goal, to lower LOCS, and go backwards to find the amount of GSR needed, then to find the delivery prototype to deliver this amount of GSR.
Prevention: GSR Function
Model 1: Crystallin Damage
The amount of damage to crystallin by H2O2 determines the severity of a cataract (Spector 1993). We relate the amount of crystallin damage to the corresponding rating on the LOCS scale, used by physicians to rate cataract severity. Our goal is to lower LOCS to below 2.5, the threshold for surgery. Through literature research as well as our own experimental data, we find the maximum allowable crystallin damage to prevent a LOCS 2.5 cataract from developing.
Measurement of Cataract Severity
There are three ways of measuring cataract severity, each used for a different purpose.
Lens Optical Cataract Scale (LOCS): Physicians use this scale, from 0 – 6, to grade the severity of cataracts (Domínguez-Vicent 2016).
Absorbance at 397.5 nm: This is the experimental method, used by our team in the lab (c.d.)
Crystallin Damage: This is a chemical definition. We quantify cataract severity as a function of how much oxidizing agents there are, as well as how long crystallin is exposed to oxidizing agents. (Cui X.L. 1993)
When we add GSR into the system, crystallin damage decreases (Cui X.L. 1993). Our goal is to find the equivalent crystallin damage that leads to a LOCS 2.5 cataract, in order to know how much"

We did colony PCRs with biobrick primers 31 and 32. We also made cultures of yesterday's transformations: pC13D+pK13AL, pC13D+pCp13X #3 in pSB1C3, pC13D+pC13K #1 in pSB1C3, pC13W with GC #3, pC13W no GC #3, and PpelA in pSB1C3. A gel was run to see if the ligations were successful. pC13D+pC13X,  PpelA, pC13W GC 3.1 and 3.5, and pC13W nGC 3.1 all looked like they worked. The pA13AM+pC13E ligation from yesterday was transformed and plated. G. lucidum GPD homology regions were cloned, column purified, and digested with EcoRI and Pst.  pC13F was also digested with EcoRI and Pst. Unfortunately, digestions of the homology regions yielded no DNA, but digestion of pC13F did yield some and thus was dephosphorylated. There was not enough template from the PCR cleanup present for homology regions, so PCRs were redone for each homology region.
Ligation of the PpelA promoter, hygromycin resistance, and T7 promoter in front of the herbicide-resistance bar gene worked. We continued cloning of our other constructs and repeated PCRs of G. lucidum GPD homology regions.

BNU-China,2018,Team:BNU-China#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," to quantitatively figure out the extent of increase in E.coli’s growth rate with the influence of  a certain amount of glucose dehydrogenase. Because of the great complexity of knowing and simulating the whole promoting process,  our model only focuses on the steps influenced by the promoter, who serves as an enzyme in cellular respiration. Both the enzyme and the substrate moves randomly in the E.coli, which induced us to a 3-dimensional random walk model. The initial substrate concentration is set fixed throughout experiments, while the concentration of enzyme (i.e. the growth-promoter glucose dehydrogenase) varies among different situations, simulation with programming is done, and the average combination ratio can be calculated.
This value is then used as the adjustment multiplier of E.coli’s individual growth rate, since their combination stands for the happening of enzymatic reaction. By treating the substrate-enzyme combination rate as a quantified value of E.coli’s growth promoting effect, we further incorporate this term as the change of individual growth rate (no units), which means, the greater this value is, E. coli shall experience a faster growth, and the promoting effect changes, under various content of intercellular glucose dehydrogenase, as follows.
Gene expression level
Following the steps mentioned above, the composition of E.coli population at each time is well known. Our goal now is to find out the relationship between individual plasmid number and the recombinant gene expression level.
We absorbed the queue theory in operational research, by treating the nutrients as customers, and the plasmid in each E.coli as the service station. Given the E.coli’s average nutrient intaking capacity, as well as the plasmid processing rate, the amount of nutrients taken by E.coli and processed by each plasmid are known. Then, with different intracellular plasmid numbers between different groups, the processing ability between individual E.coli can vary, indicating a bigger velocity of reaction with a greater number of plasmids contained.
However, more plasmids can leads to decreasing amount of allocated nutrients on average. Since the E.coli’s nutrient intake ability is fixed,  more plasmid within means less nutrients sent to each of them, this will on the other hand, leads to a decrease in target gene expression level of each plasmid.
Programming goes along with theoretical deductions, by setting the time step as one second, E.coli’s nutrient intake ability is set as at most 10 units, and the plasmid’s average processing ability is 2 units at a time, under"

     The second activity was that our team member                                         organized a game which can help children strongly remember what is the best time                                         to go to sleep. The rule of the game was a little bit like musical chair. We                                         just replaced the music into slogan “It’s 10 o’clock”. There was a research                                         showed 10 o’clock in the evening is the best time to sleep. Thus we made                                         students enforce their sensitive to “10 o’clock”.
     The third activity was a team member telling                                         students what is a sleep pattern. The sleep pattern was told in a understandable                                         way by describing a boy’s sleep process. Students asked a lot of meaningful                                         question such as why we dream. We told them there was two period of our sleeping                                         process: one is rapid eye movement, the other one is non-rapid eye movement. I                                         believe they fully understand the two periods.
     The last activity was a game to made a clock by                                         the cardboard. We would like to let the students arrange their time of the day.
     The class attracted many children and their                                         parents. In the class, kids gained knowledge about sleep, understood the                                         importance of sleep and let the kids know how to reasonably arrange their daily                                         schedule. After the class, the parents and the children asked lots of questions                                         related to scientific sleep. Our team members explained to them patiently.
     No doubt that sleep is a significant part of our                                         daily life. Thus, we hoped to do our bits to raise the children’s awareness                                         about the sleep and encourage them to be curious in our project, particularly                                         when our project is so close to everyone’s daily life.
02.  Library Exhibition
     Nowadays many Chinese don't know what is transgenic technology, and some rumors                                         from the Internet convince them that transgenosis is extremely harmful to human.                                         As many Chinese don't have objective an understanding about transgenic                                         technology, we think it's our duty to publicize correct concepts about it.

Warsaw,2009,Team:Warsaw#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," the medium the expression of all genetic circuits is inactive. After temperature increase to 42°C the system is activated by thermal deactivation of cI. Genes from invasion operon are transcribed. They maintain their own expression, cause internalisation of E. coli by mammalian cells and enable escape from endosome. When bacterial cell is inside the endosome the endosome detection module is activated by phoP/phoQ system. In trans expression of regulatory genes cI and tetR deactivates invasion operon and activates cytoplasmic operon. However its genes are not expressed as long as bacterial cell is inside endosome due to cro protein activity. When bacterium escapes from the endosome, the transcription from endosome detection operon is repressed and cytoplasmic operon genes are expressed.
Conjugation with mitochondria.
To place the copy of the mitochondrial genome into bacterial cell the pBACrNESd plasmid will be used. It is built basing the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome. Replication origin (ori R6K), kanamycin resistance gen (kanR) and replication complex genes (repE, parA, parC) from pBACrNESd plasmid will be fused with origin of transfer (oriTF) from natural conjugative F plasmid. Unique restriction site will be introduced to the mitochondrial genome by PCR reaction and the described gene construct will be inserted into mitochondrion. To enable conjugation proteins encoded on RP4 plasmid (Tc, MuKm, Tn7) will be placed in the cytoplasmic operon. These genes are responsible for pillus formation and transport of single stranded DNA. The cell with this system will conjugate with any structure surround by lipid bilayer. We will prepare mitochondrial DNA deficient cells using procedure described in [2]. The occurrence of conjugation will be confirmed by PCR reaction specific for sequences added to mitochondrial DNA. The quality of the DNA will be determined by analysis of restriction patterns. The expression of mitochondrial genes will be confirmed by semiquantitative time PCR [2].

Also the DNA which had been extracted the previous day (miniprepped) was sent for sequencing to confirm the identity of the construct before going on to testing it.

The amount of phages in the solution is calculated by: PFU/ml = number of plaques x dilution factor x 1000 e.g. 12 blue plaques are counted on a plate quarter where 1 µl of a 10-4 phage dilution was plated.
12 x 104 x 1000 = 1.2 x 108 PFU/ml

Synchronizing the oscillations at a population level
In order to make our system easier to observe, we need to extend and synchronize the oscillations at a population scale. The best way to do so is to insert a check-point that can be overcome only if the major part of the population has reached it. The phenomenon of quorum-sensing is the way bacteria synchronize the expression of genes when the density of bacteria is important enough.

The Hawaiian bobtail squid have a symbiotic relationship with Vibrio fischeri
Presentation of the phenomenon of quorum-sensing : intercellular communication in bacterias
The phenomenon of quorum sensing was first discovered in Vibrio fischeri. This bacteria only expresses luciferase when the density of bacteria is very high (1011bact/mL). Typically, the bacteria does not express bioluminescence when they are free living in the ocean. At the contrary, they express luciferase when they are highly concentrated in the photophore of Hawaiian bobtail squid.
Fig 1 : Quorum sensing in V. fischeri. (Red triangle represent AHL produced by LuxI. OM : Outer Membrane, IM : Inner Membrane
The genetic cascade
In this system, LuxI and LuxR control the expression of luciferase operon luxICDABE, necessary to produce bioluminescence. LuxI synthesize small diffusible molecules called Acyl Homoserin Lactone (AHL). LuxR is the intracellular receptor to AHL.
The AHL freely diffuses into the extracellular medium. Its concentration increases as the population gets more dense. When the concentration reaches a critical level, those small molecules bind to their receptor. LuxR bound to AHL and the complex activate the operon that code for luc"
TU-Eindhoven,2018,Team:TU-Eindhoven#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," more influential for nutrient concentrations because of the small differences for varying amounts of cells. In fact, we later realized that this parameter is not worth investigating. The concentration of nutrients reaching the exudate (and in that sense the S. aureus through the gel is not relevant, because exudate is already incredibly soaked with nutrients. This is why deeper wounds get infected more quickly than more superficial wounds in the first place. In wounds where blood vessels are close to the surface, a lot of small molecules are pushed out of the bloodstream producing exudate. Blood is full of nutrients and this way the exudate is as well.
The most important feature why we established this model, enough lysostaphin expression within a hydrogel seeded with bacteria, does not come forward very well unfortunately. The concentrations of lysostaphin that are shown on the selected surface where these concentrations matters most, at the border of gel and exudate, are strikingly low. This does not meet our expectations at all. With the lysostaphin production per cell found with model 2  and the moderately high diffusion constant we calculated, we expected to reach MBEC at some point with some amount of cells. Since the experiment shown in the model for Production of Lysostaphin clearly showed cells are capable of reaching MBEC after some time. We think this result in the model is caused by our blood boundary condition. Because we put the boundary condition that in the blood the lysostaphin concentration should go to zero, this 'sucks' the lysostaphin from the exudate and the gel. In hindsight it is not logical to put a boundary condition of zero there. Proteins, even smaller ones, go through the thin wall of cells of the blood vessels very poorly. So even though the blood flows away from a wound, carrying away all that diffuses to it, lysostaphin should not have been included here. This would greatly increase the model's lysostaphin concentration on the border of gel and exudate, agreeing with the results we got from the experiments: MBEC can be reached for S. aureus by lysostaphin that is produced by E. coli.
For future modelling there should be done more experiments to increase the accuracy of certain constants used in this model. Other models we established were also partly used in this model, but their individual inaccuracy was already discussed separately. Improving the first model will already improve the accuracy of the properties of the gel and this way indirectly diffusion constants on which this model relies.
Conclusion
Considering the inaccuracies in model parameters due to"

TP_CC-SanDiego,2015,Team:TP CC-SanDiego#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," we have compiled a general guidebook and a guide to basic lab protocols and procedures to assist new iGEM teams.  Beyond our mission of increasing high school participation in iGEM in our area, we hope to increase elementary and middle school students’ exposure to synthetic biology. This can be done through demonstrations of basic lab protocols and procedures, as well as lectures on basic synthetic biology knowledge. In particular, interactive, hands-on experiences can generate great interest in young minds. By presenting these opportunities, we can help cultivate their interest in biology at a young age.

We were contacted and interviewed by a reporter of the San Diego Union Tribune, Mr. Pat Maio, due to our First Runner Up award at last year’s High School Jamboree. He asked us about our project and how we plan on using it to better San Diego county, California, the United States, and the world as a whole.
ZENGER MAGAZINE
We published an article in a joint Torrey Pines High School and The Bishop’s School Zenger Political Magazine regarding synthetic and molecular biology. The main focus of this article was again GMOs. We also discussed how our project, given its use of a natural mechanism, chitinase, is a better and more efficient way of combating fungal diseases and protecting against insects."

Note that agarose gel mixture should be clear before pouring into the mold.
Used 100bp and 1kbp ladders from NEB, called ""Quick Load,"" which appeared to already have loading dye.  Applied 15uL of each in the wells.  Also added 5.6uL of 10x loading dye to each tube, which contained around 50uL of restriction digest.  This gave a final volume of 55.6uL, of which approximately 10% was loading dye.  Decided to only use 2/3 of each tube, so only applied two wells of 18uL apiece for each, leaving about 18uL left in each.  Voltage setting was 104 volts.

Note that one must add 300uL of QG for every 100mg of gel.

Starting weight = 1.0060g
End weight = 1.0518g
=> Weight of gel = 0.0458g
=> used 137.4uL of QG
Combined volume: 350.4uL
J63002 tube #1:
Starting weight = 1.0047g
End weight = 1.1069g
=> Weight of gel = 0.1022g

After dissolving the gel in QG, the two tubes for each part were combined into a single column to be spun down.  Note that 50uL of EB was used to elute each column.  The results of the extraction were placed in the freezer at -20 degrees Celsius.
In addition to the extraction for these two parts, also started two liquid cultures, each from a separate colony on the P0501 plate.  Placed these cultures inthe incubator around 8:45 pm.  Should take them out around 10:45 am tomorrow for making gly"
IISc_Bangalore,2016,Team:IISc Bangalore#Experiments_-_-_TEXT.html," from that point, progress only hastened, from one only one recombinant pharmaceutical  approved for human use (insulin) in 1982 to one hundred and fifty-one FDA approved protein based recombinant pharmaceuticals by 2009 [1] . Despite being in high demand (due to the fact that most recombinant products produced on an industrial scale are therapies for chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes), recombinant products are expensive due to several factors like long and expensive development time, high failure rate (~80%) of the products developed, manufacturing costs requiring expensive technologies and processes (bioreactors, column chromatography, sterile conditions, etc) and the involvement of skilled labor on both the manufacturing and the healthcare provider’s side [2] . Treatments with these pharmaceuticals can cost from around 10,000 to 100,000 € per year for a single patient[2]. As scientists and engineers, it seems obvious that our contribution can be most easily and effectively be made at the level of manufacturing costs; to try to bring down the cost of these life-saving products.

Bioreactor design
We realized that manufacturing units use expensive and energy expensive machinery [3] . Hence, we engineered our bacteria in such a way that it could do most of the work done by these monstrous machines so that we no longer have to buy them and pay their bills. To increase the yield of the product, we came up with the idea of separating cell growth and target protein production so that when the cells have grown up to a high enough cell density, they shuttle all their energy towards the required protein production [4] . Based on the above ideas, we came up with the design of our bioreactor.
We realized that we would not be able to work on the whole idea this summer so, we focussed on two modules of our design: the Protein production module and the auto-aggregation module leaving the arresting of cell growth for future iGEM teams as a seed for their ideas.

Protein production
Induction synthesis of protein of interest is another important step. Microorganisms in bioreactors are induced at the OD, at which the protein production is maximum. [5] Because of this, factories install sophisticated machinery to keep track of the OD value of the culture so as to know when to induce the production. We wanted our bacteria to know when to start protein production and start it by itself. Hence, we used the lux quorum sensing system to sense this cell density. [6] We have expressed the gene for our protein of interest under the lux"

Motivation
One of the main goals of synthetic biology is to create a modular genetic basis for the independent control of circuit behavior properties. Much progress has been made in achieving this aim for properties like gene expression strength (where well-characterized ribosome binding sites (RBSs) can be swapped within a genetic part), circuit architecture (where promoters can be swapped out to introduce connections and feedback architectures), and even gene expression noise (through a combination of the above two modulations). However, in order to move into the next phase of synthetic biology, we need to be able to control the dynamical properties of circuits— we want to move beyond circuits that focus on endpoint, steady-state values and explore the rich variety of dynamical systems. Fundamentally, gaining controlling of dynamical systems implies gaining control of temporal dynamics.
Currently, there is no good way to control the temporal dynamics of gene expression. Current control strategies require either a rewiring of the circuit architecture to achieve different time-dependent dynamics [1, 2] or a complete circumvention of transcriptional circuitry altogether, relying on post-translational dynamics like phosphorylation [3] or protein-protein interactions [4] to transmit information through a circuit. These approaches are often inaccessible to iGEM teams because they require too drastic an overhaul of existing circuit implementations. To alleviate this issue, and to enable future iGEM teams to create robust dynamical circuits, we created a protein degradation based ‘plug-and-play’ style system that allows modular and predictable control of the gene expression speed of a given circuit without requiring a fundamental redesign of existing circuit architecture.
Degradation Based Control of Gene Expression Speed
The relationship between the degradation rate of a gene's protein product and the response speed of its expression is a well-established concept in the theoretical biology community. Consider the following simple mathematical model presented by Uri Alon [5]. X is an inducible gene which, once activated, produces its protein product x at rate α. If x is degraded at rate γ, then we can use the following differential equation to track"
UCL_London,2011,Team:UCL London#HumanPractices#Experts_-_-_TEXT.html," self-funded summer internship. He suggested that since industry was the eventual benefactor of the competition, it would not matter if the BioBrick Registry was privatised or superseded by a commercial database.
Jane Gregory , Senior Lecturer in Science and Technology Studies at UCL , is optimistic about the future of synthetic biology, explaining that important lessons have been learnt about public consultation from past controversies such as that around genetically modified food in the UK. Jane also argued that the open principles involved in iGEM towards access to information and the library of parts paves the way for fairer regulatory decisions around synthetic biology.
In this way, iGEM presents a positive image of synthetic biology to those involved in the competition, but there is little evidence that from our research that this reaches beyond the confines of the competition.
Jack Stilgoe , Senior Research Fellow in Responsible Innovation at the University of Exeter, sees a different side to the open ethos of the competition, asserting that it could be seen as a method of distancing from other synthetic biology movements such as that initiated by Craig Venter, where there has been a focus on establishing private patents. Jack explains that transparency in science can be used to ward off future criticism of political aims, beyond its stated aim of fostering a collaborative community.
Jack also highlighted the importance of considering the issues arising both today and in the future. He explained that current research is in processes rather than products, so although you cannot ‘buy’ synthetic biology now, it still raises important issues. At the same time, the future possibilities of synthetic biology are being discussed, on the scale of a new industrial revolution.
Transparency within MIT’s vision of synthetic biology allows the creation of a distinct sociological image as well as a scientific one. This indicates a new appreciation of modern science communication and engagement methods, where openness and collaboration are highly regarded. perhaps iGEM is a powerful marketing tool for synthetic biology, and perpetuates its image as a field on the bleeding edge of productive research.
Melissa Lewis and Meher Antia , Science Portfolio Advisers for the Wellcome Trust ,  described how they allocate iGEM stipend funding in their annual application process. They explained that they allocate funding to teams who prioritise the educational experience for their students. We asked why iGEM is a worthy cause for funding, and they explained that the competition is an opportunity for scientists to broaden their experience. UK synthetic biology research lags behind that of our US counterparts, and the focus of the Wellcome trust is to build capacity for future high-level research. Meher explained that exaggeration of the potential of synthetic biology has"

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," replicate on its own until it enters the lytic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the bacterium is used to create parts of the phage which are then assembled. (3) The phages create two enzymes, hollins, which perforate the plasma membrane, and lysins, which attack the cell wall. The enzymes ultimately cause the bacteria to lyse. (2) Phage therapy works based on the bacteriophages’ ability to lyse specific bacteria while not harming eukaryotic cells.
Early Drawbacks:
The early founders of phage therapy made many mistakes that ultimately led to antibiotic treatments being favored over phage therapy. The main issue was a lack of information about bacteriophages. While some at the time believed that they were viruses, many of the studies hinted at phages being an enzyme that was created by the bacteria. (4) The lack of knowledge also led to very inconsistent reports causing Eaton, Bayne, and Jones to write a report which deemed the technique no better than prior treatments.(4) Also, phages are very specific, making it difficult to kill the correct bacteria with the correct phages using the technology of the time. (5) The lack of research and understanding also led to impurities being injected into patients, further infecting them, and denaturing the bacteriophages during isolation leaving them inactive. Finally, the researchers faced the issue of the phages being rapidly eliminated by the body and were unable to prevent it.
Solutions
Due to the overuse of antibiotics, alternative treatments like phage therapy have been sought. Fortunately, modern technology has had more success with phages than the discoverers. Thanks to scientific advances, many of the original problems have been solved, and phages are now even superior to antibiotics in many ways.  First, phages can be very specific and can be programmed to target only the virulent bacteria so as to not damage the microbiomes or probiotics. (1) Modern technology has also allowed for the easy and effective isolation of phages without disrupting their function. In addition, while the body metabolizes antibiotics, lytic bacteriophages are constantly replicating in the host bacteria and thus grow exponentially in number. (1) Phages have also been identified with coat proteins that are harder for the body to identify as foreign. This allows the phages to stay in circulation longer and until they reach the lytic cycle and quickly kill the bacteria. (5) There is also much less risk of resistant bacteria forming as only the target bacteria will be infected while the others remain untouched. This is very different"

Plant Promoter Project
As plants are still novel organisms for most of synthetic biology, we we are interested in developing methods of control for our projects. Currently the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter is the most widely used plant promoter. In hopes of increasing the availability of plant promoters, our project aims at testing viral promoters due to their relative efficiency, as well as cytoskeletal protein promoters due to their natural abundance.  Testing these promoters in parallel with the CaMV 35S will create a plant promoter catalog which can be used for future iGEMers exploration of plant synthetic biology.

Introduction
Synthetic Biology is still a new field with many opportunities for characterization and regulation.  The discovery that DNA could be transferred between organisms occurred in 1946, and the first plant was genetically modified in 1983 (1).  Since then, most synthetic biology has dealt with bacteria rather than plants.  Bacteria are prokaryotic, simple organisms and the procedures for their genetic modification are shorter.  Consequently, eukaryotic organisms, especially plants, have an enormous amount of untapped potential  (2).  Genetic “parts” for plant organisms are limited and often poorly characterized.  Under-developed parts prevent many great scientific ideas for plants from ever getting off the ground.
Among the limitations of working with plants Penn State iGEM noticed that only one promoter was commonly available for expression of proteins in plants: CMV 35s promoter.  Since in Eukaryotic organisms the promoter is currently the primary source of variable expression, a wider variety of characterized promoters would be very useful.  Penn State iGEM aims to modestly characterize several plant promoters for enhanced expression regulation in plant synthetic biology.

For quick     determination of functionality of the parts these two evaluations are     important so they have been included in the proposed standardization     template. But, as they were not properly used up to now for the re-organization     of the parts information during the development of our software application     we had to include all parts to our queries regardless of their evaluations     based on “Group Favorites” and “ StarRatings”

Today we finished with the western blot for our media samples, but unfortunately, there was a lot of background in the picture. We are attempting to block longer and wash our equipment better to reduce the background.
Thursday September 20th
Today we reattempted to take our media samples through the western blot process. We ran them on an SDS-PAGE gel and plan to complete the process tomorrow.
We finished the DpnI digest of the SDM from yesterday, and also digested fixed parts from previous rounds of SDM. We digested K206000 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase in both an aerobically-adapted and anaerobically-adapted form, J23101 + B0034 + Reductase + B0034 + Dehydrogenase in an anaerobic form, pelB + Cutinase + His, and K206000 + B0034 + pelB + Cutinase + His at Eco and Pst. We did this specific digestion so that we could put these parts (which are currently in a pSB1A3 backbone into the pSB1C3 backbone which is the requirement for BioBrick parts for this year. We ligated these parts together with the new backbone, and transformed them into DH5α. We transformed K206000 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 and J23101 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 into DH5α, MG1655, and Strain E-15 EG3. We continued the Tecan experiment from yesterday. We went through all of the EMS replates to see the amounts of colonies and documented how many there were. We also transformed the J23101/K206000 + B0034 + Dehydrogenase + B0015 constructs into MG1655, DH5α, and Strain E-15 EG3. Transformations of mutants into MG6155 done.

Our group was at first focusing on the role of microRNA in diagnosing colorectal cancer, however through the interview we realized that the technique can be always developed as a tool for treatments. We modified the methods, and had a second trial.
Self-improvement
Without realizing the medical ethics protocols behind, we formerly planned to borrow real rejected patients’ tissues from the hospitals, which provide an ideal environment to measure the expression of mir-21 in colorectal cancer patients. However, after the interviews with Professor Zhou and Professor Rui Xu and a careful review of iGEM’s guidelines, we became aware of the challenging, time-assuming and ethical aspects of this plan in light of the complex procedures that we have to complete in order to borrow and perform experiments on human tissue. For this reason, we reformed our plans and instead created environments containing varied concentration of mir-21, which simulated the varying amount of the miRNA in different human bodies and enabled us to better test and observe the potential of mir-21 sponge to be used as cancer detectors in various environments. The interviews also shed lights on the long way to come if we want to use mir-21 sponge in further researches
Visiting to biomedical testing center
At the end our first trial, we visited Kindstar Global, a biomedical testing center, to learn about techniques relating to our projects. The sophisticated machines were fascinating. Moreover, through our visit to the testing center, we were able to get a clearer idea how the merits as well as limitations of the testing and prospect the future of microRNA biomarkers as a tool for testing.
Public Education
In mid July, we visited a local science center and gave short speeches to people pertaining basic information on colorectal cancer, current treatments, and, of course, our approaches to tackle this challenge. In this experience, raising public awareness of colorectal cancer is attempted. At the same time, some team members also scattered and distributed hand fans to people, on which basic information on prevention of the cancer and recommendation of doing regular checks were printed.
Team Wechat Accout
We also kept the account on WeChat Subscription from the 2017 Worldshaper-Wuhan team. Every happening event and works done will be updated and news about iGEM, colorectal cancer or synthetic biology will be shared on the account. Since there are large amount of people in China who browse through WeChat every day, this account is our window to the public.

Biofiltration & Functionalizing Mycotecture
Clean water is vital. A self-assembling habitat for extraterrestrial exploration is simply not stable without a sustainable, regularly filtered water supply, and access to clean water remains one of the largest challenges humanity will face in the upcoming future, whether it’s in space or on earth. Another challenge is metal acquisition, whether from waste electronics or martian regolith. We developed a cost-effective, scalable, completely biodegradable filtration system for waste metal recovery from aqueous solution, using copper as a proof of concept. We first modified metal binding domains through computationally-aided rational design, and tested multiple in tandem to increase the binding capacity of our peptides. We then created metal binding domain - chitin binding domain (CBD) fusion proteins, using the CBD as a platform for functionalizing the mycelium surface and enhancing its properties. We quantitatively characterized and modeled the binding affinity of the individual domains to rigorously understand the molecular underpinnings of the filter. We finally created a tangible, functioning prototype composed of filter strips of pure mycelial material that removes >92% of the copper from a >300 μM aqueous solution within 30 minutes through surface adsorption and tangential flow, demonstrating the viability and utility of our novel process for filtration and biomining applications, both on earth and in space.
Mission Architecture
Mission architecture involves designing and planning a mission.
The goal of our mission was framed around giving other missions feasibility  by giving them the ability to work in places that might be too dangerous on the surface by providing a protected environment which our mycelium structure would provide.
The habitat is based around a 3 layered plastic dome, of which the outer layer is a layer of water which will freeze into ice, another shell encloses the cyanobacteria, and lastly the layer of mycelium. Each layer provides its own benefits. The ice water layer will be drawn from a pump which will melt subsurface ice water from our landing site, this layer provides insulation as well as providing radiation protection. Lastly this layer can be partially melted to provide water to our living cyanobacteria and fungus. The layer of cyanobacteria, suspended in a water solution will receive the sunlight which passes through the ice and use this energy it to break down carbon dioxide as well as molecular nitrogen, and create biologically available carbohydrates and nitrogen.

Sent a Collaboration Request and constructed an alliance to build a worldwide database.
We came up with the idea that we could gather all the iGEM teams whose projects were about water pollution treatment and built an alliance to unite all information and data concerning the social impacts, knowledge and geographical advantages they collected during the conduction of their project.
Built an alliance
On 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU/FAFU, during which we discussed about how we wanted to use this alliance, and the discussion led to 2 conclusions:
1. Build a worldwide database for the contents of heavy metals in local soil.
2. Mutually promote the social impact of each parties in this alliance.
Constructed a world-wide database
On 23th of August, we sent a Collaboration Request to iGEM official website. And the next day, Ana Sifuentes replied our message and posted our request in the iGEM official website.
we received the response of many teams like heretofore team EXETER and team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN. With their information, we constructed a database which contained the global data of contents of Cu2+/Cd2+ in soil or water. And we built it based on the world map. We received team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN's kindly help——they offered us information about major metal pollution incidents in Taiwan as well as the real time monitoring data of places that had the potential risk of occurrence of serious pollution incidents.

Bacterial Wall of Fame
Background
The discovery of the weedkiller glyphosate
Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) was first synthesized by the chemist Dr. Henri Martin in 1950, while working for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Cilag , which was founded in 1936 in Schaffhausen . Unfortunately (fortunately?), Dr. Martin did not find out that glyphosate may serve as a very efficient herbicide (see below).  About 20 years later, the American chemist Dr. John E. Franz who was working for the American company Monsanto (recently bought by Bayer ) observed that glyphosate specifically inhibits the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase in plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea (Figure 1) (1-4). The EPSP synthase generates the precursor for the de novo synthesis of aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine (5). Therefore, inhibition of the EPSP synthase by glyphosate results in the depletion of the cellular levels of aromatic amino acids and death of the organism that is treated with the weedkiller (Figure 1) (1,6-8).
Figure 1. Glyphosate that is present in Roundup specifically inhibits the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase (PDBid: 2QFU ), which converts shikimate-3-phosphate (S"

Edinburgh,2012,Team:Edinburgh#Project#Non-antibiotic-Markers#Plac-RFP-SacB_-_-_TEXT.html,": A quick test of SacB transformants' growth in the presence of sucrose. The growth of SacB (bottom) is inhibited near the well in comparison to the control (top).
Citrobacter freundii
SacB and control (pSB1C3 only) transformants were streaked onto LB plates (with either cml40 or cml15) and solid sucrose was added to the regions indicated by the crosses or circles in Figure 5. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Figure  5: A quick test of sacB and control’s ability to grow in the presence of sucrose. The zone of clearance indicates that the cells containing sacB are inhibited by sucrose while the controls are unaffected. The control on the plate on the right is purple due to both expressing the RFP gene and turning blue because of the X-gal on the plate.
The bottom streak on plate on the left in Figure 5 contains cells that have the selection-counterselection cassette so this test shows that the counterselection component of the cassette is working.
We also tested the selection component of this cassette by streaking the cells onto plates containing both chloramphenicol and kanamycin and incubated overnight. These results can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Plate showing that the kanamycin resistance component of the selection-counterselection cassette works. The control did not grow at all, even after 4 days, as it was inhibited by the kanamycin, while the cells containing the cassette show growth. Growth is weaker because we have found that using the concentration of chloramphenicol we normally use (cml40) in combination with the sacB in Citrobacter freundii causes slower growth, presumably because levansucrase expression is unregulated in these bacteria which puts a strain on the cell.
Sugar-dependent selection-counterselection cassette concept
The reason we did not use our sucrose hydrolase gene for the selection component of the selection-counterselection cassette was because both it and levansucrase depend on the same substrate – sucrose – for their function, so this would have not yielded good results.
We have found that Citrobacter freundii can use sucrose as a sole carbon source without the need for the sucrose hydrolase gene – this means that if we want to develop a non-antibiotic resistance-dependent selection-counterselection cassette for this organism, we need to use a different sugar. One sugar that, according to our findings, Citrobacter freundii cannot use is xylitol – see our ‘Xylitol de"

Pigments
In our project, we transfer five types of pigment-related gene sequences (Indigoidine, Zeaxanthin, Melanin, Astaxanthin and Lycopene) into our cyanobacterial cells. We expect to get five different colors of microalgae, so we could see whether adding other pigment colors to the original color of microalgae would add wavelength absorbance and have better photosynthetic efficiencies. Due to better photosynthetic efficiencies, we could elevate oil accumulation in microalgae, which would have great benefit in both industry and scientific usage.
Backbone Design (pPIGBACK)
To genetically engineer cyanobacteria, we chose Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 as our engineering host.       Our main strategy is to embark on gene double-crossover homologous recombination in S. elongatus PCC 7942 genome, which is the first cyanobacterial strain to be transformed by exogenous DNAs and is reliably transformable through natural uptake of extracellular DNAs.
First, we constructed a vector which is able to finish double-crossover homologous gene recombination in S. elongatus PCC 7942.       The vector (pPIGBACK) contains 5’- and 3’-ends of the neutral site II (NSII) and an ampicillin resistance gene (AmpR) for antibiotic selection.       Then we fused AmpR with double terminator, BBa_B0015, which is proved to be functional in cyanobacteria.       Additionally, to easily manipulate DNAs for gene cloning and plasmid preparation in E. coli DH5α, the replication origin (ORI) of pBR322 was also introduced to make the plasmid"

The second (and last day) had two interesting activities. The first was the meetings with different experts from the university, which privately asked each team about controversial issues. To see if these issues had been taken into account and the possible solutions and consequences were debated.
To close the event, a poster presentation session was held, which was very enriching to know how to present our project in Boston..
One of the things that were achieved in this meet up was the agreement with the UPF-CRG-Barcelona group to organize an activity in their meet up. Activity that is explained in the following session (and that gave rise to a greater collaboration).
Barcelona
Spanish Meet Up (Barcelona)
This meet up took place between Saturday 18 and Monday 20 August in the city of Barcelona and was organized by one of the two teams of this same city, the UPF-CRG-Barcelona. In it, all the teams from Spain were called, which all but the Valencia team attended. To this meet up they were representing the whole team: Laura, Iván and Francisco. The meet up took place in the Biomedical Research Park of Barcelona (PRBB), center where the host team operates and where they started with a welcome activity. This activity consisted of a game where each one of the assistants of each team presented themselves, so that the subsequent environment was much more relaxed.
The next activity was the one organized by our team. In this activity we proposed to carry out a collaborative guide in which each group would give the main ideas on how they have solved the main problems that have arisen in iGEM. The structure we proposed was followed. We collected these ideas and wrote a complete guide. We explain this collaboration in a later section of the collaborations. After this, some playful activities were carried out on the beach, including volleyball games.
During the morning of the second day, a more detailed presentation of each team's project was made. There was 30 minutes to expose each project in detail. This activity was very useful because the rest of the teams, besides getting to know the details of each project well, could intervene to give advice on how to make the presentations. Each team took a series of points in which they could be reinforced in the face of the presentation of the Giant Jamboree.

Samples were loaded, mixed, and placed into the thermocycler.  Samples were ligated for 10 minutes at RT (22 degrees Celsius), and heat inactivated at 65 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes, and held at 4 degrees Celsius indefinitely.  Samples were then removed and chilled on ice, before being transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) Mix n Go cells.

CCMB80
Materials:
10 mM KOAc pH 7.0 (10mL of 1M stock/L)
80 mM CaCl2 x 2 H2O (11.8 g/L)
20 mM MnCl2 x 4 H2O (4.0 g/L)
10 mM MgCl2 x 6 H2O (2.0 g/L)
10% Glycerol (100 mL/L)
Notes:
Adjusting pH up may precipitate MnO2 from the Mn containing solutions
Slight dark precipitate will not impede function of solution
LB
Materials:
10 g Tryptone
5 g Yeast Extract
10 g NaCl
10 g of Agar (for 1% Agar Plates (w/v))
1 L ddH2O
Antibiotic Stock (if Required)
Notes:
Do not store, the gel will condense and become unusable
Add the Antibiotic stock after pouring some non-antibiotic LB Plates
1 L Should pour ~40 Plates
SOB
Materials:
0.5% (w/v) Yeast Extract (5 g/L)
2% (w/v) Tryptone (20 g/L)
10 mM NaCl (.584 g/L)
2.5 mM KCl (.186 g/L)
20 mM MgSO4 (2.4 g/L)
Notes:
Autoclave and Store at 4C
TBE Buffer
To make 1 liter of 5X TBE buffer:
Mix 54 g Tris (Trizma base) and 27.5 g Boric Acid in 900 mL DI water in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 20 mL 0.5M EDTA solution.
Pour into a 1 L graduated cylinder.
Adjust volume of solution to 1 L with DI water.
Store at room temperature.
Making 100 mL of 0.5M EDTA solution:
Add 18.61 g EDTA to 100 mL DI water.
The EDTA will not dissolve unless the solution is at a pH of 8. Bring the solution to the biology labs to use the pH meter. Follow the instructions"

Results
Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.
What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
Describe what your results mean
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.
