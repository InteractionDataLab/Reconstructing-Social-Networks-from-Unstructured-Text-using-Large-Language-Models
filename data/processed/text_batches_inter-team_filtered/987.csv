UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Composite Part_-_-_TEXT.html,"uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

Notebook
The weekly notebook includes the work process of every teammate everyday. Here you can see the detailed steps of finishing the two projects for iGEM competition, and go through the days that our projects grow up with us together.
 
Notebook Overview
Learning synthetic biology
Before July, we had several courses about synthetic biology. We had a journal club almost every week where we shared the most classic experimental results in synthetic biology by presenting presentations. After this suffering yet satisfying process, we all gained the basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM.
Brainstorming
During June, we gathered for several times to discuss our project. Almost everyone proposed a fantastic yet reasonable idea. Those ideas, including making a sequence of DNA into a piece of music, developing a synthetic biology game and so on, were discussed one by one. At last, we decided to write an app on iPhone due to its portability and popularity. We wanted to demystify the synthetic biology! Then we presented this idea to our supervisor.
Learning Objective-C
Since none of us had experience developing software on iPhone before, we spent about 10 days learning Objective-C, which is similar to the computer language C and C++. After that we learned how to use Xcode, which is a developing tool.
Starting to work
We divided our project into two parts: user interface part and database part. We wrote code from 8:00am to 5:00pm every day. Sometimes we had to do extra work during the night. After a long and hard but exhilarating travel with Xcode, we finally virtually finished the mainframe work.
A short vacation
We had a short vacation from 6th October to 12th October. Since most of our team members lived far away from Shenzhen, many of us got a chance to go home and stayed some time with parents.
Back to project
After the vacation was the debugging and optimizing user interface time. It was truly an awful period. Sometimes it took us several days to locate and remove a bug. After about 10 days’effort, we finished our app eventually. We submitted out software to AppStore on 22nd October. Then we started to write the second software.
Human practice time
While writing codes, we didn’t forget to do our human practice. We put on many posters about synthetic biology in our campus. We delivered"

Danielle Huang
Danielle, ""the overachiever"" always aims for higher goals. Her schedule is packed just like that of a Hollywood star, except that she doesn't act, but she truly enjoys keeping herself busy and productive. What an exemplary student. Over the summer break, she worked very hard to contribute to Cornell iGEM until the day before she left Cornell for a co-op at Johnson & Johnson. We miss you Danielle!
Dan Levine
While most of us are water-based, Dan is not water-based. He enjoys long walks on the tight-rope, bumpy rides on the pommel horse and protein-heavy meals. If you are what you eat, then Dan is a bowl of non-fat Chobani yogurt (the serving spoon being a vanilla-flavored Power Bar). However, a cranial examination reveals Dan is wired to circuit-boards and graphics cards. At a glance, his computer models could be mistaken for supermodels. Needless to say, Dan is popular among ladies.
Rafael Lizarralde
Averages 200 + APM in StarCraft II, makes chimeric polymerases in his spare time, and proficiently speaks four languages - Rafael is a modern day renaissance man. His brain surpasses Amazon's servers with the storage capacity approximately equal to a googlebyte or three of data. After majoring in Biological Engineering, Rafael plans to go to graduate school. In graduate school, it is rumored that Rafael plans to study meat science and the art of turf grass management. Rafael's career aspirations are to win a couple of Nobel prizes and designation as Cosmo's ""Man Candy of the Year.""
Kelvin Luu
There are only 10 types of people on Cornell iGEM: Kelvin Luu, and those who wish they could count like Kelvin Luu. Basically, the man’s a G – a Graphics G. Beyond website design and Android coding, Kelvin enjoys orienting objects and warping System.time with his compsci genius. Other talents involve staying up past 4 AM and making burnt hash browns.
Jim Mathew
An elocutionist so suave you'd think he speaks in songs of the Sirens. But don't let his baby face and sunny smile fool you. Featured four times on the front cover of Nature, Forbes, and Maxim's Hot 100, Jim seamlessly integrates his wizardry in chemical engineering and applied economics into a leader's conviction that's not to be taken lightly.
Jim has been especially prolific the past couple of years. He coined the acronym YOLO after wrestling"

Weird fact: Chris knows there are no such things as ""facts"". Question everything you do, assumptions are bad.
 
 
 
 
Edwin Jake Yeboah
Jake is currently a 3rd year Bsc Biotechnology student currently planning and preparing to write a dissertation on his research of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum.  “Taking part in iGEM was a goal of mine ever since I read about it in a science article in my sixth form library”. He was drawn to how almost magical it seemed to be using bacteria in this way and could not believe he had not heard about Synthetic biology sooner. iGEM is also the reason he is studying Biotechnology since it very closely relates to synthetic biology.
“iGEM has been even more intense than I imagined it to be and an experience I will not forget. I cannot stress enough the large amount of skills I’ve gained such as HTML coding, lab skills such as carryout of gel electrophoresis and general team work and optimism. I am looking forward to the infamous Boston Jamboree and hearing some cool accents. See you in November.”
Weird fact: Jake's worst fear is an alien invasion of beings so advanced they wipe us out with minimal effort. Stephen Hawking also believes this is a possibility.
 
 
 
Vikram Chhapwale
Vikram is a modeller and programmer for the iGEM Nottingham Team. He also handles external relations such as talking to the public and to industry contacts as well as handle the legal stuff in the project. His hobbies are playing music live, doing art and playing videogames.
“IGEM has helped me develop stronger team based skills as well as see new applications for computers as helped me gain an insight into the world of research.”
Weird fact: Vikram carries his favourite Yugioh card in his walet just in case the moment arises.

Integrated Human Practices
Over the course of summer, The University of Edinburgh OG iGEM 2018 team had learned about the importance of plastic in our lives, making it virtually impossible to detach it completely due to its versatile attributes and application. However, we also learned that plastic waste is detrimental to our environment. To tackle this problem, we chose to focus our efforts on bioplastic production, specifically the copolymer PHBV. As a group, we firmly believe that to approach  the plastic issue it is necessary to design environmentally responsible products. For that reason, it was essential to engage in conversation with experts in the field, from bioplastic consultants to plastic producers. As a result of the discussions with various stakeholders, the OG iGEM team designed genetically modified parts and integrated a sustainability analysis to Valeris.Ed. Thus, for our Integrated Human Practices we wanted to show how the dialogue with multiple sources shaped our project and how it evolved from the initial idea to the final project we are presenting. Following this, in the left-side section, we summarised how stakeholders’ interaction lead to changes in the design of the project. On the other hand, in the right section and organised in chronological order, we listed the consulted stakeholders and the valuable insights they provided to the project.
The team has not only focused on how to contribute in solving the plastic problem, but it also has thought of the potential use of Synthetic Biology in other fields. Accordingly, we collaborated with other iGEM teams and organised different presentations to promote Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition in our local and international community, i.e. young students in Macau. We are happy to have spread the wonder of this world and work with the future first iGEM team in Macau.

“The increasing demand for rubber and the inferior properties of synthetic rubber call for development of new innovative sources of natural rubber.“ - iGEM SDU 2013
The rubber demand is growing by 5-6% annually. At present, 40% of the global rubber demand is satisfied by natural rubber while the remaining 60% comes from synthetic rubber, and it is noteworthy that the fraction of natural rubber is increasing. The fact that synthetic rubber can’t fully mimic all the properties of natural rubber necessitates the use of natural rubber in the production of quality seals, tires, latex gloves, condoms, etc. The increasing demand for rubber and the inferior properties of synthetic rubber call for development of new innovative sources of natural rubber.

Meeting with Rosalin (Weizmann institute, Flieshman lab)
Meeting Summary:
a. Their newest tool of the lab named funclib and is used to make certain in the proteins more ligand specific (in up to 15 sites).
b. It's possible to run the program with a bound ligand so if we will have a crystallographic structure that contains TCDD ore some derivative of it, the process might perform better results.
c. Rosaline mentioned that We should use pross tool (Also from Sarel lab) just in case the expression level of the protein in the cell is very low, otherwise it's not needed for our purpose. Also the lab has a special pross for membrane proteins like our CYP seem to be.

Meeting with Noam Kirshennbaum: Analyzing of our experimentt results (Rehovot Campus)
Analytical methods suggested by Noam:
a. HPLC  with UV detector
b. GC with FID/ECD detector.
Noam suggested we should check for the best method that works with our medium. If both doesn't show up well we might need another stage of purification.
Hagit mentioned that we might be able to dissolve TCDD in DMSO while measuring the breakdown in yeast.
Moreover, Hagit found an old and simpler method called TLC that we should check (if it fits our needs).
Furthermore, when TCDD will arrive we could try analyze it by GC-MS.
Tasks for next meeting:
a. We need to find libraries that contains properties about our reacting molecules.
b.  We might find information concerning our molecules in M/Z cloud library (High resolution database).
While looking at another analyzing methods we should aim to understand the concentration range and sensitivity of each one of them in order to find the best that can fit.
We must prepare an archive of all the data we are able to find regarding the materials (Tetrachlorobenzene, dibenzofuran and TCDD)- physical properties, chemical properties etc..
We concluded to have a tour at Noam lab later this week (13.06.18 at 1100).

Funding - who will pay production and costs?
The production of the first Nutrition Generators needs funding by donation, as the target consumers are  not able to pay for the product. We expect that the product will be a great success so that, after a while,  also well-nourished people, who have access to many different food sources, will buy the product and thus  contribute to the production costs.
Competitors
The Nutrition Generator is the first product of its kind and there are no similar products, but products within the same category exist. The international marked offers a wide variety of protein powders that provide  the consumer with many nutritional proteins. They are great products, but we don’t see any potential for this to  be a food source for undernourished poor people. Protein powders are produced synthetically and must be  available in big amounts to cover the daily needs and a new quantity must be delivered very often. It is impossible to deliver protein powder to all undernourished people  in the world, as there a too many (805 millions in 2012-2014 Source: (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2014: Hunger Statistics. (Link) ), and it would be very expensive.  Furthermore, protein powder needs to be dissolved in a liquid media, which is often insufficient for poor  people.
Our OneProt protein, which is produced in the Nutrition Generator, is produced by bacteria that can  reproduce themselves. A Nutrition Generator only need to be delivered once and will afterwards produce  protein and fat rich food, by cheap and easy accessible materials.
Marketing - our promises to the costumer
The Nutrition Generator can supply the consumer with proteins and fats, food sources that all people  need. Everyone can be a consumer of the product, and it is usable with and without electricity, which  gives the product multiple applications.
We promise our customers a sustainable product that has a very low cost of operation by the use of  materials that are non-degradable by humans and available all over the world.  Furthermore the use is safe, as no living bacteria will ever escape from the tank, and as the media is  autoclaved before the product is eaten.
We see a great potential for the Nutrition Generator, an easy usable and cheap product that can save many  lives.

Evry,2013,Team:Evry#Seminar_-_-_TEXT.html," together hemochromatosis patients, presidents of patients' associations, expert researchers and clinicians, and the 2013 Evry iGEM team in an extremely warm atmosphere.
During the day, very varied themes were discussed: the fundamental research on iron homeostasis, the clinical aspects of hemochromatosis, the ethical and philosophical aspects of the creation and use of a probiotics to decrease iron overload, and finally the state of the art of a promising research field, the microbiome.
On the remarkable (and rare!) initiative of the 2013 Evry iGEM team, the patients had the possibility to express their opinion about their disease by answering a survey: 135 women and 135 men answered it, which constitutes an absolutely remarkable cohort. One session, presented by the 2013 Evry iGEM team, was dedicated to analysing some of the datas.
Finally, the 2013 Evry iGEM team presented their project. They could present the beginning of a proof of concept: they had obtained a modified bacteria capable of modulating GFP expression according to iron concentration.
The day ended with a visit of the laboratory given to the 2013 Evry iGEM team to elaborate their project.
During this kind of day, it is not so easy to use a vocabulary such as all the participants could reach a common base of knowledge, in order to have exchanges as fruitful as possible. Nevertheless I feel that all the speakers managed it, and thus it enabled each time an enriching exchange of questions and answers.
From a personal point of view, it is always very enriching to meet patients, to hear their difficulties, to understand how they live, accept or refuse some aspects of their disease. It is during these exchange that I hear their expectation for new medicines, and that, in return, I have the possibility to explain that it is always very long between a proof of concept and a new treatment. 10 to 15 years usually pass between the two.
I repeat my congratulations to all the members of the 2013 Evry iGEM team for the organisation of this day, for their dynamism, for their scientific daring, and most of all for the way they have developed their project scientifically as well as philosophically... starting from scratch... and in the record time of a few months!

The data points from our measurement aren’t connected because we didn’t measure inbetween. After their first growth curve didn’t show the results we expected NTNU was kind enough to repeat the experiment, that is why they have two curves. In two hours NTNU reached an OD600 of about 3,5 both times, Thessaloniki reached an OD600 5 and we an OD600 eached 12.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discussion and Outlook

Vibrigens InterLab
It can be observed that Vibrio natriegens produces a much weaker fluorescence signal at the same OD when compared to E.coli using the same plasmids. In some cases, the fluorescence with a plasmid meant to express GFP is weaker than the blank. This happens because the cells block light more than they emit fluorescence at high densities. According to our measurements the strongest promoter was Test Device 5, followed by 4, 2, 1, 3 and 6. The other teams also found device 5 to be the strongest, but followed by 1, 4, 2, 6 and 3. Device 5, Part BBa_J364008 with the promoter J23104 is unequivocally the strongest. The experiments showed similar results, except that Device 1 was much weaker in our measurements than for the other teams. Device 6 and three had such weak GFP expression that small variations can change their place in the order of strength. We had some difficulty comparing resulting because the units of fluorescence are not standardized. We could only compare results and not analyze them on their own. Some teams had a much higher values then the other. This doesn’t mean that they measured a higher fluorescence, just that the values were given in another frame. The only quality control we could conduct on the data given to us were common sense checks, for example, the negative control had to show a lower fluorescence than the positive control. These checks excluded one team from our experiment.
 
Growth curve
In the five hours in which the experiment was performed by the other team, we reached an OD600 of about 12, and they reached one of 3,5 to 5. There are also some small factors that can combine to truly impact growth. Vibrio natriegens needs a lot of oxygen, so it’s important to take big baffled flasks and keep them shaking at all times. It is also very sensitive to cold, so taking the flasks out of the incubator to take samples can have an"

Prof. Åsberg discussed her research on occupational well-being and the emergence of fatigue syndrome as a clinical diagnosis. Before a short intermission consisting of lunch and talk by Naturvetarna on their work as a federation of the Swedish trade union representing workers in the natural sciences, team Uppsala’s own Jonas Nielsen guided the audience through a breathing exercise.
The second part of the symposium touched on the ethics of human genetic engineering that materialized following developments in genetic engineering such as CRISPR and high-throughput DNA synthesis. The topic was discussed by Dr. Jens Sundström and Assoc. Prof. Per Sandin, two researchers in bioethics at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and Hannes Sjöblad, a figure within the Swedish biohacking society and avid proponent of human augmentation and transhumanism. The three reflected on future scenarios, ranging from the realistic to the absurd, in an effort to elucidate some of the complex philosophical issues human augmentation gives rise to.
The event gathered a substantial audience and all teams did a very good job mediating the event. We hope that all participants got to learn about the importance of personal stress management and biohacking. Hosting this event allowed an open and honest discourse in discussing the most important questions regarding the rapid development of biology and medicine. The discussion by the end of the symposium got really heated due to the opposing viewpoints of the participating debaters. The significance of good moderation was made apparent in this context.
We hope our collaboration with team Uppsala and Stockholm will serve as an example for future  Nordic teams to reach out and work together.
Biotech4Change conference at the European Parliament
With the wiki-freeze being 18 days away and having tons of work left to do, we still managed to send some members of our team to attend the Biotech4Change conference at the European parliament. Despite the workload, we did not want to miss out on a big opportunity to make change on a political level. We got the chance to present our project and participate in a round-table discussion with various entrepreneurs, researchers, politicians and students. The topic was about the strict regulations set by the parliament regarding GMO and technologies like CRISPR. The current regulations and long court trials hinder many scientists and biotech companies in pursuing their research and launch of products that potentially could save the lives of millions.
We hope that our participation in this discussion and the presentation of our project will invoke new insights of the vital role biotechnology will have in the future. Big thanks to the U"

When analyzed in detail, pMMo differs from sMMo by copper ion concentration. Copper ions have been shown to play a key role in regulating the expression of both MMO enzyme complexes. When its concentration increases the differentiation goes through particulate form. Here we analyzed the soluble form of methane monooxygenase to express in heterologous host.
a) Soluble Methane Monooxygenase
In contrast to pMMO, sMMO has extremely broad substrate specificity and can oxidise a wide range of non-growth substrates such as alkanes, alkenes and aromatic compounds thus making it the more attractive enzyme for co-oxidation reactions. sMMO is expressed only under conditions in which the copper-to-biomass ratio is low, i.e. under “low-copper” growth conditions, when copper ions are omitted from the trace elements solution of a standard mineral salts medium or cells are grown in a fermentor to high cell densities.There is also some evidence that copper ions inhibit the activity of sMMO (Jahng and Wood 1996). Like many other multi-component oxygenase systems, sMMO contains a component of approximately 16 kDa, Protein B, which serves an “effector” or regulatory role. The activity of Protein B may be regulated by proteolysis at its amino terminus (Lloyd et al. 1997). At low concentrations, Protein B converts the hydroxylase from an oxidase and stabilizes intermediates necessary for oxygen activation. Saturating amounts of Protein B dramatically increase the rates of formation of intermediates and accelerate catalysis of methane to methanol by sMMO (Lee and Lipscomb 1999). When analyzed, the most extensively characterised sMMO enzymes are those from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (reviewed in Lipscomb 1994; Deeth and Dalton 1998). Therefore we preferred to study on Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) for monooxygenase.The sMMO is a non-haem iron-containing enzyme complex consisting of three components. The hydroxylase consists of three subunits of 60, 45 and 20 kDa arranged in an α2 β2 γ2 configuration. sMMO genes are clustered on the chromosome of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#Application#Rollout_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Emergence of an outbreak
The first signs of an epidemic are noticed, for example by an increase in the number of people showing certain symptoms in a certain area. Often, this is noticed by the local or national health centers.                             When this is a new outbreak, little is known about the pathogen, vector, vector trajectory or the vulnerable target group. In the case of a re-emerging outbreak, these details are already familiar.
To define an outbreak
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes a pathogenic outbreak if it fits the following definition:
A disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years.
[1]
While the definition above describes the outbreak for a case where the disease in question is to be expected, there are also instances where the disease is new in that region, or re-emerges after being eradicated for some time. Therefore, the following description can fit an outbreak as well:
A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.
[1]
Dr. Marianne van der Sande
Head of Epidemiology and Surveillance of Infective Diseases Center (EPI) and Center for Infectious Disease Control (CIb)
In an outbreak scenario, the priority of the people should be assessing the identity of the infectious agent. What kind of pathogen are we dealing with? What are its transmission routes? How does it cause disease?

Step 2.  Develop the diagnostic
When an official epidemic emerges, Mantis will be adapted to the new, spreading disease. During a new epidemic, the pathogen first has to be identified and isolated by authorized laboratories. The whole-cell biosensor can detect a pathogen by the antibody-like protein on its cell surface. This so-called ‘affinity body’ binds an antigen of the pathogen, whereafter the signalling system in the cell is activated, resulting in a detectable signal. The already made affinity body library, containing biosensors that theoretically can detect all possible pathogens, is screened for a suitable one"

Our Contribution
Throughout our iGEM experience, we have interacted with synthetic biologists, researchers, and companies in the microfluidic industry. Our team has found that there is a need for a system that increases the accessibility of microfluidic devices to the scientific community. While microfluidics is not new to biologists, many scientists have not incorporated it into their research workflow. This is due to a number of barriers that scientists must overcome in order to utilize microfluidics, one of which is a lack of accessibility.
Currently, the experimental outputs of experiments run on microfluidic chips are collected in a tube and manually transferred to other vessels, such as a well-plate for analysis in a plate reader. This, however, defeats the purpose of using microfluidics to automate biological protocols. In order to streamline the process of utilizing microfluidic devices for synthetic biology protocols, we have developed a system that automates the output of a microfluidic device. Our system, TERRA, takes the output of a microfluidic device and selectively dispenses the fluid to specific locations on a vessel, such as a 96-well plate. Scientists can then use the output of a microfluidic-based experiment more effectively. For instance, the microfluidic output can easily be analyzed using standard lab equipment, such as a plate reader. TERRA allows scientists to incorporate microfluidics to their workflow without an extensive knowledge of microfluidics itself.
TERRA aims to be an application- and microfluidic-agnostic system, in which a biologist can run a microfluidic device designed for their experiment, connect it with the TERRA Adapter, and enter the protocol for the experiment to our user interface. Our system will then automate the experiment and dispense the fluid output to the wells of the microtiter plate that the user inputted to the user interface. By automating the microfluidic-based experiment, our project combines the use of standard lab equipment for analysis of outputs of microfluidic devices. TERRA allows scientists to easily incorporate microfluidics to their experiments and easily access and utilize the outputs"

Our comic book left a footprint in more than 10 countries.
2.2 Social influence
Having translated into 13 languages, we took comic book E.coli spaceship to some local educational bases. Children like our comic book very much and we printed some to send them as gifts. It worth mentioning that many iGEMers thought it a great science education textbook, so they contacted us and hoped to use our comic book to do science education at local. We were proud of it and glad to provide them with different versions of comic book according to their needs.
iGEM Foundation Executive Vice President Meagan Lizarazo appreciated our comic book in CCiC.
Foreign iGEM teams popularized synthetic biology in their country using our comic book.
2.3 Feedback
These children love our comic book very much. It is a welcome idea to display synthetic biology in the form of colorful pictures supplemented with texts. Here are the summaries of our science education.
Foreign iGEM team gave us some comments on our comic book.
Foreign iGEMers gave some good feedback on our comic book.
You can see comic book popularization Feedbacks in 12 schools in China.
2.4 Future
According to their feedback, we will continue to improve our comic book and expends the contents of this book. At the same time, we hope more iGEM teams will join us and popularize synthetic biology, making synthetic biology a household word rather than an obscure concept. Furthermore, there are some minor flaws in the book that need to be found and revised.
3. Education for high school students: A five day life science summer camp in China
We held a summer camp and recruited students from different schools in China. Before summer camp, we prepared a detailed schedule, safety precautions, uniforms and presentations for these campers. These lectures involve synthetic biology and iGEM, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, PCR technology and cytometry introduction, literature search ability training and so on. During that time, they were taught 4 experimental operations in our lab, such as DNA extraction, PCR experiments, marine microbial separation and observation, butterfly specimen making. Furthermore, we made a summer camp book for them.

Fluid model
I Introduction
    The system we designed involves many kinds of relationships between populations and individuals. To help us understand these relationships better, we designed models to describe how the amount of E.coli and substance change with time.
    Concretely, to consider population interactions in a fluid environment, we designed a fluid model based on ODE. The system we considered here has no substance exchange except for some gas, which is, however, not considered in our model.
    What's more, we can use this model to help us design our experiment. (See more details at Improved gene circuit and Regulation of killing ability )
    Furthermore, we found that it will be much easier to consider the effects of some factors (Like the initial number of each populations) on population interactions if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---Fluid E.coli War based on our fluid model to satisfy our needs. What's more, the game can also help us realize educational purpose of our project and make public know more about synthetic biology! ( Exhibition at National Museum )
    Our game is made on the structure of html5. The small video below is Fluid E.coli War.

He emphasized the importance of having a controllable switch and informed us of the issue regarding leaky toxin expression. His advice was to add an antitoxin to the switch used by the iGEM Trieste 2012 team and described by Choi et al. 2005, which uses a regulatory protein repressed by cumate. This second layer of protection would make the system safer and more tightly contained.
To solve this challenge we integrated a killswitch into our research as biocontainment measurement in our project.

Policy
As part of our project development, we researched the different regulations and directives that could be applied to our project, as a Recombinant Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP), and despite our best efforts, we were surprised over the lack of information covering this topic. This made us realise that we would not be able to gather and map all the regulations related to our project on our own.
For this reason, we decided to get in contact with Erik Forsse, a senior adviser (specialist) at the Director’s Office at Karolinska Institutet, who works with investigations, analyses and the processing of in-coming public consultations. He explained that the current regulations for a project like ours does not exist, and inspired us to create a policy of our own.
Erik Forsse.
Even with the support and knowledge that Erik had provided us, we understood that we needed to contact someone working with more in-depth knowledge about regulations. We contacted Katarina Mercer, Senior Advisor for Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs at Scandinavian Development Services. She, once again, confirmed that there are no available regulations for our project. Katarina supported us in how we could develop our own policy by guiding us through similar cases and by providing us an insight in product development and what strategies we could use.
Katarina Mercer Jansson.
Additionally, we reached out to the Medical Products Agency (Swedish: Läkemedelsverket), the government agency in Sweden responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sales of medicinal drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. We talked to Åsa Kumlin Howell, international coordinator at the medical products agency, and she stated:
“This has been shown to be a hard question to answer, and after some research I haven't been able to find any legislation that regulates live biotherapeutic bacteria”
From these meetings we were able to determine our strategy for the policy we were aiming to create. The first part of the"

Human Practices
At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams’ efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and the work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design and execution.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub . There you will find:
an introduction to Human Practices at iGEM
tips on how to succeed including explanations of judging criteria and advice about how to conduct and document your Human Practices work
descriptions of exemplary work to inspire you
links to helpful resources
And more!
On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.
If your team has gone above and beyond in work related to safety, then you should document this work on your Safety wiki page and provide a description and link on this page. If your team has developed education and public engagement efforts that go beyond a focus on your particular project, and for which would like to nominate your team for the Best Education and Public Engagement Special Prize, you should document this work on your Education and Education wiki page and provide a description and"
Tuebingen,2018,Team:Tuebingen#Bioinformatics_-_-_TEXT.html," alignment of residues of the query sequence to residues in the template sequences heavily influence the quality of the homology model. Researchers have shown that protein structures are very conserved amongst homologues, even more so than protein sequences [] . Sequences with less than 20% sequence identity are likely to have different three-dimensional strucutes. [] The presence of alignment gaps in either solely the target or the template further complicate the modeling process, since they indicate a structural region present in only one of the two structures. Moreover, it has been shown that the quality of the homology model gradually decreases with the sequence identity. A typical homology model has ~1–2 Å root mean square deviation between the matched Cα atoms at 70% sequence identity but only 2–4 Cα agreement at 25% sequence identity. Furthermore, loop regions, where amino acid sequences of target and template proteins may completely differ, usually contain more errors [] [] . The generated sequence alignment is then used for the creation of a structural model of the target protein. Significant structural similarity can usually be derived from the detectable levels of sequence similarity, since protein structure is more conserved than DNA [] .
Materials and Methods
Molecular dynamics simulations allow for the mimicking of the movement and interactions of atoms and molecules. The system simulates the interactions of the atoms and molecules for a fixed period of time allowing for a detailed view of the dynamic progress of the system. Most commonly, the trajectories of the atoms are calculated by numerically solving Newton’s equations of motions for interacting particles. Molecular mechanics force fields are responsible for the estimation of interatomic potentials and energies. At each simulation step the forces on each atom are computed using the force field. Afterwards, the position and velocity of the atoms is updated by solving newton’s law of motion.
Our molecular dynamics simulations were done using GROMACS [] ,  a free, open-source software design for simulations of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. GROMACS' processor specific optimization and extensive GPU support results in one of the fastest software packages available [] .
This allowed us to run molecular dynamics simulations even very large proteins such as BoNTC.   The homology modelling was performed using the full automated SWISS-Model web servers, which computes trustworthy results regarding stability and accuracy. SWISS-Model finds the closest homologs of the input sequence via BLAST and transfers the coordinates defined by the target-template alignment followed by refinement steps. []
Results
In order to compute a probable structure for our botulinum toxin C, we used the SWISS-Model fully automated web server for homology"

Calibration of fluid flow velocity
To visualize the flow profile, rainbow beads (SPHEROTM Rainbow Calibration Particles, Cat No. RCP-60-5, Lot No. AB01, diameter: 6um [1] ) were dissolved in the cell culture medium, which contained some dead cells. A series of pumped flow rate(5μl/min, 15μl/min, and 45μl/min) were applied to generate a steady fluid flow. The length of the streakline (shown as a gray line in picture) represents the total traveling distance of the beads during the exposure time of 100ms . Fig. 1 shows a typical image of a bead trace(fastest microfluidics channel with the flow rate of 5ul/min). To minimize hydraulic effects of the PDMS walls, the pictures were taken from the midplane of the channel providing the maximum flow velocity. Note that the traveling direction of the beads was left. Each streak was measured separately, and the average length of all streaks in one particular channel divides the exposure time was regarded as the maximum flow velocity of this channel. [2]
Fig.1 Bead Trace in The Fastest Microfluidics Channel with The Flow Rate of 5ul/min
Experiment
To minimize the error, we took pictures on fast microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 5μl/min; on mid microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 15μl/min; on slow microfluidics channel when pumped flow rate was 45μl/min, considering that fluid flow velocity is proportional to pumped flow rate.

This is our first meeting since the beginning of the term.  What's different about this meeting is that there are 3 more iGEM teams of Nanjing taking part in our meeting this time.
We talked about the condition of each team, including the work each team is working on, the facing problems, and the details about the competition in HKUST, as well as the conditions of each laboratory.  Meanwhile, we decided to have 2 teach-ins in Nanjing University and Southeast University (where the 4 teams are from) in the middle of September to promote iGEM and to attract more students into this competition.  After the meeting, the team leaders of the other 3 teams visited our laboratory, and they showed great appreciation for our experiments.
When the other teams left, we further concluded our work in the first week of this term.  Though we met some problems during the construction of our wiki and during the process of experiments, we feel satisfied for the results we got.
We are still working on our future work.  We hope to perform 2 teach-ins in Nanjing University and Southeast University and a scientific teach-in in Jinling High School in the middle of September.
9.3(A)
Today we refer to Dr. Shi from Arizona State University.  He gave us the following suggestions.
1. Substitue the LB with SOB and SOC for electroporation.
2. Add arabinose when OD reaches 0.1, so the final concentration is 10mM and shake it for 4 h.
3. Precipitate the PCR with alcohol, resuspend DNA pellet in 16 ul H2O, and introduce 8-10 ul DNA to competent cells.
4. Add 500 ul SOC to grow the transformants at 37℃ for 1 h, plate 150 ul culture X2 to Cm-LB plates, and leave the rest culture on your bench.  Plate them to other two Cm-LB plates next day.
We hope that we will have a better result with his advice.

Requirements
1. Template
2. 2 Primers (limiting)
3. dNTP's (limiting)
4. Polymerase (limiting by heatcycle) Using Taq which tends to transcribe more errors.
5. Buffer (mg++) (limiting)
Primers are 18-30 bp long. Have to be at least 15 bp long. Primers bind to template DNA, one primer for each (5'/3' strands). Review: What is a base..? Sugar with A, C, T or G is a nucleotide. BP are the matching set of 5' and 3' hydrogen bonded nucleotides.
Polymerase links free dNTP's to the opened strand edges of basepairs.
Denaturation 95 - 98 degrees c... DNA Melts
Anealing 40 - 65 degrees c... Primer Binds
Extension 72 degrees c... Strands Extend
30 second cycles...
As the DNA heats it denatures then as it cools the primers anneal and polymerization takes place creating twice as many strands. The strands are held together only by hydrogen bonds, making it very easy to melt and reform. The polymerase acts like a little machine stitching the free dNTP's into the template.
BioBrick plasmids have bb prefix and suffix. Primer binding sites vf2, vr. Theoretically any area can become a primer site.
With PCR we can identify and amplify particular strands/compositions. You have to know how much of the requirements to use. Gary asked if Tom could show us where to find the optimized volume information at, and he agreed to pull out the research to show how to optimize.
With PCR you can also design primers and introduce mutations. If primers are too short they can bind to the wrong spot. Actual reactions may vary based on bp length and combination. Usually they are tweaked for the optimal over a series of trials.

OUC-China,2018,Team:OUC-China#mb9_-_-_TEXT.html,"""Your hairpin mutant is very conservative. Only a pair of base mutation will not achieve your idealized effect. You can try more bases modifications."" Professor Liang, who studies the range of mutations nucleic acids for about twenty years, gave us some advice on the hairpin mutation.
Having accepted his suggestion, we expanded the range of base mutations, from a pair of base mutation to two or more pair of bases mutation, from the bases mutation on the stem to the bases mutation on the loop. Indeed! Expanding the range of mutations showed us a better expanded expression gradients, which formed a useful toolkit ""miniToe family"" by combining different hairpins with Cys4 mutations. Initially, professor Liang doubted whether crRBS and RBS can be separated after the interaction with Cys4. He was concerned that the cleavage of Cys4 and steric hindrance was not sufficient to break the hydrogen bond between base pairs. But his concern was broken by the expression of fluorescent gene.
Fig.8 We expanded the range of mutations to get a better expanded expression gradients.
""A great idea! It will be better if you can regulate the expression ratio of more than one gene. So your application range can be wider."" said Professor Du of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Du ever changed the intensity of RBS to achieve different expression levels of the target gene. So we went to Beijing and consulted some question of our project with him. He gave an example of our project application. The traditional way is to knock out a gene then observe different performance of the organism, and your experimental results can be used to explore the effect of different gene expression levels on the function of organisms. Indeed! Inspired by Teacher Du, we considered applying the MINITOE structure to the regulation of gene expression in polycistron expression systems.
Fig.9 Professor Du helped us analyze our project in Institute of Microbiology.
Fig.10 Du said, ""Your project can be used to explore the effect of different gene expression levels on the function of organisms""

2.2 Integration with biotechnology companies and research institutes
Given that all basic researches aim at application and benefiting for human beings, we supposed that visiting the biotechnology companies to investigate the prospect of our project is a great idea. We went to the BGI, Qingdao Youdu Biotechnology Co.LTD and Qingdao Bright Moon Seaweed Group Co.LTD to integrate our project with social reality and communicate with technical staff in these companies.

Butyrate is a four carbon, short chain fatty acid, is formed in the human colon by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (including dietary fiber), and putatively suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC). It induces apoptosis and differentiation, inhibits proliferation of tumorous cells in colon flora. At the intestinal level, butyrate plays an administrative part on the transepithelial liquid transport, improves mucosal aggravation and oxidative status, strengthens the epithelial protection obstruction, and regulates instinctive affectability and intestinal motility. As it is claimed to suppress colorectal cancer, Butyrate is our agent to defeat cancerous cells.
D3D Structure of ButCoAT
Butyrate can be formed by numerous ways as in the figure below;
As Acetyl-CoA is readily present in the cells, we used an enzyme that directly converts Acetyl-CoA to our agent; Butyrate. Enzyme name is But-Coat, our protein coding region.  Here we have schematic demonstration of reaction;

Design Notes of K2052016
Our construct consists of a protein coding region (FimH), a double terminator (B0015), an arabinose induced promoter (K206000), a ribosome binding site (B0034), and another protein coding region (ButCoaT).
Our construct have 11 restriction enzyme cut sides. The prefix that we have designed includes EcoRI, NotI, XbaI. On the other hand, SpeI, NotI, PstI is included in our suffix. We entailed NotI for confirming the size of our construct while we're making our experiments. Therewithal, we added NcoI and HindIII so that we can clone our construct into Pet28a. To determine that both FimH and ButCoaT sections function well, we included SpeI, SalI, XbaI restriction enzyme cut sides. By this way, we conduct our experiments for FimH and ButCoaT separately. We put these three restriction enzyme cut sides after our arabinose induced promoter to determine if our construct is working with that promoter or not. We decided to work with Arabinose Induced Promoter in the middle of our construct to understand, if FimH works without putting arabinose and if ButCoaT works with arabinose in the medium.

BGIC-Union,2017,Team:BGIC-Union#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," probability of one DNA molecule bearing both NT7-dcas9 and CT7-dcas9 and enabling transcription of report gene decreases as the concentration continually increases. The probability of one DNA molecule bearing both NT7-dcas9 and CT7dcas9 is represented as the formula below:
Employing the formula above and the data from Peking 2015, the best-fitted curve for the relationship between relative fluorescent unit and target DNA concentration before and after the optimal concentration is reached has been made in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Revealed in the curves, before the optimal concentration is reaches, in the interval of low concentration (0-0.6), the line has a greater slope than the slope after the concentration reaches a certain value (0.6-1.5), decreasing by multiplying the factor of θ. After the optimal concentration is reaches, the slope is negative and the value of the negativity increases as a factor of
Therefore, the best-fitted curves prove that our hypothesis is correct.
Conclusion:
From the two models made above, we conclude that using NASBA to amplify the target DNA (EML4-ALK) is necessary and efficient for the detection device in order to avoid the interference of cell free DNAs from normal cells. Also, there is an upper limit of target DNA concentration for the detection device to create the most intense signal. The upper limit of the concentration of DNA is determined by the concentration of NT7-dcas9, CT7-dcas9, and their dissociation constant with target DNA.

Consistent with our expectation, the lower the ammonium concentration, the shorter the response time (Figure 6,7).
To test the interference of other nitrogenous substances in ammonium detection, we collected and analyzed water sample from local farming ponds. We found that NO3- is the main nitrogenous substance other than ammonium in pond water with a concentration of approximately 60uM. Therefore, we added potassium nitrate of different concentration into working medium with 0.02-fold of standard ammonium concentration and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture. Results showed that 100uM nitrate had slight influence on response of glnAp2 to ammonium concentration, suggesting that glnAp2 is suitable for ammonia detection in aquaculture water (Figure 8).
Selecting SsrA-like tags
Three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were added to the C-terminus of mRFP downstream the promoter glnAp2. By analyzing the dynamics of fluorescence intensity in working medium, we compared protein-degradation effects of these tags. We found that mRFP with LAA- and LVA-tag were unable to emit detectable fluorescence, indicating a high degradation rate, while mRFP with DAS-tag still produced red fluorescence, which in turn suggested the inefficiency of DAS-tag (Figure 9). In the meantime, the response time mRFP with DAS-tag reveals a remarkable difference, indicating a reliable resolution, while the LAA and LVA do not (Figure 10).
Demonstrating function of our sensor system
We constructed a sensor circuit where a reporter mRFP with a moderate-degradation DAS-tag was expressed from an NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, and tested its function in laboratory.
In laboratory, we used Cytation3 Multi-Mode reader to obtain the kinetic curves. Obviously, the degradation tag leads to a remarkable drop in the maximum RFU, which makes the fluorescence signal harder to be detected by normal photoresistors (fig.9). This problem can be solved by employed other photoelectric sensors with higher sensitivity, or we can give up the idea of involving degradation tag, as the circuits without this tag has displayed reliable performances. Moreover, after being added a degradation tag, the system becomes more unstable, which is revealed from the decreased signal-noise ratio(fig 11,12). With"

Heidelberg,2009,Team:Heidelberg#Eucaryopedia_-_-_TEXT.html," occurs upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) in a region called core promoter, this part of the promoter often contains specific elements like the TATA-Box (consensus sequence, TATAA/TAA/T, about 30 bp upstream of TSS [50] ) and the GC-Box (consensus sequence TGTGGCTNNNAGCCAA)  app. 80 bp upstream of the TSS [51] to which the IC can bind. Further upstream is a part of the promoter which is referred to as proximal promoter. Containing specific sequence elements, this part of the promoter is highly important for the transcriptional regulation. Transcription factors can bind to these response elements thereby up regulating or down regulating the gene transcription. Proteins methylating or acetylating the DNA are also involved in gene transcription regulation by remodelling of the chromatin structure.
Drugs
CPT
Camptothecins (CPT) is a cytotoxic quinoline alkaloid and a  topoisomerase I inhibitor isolated from the Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca or the Happy tree). It was discovered during a screen for natural anti-cancer drugs in 1966 but it is not not used in cancer therapy due to its severe side effects, but there were various derivatives developed to increase the benefits of this drug while decreasing its negative effects. [52] The two CPT analogues have been approved for cancer chemotherapy today are topotecan and irinotecan. CPT acts by binding to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex using hydrogen bonds and thereby preventing DNA-religation, inducing DNA damage and ultimately causing the cell to die. [53]
Cellular components as tools
GPI
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid. During the posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells, it becomes attached to hydrophobic C-termini of proteins that have a special singnal peptide on them. This signalpeptide leads their translation into the ER, where the hydrophobic C-terminus will be replaced by a GPI anchor. Because of its hydrophobic nature it attaches the bound protein to the cell membrane [54] .
Sar-1
Sar-1 GTP-binding proteins direct the transport of molecules inside of veiscles from the ER to the golgi and the other way round. Being an anchor for COPII molecules that cause the budding of vesicles off the membranes, it needs a domain to attach to the ER"

Successful Pigment Production
We transformed Top10 with pPSX-Vio+.  After three colour eventually appeared, as shown below.  Interestingly, the pigment appears to remain within the bacteria, with little or no bleeding into the media. We took the violacein pigment bacteria (right plate in photo) out of the fridge to find that the purple colour had started to develop. They were therefore left at room temperature overnight. The colour appears to be within the bacteria, with little or no bleeding into the media. The control plate (left plate) is the untransformed TOP10 E. coli.

Multiple Pigment Production from the Violacein operon
Top10 transformed with the DNA we received from DNA2.0 showed vibrant pigment production.
Left: Violacein growth on agar plate (overnight). Right: Single colonies.
Further, we were able to remove VioC or VioD from the operon to produce a green pigment.
Left: Lawn of green bacteria on agar plate (overnight), derived by removing one gene from the violacein cassette. Right: Green colonies on agar plate.
Characterisation of colour output
We characterised the violacein pigment by carrying out the acetone extraction protocol used for carotene. The results were normalised for OD and then plotted as a graph of absorption units against wavelength:
We also looked at absorbance at 584nm (the maximum absorbance for violacein):

Biorefineries in society or society in biorefineries
Throughout the design of our biorefinery a lot of debate was had surrounding the role biorefineries should/would/could play in society. Should a biorefinery using Synthetic Biology be implemented? Would it be accepted as a technological application? What implications could a biorefinery, or a biorefineries network, have on society at large?
We thought it not sufficient to merely acknowledge the potential consequences and consider the implications that the implementation of a biorefinery would have on society but rather we felt it important to ask whether society considered biorefineries a worthwhile endeavour.
In an attempt to investigate the feasibility of implementing biorefineries and to determine the role, if any, they could play in a social context we made contact with and interviewed a number of different experts from various fields: environmentalism, business, academia, politics, and the Church. In this approach we hoped to open a discourse related to the field of Synthetic Biology in Scotland and understand any concerns, indifferences or hopes people had towards Synthetic Biology and more specifically our proposed biorefinery.
Obviously, the iGEM timescale is short and as such our study is limited in its depth. Often interesting doors would open but a shortage of time and experience meant we were unable to follow them to their end. However, our interviewee’s responses offered many interesting insights and led us to new, useful questions and ideas which we hope could be useful to"

Wageningen_UR,2013,Team:Wageningen UR#Chromoproteins_-_-_TEXT.html," this codon-optimized eforRed with mitochondrial retention sequence displayed the expected bands after gel electrophoresis, which were around 750 bp, see Fig.5. Afterwards, Aspergillus niger was transformed with the codon-optimized construct with mitochondrial retention signal. Today (05-10-2013) we noticed that the mycelium of one of the aforementioned transformed A. niger showed red colour (Fig.6)!!! The day before the wiki-freeze, we got the result we were longing for for so long!
We performed PCR on our construct in fungal DNA and on our construct in the biobrick backbone as a positive control this very evening before the wiki-freeze. It showed faint bands of the expected size (750 bp)(Fig.7)!
Lane 1 = marker, lane 2+3 = transformant fungal DNA, lane 5 = negative control, lane 7+8 = positive control (biobrick)
Fig. 7 PCR of transformant A. niger
Conclusions
The correct insertion of the non-coding optimized chromoprotein encoding genes in the fungus genomic DNA was confirmed by PCR. To further confirm whether the sequence of the chromoprotein encoding genes also remained unchanged, we sent the new constructs out for sequencing. Comparing the sequencing results to the original sequence from parts registry, for the aeBlue, mRFP and amilGFP chromoprotein gene, the identity was almost 100%. We thereby showed that the palettes of chromoprotein transcriptional units for A. niger were designed and transformed successfully. Additionally, we optimized the codon of eforRed chromoprotein encoding gene for A. niger and introduced mitochondrial retention signal for targeted localization. The transformation of A. niger with the optimized constructs was successfully validated via PCR and its mycelium showed the red colour as we expected. For the PCR however the bands for amplified transformant fungal DNA were not really intense compared to the bands for the amplified positive controls. The reason for this could be that our biobricking primers only partly annealed to our codon-optimized construct with signal sequence in the fungal DNA, while they fully anneal to our construct in biobrick vector.
To conclude, the codon optimized eforRed chromoprotein could be introduced into A. niger and applied as a simple selective marker or bioreporter. For the others whose mycelium didn’t show colour, we assume that it is either related to transcription or translation of the chromoprotein encoding gene in A. niger. Future analysis,"

When imaging the colonies, look for colonies with large, rod-shaped cells. If you look carefully, you may be able to see parasporal inclusion bodies or Cry toxins. It is a good idea to get a control strain that produces Cry toxins to have a clear idea of what you are looking for.
In Vivo toxicity
The toxicity assay to determine in vivo toxicity was based on the assay performed by Alquisira-Ramírez et al 5 . Protein extracts were diluted to 100 µg/mL in a 0.1% Tween-80 Tris-HCL buffer (pH 7.5). Per sample, 5 mites were dipped in the protein solution for 5 seconds, then sieved with sterile filter paper. They were then put on an Apis mellifera pupa and mortality was observed every 24 hours. As a negative control, Tween-80 buffer without protein extract was used as well as Bacillus subtilis protein extracts. As a positive control, T. molitor larvae were used in combination with protein extracts from B. thuringiensis tenebrionis.
16s rRNA PCR
16s rRNA PCR can be used to identify bacterial isolates. The 16s rRNA region consists of highly conserved as well as variable regions; primers anneal to the conserved regions, so the variable regions can be sequenced and used to identify an isolate to the genus level.
The following primers were used to amplify the 16s rRNA region:

Based upon the TLC analysis, we made the following      conclusions. First, we Confirmed that purification of      rhamnolipids via liquid-liquid extraction and TLC analysis      work efficiently for cell culture as well. Next, we      Confirmed that PAO1 mostly produces      di-rhamnolipids. Lastly, both E. Coli and P. putida do not      produce enough rhamnolipids for TLC analysis. Comparing      the MS peaks from P. Arginosa, pure rhamnolipids, and      E.Coli + RhlAB, the peak induced by our construct was not      sufficiently pronounced to conclude that rhamnolipids were      produced.
S. epidermidis Experiments
After adding 5-fold inserts instead of the usual 3, we      successfully PCRed out all the parts necessary to form the      two recombinant plasmids needed to perform Gibson      Assembly. Filter conjugation of empty pC221 into      S. epidermidis RP62A was successful. We made glycerol      stocks of electrocompetent S. Aureus RN4220, OS2/pGO1 and      S. Epidermidis RP62A cells. We made plans to electroplate      empty vector and construct in the coming week. To ensure      that S. epidermidis could survive the secretion of      rhamnolipids, we conducted a qualitative survival test by      directly plating S. epidermidis with the necessary 1g/L      rhamnolipids for Mosquito repellent activity. The      resultant colonies appeared more sparse in      rhamnolipid-Epidermidis cultures than cultures with Just      the bacteria. In order to determine the effect of      rhamnolipids on already established colonies, we grew      S. Epidermidis on plates overnight, and then added 1g/L      rhamnolipids to the already present colonies. A day later,      the colonies in the after one day rhamnolipid addition      plate were slightly denser than those in the immediate      addition of rhamnolipid plate, but less dense than the      plates that had absolutely no rhamnolipids present.
Freeze Dry
We analyzed the difference between survival rate and      survival ratio to get a better sense of the difference      between the two metrics. We conducted the experiment again      with the four day incubation."

The fifth course was about human practice design guidance. Our team has analyzed the contents of the 99 gold medal teams last year. We communicated our analysis results with Shenzhen_SFLS, and gave our suggestions about iGEM to them.
The sixth course was about web building. There are 5 members with a master's degree in design and computer science in our team. We introduced some web building software, and exchanged relevant experience about this part. We have kept in touch with each other in the topic of web building. They were very active and during the course they asked many questions. It's a great blessing to someone studious like them that who is doing research.
The program was really successful. It will be more than this time since we'll keep in touch. Shenzhen_SFLS team said they have gained much from this interaction. And what's more, this activity provided them some new sights about their project and their experiment skills. For our team, we received the priceless happiness when we felt we can help others with our knowledge and we'll keep on going helping. We think this program is a very valuable experience.

In the beginning we decided to use light stimulation. The light-sensitive protein taken from the registry was not consistent, and also the Biobrik sent back from the registry cause us many problems. Finally we opted for UV stimulation first for the space selectivity.

Conclusion:
What is synthetic biology? Professor Xiangrong Xu explained and gave examples for his classmates. We are happy to see that students have such a great interest in synthetic biology. Interestingly, after the meeting, the students gathered around professor Xu and asked him about he contents of synthetic biology and asked the professor to sign on their notes.

Child's public class:
We held a child's public welfare class for children from primary schools. Brother Monkey introduced biology and knowledge of plants, animals, microorganisms, viruses and so on to the children via pictures and videos.
We introduced the structure and principle of DNA, and we worked together to make an model of it. We watched onion slices demonstration video.
We replaced of iodine with red ink. First we dropped a few drops of water on the slides, and taught the children to remove small pieces of onion from the inside of the onion skin. Some of them torn off the epidermises, and some got the curl of the epidermis so that they can not be flattened on the slide. However, they never discouraged and always started again if they failed and finally succeeded. After that, we dropped a piece of red ink at one end of the slide, tilted the slide, and used the paper to absorb water at the other end to ink the onion epidermis completely. After many attempts, the children all succeeded in making an onion-slicing specimen.

Terms that are found in the references reflect the origin of the research literature of iGEM teams as can be observed in the terms like (“biochemistry”,“microbiology”,“biological chemistry”,“chem”) that originate from article titles and journal names. The most common journals are also recognizable (“science”, “national academy”). Unexpectedly, because atuomatic bibliographic tools record the date of citation we can observe that most teams conduct the research for the wiki during June and August.
LIMITATIONS
The limitations of this analysis is the filters that VOSviewer may have that prevent some words like “type” from being considered relevant. Also this analysis can pick up only words that are consistently used in the same way. This is because we did not use a dictionary of synonyms for the analysis with VOSviewer which can increase the resolution of the results. This may explain why we do not pick up commonly used fluorescence proteins like RFP but we do pick"

High Schools
ZJU-China attaches much interest in communication with other teams. It’s very necessary to know more about others and to help each other is the very tradition of Zhejiang University. This year, we helped H4Z to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits.
To help H4Z, we held some seminar in Zhejiang ST, in which we talked a lot about how to run an iGEM team and what should be paid attention to in an iGEM project. Also, we did our experiment in the same lab so we got even more time to help them. In the modeling part, our dry lab helped them write their wiki in a technical way.
The picture of teaching high school teams to do experiment.
BNU
To help BNU, We constructed two main circuits, first one expresses a serine integrase. This intergrase can exclusively catalyze site-specific recombination between attB and attP (click here too see more information from BNU's wiki)  , the attachment sites on phage chromosome and host chromosome. This recombination results in the reverse of the sequence between attB and attP, changing"
TU_Munich,2012,Team:TU Munich#Human Practice#Information Day_-_-_TEXT.html,", we explained the principles of iGEM using Lego Bricks and the children built interesting constructs on their own. The children who participated in our competition won tickets to the zoo in Munich (""Tierpark Hellabrunn""). They painted really nice pictures as you can see below. We learned from the kids that there are actually no boarders for imagination and that the statement ""thinking outside the box"" was here more present than anywhere else. They talked to us and were so enthusiastic about SynBio, because for them it is a tool to change the world. Showing us their view of the world and as a consequence make things very simple had a huge impact on us.

Press Release in English
This press release is the neutral version which was sent to all iGEM Teams which participated in the Action Day. It was the first try to unify all German teams at one day. To promote this our team wrote a press release for all other teams which you can read here in a translated version.
What Lego Bricks and Biology have in common
On the 25th of August the German iGEM Teams held a Germany-wide action day. In [City] students of the [University] informed about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition. Students of the [University] participate this year, like the last years too, in iGEM. iGEM is the abbreviation for ""international Genetically Engineered Machine competition“. This international competition in the field of Synthetic Biology is held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, since 2003. Within the years iGEM got one of the most famous competitions in the steadily growing field of SynBio. In the last year 160 student teams from all over the world participated. Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary field of study, combining molecular biology, chemistry, engineering, biotechnology and IT.
The aim is to create new biological systems which can be transferred in organisms and grant them certain characteristics and features that don't exist naturally. These systems are created in a modular way what is the gist of SynBio and iGEM. These biological systems are designed by single gene parts, called BioBricks. Similar to Lego bricks these Biobricks can be combined in different and new ways. For the completion the teams can use BioBricks from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, comparable to a box of different Lego Bricks. There is no limit, anything is possible.
The teams have half a year to realize their project, either using existing BioBricks or creating new ones. The projects vary a lot, one team faces environmental problems, others build very sensitive bios"

This account recorded our progress and interesting comments about synthetic biology. The articles were written by our team members and were published regularly. The number of Subscribers are increasing as we speak.
HUST_Cheering
On July 7th, members of team ShanghaitechChina_B attended HUST-CHEERING seminar hosted by Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. After several days of heavy rains, the city suffered serious water-logging. Power supply was damaged in HUST. Organizers and participants had to move from the hall to the teaching building to continue our seminar. The classrooms were not spacious but were big enough for passionate IGEMers.
Because ShanghaitechChina_B is a newly founded team, we gave a presentation about our project and received many pieces of valuable advice. Experienced IGEMers also gave their encouragement to our team. Our team gained a more comprehensive understanding of IGEM competition through this event and became much more interested in synthetic biology. It was quite an experience to establish friendships with other IGEM teams.
iDPI
Owing to one of the purposes of IGEM that is to improve public awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology, as the first team founded in ShanghaiTech IGEM, we decided to establish an IGEM Day for Public Interests (IDPI). This year, the IDPI invited students and teachers from Shanghai Concordia International High School and held an IGEM Open-Lab Day on Sep 3rd, 2016. Along with another IGEM team at Shanghaitech, we warmly welcomed the visiting delegation from Concordia. Their delegation included two major science teachers and eight students from different grades. We delivered two introduction speeches about and synthetic biology and the IGEM on behalf of two ShanghaiTech IGEM teams respectively. One was done by Haolong Zhu, a member of ShanghaitechChina Team, another was by Shenjian Ai, one of our team member. We introduced our IGEM project Gutrio to these curious visitors. To explain the design of our project, we made analogy of engineered bacteria to trained agents who carried secret weapons to terminate their targets. Thus, we described our potentially complicated experimental system in an understandable manner - an amazing adventure. Those high school students were all cheered up: “It was really cool!”. Our provocative speeches did stimulate their interests to synthetic biology.
After that, we held an open discussion session, where we witnessed the curiosity and passion of these high school students towards synthetic biology and IGEM. We shared many details of"

Fig 5-C Bacteria concentration of K1755007 and K1755008 bacterial strains vary with time.
Although there are some difference in bacteria density between strain K1755007 and strain K1755008 at the same time, the difference isn't obvious. Statistical analysis also shows that the difference of bacteria density between K1755007 and control group isn't obvious, but the difference of bacteria density between K1755008 and control group is remarkable.

Fig 5-D Riboflavin concentration of  K1755007 and K1755008 bacterial strains vary with time.
After linking different parts, riboflavin expression level is distinctly different because K1755007 is constructed with strong promoter and strong RBS so that it has the strongest ability to produce riboflavin followed by K1755008, which is weaker than K1755007. The experimental phenomena coincide with theoretical analysis, showing that K1755007 and K1755008 both can work. Some problematic data have been removed.

Fig 5-E The ratio of riboflavin and bacteria concentration of different kinds of BL21 vary with time.
Through the ratio curve of riboflavin and OD value from the same serial number and the same time point, we can intuitively know that K1755007 and K1755008 can observably improve riboflavin production in E.Coli and K1755007 behaves batter than K1755008.
Using SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solutions) paired sample t test for significance test, we obtain the following results on the condition that the confidence level is 95%.

The graphical presentation of the result above clearly shows that the negative control has reducing absorbance with increased treatment. This was unexpected, as it should have theoretically remained constant. The steep decrease in the negative control sample could however indicate that other proteins from the cell lysate may play a role in causing the dispersal of S. aureus biofilm.
In contrast, the treated wells with lysostaphin samples show a reduced absorbance that remained constant with increased volume of treatment. In the treated samples we see that at low treatment volumes the absorbance is already low, at around 1.5. This is comparable to that of the positive control which has an average absorbance of 1.09 (not shown). Hence, even though we do not see a declining slope of absorbance towards an increase of treatment volume, it was likely that with low volumes, lysostaphin was able to disperse S. aureus biofilm. This is confirmed by the t-test where there a significant effect of biofilm dispersal at a P-value <0.03 for a majority of the Lys 2 samples.

Lys 2 (S): Cell lysate containing lysostaphin from the supernatant fraction  Lys 2 (P): Cell lysate containing lysostaphin from the pellet fraction.
As in the previous graph, we observe an unexpected drop in the negative control. The t-test for the dispersal of P. aeruginosa shows that for most of the treated samples, the result was insignificant. This implies that lysostaphin is ineffective against P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersal.
Adding Sortase and His tags to the expression construct
To be able to attach lysostaphin to spider silk we would need to add a linker-tag (LT) that would act as a recognition sequence for Sortase A. The LT consisting of a LPETGG motif would then be conjugated to a corresponding glycine sequence on the spider silk by Sortase. The addition of the LT mimics that of the"

With the three models mentioned above, we finally proved the accessibility of our roGFP2-Orp1 detecting method.
Fluorescent Probe Model (Chick                     here for details)
The model was established based on the mechanism of the fluorescence probe and we revised it                     according to the experimental results. From this model we can realize the conversion between                     fluorescence intensity of the probe and intracellular H2O2 concentration from                     overexpression of genes.
H2O2 Decomposition Model (Click                     here for details)
In our experiment, we found it was hard to measure the intracellular H2O2 concentration, so we controlled the external H2O2 concentration in culture to confirm our system's function because the H2O2 can entry the cell quickly through simple diffusion. So we fitted the relationship between two kinds of H2O2 concentration, through experimental data and ordinary differential equation based on the processes of H2O2 diffusion and decomposition in yeast cells. In this way, the mutual translation of external and intracellular H2O2 concentrations can be achieved.
roGFP2-Orp1 Michaelis equation model (Click                     here for details)
The model was established based on the mechanism of the Michealis equation to describe the                     relationship between intracellular H2O2 concentrations and the roGFP2                     fluorescence intensity changing. We simplified the process of the reaction between roGFP2-Orp1 and                     intracellular H2O2 as a classic Michealis equation, which helped us                     understanding this process better.

A summary of our Meetings
MARCH
2nd: GET TOGETHER!! Cristina brought brownies!
9th: We started looking at some of the previous successful projects.
16th: More on the old projects eating a fantastic Tiramisu from Giacomo.
23rd: Crash course on Synthetic Biology from Sheref and Cristina
APRIL
13rd: Brainstorming. No more cakes?
16th: Brainstorming. Where is the cake?
19th: It seems like everybody likes the idea proposed by Daniele. Remove the black crust from statues. We decided to look more specifically into these topics: A) how to dissolve the black crust, B) how to keep the “patina nobile” (calcium oxalate protective film) and C) how to kill biofilms, all to protect statues and marble monuments. Giacomo will look into secretion systems and Francesco suggested a photoinducible system. We have homework to do.
24th: Discussion on possible ways to achieve our goals. We looked into the mechanism of SRB for sulfate reduction.
27th: More ideas on the Black crust project based on a work of J.Keasling that Jason found in the literature. We are also thinking of having a side project for the characterization of deposited parts (RBS, promoters, terminators?). Each of us will further investigate the fesibility of the topics discussed on April 19th and will present a plan of work for next time.
MAY
14th: Presentations and discussion on the investigated topics. Other PIs from CIBIO participated to the discussion too.
28th: The project is finalized: We will save the world one statue at time! We decided to drop the project on the formation of calcium oxalate"

Mentoring, Virtual Conference and Wiki Workshop
Being Mentored by the Veterans
With their prior experience with iGEM, the NYU-AD team was able to help with insights on our project, interlab doubts and an overall understanding of how iGEM works. Our team                     member, Sahana visited them and had discussions related to possible collaborations. The NYU-AD team was very friendly and enthusiastic about their mentorship and made sure that                     we felt like family.
Wiki Workshop
The NYU-AD team conducted a wiki workshop that covered a lot of necessary points that we could keep in mind while designing our Wiki. Basics of HTML, CSS AND Java and many other rules pertaining to iGEM were also discussed.By covering the iGEM Wiki rules and resources,the workshop indeed gave us a clearer picture of how to organise our content. NYU-AD Virtual Conference
An online conference was conducted by NYU-Abu Dhabi, on 15 th September, where six teams, including ours, participated in this virtual conference from India, Abu Dhabi, Australia, China and Turkey.
Google Hangouts was the preferred medium of communication for the conference. After the initial introductions, each team shared what their idea and project was about, what challenges were being faced, human practices, tips and suggestions to other teams and much more, and this virtual presentation was kick-started by the host team themselves. Each team was given a 15-minute slot to present their project and we were able to share the presentation (if any) through the google hangouts screen sharing feature. Then there was a round of questions to the team presenting.
On the whole, it was a very enriching and educative experience as we learnt a lot from the teams who participated. A big thanks to the host Team NYU Abu Dhabi, and the participating Team HKUST from Hong Kong, REC Chennai from India, Team Saint"

show technical details
One colony of pC13BH had a good banding pattern and was submitted for sequencing. Digested T7 polymerase PCR with XbaI and PstI and pC13F with BamHI and KpnI (sites were appended via PCR). pC13F that was digested with XbaI and PstI as well as with BamHI and KpnI were dephosphorylated for ligation. After confirming T7 polymerase PCR on a gel, it was ligated into pA13AM and pC13P. Additionally, Pc + T7 polymerase was ligated into pC13F and PpelA was ligated into pC13F. We ran those PCR's for the Gibson of pC13BN on a gel. lox 2 worked, but lox 1 did not, so I purified lox 2 and reran the PCR of lox 1 (it is in the small fridge labeled lox 1).  I also made glycerol stocks of pC13BX and pC13CJ so that we have those in case we need to do more minipreps on them. We also had transformants for pC13CN so I made cultures with spectinomycin for all of them and ran a colony PCR on them.  The colony PCR did not work due to incorrect protocol. We do not have the correct primers to do a PCR on this plasmid because its in Bbb format, so we just have to assume the plasmid is present because the cultures are growing in Spec. Tomorrow we need to miniprep those cultures that are in the incubator. We blended G. lucidum and made two 100mL cultures with 75mL cells and 25 mL cells. We will now let these grow for 2 days before attempting protoplasting once more. We created large batches of vectors (pC13F (XbaI,PstI) and (EcoRI-HF,PstI), pC13D (XbaI,PstI)). pC13AG sequence is sequence confirmed! We tried to dephosphorylate, but mistakenly used DNA Ligase on pC13F and pC13Q instead"

Hamburg,2016,Team:Hamburg#HP#Gold_-_-_TEXT.html," Tanzania was really focused on training people from around Africa to providing mentorship so that they could run effective and efficiently managed eye care systems. So the research that we intended to do has been more on service delivery than it has been on the specifics of a particular disease. My doctoral work was actually on trachoma in Egypt back in the mid/late 80’s and of course I was involved in a lot of trachoma work. But truly that started more from 2009 because simply trachoma for many years was kind of dominated by a particular organization and until that organization underwent significant change on how they worked, it was not a field I wanted to spent lot of time in. So in 2009, and that was the initial trachoma initiative (ITI), the funders of ITI basically clenched down the old ITI and it was reopened in Atlanta under the task force with huge change in how it functions.
    It was that time when I was more involved in trachoma again. My current role is: I am the technical lead for all of the UK governments donor support for trachoma. That also includes the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust support as well. It’s like an 80-million-pound program in nine countries and I provide the technical backup for all of this countries. I recently stepped down as director of KCCO, part of my semi-retirement plan. Still more semi than retirement but that’s the way it is. I lived in Africa about 20 years and only moved back to the US in April so we’re in the process of learning what it’s like to live in America which is at this current election period a bit scary. […]
Daniel C.:
Where did you live in Africa for those 20 years?
Dr. Courtright:
It would have been 1 year in Ethiopia, 4 years in Malawi, 11 years in Tanzania, 4 years in South Africa.
Daniel C.:
Then you really must have an overview of how the chlamydia endemic works in different countries within Africa?
Dr. Courtright:
Yeah, I have to visit all the nine countries which are Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi, Chad, Nigeria, and […] Zambia. I visit all these countries at least once a year and worked with all those folks for many, many years. I’m also involved with assisting Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen ... I’m now helping Vietnam to get their dossier for declaration of verification of elimination and the same for Nepal. So, yes, I have a pretty good sense on what"

Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#pumi_-_-_TEXT.html," but concentrations exceeding this value of CuCl2 may have a negative impact on the ability of oxidizing ABTS. This fits the expectations as laccases are copper reliant enzymes and gain their activity through the incorporation of copper. Additionally negative controls were done using the tested concentrations of CuCl2 without applying laccase to detect the oxidization of ABTS through copper (see Figure 15). The more CuCl2 was present, the more ABTS was oxidzied after 5 hours. Still the maximal change accounts only for ~6% oxidized ABTS after 5 hours.
Figure 14: Activity measurement using 0.1 mM ABTS of BPUL incubated in different CuCl2 concentrations. Without CuCl2 incubation the BPUL laccase shows half of the activit as after CuCl2 incubation. Incubation with 0.1 mM CuCl2 or higher concentrations leas to an increase in ABTSox.
Figure 15: Negative control for CuCl2 activity Tests using different concentrations of CuCl2 H2O instead of Laccase to determine the potential of ABTS getting oxidized through CuCl2.
In relation to apply the laccase in waste water treatment plants it is beneficial knowing, that small amounts of CuCl2 are enough to activate the enzyme. Still it is expensive to be reliant on CuCl2 and a potential risk using heavy metals for waste water purifcation.
BPUL activity at different temperatures
Figure 16: Standard activity test for BPUL measured at 10°C and 25°C resulting in a decreased activity at 10°C. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10°C were analyzed.
To investigate the activity of BPUL at lower temperatures, activity tests as described above were performed at 10°C and 25°C. A small decrease in the activity can be observed upon reducing the temperature from 25°C to 10°C (see Fig. 16). After 3.5 hours when samples at 25°C reached the saturation samples at 10°C had not, but nonetheless the difference is minimal. After 3 hours 5% difference in oxidized ABTS is observable. The negative control without the BPUL laccase but 0.4 mM CuCl2 at 10°C shows a negligible oxidation of ABTS. A a decrease in the reactivity of BPUL laccase was expected. The observed small reduction in enzyme activity is excellent news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants where the temperature differs"

Pconst: J23116 from Berkeley 2006 ""J23116"" (sequence copied into our primers)
RBS: B0034 from the Registry ""B0034"" (sequence copied into our primers)
TetR: ""TetR sequence"" (623 bp)- The sequence lacks a stop codon, so we added one (TAA) with our primers.
Our TetR plasmid contains a p15A replication origin, the same medium-copy number as in J61002 to ensure that during co-transformations the 2 different plasmids are present in same amounts. The plasmid carries a Kanamycin resistance marker, since co-transformations with J61002 means we need a different selection antibiotic for each plasmid to confirm both are present (J61002 = Ampicillin resistance).
Cutting out RFP
We were surprised to see that the colonies recovered after Gibson assembly were red, indicating that the pSB3K1 plasmid contains RFP. By looking at it more carefully, we discovered that we had included the Biobrick region with our primers, which explains why RFP was present in our pSB3K1 backbone. Taking advantage of the BioBrick format, we digested our pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR plasmid with SpeI and XbaI and then successfully religated.
Now we have the expected TetR plasmid that is used in combination with the J61002 Ptet-RFP plasmid into our first readout system . The complete sequence of the plasmid is available here .
Second plasmid - pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR Ptet-LacI
For the second readout system, we added LacI under Ptet promoter to pSB3K1 Pconst-TetR (after RFP had been cut out).

Fluorescence Blank variation
Here we repeat a similar analysis to the previous part, except that this time we will account for variations in the blank for fluorescence data. However, we suspect that there has been a systematic error in the results returned by the fluorometer. The analysis brings out the data's most important features and compensates for these.
All the raw data files will also be uploaded in the wiki for further details and explanations.
28 ºC
At this temperature, variations of the blank levels have been taken to be between 250 and 300 Fluorescent units (discarding overshoots).
This means that once again, fluorescence data must be normalized against different blank data values to account for this variation.
Figure 1: Fluorescence variation in blank wells at 28ºC
42 ºC
Here, variations seem to be linear, as seen in the absorbance case so one of the causes for this may be evaporation.
However, they may also be due to systematic error of the fluorometer.

BUCT-China,2014,Team:BUCT-China_-_-_TEXT.html,"ig et al. 1995). Hg(II) binding to the MerR homodimer results in both a relaxation of the DNA bends induced by apo-MerR, and both DNA distortion (Frantz &O’Halloran 1990) and an allosteric under winding of the promoter sequence by approximately 33(Ansari et al. 1992). The underwinding of the promoter DNA aligns the-10 and -35 sequences, such thatRNApolymerase can recognize and bind to these sites, initiating transcription from PmerT  (Heltzel et al. 1990; Ansari et al.1992, 1995).  The current model describes a resistance mechanism whose expression is repressed until Hg(II) ions enter the cytoplasm of the cell, but is primed to initiate transcription of the resistance genes at very low levels of Hg(II), and to fully induce resistance gene expression across a narrow increase in external Hg(II) concentration.

- Digested all PCRs and protet with EcoRI and HindIII. Gel of digestion shows success.
- Performed gel purification, but got concentrations all under 6 ng/uL.
- Tried several ligations of control and PUf binding site YFP into protet anyways. Used 10:1 insert to vector ratios. Running ligations overnight.
- Did PCR cleanup on the three samples from yestereday, digested with EcorI and HindIII.
- Digested pBAD as well.
- Ran gel of the digests, only one of the PCR's worked, the digest of pBAD didn't work.
- Extracted the PCR sample digest that worked, and ligated it with a previously digested pBAD sample
7/11/2012
- Incubation for alkane production finished; took out the culture from the chromotography tubes; Not sure whether we extracted sample using Ethyl Acetate or not.
- Talked to Dr. Jin about GCMS; He directed us to Dr. Lee. He also mentioned that before GCMS, the C15 alkanes have to be injected in M9 media to test for a standard curve
- Transformed ligations, and plated on CM plates.
- Plated 4 pTET transformations, placed back in 37 degree room.
- Poured LB into 50mL conical tubes in sterile hood in MMG since somehow previous LB got contaminated.
- Transformed and plated the ligation reaction
7/12/2012
- Designing primers for cCFP amplification, PUF-CFP tethering of both N and C termini, and creating check primers for MSC1 and MSC2 of pETDuet-1 in order to sequence the constructs.
- Transformations from yesterday failed, so replated all of them.
- Started a second ligation from the digests, now using a 6:1 insert:vector ratio instead of a 10:1.
- There were no colonies, replated two more plates from the 7/10/12 digest.
- Also transformed and plated two plates using a ligation from 7/7/12
7/13/2012
- Found many colonies, however the number of colonies seems to be too many. Difficult to isolate individual colonies.
Week 8 Notes
7/16/12

Taking several issues in consideration we decided to regulate RcnA.
Here is the page of our team in case you're interested in reading more about our project:
https://2008.igem.org/Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico
However we've been having some trouble in finding parameters for our model (such as RcnA's half-life, efficiency, synthesis rate among others). Therefore, having exhausted (or so we believe) the literary resources and having found your name in many of the papers regarding RcnA we decided to contact you. I'll try to explain with more detail the parameters we still lack in case you're interested in providing us with information.
I greatly thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail and await your answer.
Carlos Vargas
Dr. Peter Chivers' reply
Dear Carlos,
Thank you for your e-mail. From what I read on your website, it looks like your team is tackling an interesting project. Unfortunately, there are very few papers on RcnA itself, and none of them have examined the parameters that you need for your model. As far as I know, the groups that have published in the RcnR/RcnA area don't typically do those sorts of measurements so they are unlikely that have the data you need. We have no plans to do these experiments as my lab focuses on the nickel responsive regulators, RcnR and NikR.
I'm sorry that I can't be of more assistance. Good luck with your project, I hope it is well received at the iGEM competition.
Best regards,
Peter

St_Andrews,2011,Team:St Andrews#drugdel_-_-_TEXT.html,"), instead binding to only prokaryotic cell membranes, nullifying any potential negative interaction between the drug and the host (Hancock and Sahl, 2006).
Dangers of Bacterial Drug Vectors
There are, however, dangerous factors involved in using live bacteria as a drug delivery system.  The act of releasing the drug from the burst cell also involves releasing the rest of intracellular contents, including chemicals which may indirectly act as stimuli, and could illicit potentially detrimental responses from the body.  One concern we’ve raised before is the release of endotoxins imbedded in the phospholipid membrane.  While the word “endotoxin” in a general sense can describe any toxin generated within the bacteria, gram-negative endotoxins are more particular.  These are found specifically within the outer layer of the phospholipid bilayer and are responsible for the disease-causing aspect of gram-negative toxicity.  Release of these endotoxins induce an inflammatory response by the body, causing macrophages and endothelial cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (Stewart, 2006).  Septic shock is dangerous, and the problem of endotoxin production would have to be addressed before any in vivo testing could occur.  This is not, however, beyond the reach of future scientific advances, as the endotoxin molecules are produced by DNA just as malleable as our kill switch.  Synthetic biology would need to advance to a point where non-endotoxic bacteria could be engineered before bacterial vectors would be safe for in vivo testing.
There are also complications arising from interactions between both the immune system and the bacteria.  Because we are inoculating the body with invasive, colonizing bacteria, how the body and its immune system might react remains an unknown factor.  Members of the host’s immune system recognize proteins on the surface of bacteria.  This recognition is what allows immune response cells like macrophages to engulf and digest non-host microbes.  In order to combat this issue, we would need to synthesize bacteria with either cell-surface proteins that are not recognized by host immune defenses, or with no cell-surface proteins at all.  The concern at this point is not whether this is achievable with synthetic biology (as our knowledge of synthetic biology deepens over time, one day this technology will be available), but the risk of passing this genetic sequence to other bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.  Conjugation, when one bacteria passes DNA to another, is the only form of horizontal gene transfer involving cell-to-cell contact (Holmes and Job"

Offering equipment and reagent
Although we have more than two well equipped laboratories in the Institute of Biophysics (IBP, CAS) where we can carry out our experiments, we have to spend 3 hours commuting between IBP and our campus. Thanks to BNDS_China, who generously provided us with some equipment we do not have on campus, we managed to finish some of our experiment without wasting time on the subway. We also want to thank BIT-China. They generously provided us with 4 liters of Methanol for HPLC-MS testing during National Day vacation when we were out of stock and all our suppliers were off work, which facilitated the progress of our experiments.
Safe Project Design
Aimed at dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, we engineered our bacteria to detect and degrade ammonia. To ensure the safety of our project, we chose E. coli (TOP10 strain for detection, BL21 strain for degradation and DH5α for InterLab) as our project chassis, which is of group 1 risk. Although we introduce resistance genes into our circuits, they are the ones that commonly used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
For ammonia detection, we also designed a device to apply our bacteria into practical use, of which safety is of crucial value. We used filter to isolate the component that will contact with bacteria from other components of the device and open environment. Afterwards, we have a complete decontamination protocol to deal with our engineered bacteria and the component of the device that contact the bacteria.
For ammonia degradation, we have successfully expressed all the enzymes we need in E. coli. However, considering the harm E. coli can do to aquatic creatures, our engineered bacteria will not be directly released into fish ponds. Instead, we planned to replace our chassis with other harmless bacteria such as B.subtilis now that our concept has been proved success in E. coli.
Safe Laboratory Work
Lab Safety Rules
We have already completed and submitted the safety form. We guarantee to follow the safety rules provided by iGEM in our lab work. Besides, we have safety rules in our lab as well. We separate the experimenting area and living area apart, no experimental material is allowed in living area and no living item is allowed in experimenting area. When we do experiments, we strictly follow the protocol and are monitored by the lab manager.
Safe Parts
In detection part, we transformed three different promotors and a RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will"

NTNU_Trondheim,2018,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,".  Consequently, the prosthetic must be removed through another surgery and replaced with a new one. This is very stressful for the patient, as well as expensive. There is no revolutionary way to treat biofilm on prostheses.
We were curious to know Kåres opinion on the E. coli strain (TG1) that we chose as our biofilm producing bacteria to be used in our future Crystal Violet Assay experiments (Biofilm Quantification). Kåre told us that there is no guarantee that a bacterium known for a low, medium or high biofilm production actually will produce the expected amount of biofilm. It largely depends on the growth medium that we use. According to Kåre, a proper glucose concentration is the most important criteria to induce the right amount of biofilm production in our chosen E. coli strain. Biofilm formation in nature and in the laboratory is not the same. In addition, Kåre made us rethink our experimental procedure in quantifying biofilm produced by E. coli. We initially planned to use a protocol for a Crystal Violet Assay and described the approach to him. He questioned the protocols reliability and found a new protocol which he found more reliable (See Protocols -> Crystal Violet).
We gained more knowledge about biofilm and the problems it can cause on prosthetics. In addition, Kåre made us aware of the flaws in our original protocols for biofilm quantification, and consequently we went with the alternative protocol that he had recommended. As another result of the interview, we performed a test on LB and M63B1 medium to see what glucose and pH values were optimal for biofilm formation in E. coli Dh5α and TG1 strains. His advice benefited us a lot by allowing us to produce significant amounts of biofilm and therefore enabling us to see whether CRISPRi had an inhibitory effect or not.

Conclusion for Integrated HP
His insight was significant when choosing incubation times and growth media (M63B1 in addition to LB).
By doing a cell viability assay we can learn more about the biofilm formed in our plates, and not just that there is less biofilm.
Key insight
It may be difficult to inhibit all pathways in bacterial communication, due to its complexity.

Friday 1/8
The overnight culture of PCR3 has been miniprepped, nanodropped and saved as product. The concentration were too low though - the sample was run in speedy vac.
Digest of PCR1-plasmid with E+S, PCR2-plasmid with E+S, and PCR3-plasmid with E+X.
In addition, freezing stocks has been made, of BBa_I742111, BBa_K118024, BBa_B0015, BBa_J23119 and Fat2 (Δ12 desaturase).
The results from the earlier digests run on a gel showed no PCR3 product, why another gel was run with same PCR3, not digested, to see, if there's no DNA in the sample solution. This showed no bands. An overnight culture has been made from freezing stock of the same PCR3 sample, to investigate, if something's wrong with the freezing stock.
The digested PCR1 and PCR2 had the right lengths and has thus been purified.

Saturday 2/8
The sequencing data of PCR3 from specific freezing stock sample, showed that the GFP generator has the wrong direction - wrong ligation links of X-X and S-S (X-S and S-X).
To make a new PCR3 construct, PCR on template: plate 4: 11P, 2014, BBa_E0840, was made, since the template was a pSB1A3 backbone. The product was run on a gel. The bands showed the right length, and the product was thus purified.
pSB1C3 has been digested with S+X and FastAP - reaction for 1 hour. The reaction was run on a gel, and the right band (around 2000 bp) has been purified. In addition, the new PCR3 has been digested as well, with X+S, and purified.
Following ligations has been made:
J23 + I74
J23 + K11
pSB1C3 + PCR3
PCR3-template has been transformed, like the ligations above.
Also, a digestion of the constitutive promoter, J23119, with S+P, has been made. This was run on a gel, and the right band (2000 bp) was purified.
