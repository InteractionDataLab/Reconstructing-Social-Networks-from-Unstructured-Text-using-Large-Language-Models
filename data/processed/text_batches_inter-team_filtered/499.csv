Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," our project, we should not only assess the safety risks but     also the security risks
In general, there are two potential hazards considered     generally; successful competition against other natural strains and     horizontal gene transfer from engineered bacteria to natural     strains. [2] Natural strains have less changes compared with GMO’s     considered their fitness. For example, most designed bacteria     contain antibiotic resistance cassettes in their plasmid, which are     used for the cell forcing to keep an insert plasmid. In absence of     selection a plasmid can be discarded by its host. [3] Therefore,     due to horizontal gene transfer, some engineered genes might could     have been taken up by other bacteria, which also could lead to     competition with other strains. Both situations end up creating a     natural imbalance between species.
There are several regulations regarding genetically modified     bacteria. The one that applies to us are the ones about working     safely with GMO’s and the sending of GMO’s . Following these rules should be taken seriously.
Over time, the lack of evolutionary stability of synthetic DNA     might serve as safety itself. A synthetic bacteria could change to     a near wild-type state, thank to pseudo-restoration. [4] But there     is current consensus that multiple safety mechanisms are needed to     ensure that risks are lowered in case of component inactivation. [5]
We designed a kill-switch to prevent against the two potential     hazards. This kill-switch in under a constructive promotor which is     always on, unless suppressed. If the spores are released in nature     they will not germinate, because of tetracycline deficiency. Under     the control of PtetR, the nuclease is translated, which is capable     of digesting extracellular genetic material. This means that     horizontal gene transfer isn’t a possibility.
Looking at the security aspects, both applications in the     kill-switch are also to prevent that  unauthorized parties gain our     spores with the message or key. If the unauthorized receiver tries     to grow the spores without the right compounds, the kill-switch     will be activated and the message or key will be digested by the     NucA. This makes our system should be safe and secure.
Safe by Design: RIVM
The RIVM, The National Institute for Public Health and Environment, challenged us to go beyond the safety forms of iGEM. By inviting iGEM teams from the Netherlands to present an implementation of Safe-by-Design, they wish to improve safety. At the first meeting with the RIVM, we presented our plan for safety in our"

Last Steps
Rhl: Transformation of E. coli DH5α with BB_B0034 (ribosome binding site), BBa_K1331006 (rhlAB) and a vector carrying a kanamycin resistance. Overnight cultivation thereof, Miniprep and digestion with EcoRI, SpeI or XbaI, respectively. This plan was dropped since the yield was not satisfying.
Nis: Sequencing confirmed the Composite Biobrick for Nisin, containing our modified Nisin with different tags, a RBS and an arabinose promotor. In order to include the whole processing cluster of Nisin Gibson Assembly was performed with NisA_LY, NisBTCIP and pSB1C3.
Chi: Construction of BBa_K28480001 (NodC+COD-HisTag) from BBa_K2380002 (NodC, SpeI) and the PCR product from BBa_K2380043 (XbaI/SpeI). Multiple colonies were picked and the orientation of the COD fragment in the construct was tested by colonyRCA and restriction digestion using MscI.
Activity assay was performed for the chitin synthase NodC using the UDP Glo Kit (Promega) and UDP-GlcNAC as substrate. Activity was compared for NodC from BBa_K2380002 and BBa_K28480000.
Link:The company dispendix provided us their iDot to print bacteria suspension on agar plate. With this we conducted experiments for antimicrobial.
Mod:The first equilibration run successfully but for the production run with npt condition the equilibration time was to short, so the step size for equilibration was extended activity.

The BioBrick terminator, BBa_B1003 was restricted with Xbal and Pstl and ligated, along with the nutR site, into pSB1C3 to construct K37014. K37015 was constructed by restricting the BioBrick terminator, BBa_B0011, with Xbal and Pstl and ligated, along with the nutR site into pSB1C3. In order to ensure that the plasmid contained the desirable inserts, verification PCRs with primers IG201 and IG004 was carried out. The estimated sizes of the inserts are shown below:
IG201 + IG004 tail + nutR = 284 base pairs.
Figure 6: Left: GeneRuler DNA ladder mix from Fermentas. Right: Verification PCRs of the Biobricks K374013 (586 base pairs), K374015 (284 base pairs, lane 8) and K374014 (284 base pairs, lane 16).
Construction of BioBrick K374016
This construct contains lambda’s natural RBS site (BBa_B0034), followed by a FACS optimized mutant of the Green Fluorescent Protein (BBa_K374012) and nutR site (BBa_K374005). Again, the 3A assembly approach has been used. The RBS-GFP was excised with EcoRl and Spel, while the nutR site with Xbal and Pstl. RBS-GFP  and nutR were then ligated into pSB1C3 (with EcoRl and Pstl sticky ends). After transformation, the verification PCR with primers IG201  and IG004 was performed. The estimated size of this part includes the sizes of the following parts:
IG201 + GFP + nutR + IG004 tail + RBS + biobrick scar = 140+717+118+2618+6=1025 base pairs

She is a very well organised people and very responsible. She always ask us for the content we need to present before the general meeting and then send the email. It is lucky for us to have her to be our secretary. Also, she is good at using photoshop and other software and is willing to teach us to use it. It helps a lot when we need to design a team logo and t-shirt. And she loves singing, she always sing when she is waiting for the PCR or gel.

The Gel Loader. Olivia, or usually called OW, is super helpful and responsible in everything. She is very good in handling any work in the busiest days in the lab, she’s also known as the gel loader due to her talent in it. Her hobby in the lab is filling pipette tips box, while singing. Basically she sings every time there’s any waiting time in doing lab work, even during heat shock or cold shock. Funny thing about her is her panic response. Whenever she suddenly finds out something wrong, she will say “eh.. eh..” with a slightly louder voice.
Name: Raymon Rui Chen
Height: I'm tall; Weight: It's a secret! Belongs to the tetp group.
Raymon spends a lot of time studying and aiding the work in modelling for the tri-stable switch. Moreover, he is always willing to provide help to people who are short in hands. He is the kind of person that you want to work as a partner since he is hard-working and willing to pursuit an accurate and reliable result which often requires more work. All in all, Raymon is a reliable and undoubtedly valuable member to the team.

Building With Biology Event
Stony Brook iGEM collaborated with The Maritime Explorium to plan a Building With Biology Event. This event was designed to educate children aged 6-13 on synthetic biology through hands on activities and conversations with iGEM team members and other scientists. The events included teaching the children about DNA and cellular functions, the influence of synthetic biology in things that they already see every day, like food, and about BioBricks and how they're used. Activities were aimed not just to educate the attendees, but to alleviate any fears about synthetic biology and genetic engineering that the public had. We also spoke to some of the older attendees about research since some of them were interested in it but didn't know how to get involved.
New York Hall of Science Forum
Team members ran a forum centered around the ethics of genetic engineering, specifically applied to mosquitos. We facilitated discussion between scientists and the public on the impact genetic engineering could have and its presence in the world today. We also participated in a mixer with attendees to address any questions they had about genetic engineering. We also presented on our project and the implications it could have in the future.
DNA Learning Center
iGEM team members went to the DNA Learning Center at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to present about iGEM, what BioBricks are, how they're made, and what purpose they'd have, as well as our projects and why we're doing them. We also spoke about iGEM as a research opportunity, since the majority of the audience were incoming high school freshmen who were interested in genetic engineering and research on biological systems. We also spoke to the assistant director of the learning center about helping her out with a class that the lab plans to hold on synthetic biology in the future and making ourselves available if she needed us.
Port Jefferson Maker's Faire
The team represented iGEM at The Maker's Faire, an event that allows the local youth to explore science and robotics and meet innovators in the field. We were able to set up a table and talk to people about what iGEM and synthetic biology are all about. We also held demonstrations of elephant toothpaste using yeast, and afterwards, explaining that yeast's uses aren't limited to beer, bread and bubbles, but can also be used for vaccine preservation and cancer detection as well!

Safety
Biology is a domain that require extensive cautions especially when it comes to the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). For this reason we focused extensively on the safety part of our project.
I- Project Safety
General
Throughout the whole project, we used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as host organism for all the laboratory work. This single cell algae are widely distributed around the world, in soil and freshwater. We used Chlamydomonas reinhardtii D66 : a non-pathogenic strain for humans and the environment.   To assess the safety of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, researchers estimated the genotoxic potential of the dried C. reinhardtii algal biomass and found no evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxic activity. (1)   This strain is characterized by normal photosynthetic properties, but requires ammonia as a source of nitrogen. Intrestingly, this ability could be a key factor in the future success of algal-based biofuels.   Therefore, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is easy to use in conventional laboratory without any risk.
Goal
The aim of our project is to cultivate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in marine environment, to avoid competition with arable land. However, many laws are governing the use of modified organisms in natural environments. Indeed, after our interview with Stephane Lemaire, an expert of microalguae, we noticed several challenge in our project. For example, the release of our microalgae into the marine environment can lead to horizontal gene transfer between marine microorganisms.
Despite the genetic modifications made to our microalgae, which could lead to its death in case of strong environmental disturbances, our project requires a real average of bio-containment. A solution were then proposed. « In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, none of the 69 protein‐coding genes in the plastome uses the stop codon UGA, therefore this spare codon can be exploited as a useful synthetic biology tool ». (2). The goal is to integrate these stop codon in the genome, then to introduce a tRNA to associate with a non-natural amino acid."

The overnight-cultured E. coli were centrifuged and lysed with Lysis Buffer (12.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 4% SDS). The resulting lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 for 2 hours and destained until the protein bands were clear. As the data showed in Figure 2, LO protein was expressed at around the estimated molecular weight of 17 kDa, LO-AOX fusion protein at 91 kDa and AOX protein at 79 kDa. The protein expression level was consistent with the data of GFP in Figure 1, demonstrating the low gene expression level of a LO fusion protein. However, so far we cannot confirm whether LO fusion protein is able to direct AOX or GFP proteins displayed on the cell surface of E. coli. We’re planning to do a subcellular fractionation to separate the outer membrane proteins for analysis in the future.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Synergene#applicationscenario_-_-_TEXT.html," directly in the environment we are attempting to protect. Our first line of defense would the build of the phosphorus reclamation module (PRM), the beads used to hold and suspend the bacteria need to be engineered and refined to reduce the risk of leaching (bacteria escaping). Filters would be installed on the input and output flows of the PRM. Both to prevent sediment build up in the filter housing and to prevent bacteria from being released through the output.
Our team has considered the practical and theoretical constraints of a kill switch capable of causing self-destruction if the integrity of the PRM becomes compromised. This killswitch would lower the likelihood that a viable cell could escape the PRM and propagate in the wild. While be believe in reducing the risk of release, cell or colonies do not appear to pose as huge a risk as the engineered system might.
Dual-Use Technology: In the most simple terms, our project takes a resource (Phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate) that is dispersed in the environment and collects it into a highly concentrated form. This allows it to be more useful, removes it from the environment, and increases the value of the concentrated product. However this can pose several obvious risks of abuse.
Calcium phosphate (commonly found in rock deposits), can be mixed with carbon and heated to produce White Phosphorus (also called yellow phosphorus or tetraphosphorus) which was used in smoke, tracer, illumination, and incendiary munitions. There has been debate on whether munitions of this type qualify as incendiary weapons, which are prohibited by Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (part of the well known Geneva Convention). While smoke munitions, the most common use of phosphorus, are given an exception for use, the danger still remains that the collected phosphate may be a target for those seeking to do harm.
Munitions aren’t the only dangerous use of this collected phosphorus. The collected phosphorus could be used for the result it was built to avoid. Accidental (or intentional) release of concentrated phosphorus could spur algae blooms in the region our system is in place to protect, as phosphorus is generally the limiting resource, this creates a vulnerability in our system as any puncture of the storage container could result in contamination of the body of water.
Our system was designed to collect phosphorus, however we acknowledge that this system can be applied to collect other chemicals or nutrients of interest. Our model could be used to collect herbicides, harmful chemicals, and could be used in consort with other iGEM projects such as the 2013 project"

To test the effect of DMSO on the PCR performance, one extra tube per amplicon was made that was supplemented with 1.5 μL DMSO (3% final) and 34 μL MilliQ. Additionally, instead of the amplified Tn5 PCR product as template, the original pTXB1-Tn5 plasmid was used as template.  Finally, a negative control sample was taken into account that contained no primers and 37.5 μL MilliQ instead.
The thermocycler programme was installed to have an extension time of 1 min 30 seconds and an annealing temperature of 60 °C. In order to check the difference between two PCR machines (older one and new one), the tubes were divided over the two thermocyclers. After the programme was finished, samples were kept at 4 °C.

The obtained PCR products Linker-Tn5 and Tn5-Linker were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4 μL DNA was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
As can be seen, the PCR amplification with primers 005 and 006 resulting in Linker-Tn5 were successful. The primers 007 and 008 did not result in any PCR amplicons. Also, the HF buffer supplemented with 3% DMSO resulted in the required amplicon. Remarkably, the old PCR machine did result in thicker and brighter bands DNA. This might be due to the differences in speed when changing temperature.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#project Basic circuits.html_-_-_TEXT.html," optimal condition for most microorganisms. For the sake of regulating the acidic environment, we need to construct an alkali production circuit. Our project concentrates on the gad system in Escherichia coli str. K-12.
GadA, one of a functional genes for producing alkali, is employed in our circuit to convert glutamate to GABA, which is a certain kind of alkaline substance. GadC (glutamate γ-amino butyric acid anti-porter) exchanges extracellular Glutamate and intracellular GABA, whereas gadA and gadB converts glutamate to GABA by removing the α-carboxylate group of glutamate.
○ Design
Therefore, we are able to regulate the external acidic environment through the secretion of GABA. The following picture(Fig.15) shows the entire process of gad system.
This year, our system relies on the intracellular activity of two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase, gadA and gadB, which catalyze the proton-consuming conversion of glutamate to γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)[16]. The constitutive promoter J23119, the ribosome binding site B0034 and the functional gene gadA will be used in our circuit (Fig.16).
Fig.15 The mechanism of gadA
Fig.16 Alkali synthesis circuit of gadA
○ Results
Firstly, we cloned the gene GadA from the genome of Escherichia coli str. K-12.. It is found that there are two restriction sites (EcoRI and PstI) in the sequence of GadA. Thus, one-day step mutation was applied to move the restriction sites. Then, the standard part GadA was constructed successfully.
In order to test the function of GadA, we inserted it into plasmid pET28a. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3). The agarose gel electrophoresis analysis below (Fig.17) shows the positive clones of GadA.
Fig.17 The positive clones of GadA connected with pET28a
After the construction of the alkali producing system, we measured the changes of pH in bacteria solution as well as the intensity of proteins expressed through SDS-PAGE. So long as OD600 of the bacterium solution reaches 0.6, the bacteria was induced by IPTG under 16℃ for 16h. The following table (Table.1) shows the different pH values between the testing group and the control group. It shows that the gene Gad"

Groningen,2015,Team:Groningen#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," Spo0A transcription factor itself controls two parallel pathways which are responsible for expression of biofilm operons. It also has other functions like repressing cell motility which are beneficial for biofilm formation. However, direct engineering of the Spo0A transcription factor would be difficult, since it controls genetic pathways in a very subtle manner. Very specific amounts of phosphorylated Spo0A have to be present to regulate biofilm formation in a beneficial way (Fujita et al, 2005). The two pathways Spo0A regulates are repressors of biofilm formation. The abrB gene is controlled by Spo0A and directly represses biofilm gene expression. The second pathway is the sinR pathway, which represses biofilm gene expression (Vlamakis et al, 2013). Our goal was to disrupt the activity of those two biofilm repressing pathways.
Pathway 1 (abrB)
abrB works by binding directly to the promoter regions of operons responsible for biofilm formation (Hamom et al, 2004). This results in the repression of biofilm gene expression as seen in figure 3a. Under natural circumstances derepression of biofilm operons gets initiated by the alleviation of the repressive effect of abrB by abbA. However instead of making an anti-repressor abbA, an abrB knockout could also be made to have similar effects.  In literature it was also shown that a knock-out of the abrB gene resulted in a 3.3 fold increase in volume of biofilms formed (Bridier et al, 2011). So our plan was to knock out the abrB gene to prevent it from repressing the expression of biofilm operons. Our approach was done by making a knock-out with an antibiotic resistance in the abrB sequence to disrupt it. Since repression of biofilm operons by abrB is now completely gone, this would result in constant biofilm gene transcription through this pathway as seen in figure 3b. However there were two pathways repressing biofilm genes (Vlamakis et al, 2013), so the second pathway also should be engineered.
Pathway 2 (sinR)
The second pathway also works by repression of the biofilm operons, specifically the gene sinR acts as the repressor of biofilm operon transcription. It operates in a similar way as the abrB gene. It would be obvious to make a knock-out of this gene too, to inhibit the repression of the biofilm operons in the same way"

As you can see, when FURt=0, iron has no effect on amilCP concentrations, which is what we would expect.
FURt =1,000nM
<img src=""

There is some variation, but it is over a very small region and it is very steep. It is almost like a threshold iron level: below this value, there will be 777nM of amilCP, but above it, there will be ~778.46nM. Additionally, the range of amilCP values is very small, which may prove to be problematic.
FURt=1e9nM
<img src=""
"" class=""left"" width=""100%"">
Interestingly, more FURt actually made the amilCP concentration increase, but increase over a smaller region (steeper increase). This tackles the issue of a very small increase, but worsens the issue of having a small range. We opted to try smaller FURt values to see what would happen. We tried many values to see if anything would work. Although it widened the increasing region slightly, the increase in amilCP is very small. Here is the graph showing what it looked like when FURt=1nM
FURt=1nM
<img src=""
"" class="""" width=""100%"">
So it seems as though increasing FURt increases maximum amilCP, but shortens the region of sensitivity, while decreasing FURt decreases maximum amilCP and widens the region of sensitivity. It doesn't look as though it would be possible to find a balance between the two. Even when the change in amilCP is just ~0.005nM, the region still doesn't come close to covering our range of values for iron. 
We wanted to zoom in on the increasing region, so instead of testing up to 61.8e6nM, we kept testing smaller and smaller regions until we isolated just the increasing section. This graph represents iron levels varying from 0 to 0.6e6 (note that our lowest saliva iron level is 2.6e6)

BIT-China,2016,Team:BIT-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," under different concentrations of arabinose and used the results to derive the threshold of plasmids number in the constitutive circuit.
In order to know the exact concentration of inhibitor under the different concentrations of arabinose. In E.coli Top10, we used the RFP to replace the inhibitor gene (Fig. 5), so we can use RFP to reflect the inhibitor when we added the same concentration of arabinose.
Fig.5 The circuit constructed to measure the inhibitor concentration, inhibitor is replaced by RFP.
At first, we also use the modeling to simulate this circuit get the curve about relationship between the arabinose added and protein intensity. We got the curve below (Fig. 6):
Fig. 6 The concentration of inhibitor expressed by PBAD changes with different concentrations of inducer.
From this curve, we can clearly see the concentration of arabinose have positive relationship with protein intensity in a proper range. Before we have achieve the threshold of the inhibitor concentration under the 0.003％concentration of arabinose. The point of inducer’s concentration (0.003%) can cast on protein intensity coordinate axis, and the corresponding intensity is about 24.42 units.
In the wet lab, after the pre-experiment, the arabinose concentrations we chose are listed in table.2. The negative control is the strain containing the empty pSB1C3 and the positive control is the strain containing the device in Fig.6 on pSB1C3 without adding the arabinose.
Table. 2 the arabinose concentration used in pre-experiment
Firstly, the two strains containing empty pSB1C3 and the device in Fig.6 separately overnight (12 h) growth in the LB medium. Then the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into new LB medium while add the certain concentration of the arabinose.
At first, the overnight culture’s OD600 and red fluorescence intensity were measured. And then we measured the OD600 and red fluorescence intensity every 1-2 hours.
We draw the diagram about RFP intensity/OD600 and time under different concentrations of arabinose (Fig. 7).
Fig. 7 The relationship between the fluorescence/OD600 and time
From this diagram we can see that the concentration of inducer will affect the expression of downstream RFP, more inducer added, more RFP will be expressed.
Then we collect the data after passing 11.3 hours from Fig. 8 to draw the diagram about the relationship between RFP intensity/OD600 and arabinose concentration ("

The result , however, improved my own personal ability and produced a project with a growing potential to aid a large audience of people. After the conclusion of this year's jamboree, I hope to have the pleasure to continue working with my team to create a lasting impact upon our campus by educating other undergraduates and providing them the skills to tackle an opportunity like this both in an academic setting and in other aspects of their life. I am proud of my team and our work and grateful for the many outstanding people that allowed this event to unfold.

Kartikeya Puri (KP) is a third-year Computer Science major at UCSD. Originally from Mumbai, India, he came to UCSD as a freshman to pursue a bachelors of science (B.S.) degree in Computer Science, a field that he's completely in love with. He’s passionate about web development, and also serves as the web master at the Undergraduate Bioinformatics Club (UBIC) at UCSD. Outside of school and work, he enjoys playing and watching soccer, & religiously follows Manchester City Football Club.
Computer Science, 2016
This is my first year taking part in iGEM, and also my first research project as an undergraduate student. When I read about UCSD building a team to take part in iGEM, I knew wanted to be a part of the team but was apprehensive at first as I wasn’t sure if, as a Computer Science major, I’d fit into a team participating in a Synthetic ‘Biology’ competition. After meeting Jenhan for the first time, though, a lot of my fears had subsided. He eased me into the team and let me know that I didn’t require a lot of background or experience in biology as this project was meant to be a learning experience for everybody.
He couldn’t have been more right about that; we learned & picked up a ton of skills this summer, ranging from reading scientific papers, mining data, building a database based on that data to figuring out how a real world software project works. We learned about little details such as setting realistic expectations and deadlines for tasks. I personally learned a lot about what entails the field of Synthetic Biology (pro advice: reading nature journals on the topic helps with that ;).  Having worked on the website and the application that we built, I also picked up several web development skills.
Overall, taking part in iGEM 2014 and representing UCSD at an international level was a fun & highly"

Activation and inhibition
Activation and inhibition can be present at the same time, since dCas9 can target different promoter sites depending on the gRNA. In S. cerevisiae the inhibition dominate the activation [23], while in E. coli this has not been tested, to our knowledge. Our experimental results shows that in E. coli the inhibition is not as dominant as in S. cerevisiae as the distance between inhibiting and activating promoter binding sites is smaller and dCas9/dCas9 interaction play an important role.
In order to model activation and inhibition in S. cerevisiae and E. coli, we will use two extrema of the binding model developed in the Binding section. For S. cerevisiae we will set \(J=0\) as we assume no interaction between two dCas9 bound to the same promoter (because the distance between binding sites is large), while in E. coli we will use either \(J=0\) ot \(J=\infty\) depending on experimental observations (we don't have references showing that inhibition wins over activation for this organism). Obviously, the situation is probably more complex and \(J\) assumes an intermediate value on the interval \([0,\infty]\), but for simplicity we used only these extreme values.
In our system we now have to distinguish between gRNAs which target the inhibiting sequence (which we call \(gRNA_I\)) and gRNAs which target the activating sequence (which we call \(gRNA_A\)). The transcriptional response of our transistor targeted by activating and inhibiting complexes is given by             \[                 \alpha_\text{max}p_a + \alpha_bp_b + \alpha_{ai}p_{ai},             \]             where \(\alpha_\text{max}\) is the maximal expression under activation, \(\alpha_b\) is the basal expression (found in the Constants page) and \(\alpha_{ai}\) is the expression when two dCas9-gRNA complexes are bound. We implicitly assumed that \(\alpha_i \approx 0\). The probabilities \(p_a\), \(p_b\) and \(p_{ai}\) are defined in the Binding section and depends on the system under investigation (basically, on the value of \(J\)). This"

Kyoto,2013,Team:Kyoto#Sponsors_-_-_TEXT.html," opinions about our own projects and how to manage the teams. Moreover, in addition to these face to face meetings, we connected with other iGEM teams by e-mail or SNS. Such interactions have helped Kyoto and other team's projects as we have showed above. We’ve made sure that we’ll continue to relate with other teams, and deepen our relationship.
International Video Conference
It is important to cooperate not only with domestic teams but also with teams all over the world, because discussing problems with people with different point of views can improve our project. We participated in the video conference sponsored by Purdue, and exchanged opinions about the new standardization of biobricks. We hope these activities will contribute to iGEM.
We cooperated with other iGEM teams in Japan!!
Assistance
Whenever we carry out a study, we need many processes such as experiments and searching reference. iGEM Kyoto communicates with many other teams, and through this activity, we can cooperate with them and learn many things from each other.
iGEM Kyoto had the help of other teams, as Kyoto helped iGEM Biwako_Nagahama. If iGEM teams increase in number and can cooperate mutually, we’ll be able to perform more outstanding researches.
For example, iGEM must get a result in only one year, but when conducting a molecular biology experiment, it takes a long time until we actually start the experiments. This is because concerning the construction of the parts takes time. Therefore, it is desirable for each team to cooperate in such points.
We have been in partnership with Tokyo-tech and NTU-Taiwan. Team NTU-Taiwan helped constructing our parts. We sent 13 parts to them.
And, we had the parts sent by team Tokyo-tech . This is because we couldn’t make usable plasmid from the iGEM DNA Distribution Kit. Therefore, we asked team Tokyo-Tech for usable plasmid, BBa_K193001 , which was registered by them in 2009.
By these partnerships, we can perform more speedy experiments, and this will lead to improving the whole level of iGEM.
Conclusion
In iGEM activities, it is important to add partners, connect with them, and cooperate by helping each other. In short, iGEM is realized on the basis of mutual communication. We succeeded in increasing the number of iGEMers, and to teach iGEM Biwako_Nagahama how to manage their team.  Moreover, we actually met other iGEM teams in iGEM JAPAN, participated in"

GMO alone will not be able to negate the negative impact on biodiversity from climate change, and some effects we are already experiencing. GMO is able to help us on a direction to reduce the impacts on biodiversity. If used in conservation by reintroducing newly extinct species Folch, J., et al.

Lastly GMO can also help ecosystems by engineering flora and fauna, so they can resist changes caused by climate change, or promote a specific phenotype. When talking about releasing transgenic organisms into the natural environment, it leads to a whole other discussion of GMO.
The PowerLeaf
To avoid the discussion of GMO in the environment, and not at least to mitigate any effect, positive and negative, on the environment we designed our PowerLeaf to be isolated in a material called polycarbonate. This, alongside with a kill switch, should ensure that no contamination of local fauna and flora would arise. Therefore our product will not be able to influence wild types, neither by outcompeting nor horizontal gene-transfer. With these considerations in mind, we believe that our project is not only responsible but also environmentally safe.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Bacteria results_-_-_TEXT.html," polarization plane of light from an α angle. This rotatory power is related to the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon within the molecule. All sugars (except dihydroxyacetone) are chiral molecules, so they all have a rotatory power. This property allows the polarimetric determination of sugars in pure solution thanks to the law of Biot.
There are two types of optically active substances:
✵Those which deflect polarization plane of light from an α angle to the right. The measured angle is positive and the substance is in dextrorotatory form.
✵Those which deflect polarization plane of light from an α angle to the left. The measured angle is negative and the substance is in levorotatory form.
Results
– Results were obtained with a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter.
– Measures are done at 25°C.

At the end...
We have obtained 3.44g of Curdlan in one month of production and with one single gene!
Perspectives
Despite amplification problems of two genes, we performed cloning with the crdA and crdC sequences. Each gene was placed into plasmids possessing resistance to a different antiobiotic:
✵pUC-OsmY-crdS (Ampicillin resistance)
✵pSB1C3-OsmY-crdA (Chloramphenicol resistance)
✵pSB3T5-OsmY-crdC (Tetracycline resistance)
We have tried without success a triple transformation.
We hope that production yield of Curdlan would be higher if the three genes were present.
Successful results
Unsuccessful results

NTNU_Trondheim,2014,Team:NTNU Trondheim#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,". This gene encodes the enzyme Glucose Oxidase, which essentially reduces the oxygen concentration inside the cell. RuBisCO, the CO2 fixating enzyme in photosynthetic organisms, has a high affinity for binding O2, which can interfere with CO2 binding. Reducing O2 concentrations could therefore lead to an increased rate of CO2 fixation in Synechocystis.
Future efforts should focus on transforming the composite plasmid containing all 6 BioBricks into Synechocystis, and testing the carbon fixation rate of the resulting transformants. Such testing requires specialized equipment that is able to measure minute differences in the partial pressure of CO2.
We had plans of collaborating with SINTEF CO2-capture and storage , which were kind enough to offer us the use of their facilities and equipment. Doing our planned experiments in their facilities would have provided us with evidence for the effect of glucose oxidase on Synechocystis' carbon fixation rate.

Hamburg,2018,Team:Hamburg#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," a lot more mosquitoes there. So I think we do not need the gene-drive technology, at least not at this stage.
iGEM Hamburg: So, you said that you want to make further investigation, more experiments with gene-drive. How would these experiments look like?
Dr. Jacobs: Well, to be honest I am not an expert in gene-drive technology and I would say, that we have to really proof that this technology is safe. I think this is what we should investigate first and then we can go one step ahead. But I think when we step one step back to the classical technology like vector control and bed nets we have a good opportunity to control the mosquitoes, even in Africa. We have to invest a lot of money to set up this basic technology. This should not only be in one area this should be applied in the whole region. This is low-tech, but it is proven very often, that this low-tech is working.
iGEM Hamburg: Can you tell us somethings about the seasonality of the mosquitoes?
Dr. Jacobs: I think it depends really on the region where you are. But normally you can see the increase of the transmission [of Malaria] during and after the rain season. For example in Ghana we have major transmission in March, April and May and then again in September, October and November.
iGEM Hamburg: Which of the ways to fight malaria is the most promising one today?
Dr. Jacobs: To fight malaria or to control the vector?
iGEM Hamburg: Could you answer both questions?
Dr. Jacobs: I think there are normal control measures, for example getting rid of wet areas. For example it is forbidden in Hong Kong to get water trapped in a bottle, so mosquitoes cannot breed. But I think that in Germany for example the BT-toxin application works quite well in the Rhein valley. We have also made studies here at the BNI about the use of bed nets. Bed nets for examples are really working quite well and have a major impact on transmission. Secondly, I think it is important to treat the people with allow infection with the malaria parasite. They will not get sick but can still be the host for the parasite and mosquitoes can be infected when they are feeding on their blood. So actually we need screening and treatment of all the infected people, even those with a low level of infection so that we can stop the transmission of the parasite to the mosquito. I think this is a very important thing to do these days.
So normally I think to control 90 % of the disease is very easy, because you can make mass"

Ag43+FLAG+MCS under the control of pBAD promoter
Abstract
We describe the creation of Biobrick constrct Bba_K1352001 which expresses autotransporter Ag43 with an inserted FLAG epitope tag at codon 148, flanked by multiple cloning restriction sites (MCS). We describe the design and construction of the new Biobrick, and its verification using restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. We show using Western blot analysis that the BioBrick is successfully able to direct the expression of an 116.77 kDa FLAG-tagged protein. We also show using fluorescently-tagged antibodies that this Biobrick is able to direct the E.coli surface expression of FLAG-tagged Ag43. Finally we show that insertion of a FLAG-tag at amino acid 148 prevents the auto-aggregation capability of Ag43, creating a useful reagent that can be used for E. coli surface display.
1.       Structure and function
Antigen 43 (sometimes called Ag43 or fluffing protein) is a phase-variable outer membrane protein encoded by flu gene. It is native to E.coli K12 strain and is usually expressed at about 50, 000 copies/cell. Ag34 precursor is 1039 amino acids long and subsequently becomes cleaved into alpha and beta chains (499 and 488 amino acids long respectively). The beta subunit forms a β-barrel pore via which alpha-subunit translocates to the cell surface, and with which it remains non-covalently joined. The surface alpha chain can be released by a brief heat treatment at approx. 60oC. Ag43 is an autotransporter protein, therefore it possesses all information necessary for translocation to the cell surface in its coding sequence. Ag43 mediates autoaggregation, via a"

XMU-China,2013,Team:XMU-China#Mechanism_-_-_TEXT.html," known as aiiA that hydrolyzes the lactone ring of AHL. (Fig. 2-1) In this system, the activator enhances the expression of both activator and repressor, which shares the common motif of many synthetic oscillators.
Coupling
The communication range of quorum sensing, however, is limited by the diffusion rate of AHL, could only reach cells over tens of micrometers. So, we introduced the coding gene for NADH dehydrogenase II (ndh) and put it under the control of the same luxIpromoter, which means ndh also has a periodical expression in accordance with the oscillator. NDH-2 is a membrane-bound respiratory enzyme that generates low level H2O2 and superoxide (O2-) and H2O2 will permeate to neighboring colonies. Periodic production of H2O2 changes the redox state of a cell immediately and interacts with the synthetic circuit through the native aerobic response control systems, including ArcAB, which has a binding site in the lux promoter region. Before the oxidizing condition is triggered, ArcAB is partially expressed, so lux is partially repressed. When the concentration of H2O2 is increasing, ArcAB is gradually inactivated, and the repression of lux is relieved. With the periodically produced vapor phase H2O2 that can diffuse quickly among colonies, the oscillation is not only strengthened but also expanded to millimeter scales(Fig. 2-2).
Fig. 2-2  H2O2 functions as an activator to the quorum sensing promoter
When compared with the strong but short ranged coupling by QS, H2O2 might be weaker but long ranged because its disperse characteristic. These two levels of communication between cells formed the basic oscillatory system inside our host.
Reporter
A good reporter in an oscillatory circuit should be steadily expressed and can be easily detected by regular equipment in laboratory, so broadly used reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) came into our mind.
First, we built regular gfp gene into our circuit and it worked well. Its fluorescence can be observed by fluorescence microscopy under 1s of exposure time on the microfluidic array 1(Fig. 2-3).
Fig. 2-3 GFP under fluorescence microscopy on a microfluidic array
However, there is a newly found GFP variant Superfolder GFP, which has shown outstanding performance in many ways. It has two advantages in observing: 1) Fold 3.5 to 4 times faster than regular GFP; 2) Yield up to"
TUDelft,2017,Team:TUDelft#Off targeting_-_-_TEXT.html," this increases the sensitivity of the detection method, but does not affect the reliability. As such, our tool assesses the design of the crRNAs by iGEM LMU-TUM Munich to be clever and to allow reliable detection. We thank iGEM LMU-TUM Munich for the fun collaboration and look forward to meeting them again at the Giant Jamboree.
Conclusions
We employed a recently proposed kinetic model to assess the reliability of our crRNAs in the Cas13a-mediated detection system. In general, we find the predicted false positive probability (given a positive output) to be low (as low as 1 in billion). Moreover, the simulation unveiled a design flaw in crRNA 5 that prevented us from wasting time on testing it in the lab. Subsequently, we simulated the off-target activity of all our crRNAs on the genomes of relevant organisms: E. coli BL21, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis and chromosome 27 of the domestic cow (Bos taurus). As expected, the false positive probability increases for the presence of larger genome sequences being present. We repeated the simulations for parameter that correspond to a higher mismatch tolerance and observed that this resulted in false positive probabilities exceeding 90%. This situation would greatly compromise the reliability of the detection system, so we set out to investigate possible solutions. In order to do so, we re-evaluate the model’s assumptions and find that if we incorporate our sample preparation protocol, amplifying and in vitro transcribing the gene, the probability of false positives is reduced accordingly. In addition, we propose a method that allows calculation of the required amplification factor α for achieving a desired reliability in the output.

Natural modiﬁcations to heme occur after the ferrous iron (Fe2) is inserted into the porphyrin by ferrochelatase, the last enzyme in heme biosynthesis
CCm complex : It is a complex of Transmembrane protein which helps in Heme maturation .From modelling we believe that by upregulating CCm complex of proteins we can increase heme incorporation into our proteins.
Technique to improve heme incorporation:
1) Supplementing the growth media with δ-Aminolevulinic acid a precursor to C5 heme biosynthesis pathway, increases levels of heme biosynthesis and thereby heme incorporation into some proteins. But the end product heme acts as a feedback regulator of ALA synthase thereby inhibiting its production.
To avoid this we thought of Expressing plasmid encoded mouse ALA synthase which is not inhibited by heme ,thereby increasing cellular heme production.
2) We can also supplement the growth medium with hemin . But most of the E-coli strains do not possess an efficient heme transport system and thus uptake of hemin solely relies on diffusion through the cell membrane. So to avoid this problem we thought of incorporating ChuA gene into E.coli ChuA :It is basically a heme-transport protein which helps in utilisation of Hemin

MCP complexes have two alternative CheA autokinase activity; When the receptor is not occupied by chemoattractant, the receptor stimulates CheA activity [1]. The overall flux of phosphoryl groups to inhibited and stimulated states. Changes in attractant concentration shift this distribution, triggering a flagellar response [1]. The ensuing changes in CheB phosphorylation state alter its methylesterase activity, producing a net change in MCP methylation state that cancels the stimulus signal [1]. Therefore, studying of methylation level, phosphorylation level of CheB and CheY are important to understand chemotaxis of single cell.
Figure 1[1]: Chemotaxis signaling conponents  and oathways for E.Coli.
The model based on Spiro et al. (1997) [1] was used to identify candidates of the chemotaxis receptor pathway.
2. Simulation of chemotaxis of bacteria population
This part of modelling focused on creating the movement model of bacteria population for chemotaxis. In order to accurately built this model, the following assumptions are made based on literature:
1) During the directed movement phase, the mean speed of an E. coli equals 24.1 μm/s, varying speed between 17.3 μm/s  and 30.9 μm/s [7]. Whereas during the tumbling phase, the speed is significantly smaller and can be neglected.
2) E.Coli usually take previous second as their basis on deciding whether the concentration has increased or not. Therefore, in our model the bacteria will be able to compare the concentration of chemattractant at t second and t-1 second.
3) In our model, we ignored that E.Coli do not travel in straight line during run, but take curved paths due to unequal firing of flagella.
4) Our model did not consider the size changing and dividing of bacteria. And the tendency of bacteria congregate into small area due to qurum sensing is also neglected.
IV. RESULTS
1. Chemotaxis pathway
Based on the Spiro model, the methylation level of receptors, phosphorylation level of CheY and CheB were studied from Spiro’s model(Figure 2-Figue3). With receptor concentration per cell equals to 8x10-6mole/L, the lower threshold concentration of chemoattractant that the bacterium start to detect is 10-8mole/L. The saturation level is 10-6mole/L "
SCU-China,2018,Team:SCU-China#project#indigo_-_-_TEXT.html," test the elimination of plasmid, we cultured the E.coli on 37℃ for 1 day, and then plated it on plasmid on K+ plate compared by those without elimination. Those still have plasmid (right) survived better than the left. And the plasmid purification from 6 ml colony culture shows no plasmid remaining.
4.2 Donor part preparing
At the same time, we design the universal primers so that we can use these primers to amplify any sequence on between prefix and suffix. Thus, we used these primers to amplified the GFP, RFP+GFP, dCas9 and dCas9 with GFP for future cloning.
In this part, we successfully verified the knock in function of our plasmid, and test the Golden Gate assembly plasmid construction. Besides here are some drawbacks of this methods.1 It’s hard to transformation efficiency, for with only the colony PCR it could be a low efficiency for colony selection when construction plasmid. 2 The periodic expression of genome may result in the desynchrony expression of RFP on genome. 3 the exogenous gene in Bacteria genome may result in long fragment homologous recombination within genome range. We only get positive result for the first few days. After several days culture after losing its plasmid, the same site colony will smear or abnormal length fragment will rise (see notebook) which may suggest the HR in genome range.

It should be noted, that this is a qualitative evaluation and is not backed by statistical real world data. Nonetheless, it can be used as an indication.
We then took the best parameter set from the pDusk/ pDawn evaluation and added the equations describing the interactions with the MazEF system to the set of ODEs. As we noticed that we have to discard around half of the parameter sets because they do not satisfy the constraint that mazE degrades faster than mazF, we built this constraint into the parameter sampling procedure. In addition, we considered the native mazEF system of E. coli. To prevent any potential interaction between the engineered and the native system, a mazEF deficient strain was created in the lab. This is, why we do not consider a native mazEF system in the model.

In Silico Kill Switch
We have built a mathematical model of pDusk and pDawn which describes the system behavior. Initial results from the lab, did not show a significant change in response for the pDusk system. However, the experimental results are in agreement with the computed data in the pDawn system. This leads us to suspect that either there was an irregularity with the dark conditions in the lab, or the model does not fully reflect the underlying biology of the system in the lower light intensity regions. We suggest that a parameter sensitivity and robustness analysis could be conducted to find the most likely cause of the mismatch to the data.  We further conclude, that we achieved a good fit in Figure 12 to the data available in literature 1 .
We then studied the mazEF toxin-antitoxin integration to design our optogenetic kill switch. After analysis of this system, we found two parameter sets which satisfy the constraints. These parameters give us an idea on how to search the parameter space for further analysis to select functioning kinetic rates in collaboration with the wet-lab.
In addition, future work could show the effect of parameter sensitivity such as leaky promoters and their effect on the system to engineer the pDusk system, adjusting it to suit our needs. We also made the Matlab code available for future iGEM teams to build optogenetic tools.

Leicester,2013,Team:Leicester#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," EPS make it flame retardant and environmentally friendly.
Recycling
The first of the three streams was focused on amplifying and modifying the genes of the tod operon found in the Pseudomonas putida F1 strain. The dioxygenase enzyme encoded by the tod operon degrades toluene which has a similar structure to the styrene monomer of polystyrene. Hence the main objective was to modify the dioxygenase genes responsible for toluene degradation so that polystyrene can fit in the active site of the enzyme.
The todC1C2BA genes encode the toluene dioxygenase (TDO) enzyme which is capable of oxidizing more than 100 substrates albeit the catalytic oxygenase is encoded only by todC1C2. Modelling carried out by the Leicester 2012 iGEM team using the programme Pymol, suggested that the gap in the active site of the TDO enzyme could be widen to fit polystyrene. They modified amino acids present in the gap by reducing their side chains in order to widen the gap that could allow polystyrene into the active site. The residues that they modified were Met220 -> Ala220, Val421 -> Ala421, Tyr422 -> Leu422 and Tyr266 -> Val266.
Modified Toluene 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme with a similar view to the image above. Again, the pink residues are the active site residues. The white residues are those that have been modified. (left) The polystyrene substrate has been omitted for clarity, but note the gap is much bigger now (modified from 3EN1). (right) The polystyrene is present here: note the very tight fit into the gap
A side view of the modified enzyme. Note that the terminal phenyl group is in the active site
This view is just of the toluene 2,3-dioxygenase active site (blue), overlapped with the modified version (pink). Notice how similar the active site shape is, which means that potentially, the active site could still catalyse the dioxygenase reaction.
The Pseudomonas Putida strain F1 was grown in overnight broth. Miniprep procedures and gel purification were used to isolate and purify bacterial DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was then used to amplify the tod C, X, F, G and B genes as well as the 16s rRNA. Thus we were able to confirm that we had the correct Pseudomonas strain using 16S"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Applied Design_-_-_TEXT.html," bacteria will express RFP when the ammonia concentration is below the threshold. When the ammonia concentration exceeds the safe value, our bacteria will stop expressing RFP. With the help of our engineered bacteria, we can convert the concentration of ammonia nitrogen into a more readable optical signal.
After transmitting optical signal, our device should be able to convert optical signal into electrical signal, and then make the electrical signal readable to fish farmers. We use photoresistance to achieve the first step and code a program to accomplish the second step. When the concentration of ammonia is above the threshold, fish farmers will receive a message on their cellphone sent via Bluetooth to warn them (See more details on in hardware ).
As for ammonia degradation, we planned to express three different enzymes form different organisms to achieve the aim of convert ammonia into nitrogen gas.
Adjustment
Nothing can be accomplished at one stroke. After we completed the design of our device, we still need to customize it to the practical conditions.
The first thing we need to know is the composition of fish pond water. We visited some fish ponds nearby and collected water sample from the ponds. We then analyzed the composition of our water sample and adjust the composition of our culture medium to stimulate the pond water (See more details on water sampling in Integrated HP). We also asked other iGEM Teams to help us collected water samples in their surroundings (See more details in collaboration).
The second thing we need to do is to engineer our bacteria to make it express RFP under certain concentration of ammonia. To achieve this, we designed and tested three different promotors and chose the best one among them (See more details on promotors in sensor).
Last but not least, we did market research and contacted with our potential customers, fish farmers, to optimize our device according to the demand (See more details in integrated HP and entrepreneurship ).
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a buoy or a platform, and to purify the water when receiving the text message that the device automatically sends to him/her.

From inception, our project aimed to produce a cheap, portable and effective screening tool for diseases. A large barrier to this is the quantification of fluorescence from our genetic circuit. We therefore set out to build a cheap and portable fluorometer.
Our combined fluorometer and densitometer allows our paper based test to be used in the field, in remote areas or less developed countries. It also provides a way for high schools and community labs that cannot afford a plate reader to quantify fluorescence and optical density.

Previous designs
Initially, we built a fluorometer using the previous design by the Aachen 2014 and Denver Biolabs 2016 teams. Their fluorometer uses an Arduino board, 2 LEDs, 2 light sensors, 2 breadboards and an LCD screen.
The light sensors output a square wave with frequency proportional to light intensity. The Arduino uses this to calculate either optical density or fluorescence. These readings are displayed on the LCD screen.
Alleyn’s School kindly allowed us use of their laser cutter to produce the casing and their 3D printer to produce the cuvette holder (as mentioned on our attributions page ). Denver Biolabs' box design was fiddly to put together and was overcomplicated, so in the end we opted to not use it as we didn’t think the extra time, money and resources spent to make it were worth it.
The circuits in the previous designs were unnecessarily complicated. We simplified the circuit by removing excess wiring and components. This made the fluorometer far easier to build, troubleshoot and modify further.

The specificity of our test would be 84% when sensitivity is 100%. [20]
P(cancer) is the figure generated by Tammemägi’s model, weighted by the probability of stage 1 detection (63%) and other stage detection (37%).
P(cancer) = P(true positive) + P(false negative)
As sensitivity ≈ 100%, P(false negative) ≈ 0
P(cancer) ≈ P(true positive) = specificity * P(positive test)
P(positive test) ≈ P(cancer) / specificity
P(false positive) = P(positive test) * (1 - specificity) ≈ P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
Therefore the probability of a false positive is approximately proportional to the chance of having cancer. P(false positives) always amounted to less 1% of the total cost per QALY so this error of this approximation is negligible.
To recap:
P(true positive) = P(cancer)
P(false positive) = P(cancer) * (1 - specificity) / specificity
P(true negative) = 1 - (P(true positive) + P(false positive))
P(false negative) = 0
The probability of each option was calculated by multiplying P(true positive) * P(treatment success). In the table, P(treament) represents the chance of the treament being as described by the 2nd column.

Project History:
For our project this year we wanted to capitalize on our resources at Purdue. In addition to our strong engineering programs we have top agriculture programs and extension efforts. The biggest problem facing the agriculture today is Food Security; how will we feed 9 billion people by 2050?
We tackled this issue by talking with professors in our College of Agriculture. In one conversation with Dr. Camberato, of the Ag Extension, office we discussed soil management strategies and how a university like Purdue tries to educate local farmers about innovations that they have systematically tested. Farmers nowadays are in great need and are willing to try anything for consistent and high yield crops, so much so that Dr. Camberato estimated each farmer probably spends up to 10,000 per acre on unproven strategies simply as result of rigorous sale strategies on the part of companies.
One day while discussing the history of Ag extension, Dr. Camberato showed Peter Mercado a black and white picture of a child playing in soil that was taken from China in Lake Michigan. Dr Camberato then stated that this family was able to increase the size and percent yield of their crop by supplementing their natural soil with the  foreign soil taken from a ship. Curious as to what properties of the soil were able to accomplish this; we did more research and found that the likely culprit was probably microbes.
We decided to talk to Dr. Nakatsu, a microbial soil ecology expert, and realized the great diversity and ability of microbes to aid plant health. However given the enormous diversity and competition in naturally occurring soil, how would we go about managing the complexity? Could we benefit plants with just one microbe or a cocktail?
We dived into the literature on the rhizosphere and"

Theoretical Applications
Fig. 2 The above figure represents a few of the unlimited possibilities entailed by engineering PUF for applicable functions. Applications involving protein localization to specific RNA sequences is key in engineering the versatility of PUF since varied proteins with varied functions can now be given binding specificity from PUF.

Bioproduction
Context
With the development of biotechnologies, academics and industrialists have achieved the exploitation of microorganisms in a rational manner to bioproduce a great diversity of compounds. This principle could be used in many fields such as health, textiles, cosmetics or even the food industry. To increase the yields of the production, one can optimize culture conditions, invest in bioreactors or enhance extraction methods. However there remains one limiting factor: the intrinsic activity of the enzymes involved in the bioprocess. We are introducing a biosensor to easily screen a library of variants on one enzyme used in a bioproduction process ( Screening tool description ) and we will use this system to improve the bioproduction of a rare sugar: D-Psicose.
This sugar is found in plants in very low quantities and is expensive, costing 1000 $ per gram from Sigma Aldrich and between 35 and 60 $ from All-u-Lose®, a company which proposes a product composed of 100 % of psicose ( Click here to find out more ). This sugar is interesting because the human body does not metabolize it [1]. It goes through the enterocytes with the GLUT5 and GLUT2 glucose transporters [2] and is eliminated in the urine in 24 hours. Therefore, this sugar could be useful for people suffering from diabetes by maintaining their postprandial blood sugar level and avoiding hyperglycemia.
Since D-psicose is a C3 epimer of D-fructose, its production can be achieved by a D-psicose 3-epimerase (EC: 5.1.3.30) or D-tagatose 3-epimerase (EC: 5.1.3.31) in the presence of fructose as a substrate (figure 1). Bioproduction of psicose has already been presented in the literature but the yields are still too low for cheap industrial production ( Rare Sugar Bioproduction ). This is why"

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," Dawkins, who had come to Exeter as part of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology conference. The event, hosted by the university, brought academics from all across the globe to campus.
We had a new work experience student join us today called Jorge. He, like our previous work experience student Juliet, will be here with us for two weeks, helping out in the lab and generally operating as a standard team member.
Jorge was introduced to the full team during today’s team meeting, where we discussed the goals for this week inside and outside of the lab, and generally just checked up on the progress of each area of the project.
The lab team - Jack, Eloise, Pablo and Hannah - attempted to redo the unsuccessful plasmid backbone transformations from yesterday, but were not successful in amplifying the PCR product because the concentration was too low. However, some of the plasmid backbone transformations done today were successful, and have been overnighted so we can use them for cloning.

We swapped to using the QuickChange Multi kit instead of the Q5 kit for site-directed mutagenesis today as the Q5 kit had so far been unsuccessful, and the QuickChange kit could be used to mutate 5 sites at a time.
Today’s lab team also began using MoClo (Modular Cloning, mentioned in an earlier entry) to make codon optimised Killer Red and Killer Orange parts that we can submit to the registry. The products were transformed into S171 E. coli cells and overnighted. They also did some standard miniprepping and carried out qubits.

We put the order for our team t-shirts and hoodies/sweatshirts so they arrive in time for the Westminster meet-up. They have the iGEM logo on the front, our social media accounts on the back, and once we have a logo designed we’ll be sending them back to get the logo put on the front too!
Yesterday’s production of plasmid backbones was successful but the digestion and ligation of said backbones was not, so we repeated the digestion-ligation process today. The QuickChange multi kit also turned out to be unsuccessful, so we repeated that today to try remove multiple restriction sites in a pkD4 plasmid.
We transformed cloned Killer Red and Killer Orange in E. coli DH5α and overnighted them.

Newcastle,2009,Team:Newcastle#Labwork#4 September 2009_-_-_TEXT.html,"quencing BBa_J33206 taken from the Spring Distribution
The first step taken was to quantify the midi-prepped BBa_J33206 + pSB1A2 DNA taken from the Spring Distribution (this is the arsR gene plus arsR binding site). When applied to the Nanodrop spectrophotometer, 1171.4ng/ul of DNA was detected. The analysis of the BBa_J33206 DNA concentration can be seen below, including DNA-to-Protein ratios:
The company who sequence the DNA require us to submit 30ul of the DNA and with a recommended concentration of ~50ng/ul. To calculate how much DNA to add to water to make up 30ul of solution with a concentration of 50ng/ul, we did the following:
50ng x 30ul = 1,500ng ...... this is approximately the desired amount of DNA present in 30ul
1,500ng / 1171.4ng/ul = 1.28ul ...... this is approx. the amount of DNA at a concentration of 1171.4ng/ul we will need in the 30ul of solution.
We rounded the 1.28ul up to 2ul (doesn't have to be exactly 50ng/ul) and to this 2ul of DNA we added 28ul of sterile distilled water
A similar step was taken with the sequencing primers. The company which carries out the sequencing requires us to submit 30ul of primers set at a concentration of ~2pmol/ul. The primers (both forward and reverse) have arrived in a concentration of 5pmol/ul.
18ul of water + 12ul primer = 30 ul of primer with a concentration of 2pmol/ul.
These solutions were then labelled with the data recorded on a database. The DNA sample plus sequencing primers were then packaged and placed in the collection box.
Transforming E. coli cells with BBa_J33206
The decision was taken to transform some pre-made competent DH5-α E. coli cells with the BBa_J33206 BioBrick in pSB1A2 plasmid DNA sent to us by Chris French.
The protocol used was Dr. Aldridge's Transforming by Heat Shock protocol . There were only a couple of changes to the protocol and these changes were seen in steps 2 and 5; the time allowed for these steps was 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
Once the process was completed, 50ul of the 'transform"

(This is important because the beads begin to settle to the bottom of the wells within about 10                           minutes,                           which will affect the measurements.) Take care to mix gently and avoid creating bubbles on the surface of the liquid.

Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein protocol
Plate readers report fluorescence values in arbitrary units that vary widely from instrument to instrument. Therefore absolute fluorescence values cannot be directly compared from one instrument to another. In order to compare                       fluorescence output of test devices between teams, it is necessary for each team to create a standard fluorescence curve. Although distribution of a known concentration of GFP protein would be an ideal way to standardize the                       amount                       of GFP fluorescence in our E. coli cells, the stability of the protein and the high cost of its purification are problematic. We therefore use the small molecule fluorescein, which has similar excitation and emission properties                       to                       GFP, but is cost-effective and easy to prepare.

what are the options for drug formulation?
According to the different physicochemical properties of drugs and the different characteristics of absorption and metabolism in vivo, in order to achieve the therapeutic effect, reduce the toxic side effects and adverse reactions, it is necessary to adopt appropriate prescription design and production technology in the production and processing of drugs.
The Chinese Pharmacopoeia divides different dosage forms into solid dosage forms (such as granules, pills, granules, capsules, tablets, etc.) and semi-solid dosage forms (such as ointment, etc.). The main business of the company is the production of capsules and tablets, liquid formulations (such as solution, aromatic water, injection, etc.) and gas formulations (such as aerosols, inhalants, etc.).
We know that your company has tablets and capsule products. What is the basis for your selection? What is the patient's acceptance?
The advantage of capsule are
1. High bioavailability: capsule preparation is not like tablet need to add binder, digestion in the gastrointestinal tract quickly, easy to absorb;
2. Can improve drug stability: to light, wet, heat-sensitive drugs can be put into capsules, so that the drug from the role of light, moisture, and so on;
3. Shape adjustable: some powder, granular drugs can be encapsulated in capsules, some liquid drugs can not be made into tablets can be made into soft capsules, such as vitamin E;
4. can achieve slow release, controlled release, targeted release;
5. Can cover up the bad smell of drugs, good compliance.
6. With the development of materials and technology, more and more functions can be realized simultaneously in tablets and capsules, which means that these functions are no longer unique advantages of capsules, such as rapid release, enteric dissolution, for the protection of Guang Min water sensitive drugs, tablets can also be used to achieve process comparison: for tablet production, drugs and excipients need to be weighed first, and then mixed. Make a dough with adhesives and moisturizers (drier and looser than the dough), then use a sieve with a fixed pore size, squeeze the dough down, squeeze it into"

Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get in touch with the researchers to obtain the genetic constructs they needed to produce the dye. Since there was no money available for gene synthesis, the project ground to a halt. Since the main goal of our mentorship was to give the students hands-on experience with actual biotech labwork, we decided to carry on and do all the planned protocols but using standard parts instead of the ones that were not available.
During May and June we taught the group all the basic laboratory procedures: how to properly use a micro-pipette, how to prepare media, how to autoclave, how to clean a biosafety cabinet, how to prepare agar plates and how to streak them. After that, we led them through a mini-prep, digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, gel recovery, ligation, preparing chemo-competent bacteria, chemical transformation, recovery and selection in antibiotic plates.
All the students had a wonderful time and were very grateful since they practically experienced the whole college-level Genetic Engineering Lab (save for PCR) in the course of a few weeks. Three of the 6th semester students chose to enroll in Biotech Engineering this August, and one of them even integrated to our college team during the summer.
The faculty from PEGS was pleased with the results and wants the school to continue participating in iGEM HS. They approached us and we gladly offered our help to coordinate the team again. With the help of SyBRE, the student group we founded, the iGEM HS Team will be better organized and will be able to tackle more ambitious projects. Also, we’ll try to get at least another one of ITESM’s high schools involved. With the experience gathered from this first hurried try, we are certain that the next team (or, hopefully, teams) will have a more distinguished role in the competition.

UNIPV-Pavia,2010,Team:UNIPV-Pavia#Project#solution_-_-_TEXT.html,". This allows to perform multiple integrations in the same strain, always using the same dominant G418 resistance marker.
The heterologous modules in the LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (<partinfo>BBa_K300989</partinfo>), i.e. the TEF promoter and the TEF transcriptional terminator from A. gossypii and the KanR from the Tn903 transposon of E. coli, show a very low homology with the S. cerevisiae genome. For this reason, the vector integration events in unwanted positions in the yeast genome are limited.
How to use it
<partinfo>BBa_K300001</partinfo> can be:
propagated in E. coli
engineered to change the passenger part and/or the HRs.
integrated into the desired locus of the host genome
used to perform the desired number of serial integrations in the same genome
How to propagate it before performing genome integration
This vector can be easily propagated in E. coli thanks to the high-copy replication origin and the Ampicillin resistance selection marker, both derived from the <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo> vector backbone.
How to integrate a BioBrick into the yeast genome
Digest <partinfo>BBa_K300001</partinfo> and the desired BioBrick part with EcoRI-SpeI and ligate them (Fig.19).
Propagate the resulting plasmid in E. coli and extract plasmid DNA from bacteria.
Digest the resulting plasmid with SbfI to linearize the DNA of interest (Fig.20). This is known to increase the integration efficiency from 10- to 50-fold when compared to a non-linearized DNA Reference 11 .
Transform the linearized plasmid into S. cerevisiae and select integrants on G418 antibiotic plates (Fig.21).
Figure 19: Assembly of the desired BioBrick part into the integrative vector.
Figure 20: The plasmid can be linearized upon SbfI digestion to separate the yeast DNA fragment (containing the part of interest and the LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette) from the E. coli DNA fragment (containing the replication origin and the Amp resistance).

3. Manager of NEU Yogurt Base Interview
After visiting the yogurt base, we interviewed the manager of the base-professor Jiang Liu and Zhenbo Cui. During the meeting with them, we learned that in the actual production process, workers often using acid-base titration method to detect the acidity of yogurt for reflecting the concentration of lactate. But this method is complicated and time-consuming in actual production. Therefore, we raised ideas of build a real time system to detect the concentration of lactate after in-depth discussion with professors. They with the professional perspective analyzed the feasibility of the whole project, felt that there is a strong display space.
In our actual experiment, we found that the expression level of lldPRD operon is relatively low, cannot express fluorescent protein GFP efficiently. According to the advice of professor, we introduced the E. coli QS system for amplifying the signal of the entire device. After adding QS system, the sensitivity of engineered E.coli has been improved.

Project Safety Concerns
The safety concerns of our project were a very important issue for this year's iGEM Team of the Technische Universität Braunschweig. Because the use of an antibiotic resistance was necessary for selection of bacteria we included an ampicillin resistance gene in our final construct. Ampicillin is a standard antibiotic commonly used in everyday laboratory work. The methane monooxygenase (MMO) plasmid construct for our E. cowli was planned to be expressed via a promoter which is inducible by methane. Although there is a constitutive promoter in the construct first, cloning according to iGEM standard biobrick format allows an easy exchange of parts. Therefore, various variants are easily constructed out of the broad iGEM Registry in case safety concerns arise. Additionally, we prepared special alginate beads in which our E. cowli will be embedded. These special beads allow the diffusion of gases and offer necessary nutrition. Since E. cowli is not able to grow in the natural rumen fluid of the cow, the beads enable its growth, controlling its localisation at once.
For further application, we plan to include a kill switch system based on a light-induced promoter. Usually, the risk of  bacteria passing the abomasum of a cow is very low. Nevertheless, an additional light-induced kill switch will disable E. cowli to live out of its provided rumen system decreasing the risk of an uncontrolled distribution.
Light-Induced Kill Switch
In order to further minimize any risk due to the application of our project we are planning to introduce a system for increased security. Since our transformed E. cowli is a genetically modified organism (GMO) and should, therefore, not be released into the environment without control a kill switch is considered to be useful. A kill switch is based on a specific combination"

TED speech on campus
TEDxCPU is another student organization on our campus, they were licensed by TED officially.  They provide a platform at school to tell stories, share interesting thoughts. In their Summer Lecture 2018, our leader, Huandi Xu made a speech named “Synthesis Biology—Create a better future.” He showed how synthesis biology can make our life more convenient and introduced iGEM to the audience, to promote public awareness of this field and this great international competition. There were nearly 100 people in the field watching. Some of them showed keen interest in synthesis biology after the speech, and approach Huandi for more information.

CPU Bio-X Club
CPU Bio-X Club, the first student-based school organization for life sciences of China Pharmaceutical University, was established by our senior schoolmates—2017 CPU_CHINA iGEMers . Thank them for all their effort. Our club aims to promote iGEM, trainnew iGEMers and provide an academic exchange platform for allstudents who are interested in life sciences. In order to do that, we organizevarious activities throughoutthe whole year on campus. Journal Club (JC)is held every week. Each time one of our club members presents a recent article in the biomedical literature and/ora former iGEM case. Sometimes weinvite faculty members to talk about their researches. Before the eventwe inform our schoolmates of the specific materials to be discussed with a poster. All who are interested are welcome.After the presentations, audience are allowed to raisequestions and give opinions of their own.
