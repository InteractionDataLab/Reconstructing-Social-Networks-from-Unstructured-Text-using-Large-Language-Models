Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in"

Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the Worm Buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the Worm Buster, horse owners will not only know how large the treatments should be but also when the treatments should happen. Thus they complement each other to minimize the amount of anthelmintics used, thereby helping to prevent resistance development.
The Worm Buster
The first thing the team did was to define the desired characteristics of the Worm Buster and outline the project strategy.
Requirements
Our bacteria need to live in the intestinal tracts of horses.
They also need the ability to report a quantitative signal of small strongyle in feces.
The small strongyle buster can therefore work as a diagnostic tool and give horse owners the possibility to use individualized dosage of treatment depending on the level of small strongyle infection.
Project Outline
1. Worm Culturing
The first step was to obtain live nematodes by the recovering them from the feces. After this process the next step would be to divide the large strongyles from the small strongyles using a 3D printed microfluidic chip with a microscope and stored for successive use.
Figure 2. The first stage of worm culturing.
2. Transcriptomics + Phage Display
As not a lot is known about our worms of interest, we needed an approach that would allow us to detect the worm without knowing its specific markers. For this, we developed new applications of two existing techniques.
Transcriptomics
For the first one, we have been developing a custom transcriptomic analysis protocol. This was necessary since transcriptomics is a new application for Oxford Nanopore technology. The transcriptomics procedure relies on the co-culturing of nematodes with E.coli and subsequent sequencing of the bacterial mRNA. This will ideally reveal which genes are upregulated when the bacteria are in the presence of the nematode. The promoters of these genes can then be used to develop a biosensor by linking them to a reporter!
Figure 3. Flowchart representing the trancsriptomics outline.
Phage Display
The second approach used a technique called “Phage Display”, which utilizes a random peptide library expressed on the surface of phages. By repeated rounds of affinity screening, only phages with high affinity to the molecule of interest will be selected. Sequencing the genetic information of these ph"

From it, we can see that the Forward sequence has mismatches towards the bottom, and Reverse sequences has mismatches near the beginning, which makes sense. Because the two sequences match perfectly in the middle, I can assume that I have the right plasmid in these cells.
Next step for this would be to make these cells competent again for Emily and Vicki to put their mutant circuits into it.

Integrated into the project
In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format for different types of data: parts, projects, keywords, and papers. Based on this format, our database is integrated into a unity, and accessible to set up interaction network and analysis. The S-Din search engine and S-Din Design are both working under this standard.
Figure 8: 20 standard parts in S-Din.
Figure 9: Each genetic design uses standard parts and interaction lines.
Figure 10: According to the standard data format, users can add their new parts to S-Din's database.
The Tree of Words & Network Analysis
Inspirations we have learned:
We interviewed several lab researchers and found that how to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, but several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.
Integrated into the project:
In order to stimulate one's inspiration in synbio work design, we tried the following explorations: The tree of words, and network analysis.
The tree of words: When you first enter the search engine of S-Din, you could search any word you like, or try selecting a word to explore more! When clicking, You will see the subordinated words. After few repeats, you will finally get the projects that you want. This function is designed to help specify your need, and help you understand your idea better.
Figure 11: The tree of words.
Network analysis: This function is designed to help you find out potential relationships between two parts, projects or keywords. Sometimes the recommendation may be hard to understand, but perhaps it would open a new direction and lots of inspiration for you.
Figure 12: Our analyses show keyword relationship and year relations when searching ""UV light"" in S-Din.
S-Din Statements
Inspirations we have learned
According to Mr. Li Yuzheng's advice, it is necessary to write a software statement, and show the statement to users when they first use our software. Only when users agree to provide their private information can our software collect and use it. What's more, Prof. He Zhumei reminded us of adding biosafety statements and interactive interface with users.
Integrated into the project
We combined the software statement with biosafety statement, then wrote the integrated S-Din statements. See statements , which consists of Terms of use, Bio-safety Alerts, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.

Although not all of them had been involved in iGEM before, the similar age as well as the common experiences made this conversation a very pleasant one. At the end of their visit, the alumni told us he never thought about before that nowadays student from Germany and China could have such common languages and experiences. And we told him that it is the iGEM that provide student all over the world an international version to “get, give and share” from each other.
iGEM Foundation
On May 24, 2015, Professor Randy Rettberg, chairman of the iGEM Foundation, Associate Professor Meagan Lizarazo, Executive Director Richard Johnson and Professor King L. Chow, chairman of Asia-Pacific iGEM visited our school. With the pleaure that we could communicate directly with the authorities of iGEM, we showed them around our lab in the Frontier Technology Research Institution of Tianjin University and talked about our project with full fervency. Some details on 2015 iGEM was given to us by Professor Meagan Lizarazo and Professor Richard Johnson, such as some revises on the evaluation standard and some  regulations of the final presentation, poster and wiki. Moved by our passion, Professor Randy also encouraged us to participate more in international competitions, so as to gain more traits that would be necessities for us in the future, such as innovation, creativity, leadership and practical ability.
Before leaving, Professor King L. Chow told us there were a great number of Chinese colleges and universities that were eager to participate in the research of synthetic biology but had no idea how to start with it. We said it was already in our human practice plan to help more green-hand school to start their iGEM team and walk into the door of synthetic biology. We had promised TUST (Tianjin University of Science and Technology) to help them start their team and we were looking forward to sharing more experiences to more students in more Chinese colleges and universities.

Our hope is that from this open source frame work, innovations with DNA origami can come about similar to how dNANO is an innovation in nano circuitry stemming off of DNA origami. However, with many innovations come the issue of ownership and intellectual property.
Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property is described as any product, invention that has come about from the creative process and has the ability to be protected by a patent, copyright, trademark or any other form of legislative protection. With our novel innovation in DNA origami, dNANO, we wanted to know more about the legislation that is out there to ensure that any innovations from our open source initiative can be made ours. We consulted TEC Edmonton, a startup incubator for more information in regards to IP rights in determining what is protected under Canadian patent law. A patent is a method of protecting inventions in which the inventor discloses the details of the creation to the level of detail where another individual can replicate the device in place for exclusive rights to that invention for set amount of time. In Canada and the United States that time is 20 years. According to TEC, in order for an invention to be patentable it must demonstrate 3 attributes:
Novelty- Is this invention/application the first of its kind?
Usefulness- Does this invention show some sort of utility?
Non obviousness- The invention must improve on existing technology that is not obvious. For example, one cannot patent a series of lightbulbs since it does not deviate enough from the base invention being the lightbulb.
Things that can be patented are concepts, inventions and applications of other products. In every patent is a state of claims made by the inventor, so long as there is enough evidence to demonstrate what is claimed in the patent then it has the potential to be patented. By doing so the patentee is claiming their creation is reasonably enabled. The team broke down the DNA origami aspect into three individual components: the template strand, the staple strands and the final structure which all can be patented.
As the act of patenting is costly, we were also introduced to the concept of strategic patenting. This"

Project Riboregulator Abstract
Regulatory RNAs are RNAs that regulate biological processes on genetic and metabolic levels, and their importance has been established through the discoveries including those of RNA interference (RNAi) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). The elucidation of their mechanism has enabled their reverse engineering, transforming them into versatile tools in synthetic biology.
Riboregulators belong to a class of regulatory RNAs that controls translation by pairing of cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) RNAs. They have received attention from at least 7 teams during the early years of iGEM. For example, Farren Isaacs in 2005, iGEM 2006 UC Berkeley team and iGEM 2007 Caltech team contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry. Though there are more than > 100 riboregulator BioBrick records, comprehensive characterization information is missing. This hinders the iGEM community to compare and contrast different riboregulator pairs and evaluate their performance. For example, if we want to use the CR and TA devices that Berkeley 2006 made, we would not know which one to use and whether the device would work, because documentations were not put down in the Registry or wiki page and were therefore no longer accessible.
In light of this situation, iGEM 2014 HKUST team decided to embark on ""Project Riboregulator"", and we aim to:
Provide Characterization information on riboregulator BioBricks so that teams and labs will be confident in using these devices.
Summarize available information of existing riboregulators into a Feature Page and promote their uses.

Cornell,2017,Team:Cornell#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," sensor unit utilizing our Wetlab’s engineered redox sensitive proteins to detect the amount of oxidative stress in the environment.  Studies show that providing the right amount of oxidative stress to plants can increase growth by 5-15% [2].  Hydroponic farms currently do not utilize ways of measuring oxidative stress, giving us a potentially novel idea.  To test feasibility, we interviewed professors, farmers, and companies, conducting over 40 interviews to discover our customers’ wants and needs.  We were able to define a problem and proceeded to iteratively sketch ideas for our proof-of-concept.  After prototyping, we brought our ideas back to our interviewees to receive feedback and improve our design, ultimately developing our OxyPonics project.
COMPONENTS
OxyPonics mechanical product consist of three main components.  The first component is a central housing box.  All electrical mechanisms and motors that power OxyPonics’s data gathering-and-response system are contained inside the water-tight box. The housing uses epoxy and 3D printed constructs to safely enclose all dry components of the product.  The second component is a rotating light module controlled by servos, which consists of two lights.  One light shines a 448 nm wavelength of light to activate the fluorescent protein [3] and the other a 576 nm wavelength of light to activate pDawn and produce enzymes to breakdown the oxidative stress [4].  The third component of the redox sensor is the mounted camera.  This camera measures the fluorescence emitted by the bacteria’s fluorescent protein and sends the appropriate amount of pDawn activating light. Ratiometric algorithms use the camera’s readings to ensure the water surrounding a hydroponic plant stays at the optimal oxidative stress state.  All three components can be attached to our designed railing system to minimize the number of cameras a hydroponic farmer may need.  This railing system can capture real time data of each and every plant within an entire hydroponic bed.
FABRICATION
We 3D printed several plastic models of the electronics housing, the camera mount, the servo mounts, and the Raspberry Pi mount using the Makerbot provided at Rev and the Rapid Prototyping Lab at Cornell University. The ArduCam 5 MP Mini Camera OV5647 1080p and light module were set up in the electronics housing. The waterproof box containing the electronic components of our product was machined by members of the team in the Emerson Lab at Cornell University.  The box was designed to hold a piece of plexiglass on top to allow the fluorescence from the"

Overview
Based on modeling work, we find that negative feedback can contribute to the network’s adaptation to DNA copy number variation. So we analysed the following three-node networks, A and B. The difference between A and B is the output nodes of network A has negative feedback. We transfected this two circuits into mammalian cells (Hela cell). By testing the mean value of EYFP (Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein, the output of our circuits), and the relationship between the EYFP and the DNA copy number, we can prove the hypothesis.
Construction
We constructed the following circuit A ,B and C .The circuit A corresponds to the network A ,while the circuit B is the implementation of network B. Circuit C is used as a control design to testify the function of A and B. In circuit A, as we can see, the input is miR-21, which can repress the plasmid pz371 and K1116002(The plasmid’s information can be found in parts). K1116002 induced by rtTA and Dox, serves as an auxiliary node, producing the LacI gene to inhibit the expression of EYFP. EYFP(Enhance Yellow Fluorescent Protein )is used as output. Besides, the miR-FF3 restrains the expression of LacI. The reason that we get the most of post-transcriptional control can be seen in Supplementary text. In circuit B, however, the plasmid K1116003 does not have FF3 target, leading to the contrast between circuit A and B. We can see miR-21 can’t target at pZ349 and pZ331 in circuit C , that is, there is no input in circuit C. The miR-21, used to distinguish cancer cell from normal cells ,is endogenous in Hela cell.

The cells have been co-transformed with a plasmid containing the respective engineered variant of indC and a second plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp, Svp, EntD or DelC. The first row shows plates with cells only expressing the engineered indigoidine synthetases without a supplementary PPTase. Note that some combinations result in blue colonies, whereas others don't."">Fig. 4 ), the T-domain of bpsA with three different domain border combinations ( Fig. 6 ) and the T-domains of the NRPS modules plu2642 (P. luminescens) and delH (D. acidovorans)( Fig. 7 ). In order to quantify the amount of indigoidine produced by the engineered indigoidine synthetases when co-transformed with different PPTases, we established a quantitative indigoidine assay based on OD measurement using a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader, inspired by Myers et al. [15]. Notably, some of our engineered IndC constructs were more efficient in the production of indigoidine compared to the wild-type IndC (T-domains synT1, synT3, synT4; Fig. 10 ).  This is particularly remarkable as our results contradict to previous studies of NRPS domains that reported the native T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase BpsA to be essential for protein function (and therefore not replaceable by other T-domains)[7].
In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to replace single domains from NRPS modules, while preserving or even enhancing their functionality. In addition, we established an approach for the design of synthetic T-domains and proved their functionality by introducing them into the indigoidine synthetase indC scaffold. Moreover, we established a high throughput protocol for circular polymerase extension cloning and transformation (Hi-CT) ( BBF RFC 99 ) based on CPEC assembly [13], which we applied for our domain shuffling approach. In summary, we created a library of 58 engineered indC variants. In addition we perforemd measurement of blue pigement production over time, which gave us novel insights in how NRPS domains should be designed, where the domain borders between different domains in a single NRPS module have to be set and which domains from respective NRPS pathways and bacterial strains can be used, when creating novel engineered NRPS pathways. We implemented our findings into the ""NRPS-Designer"" Software"

Furthermore, he also advised us to compare the STEP system with current CAR-T therapy in the background in order to highlight our originality.
Haotian Guo Judge PhD student in The Center for Research and Interdisplinarity Leader of 2013 Fudan iGEM Team
How to present the result of our project clearly? We invited Guo, who has led the Chinese and French teams to participate in iGEM several times and has rich experience in the competition. In his opinion, the basic assumptions of our dry experiment could be refined, so we further considered the reaction mechanism of STEP system completely in the model, and improved the integrity and authenticity of the model. In addition, he suggested that we should use more intuitive images as a result when introducing projects to the outside world, so that people without professional knowledge can understand meanings. Therefore, while making statistical explanation of the data, we also directly showed the molecular structure diagram to make intuitive comparison.
4. Ethic and Law
Dr. Jie Yin Associate Professor, School of Philosophy Fudan University
How ethical issues are involved in cellular immunotherapy? In China, no medical institution has received clinical application approval for tumor immunotherapy as there exists major ethical issues. As a result, we are very curious about what ethical issues are involved in our research and how to make our research more ethical. Dr. Yin, who graduated from Shanghai medical university, transfer to philosophy after graduation as a clinical undergraduate. She majored in medical philosophy and Kantian philosophy. Her dual degrees in medicine and ethics, therefore, greatly helped us in the field of research ethics and clinical ethics. She highlighted that unlike the embryonic ethical issue facing stem cell therapy, safety is the major ethical controversies facing our STEP system. Tumor immunotherapy is expensive, it can also have serious side effects and fatality. She stressed that among the four principles of bioethics, the principle of no harm is pivotal. It is crucial for us to consider how the technology and drugs that are still under clinical trials can protect the rights and interests of the subjects. Therefore, we tried to solve the problem of cytokine storm through the cooperation between wet lab and dry lab in subsequent experiments, thereby making our platform more secure. Dr. Yin also introduced the history, composition and approval process of the Chinese Hospital Ethics Committee to us. When we talk about the current ethical situation in China"
Paris_Bettencourt,2015,Team:Paris Bettencourt#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"1 for 1 idli).
Besides its popularity and easy accessibility, the most interesting property of idli is                         that it is fermented. To cook idli, people soak rice and dal separately, then                         grind and mix them together, then let the batter ferment overnight. In the hot Indian climate,                         the batter ferments quickly and its volume can triple overnight.
Many studies have been made on the microbiome of idli batter. Though the strains                         found in idli can be highly variable from one study to another, probably because the                         microbiome varies from different regions, we found that Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus                             plantarum are among the most common fermentative bacteria found in idli batter,                         while in the yeast population, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was always present.                          Since we wanted our product to disrupt as little as possible                         the idli's taste, we chose these organisms for production of the different vitamins and                         to improve iron availability, instead of adding new micro-organisms that weren’t already present                         in the idli batter that may have influenced the microbiome in an unpredictable manner.                         Many people who reviewed our project said that taste was of high importance, and would prefer                         that we modified microbes already present in the idli rather than add new ones.

Safety & Regulations
Choice of Strains
Since our product is meant to be used freely in households                         without containment, and to be eaten by people, safety is a major element we had to address. In                         this optic we chose to implement our pathways in Generally Considered As Safe (GRAS) organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii are all GRAS, commonly found in food.
We used Escherichia Coli to assemble our plasmids because this bacteria is easy to                         work with, but our goal is to have the vitamins produced by GRAS only.
A further step to our project would be to implement the pathways in wild type strains                         directly taken from fermented foods, instead of lab strains.
Toxicity
During the summer we worked on the synthesis of 3 vitamins: vitamin A, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12.
No toxic or adverse effects have been associated with B12, even in very large intakes, so there                     is no tolerable upper intake level (UL) over which the B12 becomes toxic. And this is true for all                     the forms of B12 present in food and"

The changes to biomes will have an effect on the ecosystems found within, and hereby also the biodiversity, which can have an overall negative effect in the fitness of species. The most extreme case of fitness decrease is extinction, and by that also a loss in biodiversity.
GMO’s effect on biodiversity
The largest impact on biodiversity from GMO is seen in agriculture. In agriculture an increase in GM plants can be seen, as crops have been modified to be herbicide tolerant (HT). This is primarily seen in soy, maize and cotton UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. . There are also plants modified to be arthropod tolerant (Bt), and is toxic to specific groups of arthropods.
Crops who have been modified with both HT and Bt, are so called stacked genes crops. HT crops allow farmers to more effectively manage pest and weeds in their fields, where Bt crops kills of pests as they feed on the plant UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. .
The overall effect of HT crops could end with a local fall in biodiversity, as weeds and other plants, together with arthropods, are simply removed with herbicides. Another threat would be the effect of horizontal gene-transfer between related species, where wild type plants get the HT gene from domesticated plants. This is seen in the golf field grass Agrostis stolonifera from a farm and the wild type Agrostis gigantea Watrud, Lidia S., et al. ""Evidence for landscape-level, pollen-mediated gene flow from genetically modified creeping bentgrass with CP4 EPSPS as a marker.""

1 PCR Amplification of pSB1C3
∙ Due to poor amplification of pSB1C3 from friday, we are doing a temperature test today.
∙ Followed same protocol as 4/17/2015, but scaled to 3x 25 uL reactions.
∙ Decided to take nanodrop reading of the template Julian provided. It was 230 ng/uL. Instead of using stock concentration of template, we will use a 1:100 dilution. Results shown below.

Referring to the possible game types, adventure and strategy games are students’ favorite, while some of them prefer stimulation and action games. In our program, we tried our best to listen to their voice and develop a game which is both educational and appealing.
Communication
We’d like to share what we have achieved with the world, so we did and will do a great deal to communicate with others and learn. For example, we collaborate closely with USTC wet team to learn what biology majors think of iGame and improve. Several seminars have been hold to make sure our program can really help the promotion of both synthesis biology and our tutor game. In addition, further transnational communication is not absent, like we had a deep talk with Dr. Joy Yueyue Zhang*(*BIOS Centre, London School of Economics and Politics Science) on how our program can change the development of both IGEM and make biology a better subject.
Yet we do not stop here. We have sent emails to other teams for further communications and asked for their opions on how we can improve iGame. What is more, all our codes are shared on github [1] (in the right picture). With fixes and new features putting forward every day,any one in any corner of the world can learn and keep update of our work, not just from the surface, but from codes and essense of our work. This is really a great way of communication, for we do not have to say too much to put our achieves across to those who really want to know our work, which really works. Great contributions have been given through github and we get a lot of advices and opinions as well.
Community
To better promote synthesis and the spirit of IGEM, we decided to establish a community together with IGEM USTC team. For the community, we have set regular classes and lectures for both synthesis biology and IGEM. We also open our laboratory to our community members and teach them basic skills of biology experiment(as in the right picture), like PCR. Of course, this is the main field we will update our progress on in the future.

CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Model#NUPACK_-_-_TEXT.html," to adjust the parameters to fit to our lab data when we had it. More parameters also increased the total uncertainty, decreasing the precision of our model.
Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"

SUPER-SAFE SAFETY SWITCH
Well thought out synthetic circuit.
Designed to standardize safety switches.
Next
Project Description
Numerous iGEM teams have designed biological devices that do not sufficiently emphasize their circuit safety measures nor do they have designed standardized safety switches. In order to address this problem, we wish to standardize a well designed synthetic circuit by which the safeness safety and ethics associated with using synthetic biology as mean can be dealt with,
without compromising the function of the construct that is originally designed. Such a system has the potential uses on both single and multicellular organisms for different applications - including but not limited to bioremediation, therapeutics and biosensors.
Next
Design Process
In our design, we employ luxR gene that forms a transcriptionally active complex with 3OC6HSL to activate a downstream construct. Once activated, the desired functions of the circuit will run along with a ""time bomb"" that terminates this synthetic process.
Learn More
Next
Design Process Cont.
After a period of time (which varies depending on the application), termination of function will be accomplished by knocking out the genes of interest using Cre-lox and/or Dre-rox. As a result, the entire local population of genetically modified organisms can be reverted back to its wild-type phenotype with or without getting exterminated to prevent sudden and drastic changes in the ecosystem.

BIT-China,2014,Team:BIT-China#Project_-_-_TEXT.html,"’t let bacteria grow without limitation. So we must have a system to control the amount of bacteria, preventing it from industrialization after stolen. So we designed a device to allow the cells grow at low density when the Eco-Lock is closed and at high density when the Eco-Lock is open.
As described in the gene circuit, when add inducer(AHL) as input, the compound that bound of inducer and LuxR can inhibit promoter R0063. Therefore, when the cell concentration is under a certain threshold, the isolated gene MinC won't express in cell under normal growth. With the number of cells increasing, Aii expression increasing as well, Aii will cause the decomposition of AHL, leading to a lower input concentration. When the input concentration decrease to a certain threshold, promoter R0063 works, gene MinC (or suicide gene) expresses, cell division stops, the number of cells stay stable.
3.3 RESULTS
Min system contains three functional genes, MinC ,MinD and MinE . MinC is cell division inhibitor of the MinC - MinD -MinE and DicB - MinC systems that regulate septum placement. MinD is membrane ATPase of the MinC - MinD - MinE system that regulates septum placement .MinE is cell division topological specificity factor .We designed 3 pairs of primers to copy MinC, MinD and MinE from E.coli which contained the enzyme digest sites of EcoRI, XbaI, spaI and PstI . MinC, MinD, MinE were constructed into pSB1C3 as new standard parts.  We constructed MinC and MinD in this part. We obtained standard biological parts J23119 - B0034, C0060, J23119 - B0034 - C0062, R0063, B0032 from iGEM, and we finished the ligation of the whole circuits of Min system through 3A assembly and OE PCR. While the verification of this section is still in progress.

Sequencing
We then sent these plasmids for sequencing analysis. This step provides us further information on the quality of our constructs.
The sequencing data confirmed the punctuated mutation (pIV*S324G) located in the mutated porin (see figure 3). Moreover, no other differences have been detected between the wild-type and the mutated porin.

In order to generate linear fragments with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends, we performed PCR reactions using different set of primers :
Cycling conditions:

To verify the length of our PCR products, we used a linear version of the PIV* construct obtained via restriction with BamHI or XhoI (see figure 4).

After amplification, those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the Gibson assembly method.

Selection
First step: Selection of the open phenotype
During the first selection step on selective maltodextrin media, we were able to get leaky mutants (see figure 6).
Figure 6: Growth of leaky mutant on selective maltodextrin medium.
As a positive control, we used the pIV*S324G porin that grows on selective maltodextrin medium. On the other hand, for the negative control, we used the pIV WT that needs much more time to grow on this selective medium (see figure 7).
Figure 7: pIV*/pIV WT growth on selective maltodextrin media (controls)
Second step: Selection of the closed phenotype
To select an inducible opening or closing of the porin, we compared bacterial viability on selective maltodextrin media in presence and absence of our transition metal ions (Zn2+ and Ni2+). If, on the same medium, a mutant survives in presence of the ions and dies in its absence or vice-versa, it"
Paris_Saclay,2014,Team:Paris Saclay#Ethics#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," in general. Then, I would say that Bio-Art educates its spectators. You learn something when you see a bio-artistic work. However, some artists, such as Eduardo Kac, frighten people about biology. Indeed, with shocking pieces they go against the principle of education. Thus, we can be afraid and completely reject it.
Alexei Grinbaum : If we use synthetic biology, it has to be useful. However, a project such as a Bio-Art work may help to prove the feasibility of a synthetic biology approach. It may also improve scientific knowledge. But Bio-Art it is not only about knowledge, it much more than that. As the work is exhibited, it is also about aestheticism, admiration… The goal is to show something to people, with a question behind it or not.
Morgan Meyer : Bio-Art has a complex set of goals. The visible metaphor is obviously very important. But what I think is that the role of the artist is not only to produce something aesthetic but also to create debate, to raise questions, and to see the biologist in a different light. It allows people to understand better, to enrich the debate and to be more interested in biology because in the end, biology is everywhere.  Bio-Art has also the power of popularization. It presents something complex such as synthetic biology with a visual work, sometimes easier to understand. It is an issue which has been raised a lot of times about scientific papers. These works are too difficult to be understood by everyone. Finally, the academic jargon is obscure and we always have to make it more accessible, simplify it without being simplistic.
Emmanuel Hirsch: Your goal is purely an aesthetic goal, is it useful? Is art useful? The approach is especially for sensitization and popularization. Bio-Art takes part in society’s education showing what is possible.
What do you think about using living being in an artistic purpose?
Morgan Meyer : I do not think that I can answer to your question. But I can say that some rules and controls exist, especially with manipulations in a laboratory. Furthermore, if you are a researcher in a laboratory, you went through a training, you studied, you passed a PhD, and so I think that these persons are aware about risks and dangers. So, if one day you pretend that you are an artist, then yes you can use bacteria for your work, but do you receive all training you need, especially the artistic approach? We cannot consider that the bacteria is the brush, the brush is inert, the brush cannot mute onto another brush"

principle
First of all, we select an aptamers AP273, which could best affinity for AFP. We modified a biotin at the end of its 5’ end, which could affinity for streptavidin. Because of the presence of streptavidin-modified beads, aptamer has been locked firmly on beads. At the same time, a complementary chain was synthesized in its protein binding site. We modified an amino at the 3’ end of the complementary chain which can be combined with lysine protected by BOC anhydride to link lysine to the complementary chain. Because Van der Waals forces between AFP and aptamers is stronger than hydrogen bond, due to the action of magnet lying at the bottom of the reaction system, aptamers are separated from complementary chain, one at the bottom, the other in the supernatant. At this point, with the action of trypsin, lysine can be separated from the complementary chain, and start his adventure.

Week 26
Primers arrived. Restriction of the banana receptors was performed. Vector pRS305 and two banana receptors were cut with EcoRI and PstI. The product was put on gel and the gel band with the proper size was cut out and purified. Then a ligation step was performed and the ligation product was transformed in Top10 cells. This didn’t give colonies. We tried the ligation step again and the second time it did lead to colonies. A colony was picked, grown in selective liquid media and after a day the plasmid was purified. A PCR reaction using the primers which checks the insert was performed. This didn’t led to results. A PCR reaction using pFX polymerase to amplify the pUG73 cassette with knock-out flanks also didn’t lead to results after a few tries. New primers (shorter ones) were ordered and also the pRS305 primers were redesigned to anneal ~200 bp from the multiple cloning site for optimal sequencing. Preparation for transformation of yeast cells with the knock-out cassette was performed. Further the I7 and I7-olf10 genes where amplified with a PCR reaction which flanks the gene with a kozak sequence and BamHI and NdeI sites. This facilitates the implementation of the gene between the promoter and terminator. Also the synthesized banana receptor genes where cut, gel extracted and ligated into the backbone. This led to many false positives. We performed the ligation step again and this time we confirmed the insert through restriction.
Week 27
We found out that pRS305 isn’t usable in our system since the leucine gene is completely removed in our strain and there is no origin of amplification for yeast on our plasmid. Therefore we ordered pRS315 and we contacted Mark Chee to see whether he could send us the renewed pRSII415 vectors which are also Biobrick compatible. G alpha pieces A and B arrived (the company couldn’t make it as a whole, so it is chopped up in pieces A, B, C and D). They were transformed in Top10 cells, grown and purified. When performing a restriction check we came to the conclusion a mistake had been made. The second time (same story) the bands of the restriction check where fine. New primers arrived to make the knockout cassette. A PCR with pFX polymerase to make the knock-out cassette was performed again. This time Gpa1 was successfully amplified. Yeast cells were grown and transformed with help of Daniel"

First Thoughts
We first became obsessed with the protein lmrA - during our brainstorming process, we read about a kind of multidrug resistance factors that make bacteria nearly invincible to common antibiotics, and lmrA is one of them. Then we had a bizarre idea: what if we make use of this trait so that certain engineered bacteria strains can export their antibiotic products more easily? Doing so is like taking advantage of evolution’s ingenuity, so we feel compelled to explore more. To make our project sounds feasible, we then set out to find a proper context for lmrA to create our project.
Since lmrA is a membrane protein from Lactococcus lactis, we decided that it would be more appropriate to express it in a Gram-positive bacteria. We then chose Bacillus subtilis as our host since it is a well-studied Gram-positive bacteria and it’s also nonpathogenic, which restraints the potential danger in using lmrA. Then, to simplify the genetic system we would need to build, we started looking for useful xenobiotics that could be naturally synthesized by any common Bacillus subtilis strain and could be a potential substrate of lmrA. In this way, xenobiotics normally synthesized at a trace amount due to their toxicity could be efficiently translocated to extracellular space, thereby increasing the upper limit of production rate.
It has been discovered that Bacillus subtilis can produce more than two dozen antibiotics with varying chemical structures. Most antibiotics are ribosomally synthesized, post-transcriptionally modified, including lantibiotics, or produced by a nonribosomal pathway, leading to lipopeptides, polyketides or some aminosugars. Among those antibiotics, one especially attracted us - surfactin. It’s a cyclic heptapeptide with a lipid tail so it can act as a biosurfactant dut to its amphiphilic property. It’s biosynthesis, industrial production, purification, and economic values have been well characterized. Moreover, it can be used in bioremediation of polluted lands, which just fits in our plan of a project with ecological concerns.

Bielefeld-Germany,2013,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Project#MFC_-_-_TEXT.html," membrane, agitation of the solution and the buildup of a biofilm at the anode have an influence at the power output of the fuel cell. When choosing a multimeter to measure the data, the internal resistance of the device, generating a so called burden voltage has to be kept in mind.
A standard measurement set up was established to generate data with fuel cell experiments. The experiments were carried out in the third generation fuel cell if not specified otherwise. A Nafion N117 proton exchange membrane manufactured by DuPont (for further information see here ) was used to separate the anode and the cathode chamber. The surface area is 25 cm2 in each chamber. The 50 x 50 mm carbon cloth electrodes, including two circular recesses are placed in the middle of each chamber. The cross-sectional area of each electrode is approximately 24.215 cm2. The exact surface area of the electrodes is unknown, since the carbon cloth is composed of extremely thin filaments and has a rough surface.   However, it is assumed that the surface area is roughly the same for each electrode used, since the material is identical. The cathode chamber was filled with 29 mL of a 20 mM solution of potassium ferricyanide in M9 medium. Bacteria were grown aerobically in shaker flasks in M9 minimal medium with 10.223 g L-1 glycerol as a carbon source. When cultivating bacteria carrying a plasmid with an inducible promoter, induction was carried out 2 hours after inoculation. The optical density of the culture was periodically measured until it reached 1. At this point, 29 mL of the medium containing the bacteria were injected into the anode chamber of the fuel cell. When using an exogenous mediator 1 mL of a 10mM mediator solution in M9 medium was injected after 15 minutes.
Figure 3: Measurement setup. A voltmeter and a resistor are wired in parallel.
Figure 4: Front and back view of the resistor box that was used to vary the load on the electric curcuit during measurements.
A 200 Ω resistor was wired between the anode and the cathode chamber.  A UT 803 multimeter by UNI-T was used to measure the voltage across the resistor. The according electrical schematic is presented in Figure 3. To generate polarization and power curves, the resistance was changed from 10 Ω to 10 kΩ in a cascade of 6 different values, using a self-constructed resistor box, shown in Figure 4.

[Fig 1] Biomarvel team member & KUAS_KOREA Team member
This year, team KUAS_Korea has been collaborating with team Biomarvel_Korea high school iGEM team. We shared our trials and errors KUAS_Korea have made in iGEM for past few years as well as general understandings in synthetic biology which could help them starting things up.
Biomarvel_Korea is a high school team, and this is their first year in iGEM. This time they are aiming for synthesizing GBP-ProG fusion protein for electrochemical biosensor, which detects heart failiue with high accuracy, inexpensive cost and high sensitivity. It is such a brilliant project reflecting socio-contextual issues, so feel free to find more of them at their wiki.
Two teams, Kuas and Biomarvel have consistently communicated through e-mail and Facebook for collaboration. The first offline meet-up was held on August 10th, and at the moment both teams were still at the stage of setting basic concepts and principals of the project. We discussed each team’s projects and gave comments regarding the direction of the project and further points to elaborate. Listening from the outer perspective, especially from young active students was a truly helpful and intriguing experience.
Besides contents of the project itself, collaboration with Biomarvel_Korea was meaningful enough in the means of giving a real help to difficulties most of the iGEMers are facing. We went through some basic requirements for iGEM together such as project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria, which can be often too overwhelming to manage all by themselves. This also actually helped us to look back and go through our own works and make sure that everything was properly managed to be reviewed and rewarded.
Overall, during the whole process of communication and content sharing, we gained valuable learnings on cooperation from their genuine thoughts and"

A1: I could have represented it, but we still do not know very well how it works. We need crossed mice to experiment.
Q2: Did you experiment on mice with KO Bmp6 type 2 receptors?
A2: No, because you can not invalidate those receptors without consequences, unless you only target the liver.
Result survey with patients participation
Summary
We learned three important informations with our survey .
Most patients are satisfied with bloodletting, and the more satisfied they are, the less they want another treatment. Despite this, they remain interested in a complementary treatment.
The most interested patients are the patients who would benefit the less from the bacterian treatment. Indeed this treatment would be most appropriate after the first phase of treatment, to help regulating iron absorption and diminishing the frequence of bloodletting.
Last but not least, our survey shows that a bacterian treatment would be a real help for working patients, who often have difficulties to leave their job to go to bloodletting.

Nicolas Pollet: ""Microbiom studies""
Summary
All the micro-organisms that live in (and on) the human body constitute our microbiome. There are 10 times more of them than our own cells, and the microbiome as an all has 1000 times more genes than us. The microbiome is a necessary part of our organism, so there is a large number of beneficial bacterias. The microbiome is still relatively unknown. We know that it is very complex. The number of micro-organisms increases exponentially along the digestive system; the microbiome varies depending on the place of the body, but also depending on the topology. Our microbiome changes during our live too: for example during pregnancy. Last but not least, we all have different microbiome, but it seems that there are several bacterial patterns. As the microbiome plays a role in some pathologies, these patterns may be a major research field.
Several probiotics are already marketed, and many more are tested.

Relationship With Synthetic Biology And iGEM Standard Parts
Genome editing is an important part of synthetic biology. It has important application value in studying the function of genes, as well as gene correction and cell replacement therapy. CRISPR / Cas technology is a rising genome editing technology, which greatly improves the ability to modify and edit the genome sequence for scientists. Our software designs CRISPR sgRNA with minimized off-target effects and high cutting rate. A part is compatible with an assembly standard, as long as its sequence has no sites of relevant restriction enzymes. Our software designs a RFC filter option that contains RFC[10],RFC[12], RFC[21], RFC[23] and RFC[25]. This ensures that each sgRNA meets the requirements of the chosen assembly standard.
Best Practices
We do follow best practice in our project development. From the start of our project, we host and manage our project on github. So we have a clear and detailed develop history on github. Besides that, we use more modern software continuous integration (CI) tools. In details, Travis CI performs our automatic build and test tasks of CRISPR-X server core. To review our build history, please visit https://travis-ci.org/igemsoftware/UESTC-Software_2014/builds . Most importantly, we use Coverall.io to evaluate our test coverage automatically. It’s significant for us to design better test cases. And our test coverage log can be found on this page, https://coveralls.io/r/uestc-igem-2014/CRISPR-X . To make our software more robust, we also did many test. Test report can be found here, https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Testing.html
Future work
1. More model organisms will be supported.
2. We would help users share results with their collaborators through email.
3. For further long term, we would integrate with functional design, helping users in whole CRISPR experiment.
4. We would make CRISPR-X support plugins, so other iGEMers can extend it easily.

BIT-China,2015,Team:BIT-China#Notebook_-_-_TEXT.html," verified the strength of two promoters under the different pH environment. The result is success.
Week12 (Jun 1 -Jun 7)
We designed recombinase system to fine-regulation. Meanwhile, we wanted to build a library of pH-induced promoters by error-prone PCR. So we divided to two groups to finish these works. And this week, we searched and looked around the articles to find suitable recombinase and fit condition of EP-PCR.
Comparing to the strain with the plasmid carrying J23119, we measured the intensity of proteins expressed in the strain with the plasmid carrying JBG again.
Week13 (Jun 8 -Jun 14)
This week, we confirmed the recombinase(Cre, Flp, Bxb1 and FimE) we used in our gene circuits and the condition of EP-PCR.
Week14 (Jun 15 -Jun 21)
We extracted the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and transformed mRFP, GFP, K137007(FimE), K907000(Bxb1 gp35) and K907001(Bxb1 gp47) from iGEM kit plates into BMTOP10. Simultaneously, we did the mutation of P-atp2 firstly and selected 157 positive bacteria from more than 500 bacteria
Week15 (Jun 22 -Jun 28)
This week, we had final examination. We didn't have enough time to do any experiments. So we searched and looked around large amount of articles to optimize our experiments.
Week16 (Jun 29 -Jul 5)
We constructed the device K137058(ILL+pTetR+ILR+GFP) according to iGEM and linked it with mRFP. We found a better approach of EP-PCR, so we did again.
We measured the intensity of red florescence at different pH to test the function of acid-induced promoter J100071 again.
Week17 (Jul 6 -Jul 12)
We constructed a new part P-atp2+B0034+K137007(FimE) by over-lap extension PCR(OE-PCR) and transformed it into BMTOP10. In this week, we did amounts of EP-PCR, and were ready to select them next week.
Through PCR, digestion, ligation, transformation and cPCR, we have successfully constructed the standard part glsA on pSB1C3.

Nordic iGEM Conferance (NiC)
More than half of the team managed to attend this years Nordic iGEM Conferance hosted by Lund. This turned out to be a great oppertunity to reconnect to the nordic iGEM community that we met earlier in spring. It was very useful since all the teams shared advice among each other in the purpose of making all nordic teams better. Most of all, it was a huge opportunity to get a taste of the feeling of being at the Giant Jamboree since all teams had to present their project with a poster and a presentation to later be judged. All teams participating along with our hosts, Lund, was: Aalto Helsinki, Uppsala, Stockholm, Linkoping University, Chalmers-Gothenburg, University of Oslo, University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Technical Univeristy.

iGEM Work Environment Evaluation
As a part of our subproject with the booklet , this year's human practice group have created a form to evaluate the work environment in the iGEM competition. In order to get as many representative answers possible, we posted the evaluation form on the iGEM collaboration page and on the iGEM community page to be able to let iGEMers worldwide answer our questions. Several teams chose to collaborate with us by filling in the form and we could not have completed the evaluation without their answers. This gave us valuable content for the booklet and a broader perspective of how extensive the problem of burning out is for iGEM participants. However, we want to continue this investigation and would be thankful if even more teams would like to answer this survey . Help us build a better iGEM environment!

The visualization is another potential advantage of this system, we raised the dose of the engineering bacteria and extended the sense time. Finally, blue color produced by our device was strong enough to be observed by the human naked eye, however, similar lightness among 100-500μM Cd2+-treatment samples were shown which matched the previous data (Fig.3 C).
In summary, the Rosetta-plysS strain made our system convenient to be applied, the classical smtB-OP-smtA device from Synechococcus supported our system a responsive Cd2+ inducible-promoter, and the viewable pigment gene provided our system a reliable and macroscopic observation. After theoretical prediction, genetic engineering, experimental optimization and reasonable model analysis (deeply discussed in Modeling ), our detecting system residing in the engineering bacteria was able to sensitively represent the content of Cd2+ (1-100μM) in 1-2 hours.
Although the inducible operator in our case might also response to other metal ions including Zn2+, our date at least did point out that Cd2+ has acuter stimulus to the pigment gene than Zn2+ which was confirmed both from experimental data and model analysis. We achieved our goal at a certain degree. Finally, our system is easier to utilize and exhibits improved flexibility as a tool to detect Cd2+ which belongs to the toxical heavy metal ions.
Protocols
Plasmid design and construction
The vector pHY300 PLK and vector PACYC184 were constructed based on the smtBCP/smtBRP backbone (see obtaining the target genes) using standard cloning techniques. The sensor vector included an improved metal ions inducible promoter (smtO-P), a pigment gene (RFP or amilCP) marker. Detailed vector maps, sequence information and cloning protocols has been described above in Foundation .
Establishment of the detecting clonal cell lines.
DNA transfection was performed as standard molecular cloning techniques, the Rosetta-plysS strain (kindly supported by our instructors) was cultured with LB medium. All the clonal cells were validated by PCR (see Foundation).

Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology Special Prize
iGEM introduced an award for plant synthetic biology for the first time in 2016. Many teams have worked in this area over the years, and we finally decided it was time for a special award to encourage teams in this area. Teams can work with a number of different plant and algal chassis to be eligible for this award. The prize will go to the team with the best plant synthetic biology project. As with all awards, if there are a sufficiently high number of participating teams, there will be separate awards for the undergraduate and overgraduate sections.
While not mandatory, teams are strongly encouraged to work with Phytobricks during your project.
Please put all your judging information relevant to the plants prize on this page!
To compete for the Best Advancement in Plant Synthetic Biology prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .

The conventional model of transcriptional termination is that the stem loop causes RNA polymerase to pause and transcription of the poly-A tail causes the RNA: DNA duplex to unwind and dissociate from RNA polymerase.
Algorithm
In 2011, iGEM team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B developed a software tool TTEC to predict terminator efficiency. It takes DNA sequences as input and returns the terminator efficiency value.
In the algorithm, it takes 3 steps to calculate the terminator efficiency:
1. Use RNA folding algorithm to predict the secondary structure of terminator and and recognize A tail, stemloop and T tail.
2. From the secondary structure, we calculate the free energy of stem loop, and generate a score by considering stem loop free energy and T tail
3. From the score, we predict the terminator efficiency based on the score-terminator equation.
The prediction of secondary and recognition of A tail, stemloop and T tail are achieved by Kingsford scoring system.
Kingsford Scoring System
In 2007, Carleton L. Kingsford et al. described TransTermHP1, a new computational method to rapidly and accurately detect Rho-independent transcription terminators.
They put forward an algorithm to predict Rho-independent terminators. The first 15 bases of the potential tail sequences are scored using a function:
where
for n=1,2,..,15 and =1.
The energy of potential hairpin configurations adjacent to a reference position can be found efficiently with a dynamic programming algorithm. The table entry hairpin_score[i,j] gives the cost of the best hairpin structure for which the base of the 5' stem is at nucleotide position i and the base of the 3' stem is at position j. The entry hairpin_score[i,j] can be computed recursively as follows:
The function energy(i,j) gives the cost of pairing the nucleotide at i with that at j, and loop_pen(n) gives the cost of a hairpin loop of length n. The hairpin's loop is forced to have a length between 3 and 13 nt, inclusive, by setting loop_pen(n) to a large constant for any n outside that range. The constant 'gap' gives the cost of not pairing a base with some base on the opposite stem and thus introducing a gap on one side of the hairpin stem.

Hong_Kong_HKU,2014,Team:Hong Kong HKUST#pneumosensor#future work_-_-_TEXT.html,", PcelA, PcomFA
PcelA and PcomFA promoters are promoter that is regulated by σx. We have proven that in the presence of σx, PcelA and PcomFA could express GFP. However, we did not manage to characterize the GFP expression of PcelA and PcomFA in different concentration of σx. So, a possible future work is to put inducible promoter upstream of RBS (BBa_B0034), σx gene, and terminator (BBa_B0015). An example of inducible promoter is BBa_I0500. Hence, by putting an inducible promoter, we can tune the level of σx expression and characterize Com-Box promoters (PcelA and PcomFA) on different level of σx concentration.
Moreover,ComW is a protein that function to protect σx from degradation. It is necessary to have ComW protein as it could increase the amount of σx to regulate PcelA and PcomFA promoters. However, due to the time constrains, we were unable to finish the construct of ComW generator. Hence, possible future work would be continuing ComW generator construct by ligating BBa_K880005-comW to a double terminator (BBa_B0015), and introduce it to E.coli DH10B strain. Then, characterization of comW could be performed by measuring the amount of σx with and without ComW protein.

RDFZ-China,2018,Team:RDFZ-China#Team_-_-_TEXT.html,"huo Wang
Hey guys, I’m Sizhuo Wang, a tenth grader from RDFZ. You might find my name a bit difficult for the tongue, but I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it soon enough, with some practice. I am generally obsessed with certain arthropods and programming (which are two things that don’t seem to stick to each other at all), but recently I found genetic engineering equally charming (yay, something else that doesn’t seem to stick to the other two). This is my first time participating in iGem, as well as a first time taking part in a year-long team project that works with microbes. Thankfully, my teammates are all awesome people, so I have already learned much from them, and probably will learn even more in the future. You will see me on my laptop a lot this year as I’m also working with one of our team leaders to construct our wiki webpage apart from my normal duties as a team member. Like the rest of my team, I am totally looking forward to seeing our project unfold while making its way to success, and seeing the rest of you bio-people at the Jamboree!

Xuan Wang is a former iGEM team leader of BNU_China 2014, a current PhD candidate in Tsinghua University. He wants to do several beautiful science projects and to teach several potential students.
Yiqing Zhao   Advisor
As a graduate from RDFZ, it feels amazing to work as the advisor of RDFZ-China! Though this is my third iGEM year, it still brings me freshness and curiosity. Hope you enjoy viewing this wiki~
Ziyuan Zhao   Advisor
Having led experiments in BHU_China in 2016 and initiated the iGEM team at our school last year, I’m proud to be the advisor this year to help my team get around the failures and follies that have tripped me in the past. I’m captivated by the bold idea of designing and assembling biological components in synthetic biology – it motivates me to search for the fundamental principles of biology and their real-world applications. As a high school senior, there’s still so much I have to learn, and I’m excited to continue my quest in the undergraduate years.                     A final thought: We have the most passionate and talented young people working on the team this year. I believe that the experience will serve as an inspiration for our future endeavors, even if outside of STEM fields. Let’s rock, my friends!

This suggests that most respondents have some degree of awareness of the genetic diseases around us. 
Figure 3. Word cloud for responses to known diseases caused by genetic defects
From left to right are results for Singapore, Indonesia and China respectively.
However, cancer, being one of the most common genetic disorders, is surprisingly not as frequently mentioned. It only ranks 4th most frequently identified genetic diseases for Indonesia and ranks even lower in the other two countries, indicating that cancer is not classified as a genetic disease according to most of the respondents. Therefore, we can conclude that though most respondents are able to name one or a few genetic disorders, they are less familiar with what constitutes a genetic disease. 
Next, we compared the public attitudes towards gene editing in the three countries we surveyed.  Generally, people are receptive of gene editing on the purpose of curing lethal diseases, as it holds the highest proportion of “agree” and “strongly agree”. As of the other three applications of gene editing, the trend differs. In Singapore, people support more on curing minor diseases, followed by improving physical trait, and lastly intelligence. In Indonesia, people support slightly more on curing non-lethal diseases, followed by improving intelligence and physical features.  In China, the graphs hold the same shape for all three other applications of gene editing. There is no obvious difference in the support level. 
Figure 4. Attitude towards different applications of gene editing
Then we tested how much the respondents perceive themselves to know about gene therapy. It also leads to the next question of the different factors to consider when making a choice about gene therapy. From the graph below, Singapore and Indonesia showed similar trends where there is a bulk in the middle. Most of the people in these two countries perceive themselves to have some degree of confidence when they need to make a decision on gene therapy. Whereas for people in China, there is no obvious peak or valley, suggesting an equal distribution.

Q5 site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove restriction site EcoRI from the pKD4 plasmid  available in the lab for Lambda red recombination. The primers ordered for the Q5 kit were resuspended according  to the protocol and then diluted to achieve 10μM concentration. The template pKD4 plasmid DNA was also diluted as only   10ng were required for the entire reaction. The Q5 protocol was followed as a two step PCR reaction.  Extension was run for 105 secs (3 x 30sec per kbp as pKD4 is 3267 bp, add 15 sec for extra time)   Transformed Q5 PCR products into DH5α E. coli.

Our first Q5 site-directed mutagenesis attempt was unsuccessful  yesterday and so we carried out the procedure again using a three step PCR reaction by changing round  3 to 70&#8451 for annealing. An 0.8 % agarose gel was made to check that the PCR product was inclusive of the correct size  pKD4 3267 bp plasmid.
Also today the Qubit was used to quantify the concentration of mini prep DNA.  Jack spent today carrying out a biobrick digestion and ligation reaction to join the resuspended parts from the registry.  We are following a multi step process in which the first digestion and ligation is used to ligate the promoter and RBS   as one part and the KillerRed protein coding region with the terminator as a second part. These two initial parts must   then be ligated to form the entire promoter, RBS, coding region and terminator sequence. Today's work involved the initial  digestion and ligation using a tetr"

We analyzed the odor of some volunteers before and after watching     a clip and a movie that showed a specific emotion –fear, love,     sadness, happiness. It was the first time they ever watched the     movie.
Before the clip, we showed a white screen during 30 seconds.     Volunteers were asked to relax and empty their minds. After the     clip, we showed a nature documentary (as it is supposed to set     us in a neutral mood state). Before the movie, a white screen was     shown again during 30 seconds.
Other volunteers smelled the samples and answered: How pleasant is the smell? (0 the least – 5 the most) How strong is the smell? (0 the least – 5 the most)
Results: Happy movie : Two people were asked to watch ‘Liar, Liar’. Results     are not very conclusive. The volunteers told us the movie was not     specially happy or funny.
Romantic movie : One person was asked to watch ‘ Love actually’.     After the movie, the smell is perceived as less strong and less     pleasant.
Sad movie : One volunteer watched ‘My sister’s keeper’. The smell     after the movie is perceived as stronger and less pleasant.
Horror movie : This is the smell of one volunteer, tested by three     different people. After the movie ‘The silence of the lambs’, they     all rated the body odor as less pleasant and stronger.
We repeated the experiment with another volunteer, and asked     two people to rate the smell. We had the same results. One person     rated the sample over the scale (6) for the question ‘How strong is     the smell?’ .

At the summit, we were able to communicate our vision for how synthetic biology can solve everyday problems and how we were using synthetic biology to improve diagnostics with over 300 people.
Reflection: We learned in this process that the most effective way to engage this population was almost exclusively through one-on-one dialogue with interested individuals. Though our poster and slideshow generated some interest, our best conversations and interactions came when the people we talked to had our individual attention, and had time to ask pertinent questions and become acquainted with our project at their own pace. This was also the most effective space in which to communicate the real world impact that we hope our product could have. It was far easier to relate our project science with our project goals verbally. In light of this, we focused more on one-on-one interactions when we had other opportunities to present to highly-educated non-experts."

A chance for academics to regain a sense of wonder and joy at science: a Biohacking space provides the ability to do science “just for the fun and excitement of it”, without looming deadlines and grants.  It has even been suggested that some academics might have ideas they don’t want to work on within the university, as they might lose a large part of ownership of their project. This way, Biohacking labs might unearth some innovative ideas.
Development of low cost equipment and protocols.
We also had the chance to witness the first day of a new program at the CRI (Center for Interdisciplinary Research) in Paris, during which new undergraduate students are taught DIY and Hacking methods. The aim of their first week was to build three biomedical devices from scratch in teams of two. The instructor Tamara Milosevic described multiple advantages for the students, such as transferrable generic skills and a deeper knowledge of the working principles. The CRI instructors also give students better marks for collaborations.

Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get
Solve this set of equation, where C1, C2 is determined by the initial condition of the system.
Therefore, any system with specific initial condition could be settled. If we clear t out of the set of equation, we get the functions of the curves in the graph above.
Now consider what have been put aside in previous discussion.
Conc and Conb have their definition domains, let them respectively be [0,ConcMax]and [0,ConbMax]. This gives a limit to the possible state the systems can evolve. In other word, it limits the system inside a square frame.
As is supported by the experimental data, at the beginning stage of experiment with high environmental ammonium concentration, the gene circuit remains closed. Thus, we can consider Conc is small at this stage. The initial point of the system falls above L1.
From the graph, we can easily find the system confines Conc at a low level at the beginning stage of experiment. This explained why there is no GFP produced at the beginning of experiment.
On the other side, parameters x0, y0 cause the whole system to perform a spatial translation. In any timepoint, x0, y0 give the velocity of the motion. According to y0’s definition, the translation in Conb direction at any time always equals y0 multiplies the change of PII by that time. y0 is negative and significantly bigger than x0.
As the experiment proceeds, the environmental ammonium concentration decreases and the concentration of PII decreases together. The phase flow graph of our system gradually rises up and conduct a constant small translation in Conb direction. There is a special time when the concentration of PII reaches a threshold that the point of our system falls below L1 and L2. Therefore, the system evolves to maximize the Conc. That is when the promoter begins to function and this is the delay time we used as signal in our project.
After that point, the graph keeps rising, the Conc consequently keeps increasing. Thus, the promoter strength keeps increases over time and the reaction goes on for certain time.
In a nutshell, we simplify the gene circuits as a TCS and furtherly construct a differential equation describing the evolving law of this system. To solve this equation, we apply methods from studies of dynamic system. From detailed analysis, we prove that the delay time is a principally reasonable characteristic signal for this reaction. With experimental data supported, the delay time could be used as a special mark for both the promoter and the environmental"

Inoculated new cultures (pPickUp2) in petri dishes with FTO glass slides for biofilm growth

New digest of minipreps from 09-16-2016
Gel: Tried another tube with NEB 2-log DNA ladder (left side of gel, right side: same one as before)
Correct Band sizes still CsgA-ZnO constructs may be positive.
Mineralization experiment failed; No adhesion of ZnO-biofilm to glass slide
09-28-2016
Gel test, linearized pQE-9, pSB1C3, gBlock CsgA-ZnO, gblock CsgA-ZnS
Bands have wrong sizes again. However, there is a second, fainter ladder visible, which appears to indicate the correct sizes.
Something is wrong with the ladder in our setup. Maybe due to adding gel stain prior to casting the gel?
09-29-2016
New test: ran two gels, one stained precast, one unstained
Stained: wrong sizes, unstained, correct sizes → earlier fragments were likely correct
Ligation: CsgA-Zno and CsgA-ZnS with pQE-9 and pSB1C3 overnight at 4 °C
Made solar cells from biofilms with TiO2 nanoparticles, sintered 4 minutes with Bunsen burner,
measured with sunlight and UV transilluminator → detectable current/voltage in both cases
