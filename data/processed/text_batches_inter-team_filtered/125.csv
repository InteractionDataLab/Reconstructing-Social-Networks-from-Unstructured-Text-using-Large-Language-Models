iGEM teams are leading in the area of Human Practices because they conduct their projects within a social/environmental context, to better understand issues that might influence the design and use of their technologies.
Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest.
For more information, please see the Human Practices Hub .

Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.

Heidelberg,2014,Team:Heidelberg#pages#Human Practice#igemathome_-_-_TEXT.html," information like status updates or information on the biological projects can be communicated to the community via the 'News' and 'Science' sections of the forum. In addition the users can give elaborate feedback on problems arising from the client site. Finally user forums are an integral component to the BOINC distributed computing community and are widely used to present user achievments such as the number of projects supported, computational time spent to projects, BOINC points rewarded for computing and also to compare the stats of different projects projects . Forum users are provided with a personal profile that displays memberships in BOINC teams, points earned for computing and the possibility to contact other users via private text messages.
Screen Saver: Communication Channel for Synthetic Biology
The second pillar of our communicational concept is a browser page that feeds content to the screensaver implemented into BOINC. We decided to post different types of content: (1) General information about (synthetic) biology, (2) general facts about the iGEM competition, (3) presentations of iGEM team projects, (4) announcements of special events that are open to public organised by iGEM (Human Practices) teams.  We started with a small series of 'Did you know ...?' pages, presented the project of iGEM team Heidelberg 2013 and contacted other iGEM teams to offer the opportunity to present content to a growing community of iGEM supporters. In order to test the capabilities of iGEM@home as a communication channel, we announced our own events via the channel. A final test will be carried out after wiki freeze by announcing an event exclusively via the screensaver (see a short description in the 'Outlook' section at the end of this text). Last not least we can announce that we received content from two cooperating iGEM teams that we proudly present in our screensaver: Team Marburg sent a flyer for their 'iGEM Quiz Marburg' and the Berlin team sent in a text and figures on their project on 'Magnetic E.coli'.
Some example pages of the iGEM@home screensaver:

Practices
We consulted Prof. Li Yang on intellectual property issues. Prof. Li was from School of Law, Sun Yat-sen University, researching laws of intellectual property. We introduced the specifics of the literature citation to Prof. Li. He carefully helped us understand the citation terms and conditions, and explained how the paper license works. With his help, we make sure that we’re approval to use every paper and every iGEM project in our database.
Figure 7: Photo with Prof. Li Yang. Thanks for giving advice on intellectual property issues.
Inspirations on our project
The awareness of intellectual property is very critical for us, especially when we design an open website to share others’ papers and other achievements.
Gold
When designing the project we have come up with many fine details for the software. Some came from our original ideas, others came from professionals in different fields. (See Silver )
We tried hard to put these inspirational details into the application of our software ""S-Din"". We tried to make more positive contributions to scientific and societal practices, and reduce and even eliminate the potential negative impacts.
Integrated database
Inspirations we have learned
By communicating with other iGEM teams, and chatting with different bio-lovers, we realized that fragmented data costs a lot of time and energy. We hope to establish such a database in S-Din, in a standard and easy-to-understand format. It will save one's time, which enables one to focus on his project ideas.
Integrated into the project
In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format for different types of data: parts, projects, keywords, and papers. Based on this format, our database is integrated into a unity, and accessible to set up interaction network and analysis. The S-Din search engine and S-Din Design are both working under this standard.
Figure 8: 20 standard parts in S-Din.
Figure 9: Each genetic design uses standard parts and interaction lines.
Figure 10: According to the standard data format, users can add their new parts to S-Din's database.
The Tree of Words & Network Analysis
Inspirations we have learned:
We interviewed several lab researchers and found that how to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, but several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software.

Leaves that had been infiltrated with A. tumefaciens strains containing our assembled binary constructs were images using an SP5 Leica confocal microscope (Figure 2). We used two channels: the first excites chlorophyll, which is shown in red and the second excites the fluorescent fusion protein (shown in yellow).
Figure 2: Constructs BBa_K1618029-032 contain a yellow fluorescent protein, as well as a chloroplast transit peptide. These are confocal microscopy images of the constructs infiltrated into Nicotiana benthamiana, in which the red structures are the chlorophyll within the chloroplast, and the yellow is the fluorescent fusion protein expressed from constructs (a) BBa_K1618029 (MAO enzyme), (b) BBa_K1618031 (RV3034c enzyme), (c) BBa_K1618032 (RV3037c enzyme), and (d) BBa_K1618030 (RV3030 enzyme).
Our results confirm that the putative acyltransferases  are successfully localised to the chloroplasts of the plants.
Determining if the expression of acyl-transferases interferes with starch accumulation in plants
AIM:
To compare the starch content of leaves infiltrated with A.tumefaciens strains carrying constructs expressing our putative acyltransferases.  A potential problem of using putative acyl transferases is that they will use the same C4 position of the glucose molecules that the starch synthases add new ADP-glucose units to, interfering with growth of the starch molecule. A simple test was to confirm that normal quantities of starch were being produced.
METHOD:
We transformed our binary vector constructs (see results “Making constructs to express putative acyl-transferases in plant chloroplasts” for the details of these constructs) containing the acyltransfeases with an N-terminal transit peptides into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation (see Protocols - here ). Colonies were checked by PCR before liquid cultures were grown from individual colonies for infiltration of plant leaves (see Protocols - here ).
Three plants were infiltrated with each experiment and control:- A. tumefaciens with no construct (control)      - Strains of A. tumefaciens that contained each of the four"

It’s often the incidence when E. coli contaminated meat for consumption gets coverage in news media. It is thus a challenge when conveying a complex topic to the public which demands some scientific knowledge, especially in biology and this is something our Human Practise group has been challenged with throughout the project. The risks of using E. coli and its given traits for this project are discussed further throughout the text.
GMO, Welcomed by the Public
By authoring and distributing a survey to horse owners we could see that the majority of respondents in Sweden had positive attitudes (83.2 %, 368 respondents) towards a GMO-type of diagnosis method. The survey also showed a public fear of growing anthelmintics resistance against blood worms (strongyles) (77.3% of 370 respondents ranked their fear as 4 or 5 were 5 being the most concerned).
Environmental Impact and Risk
The E. coli (BL-21, DH5-alpha) that was used in the lab has a biosafety level of 1, which is the lowest possible on a scale of 4 [7]. This means that E. coli is safe to work with in the course laboratories we were provided with by Uppsala University [8].
Nothing that is considered toxic or harmful was genetically introduced (UnaG, amilGFP) into our E.coli. However, for cultivation and selection purposes used in common synthetic biology practical work, antibiotic resistance was also introduced which presents a risk in the potential spread of antibiotic resistance (Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, Tetracycline), if these plasmids were to spread into the environment. This was avoided to a large degree by following standard lab practise with specific guidelines regarding waste disposal of GMOs.
The ability for proliferation of GMOs and organisms in general is determined by their fitness. As a rule of thumb regarding the spread of GMOs in the environment, fitness is greatly reduced for most lab strains of microorganisms since they have been modified in numerous ways to make them easy to work with. These are not adaptations that are suitable for their natural environment, giving them a negative fitness contribution [9]. Regarding the risks associated with nematodes, you can look at the separate safety form and select Uppsala from the menu.
This was the first time a team tried to see if this is an applicable solution to diagnose parasitic infections caused by nematodes in equines; it is thus a long way from a potentially finalized product. If a product would surface in the future, further risk assessments must be evaluated"

Finally, we engineered CHO cell with a GFP gene under the control of NFAT promoter to detect chronic  calcium signal). With which, we further developed tools for direct evolution of TRPC5 towarding mutants with high sensitivity to specific sound parameters. All in all, our project is well organized. Each procedure is indispensable. We not only implemented audiogenetics with synthetic biology to sense mechanical stress and sound, but only use it as a research tool for discover novel mechanical properties of Piezo1. The whole project can strongly prove the possibility of using sound wave energy as the extracellular input signal to induce intracellular downstream signal.
1. PiggyBac System Test
In order to quantitatively test the function of PiggyBac system, we did two groups of transfection using Lipofectamine® 3000. One was a group of CHO-K1 cells transfected with R-GECO, and the other group was the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac.
Fig.1 PiggyBac system test
a) Bright field image of the cells transfected with R-GECO. b) Fluorescence of the cells transfected with R-GECO. c) Bright field image of the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac. d) Fluorescence of the cells transfected with R-GECO and PiggyBac.All figures was captured by Nikon microscope (Nikon TS100) 24 hours after transfection.
Comparing the fluorescence image of R-GECO (Fig. 1b) with R-GECO + PiggyBac transfected cells (Fig. 1d), we can observe that the group with PiggyBac has more fluorescent cells. It’s proved that PiggyBac transposon system can help the insertion of R-GECO gene into CHO-K1 genomes.
2. R-GECO Function Examination
To quantitatively test the function of R-GECO, two experiments, potassium chloride (KCl) induced calcium influx and ionomycin induced calcium influx, were conducted under the live cell imaging.

Continue developing models/equations/reactions of 2 and 3 step amplification.
Presentation was given
We didn't manage to find many information on relveant constants. We decided to arrange meeting with advisers for next day to help us with the issue.
We need to look for estimates of the necessary values. It is very unlikely that we will be able to find the exact constants without performing experiments.
During the meeting, it was discovered that there is a major error in our model. Our system does not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We have to remodel using the law of Mass Action.

Δ1-19 Cre recombinase
This part contains the protein coding region for a mutant (Deletion of AA1-19) of DNA recombinase Cre and is codon optimised for yeast. Cre recombinases recognize two loxP sites ( BBa_K1680005 ) and depending on their orientation cuts out or reverses the DNA sequence between them. The first 19 amino acids were removed because these amino acids are most likely very flexible, because they could not be crystallized when the structure was determined (RCSB: 3MGV ). The part is supplied in RFC25.
Due to time constraints and failed attempts at cloning our Cre reporter into a vector for cotransfection with this part, we were not able to characterise this part.

Lund,2017,Team:Lund#Design#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"BD is that somewhat equidistantly split proteins have generally shown either high levels of aggregation or high background noise [30].
To alleviate the host of constant expression of the heterologous proteins, both nahR and the GFP10- hER-α LBD-GFP11 were put downstream lac o with the lac repressor lacI constitutively expressed. Thus, the system remains repressed until addition of a ligand inducing an allosteric shift and subsequent disassociation of the repressor [42]. The final system model can be found in fig. 6.
Design of fusion protein linkers
The choice of linkers was evaluated using the open-source software PyMOL. Crystal structures of the human estrogen receptor alpha were acquired at the NCBI gene bank [43] [44]. The sequence of ligand-free hER-α LBD and antagonist-hER-α LBD complex were analyzed and the distance between the two termini was measured using the PyMOL wizard tool. The former measured a total distance of approximately 38 Å with clear steric hindrance while the latter approximately 21 Å with limited to no steric hindrance. Thus, only linkers longer than 11 Å were considered adequate candidates. Ultimately, glycine-serine linkers were chosen due to their flexibility, which was needed for mobility of the two GFP fragments [45] [46]. Two different linker sizes were picked, corresponding to 6 a.a and 12 a.a respectively.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Chile_-_-_TEXT.html," bioprocessing. An interesting area of development of biotechnology in Chile has been the biomining where bacteria are used to dissolve metals such as copper from low-grade deposits, amicably and cost to the environment. I heard that 9% of the copper produced in Chile comes from biomining. This highlights the efforts by BHP Billiton-BioSigma and companies, which together invested more than $ 20 million in this area in Chile.
In addition to these investments, there is research in Chile that shows funding of 60 million Chilean pesos in biotechnology projects by another program called:Program enhancement of university-VIU linking university research with business needs. Chile has other programs of common purpose as those presented above CONICYT (National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research) and INNOVA Chile Association, which created a covenant to act in the promotion, development, management and financing of strategic projects in biotechnology.
REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Chile has specific legislation regarding biosafety rules to regulate the use of genetic engineering as a tool in the context of different biotechnological CTNBio of Brazil. Once the country is only allowed to cultivation of transgenic export , there was a need to regulate an unstable field of transgenic and GMOs. The legislation signed by Chile is the Cartagena Protocol that was part of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 1992, which contained three related to GMOs devices, one of them was the Cartagena Protocol. This was ensured that any use of genetic engineering of organisms for purposes of modification, will have to consider the prevention of biotech or biotech security risks, depending on the goal and also address the labeling of modified products, the declaration of areas free of GMOs, the   act of creating environmental impact studies etc.
This protocol is only modified organisms and is not specific about the biosafety.The situation ends up being the subject of debates today,because ecologists and environmentalists claim and propagate situations in the country with unconstitutional acts , not the putting into practice. As an example, there are some initiatives by Chilean organizations creating events like ""I DO NOT want GMOs in Chile."" The campaign involves the use of seeds that cannot be marketed by traditional farmers, but by foreign companies, in addition, the campaign seeks to block the adoption of a Law on Biosafety, as to claim that the same will be approved the production and marketing of transgenics in Chile.

Project Abstract
Microbes such as Escherichia coli and Cuprivadis metallidurans have an endogenous multicomponent mercury (Hg2+) uptake and reduction operon, under the control of a metal responsive transcription factor, MerR.  By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering"
Paris,2009,Team:Paris#Production modeling2_-_-_TEXT.html,"   Thus, in what follows, we decomposed the original main question in three parts:
Can we explain the formation of small blebs by differences of osmotic pressures between intra- and extra-cellular environments?
Can we explain the accumulation of Tol/Pal molecules at the basis of nascent blebs?
Can we explain vesiculation by constriction of blebs basis by accumulated Tol/Pal molecules?
Before answering these questions, we start by describing how we modeled membrane deformation and Tol/Pal diffusion.
The main features of our membrane model is that we take into account the presence of osmotic pressure differences between intra and extra cellular environments and the existence of an outer membrane intrinsic preferred curvature. The main feature of our Tol/Pal diffusion model is that we take into account that diffusion may happen on non-flat surfaces, and that the Tol/Pal complex is anchored both in the intracellular (Tol) and extracellular (Pal) membranes.  We assumed that the intracellular membrane position is fixed (pushed against the peptidoglycan layer).
Modeling membrane at steady state
The objective of this part is to discuss the existence of an intrinsic curvature of the outer membrane at steady state, and to obtain an estimate of its characteristic parameter.
Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are important constituents of the E. coli outer membrane. They possess long polycaccharide chains pointing outwards. These extracellular sugar extensions create mutual attraction forces that curb the membrane. This situation is depicted in the figure below.
From a physical point of view, the lipid bilayer behaves like a liquid at 37°c. To each membrane conformation, one can associate an energy, called the bending energy [1]. This is given by :
where E is the energy of the membrane, Kb and Kg are Bending and Gaussian moduli, Hg is the Gaussian curvature and c0 is a parameter describing the intrinsic curvature of the outer membrane at steady state (ie, minimal energy). The shape of the membrane is described locally by the principal curvature variables c1 and c2 (see here for details). dS is an infinitesimal surface element.
Under simple assumptions on the shape of E. coli (seen as a cylinder) and assuming that on average the size of the vesicles is the one requiring a minimum of energy, we can using the above relation relate the radius of E. coli r, the mean radius of vesicles r', and the γ0 parameter:
Using r= 300 nm and r’=100 nm (the vesicle size ranges from 25 nm to "

Bologna,2008,Team:Bologna#UV radiation#_-_-_TEXT.html," Ultraviolet treshold limited value figure 5: Permissible ultraviolet exposure these effects.The UV source that have been used in this project is a GW6 Sylvania, a lamp that emitt UVC at 253,7nm near the absorption's peak of DNA with an optical output power of 1,6W; to use it safely we built a box of mdf(medium density-fibreboard) that surrounds the lamp and using a diaphragm that allows passage only to the light absorbing the remainder. Moreover we insert in that box two pierced brackets, those permits to choose the distance between the lamp and the sample and then in accord with the Lambert-Beer law's the exposure time.
mdf box structure
Finally we embedded this structure in a polistyrene box for its handling and greater safety.(figure 6)
Gel matrix
Our project use UV light for its space selectivity, that gives the possibility to irradiate a target zone without interfering with the other. To do that we build a mold to make a matrix of agarose gel;this give us a square of 25mm side's with 16 cells inside where we can locate bacteria.
Once do that is easy with an optical mask, like those used in photolithography for electronics circuits, stimulate only the selected bacteria.To realize this device we use palsticard because it is very easy to shape and clean. The mold is made of two parts that will form a sandwich with the slide: one will create the shape  of the gel matrix the other is a cover that that will give the picture into gel .
The matrix is obtained through the pressure of the cover part over the mold part
and that is the result:
Protocol used for UV induction
The plasmid with our construct has been transformed in DH5alfa bacteria by standard protocol and one colony from the plate has been picked and cultured overnight in  5ml LB medium broth with ampicilline.
The day after the culture  has been diluted in 5ml LB and antibiotic in order to have 0.1 starting OD bacteria culture and let it grown for one hour; after that the culture has been divided in five falcons with 1ml of bacteria, ready to be induced.  Using 1ml of culture is a choice done in order to have a thickness as thick as possible to perform an irradiation as uniform as possible .
Tests with difference distances from the lamp with different exposition times were done in order to respect the maximum lethal UV dose of bacteria and avoid mutagenesis factors in the cell. The following table illustrates the tests setup used:

Registry/ Biobrick Tools
Our primary aim is to develop tools to make iGEM easier. We realize that three months is an incredibly short time to attempt ambitious synthetic biology projects, so we are working to code tools that will allow future iGEMers to develop their experimental plans more quickly. Our Primer Designer will take a given sequence and output the primers necessary to biobrick that part. When searching the Registry to see if your parts has been biobricked already, text searches turn out to be an inefficient way to find this information. Instead, perhaps you could use our BLAST Tool to search based on your parts' sequence instead of the arbitrary name humanity has given it.
Deinococcus Genome Sequencing
Our wetlab partner team's goal is to discover novel responses to radiation resistance in bacteria by cloning a lot of genes and testing them. We aim to aid that effort by sequencing the genomes of species of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus genus and to identify genes that may be responsible for increased protection against superoxide radicals and ionizing radiation. This is a pretty ambitious goal, but thanks to a large donation from Illumina and our location here in the Mason Lab at Weill Cornell we can make it happen.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.

dCas9 and β-lactamase
The sequences for the dCas9-lactamase were too large to be synthesized in one piece.
We therefore received them as separate g-blocks that had to be fused together before we could start expressing the proteins.
Our goal was to fuse the dCas9 with either the C-terminal or N-terminal part of the split β-lactamase.
Fusing dCas9-β-lactamase parts
Perform a three-part Gibson assembly with pSB1C3 vector (submission vector), the two dCas9 g-blocks, one already linked to a split-β-lactamase.
Transform the assembly into competent DH5α cells, and let grow overnight to observe colonies.
After colonies are observed, make a gridplate with several of the colonies, followed by making overnight cultures from the gridplate colonies.
Miniprep the overnight cultures to extract the DNA, and send the DNA for sequencing.
Expressing and purifying dCas9-β-lactamase
After obtaining colonies with the right DNA sequence, clone the DNA into the pBAD vector (expression vector) using two-part Gibson assembly.
Transform the assembly into competent DH5α cells, and let grow overnight to observe colonies.
After colonies are observed, make a gridplate with several of the colonies, perform colony-PCR, followed by making overnight cultures from the gridplate colonies.
Miniprep the overnight cultures to extract the DNA, and send the DNA for sequencing.
After confirming which colonies have the right DNA sequence, insert the expression vector into a bacterial strain suitable for expression, like BL21, using the transformation protocol.
Make overnight cultures for subsequent small-scale protein expression.
Separate the cell fractions using an SDS gel.
Check protein expression with a Western blot using relevant detection antibodies or conjugates.
Run affinity chromatography of the different fractions using the His-tag, collect the fractions into Eppendorf tubes.
Run the fractions containing your protein of interest on an SDS gel.

Oxford,2015,Team:Oxford#Blog_-_-_TEXT.html," destroying bacterial biofilms released for clinical use.
Inspired by how UTIs, both their own clinical significance and with respect to the bigger picture of modern antibiotic resistance, and with bacterial biofilms as a tangible, well-characterised target in mind, our team has decided to pursue the creation of a synthetic biological system that can detect the presence of bacterial biofilms and subsequently destroy both the biofilms and the offending bacteria. To achieve that aim, our system would have to be able to perform the following tasks autonomously:
Identify the occurrence of biofilm production and other virulent behaviour by pathogenic bacteria through the detection of signals that they use to communicate
Release biofilm-degrading proteins into the infected environment to break down the biofilm
Release antimicrobial proteins into the infected environment to specifically kill bacteria without the use of antibiotics.
Enzymatic degradation of biofilms, especially the E. coli biofilms which we are interested in is a subject that has been extensively researched on, and various iGEM teams in past years have taken on projects related to biofilm degradation (eg Groningen 2014, Indonesia 2014, Lyon-INSA 2012, UBC 2010). Most studies however involved the lysis of the enzyme-synthesizing bacterial chassis after the synthetic biological production of biofilm-degrading enzymes, either for the isolation and purification of said enzymes or for direct one-off release of enzymes into the extracellular environment for therapeutic purposes.
Our team is interested in not only a one-off pathogen-responsive antibiofilm/antimicrobial-releasing system as described above, but also a design with an enzyme secretion system that can exert its antibiofilm/antimicrobial effect without killing the chassis cell. This design would be especially useful in prophylactic applications, whereby these engineered antibiofilm bacteria can, for example, be immobilised on the surface of medical catheters or implants where the formation of biofilms are highly undesirable and autonomously secrete enzymes that destroy the pathogens' protective biofilms as well as the pathogenic bacteria themselves.
We will house our designed antibiofilm/antimicrobial system within E. coli K12, which is an extensively-studied, safe-to-use standard model organism widely adopted in both microbial genetic research as well as industrial applications. To achieve the design aims outlined above, we will need to functionalize our K12 with the following biological components:
Promoters that can trigger protein synthesis in response to the quorum sensors of pathogenic bacteria. In our case, we are targeting pathogenic P. aeruginosa and E. coli.

(2) Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy uses high-energy electromagnetic radiation to act on life, changing the structures of biomolecules to achieve the aim of destroying cancer cells which are sensitive to radioactive rays.  The radioactive rays applied in clinical treatment are X-ray and γ-ray.  Future researches focus on exploring and applying new radioactive sources, accurate location of irradiation site, treatment plans and enhancing sensitivity towards radioactive rays.
(3) Surgery: including radical operations, palliative operations, and exploratory operations sharing one purpose of eliminating tumor tissues completely.
There are no breakthroughs in cancer surgery.  The main obstacles are lack of accurate detection method for the range of tumor invasion and the explanation for different reactions of immune system. Though surgical techniques have been greatly developed, the trend for surgery is to narrow the extent of operations to ensure the completeness of organ functions.
(4) Immunotherapy
There is one certain effective immunotherapy at present, with local injection of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) to cure melanoma.  Transfer factors and immune ribonucleic acid (iRNA) have certain curative effects as well.  Some new immune drugs have yet to be identified and product standardized.
2. Bacteria therapy
Nowadays there are three major problems in the tumor therapy, which are inadequate tissue penetration, low tumor targeting and limited toxicity to all cancer cells. These drawbacks prevent effectual treatments and are associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. However, bacteria can carry out the ideal functions to overcome these limitations. Therefore the bacteria therapy has several advantages superior to common chemotherapy.1
1)It's self-propulsion and can penetrate into tumor regions that are inaccessible to passive therapies.
2)The bacteria are able to sense the local environment and make decision about when and where to release the drugs.
3)When the bacteria carry the reporter gene, they can be easily detected and can provide information about the state of tumors and the effects of the treatment.
4)Anaerobic bacteria can highly colonize the hypoxic areas of tumors, invading the tumor cells.  The invading bacteria can reproduce unlimitedly escaping from immune cells. 2
5)These bacteria can not only inhibit the growth of tumor tissues through parasitism in tumor cells, but also secrete natural toxin to kill surrounding cancer cells.
6)Bacteria have large genome and can carry multiple exogenous genes.  Researchers can also modify bacteria with gene engineering and synthetic biology techniques to improve their lethality upon tumor cells. 3,4

Therefore, considering the site responsible for the protein to fluoresce is known, this chromogenic site alone may be readily altered to accommodate differently coloured proteins. Using Quikchange PCR mutagenesis a blue fluorescent protein should be formed from our experiments by simply changing an existing fluorescent Biobrick. PCR mutagenesis is a method for generating sequence-dependent changes into DNA.  This method can generate mutations based on substitutions, insertions and deletions and simply involves a PCR reaction using a plasmid vector as the template and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers of ~20-40 nucleotides containing the desired mutation with each complementary to the opposite strands of the vector (except for the mismatch at the desired mutation site), with both primers overlapping at this exact point.
Because genomic DNA is methylated, the parent plasmid that is being changed and mutant colour can be resolved since the PCR mutant product will not have methylated DNA, hence digestion with the restriction enzyme Dpn I will remove the template DNA (as it cuts only methylated DNA), leaving the mutated DNA for transformation. Plasmid can therefore be grown, purified and secondarily transformed into a protein expression strain and mutagenesis rapidly screened by fluorescent behaviour.
The fluorescent proteins will be expressed initially in E.coli as it ensures the GFP expresses well and there is a relatively simple translation from E.coli cells to an E.coli-based cell-free chassis. This system of mutagenesis uses defined and simple PCR conditions, simple protocols and rapid steps to “cut to the chase” of producing a new Biobrick with minimal efforts. Essentially it allows us to rapidly perform the PCR-mutagenesis reaction and template digestion which can be directly used in the subsequent transformations and protein synthesis of the blue fluorescent protein.
Once it has been tested for function in E.coli, plasmid will be introduced into the analogous E.coli cell free chassis to ensure that everything is working. In the following experiments, an E.coli cell free chassis and a Wheat germ cell free chassis will be used. A cell free chassis is used in the study of biological reactions that occur within the cell without the complex interactions found in the whole cell; hence a cell free expression involves a coupled transcription translation system that is minimal to the production of the desired protein from the genetic circuit. The wheat germ expression is the ultimate end-point as it is analogous to plant waste material which could be used as a viable chassis for expression. The Wheat germ system is also a GRAS system (generally regarded as safe) and due to ethical reasons – especially"

Program Design
BioMORTAR is web-based, and can be found linked to by our iGEM wiki page. BioMORTAR uses different coding languages to perform different functions more efficiently. IMPtools and the plasmid designer are coded in Python since the language is so versatile, whereas the cell modeling part of BioMORTAR is coded in MATLAB since COBRA provides many of the tools necessary to model cell performance. The user interface for all of BioMORTAR is programmed in Django, a high level Python web framework that allows for a simple user interface, in our case, and a simple setup for hosting the program on our server. The server is owned and operated by the UIUC iGEM team, and it currently runs from its location at the University of Illinois.

Minipreparation of plasmids
Purpose: Minipreparation (miniprep) is done in a laboratory setting in order to extract a plasmid from bacteria. There are several different scales of executing this task, but miniprep is the smallest. The steps of the miniprep are to weaken the cell wall, lyse the cell, precipitate out the lipids and proteins, remove of any chromosomal DNA or RNA that is still present, and then wash the plasmid to make sure that all salts are removed so that only the plasmid remains. This process uses a binding column that is comprised of a silica matrix in order to bind the plasmid DNA so that any other remaining cell fragments can be washed away. This procedure follows the E.Z.N.A. plasmid DNA Mini Kit 1 from the Omega Bio-Tek company.
Vacuum Procedure:
1. A culture was inoculated and grown overnight in a shaker at 37C at 300 rpm.
2.  The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute at room temperature
3. The culture median was decanted being careful not to discard any of the cell pellet.
4.  250 µL of Solution I was added and mixed thoroughly and resuspend the pellet. *Note: Solution I is used in order to weaken the cell wall.
5. After the pellet has been resuspended, the contents were added to a microcentrifuge tube.
6. 250 µL of Solution II was added and the microcentrifuge was gently inverted until a clear lysate formed. *Note: Solution II is used in order to lyse the cell wall. Vigorous mixing was avoided to prevent DNA shearing.
7. 350 µL of Solution III was added to the microcentrifuge tube and then it was inverted several times until a white precipitate forms. *Note: Solution III is used to bind all of the proteins and lipids from the cell so that they can be removed.

lacI Dosage & IPTG Induction
In NEON system, luxR/AHL complex is able to activate lacI expression on Safety Catch and inhibit gRNA transcription and relief CRISPRi on the positive feedback loop. Therefore the concentration of lacI directly influences the stringency of NEON system. During pilot studies we found that high level of lacI expression severely decreased IPTG induction efficiency. Therefore we used Anderson promoter J23100, J23110 and J23114 to design three constitutive lacI generator of different intensities. The three lacI generators were ligated with Ptac driven reporter sfGFP to make three IPTG induction devices BBa_K2558203 , BBa_K2558204 , BBa_K2558205 . By measuring sfGFP fluorescence we tested how these devices react to IPTG.
Figure.3. Design of IPTG induced CRISPRi test circuit.
IPTG Induced CRISPRi
After we clarified the correlation between lacI dosage and its induction efficiency, we furthered the exper-iments by adding CRISPRi to the system. Instead of sfGFP, the three IPTG induction devices with three lev-els of lacI generators are now going to produce a gRNA that targets the promoter of a constitutive sfGFP generator BBa_K2558206 , BBa_K2558207 , BBa_K2558208 . By adding IPTG, we can induce the transcription of gRNA. Binding with constantly expressed dCas9, gRNA is going to inhibit the expression of sfGFP. We were able to observe how this process proceeded un-der different levels of lacI expression.

Overview
Models
Simulations
Assumptions
The protein cI is constitutively expressed by the strong promoter J23114.
Restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI
At higher temperatures, DpnII and TaqI will not undergo conformation changes or undergo denaturation. Therefore, they will work at optimal levels from 28°C to 42°C.
No saturation of enzyme restriction sites will occur. Restriction enzyme concentration will always be in access of the substrate.
Cell growth
Assume that cell growth prior killing by thermoinduction is not constrained by availability of resources. (This correlates to the classic assumptions for exponential phase)
Cell death
We assume that the rate of cell death is a function of restriction enzyme concentration at the time. Ie, the system has no memory.
More precisely, we assume that each cell has a constant probability of dying due to the action of the restriction enzymes in any unit of time.
It is this probability of dying that is modelled as is a function of the internal concentration of restriction enzymes only.
A hill function is often chosen because initially, there is very little killing with the increase of temperatures. Then, when threshold temperature is reached, killing is expected to be the dominating feature.
Predictions
If the temperatures are below threshold, little restriction enzymes are being produced; hence population of live cells will increase exponentially. (Cell growth is not constrained by resources such as food and space.)
If the temperatures are above threshold, the population growth of live cells will be constrained by the concentration of restriction enzyme.
Initially, cells will grow exponentially as the restriction enzymes take time to be produced. When enough restriction enzymes are being produced, cell death will begin, and an exponential decrease in cell population will be observed.
When we increase the temperature, we produce more restriction enzymes at a faster rate. Hence, at higher temperatures, the exponential decrease in live cell numbers will occur earlier. Furthermore, the maximum live cell population at a given temperature will also be lower with increasing temperatures, because a greater concentration of restriction enzyme means more cell death in the same amount of time.
If the lambda cI promoter is strong, there will be a higher rate of cell death than cell growth; we will see a decrease in live cell population. However, if lambda cI promoter is weak, there might not be enough killing, so we will only see a reduction in growth of cell population,"

Added BioBrick parts and devices
One of the ideals of iGEM is the vision of a large registry, where all imaginable DNA sequences usable for a synthetic microbiologist can be found in easy-to-use standardized parts. During our project, we have added 4 new basic parts and 13 devices to this registry. Dig deeper to explore the different bricks and submitted parts.
A different wiki
One of our stated goals during this year’s iGEM competition was to invent a novel and intuitive approach to the iGEM wiki. We hope to reach a wide and varied audience and our wiki is part of that effort. Through a lot of hard work and great feedback, we are confident that our goal has been accomplished and that our tour is to your liking, dear reader.
Jamboree result
At the Regional Jamboree in Lyon our project achieved a Gold medal, advancement to the World Championship in Boston, and even a special award for Most Improved Registry Part.
Alongside all these achievements, we learned more about the hard work it requires to work together in large groups and received invaluable lab and life experiences.

TagCFP for analysis of elastomeric tissue
TagCFP is a monomeric protein emitting bright cyan light. It is based on the natural fluorescence of the jellyfish Aequorea macrodactyla, which expresses a GFP-like fluorescent protein. This part can be used to analyze the quality i.e. of an elastomeric tissue out of proteins connected via Catcher-Tag systems (see BBa_K2419000). While such a tissue is formed, TagCFP as a fluorescent protein can be added due to its strong fluorescent emission. As a result, the maxima of emission and absorption of the fluorescent protein shift to a higher level when excited by the specific absorption light wavelength. This shift can only be ascribed to the assembly of TagCFP to the tissue. The behavior of the emission and absorption can therefore be used as a screen of the tissue around the fluorescent protein. The tissue network can be characterized regarding its structure and density. These parameters will give information about the quality of the polymeric network.
Testing the indicational function of TagCFP in an elastomeric tissue
To test the indicational function of TagCFP we created a hydrogel resembling the elastomeric tissue. We then added TagCFP both into water and the hydrogel. The results of this test are shown in Figure 1. On the right, TagCFP fluoresces in a cyan color when added to water and excited with light. Whereas the fluorescence color changes to a light blue when excited with light while being located in the hydrogel.
Figure 1: TagCFP in water (right) and TagCFP in hydrogel (left).
These results visibly show the effect of TagCFP being added to different solutions. The change of the color from cyan in water to light blue in the hydrogel indicates a shift of the emission maximum and therefore TagCFP can be used as a qualitatively test for elastomeric tissue, while additionally, further characterization of the tissue can be achieved.   Characterization    We further characterized the TagCFP to supply a broader understanding of the properties of this fluorescent protein. We therefore measured the absorption and emission of TagCFP. The regarding graph is given below (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Fluorescence spectrum of TagCFP showing absorption and emission at variant wavelengths.
The results show a difference in the wavelength of the absorption and the emission. The absorption of TagCFP has its maximum at a wavelength of 457.4 nm and the"
TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#2017.igem.org#Team:TecMonterrey GDA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," manual for elementary school students in which we aim to get children involved with science by creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.
The manual consists of 30 experiments divided into 3 segments, according to their educational level and average age range. Each of them consists of the name of the experiment, objective, theory of the phenomenon studied, material, procedure and questions. Each section aims to ensure the understanding of the experiment and its relationship to the topics seen in class. Each experiment has its fundamentals clearly explained for all ages to which the manual is directed.
iGEM Tec GDL validated three of the 30 experiments of the Science Manual in a Public School in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The Elementary School principal, Manuel Cañedo, mentioned that he feels fortunate and pleasurable of having us in their school to participate with their students in science activities. Manuel Cañedo welcomed us and introduced us to the 5th graders; we explained them the activities, and all the children responded, participated enthusiastically and payed attention at all time, then we made other experiments in 1st and 2nd grade, in which children responded in the same way.
Teachers and students were excited because this experiments took them out of the daily school routine, they could all participate, they all had fun, but most importantly they all learned science.
In this picture we are creating a Non-Newtonian fluid with the second grader students. They are touching and feeling the difference between applying pressure to the fluid with the finger and not applying pressure at all.

Tyrosinase (produces melanin)
Nina: In the “normal“ skin melanocytes are present and secrete out melanin molecules which enter the keratocytes, resulting in color in the skin. In “vitiligo“ skin melanocytes are missing at some areas, thus no melanin production takes place at these patches that keratocytes can take up and result in skin color, instead one gets white patches. Note! Ignore albinism and piebaldism.
Nina: I scanned this picture from the book: Vitiligo Problems and solutions by Torello Lotti and Jana Hercogová. It is good in the way that is presents the relationship between keratinocytes and melanocytes. They are in close contact and have ""communicate"" with each other via molecules. In addition, it is shown here that melanocytes are like neronal cell with dendrite, from which they secrete molecules, such as melanin, to the keratinocytes. When melanocytes will be removed as in the vitiligo disease, they won't be able to secrete any necessary molecules to the keratinocytes such as melnin, which gives skin color.

Today we discussed the new Hg concentrations that we’re going to use for our biosensor and bioaccumulation for reasons discussed previously. (Any doubt, access September 1st and 5th ).
We started to do total DNA extraction from wild bacteria that present resistance to high Hg concentrations. We used the method phenol-chloroform and because it takes a really long time, we couldn’t finish today! We let DNA sample precipitating in NaCl 0,3M and Ethanol 70% to keep working on it on following days. We’re out of competent bacteria! So we need more to proceed with new bio brick’s construction. We made pre inoculum of DH5α today.

Phase I
Saffron in a Kan is focused on the modification of carotenoids to produce compounds characteristic of saffron.  The first step to doing this is optimizing the production of the carotenoid precursor, zeaxanthin, in our target species.  Below you will find our work for both Synechocystis and E. coli.
Synechocystis
To see if Synechocystis was a viable chassis organism for production of crocin and safranal we wrote a flux balance analysis model to predict theoretical yield of these two compounds. As a first step, we wanted to predict the optimal conditions for the maximum production of zeaxanthin. Below is a phenotypic phase plane for the production of zeaxanthin under varying carbon dioxide and photon fluxes. The technical detials can be found on our modeling page.
E. coli
Thankfully, Tokyo Tech developed a biobrick which contains all the enzymes necessary to produce zeaxanthin in E. coli, BBa_395704 . This is an enormous help in advancing our project, however the biobrick lacked the characterization needed for optimal production of zeaxanthin through utilization of its inducible promoters.
To this aim, we further charcterized this part for both our project and for furture teams working on a developing biobricks that depend on the synthesis of zeaxanthin in vivo.
Optimization of induction conditions
The construct that Tokyo Tech built is composed of two parts:
1. CrtZ which is needed to cleave beta-carotene into zeaxanthin.  This component is repressed in the presence of glucose and
induced in the presence of arabanose through a pbad/arac promoter.
2. All the enzymes needed to produce beta-carotene from FPP in E. coli.  Expression of these enzymes is regulated by a lacI repressed promoter, which is induced in the presence of lactose.

What is iGEM?
iGEM is an international competition in which undergraduate students engineer cells to produce unique products or gain novel properties. Students at the University of Nevada, Reno have been participating in International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition for over four years.
[Learn more about iGEM]
Projects
2009: Synthesis of cinnamaldehyde (a major component of cinnamon) as a natural pesticide. Bronze medal winners.
[Learn more about the project]
2010: Design of a non-toxic fluorescent tag that allows plants to “glow” under drought or temperature stress. Silver medal winners.

2011: Production of photosynthetic cells that “feed” biofuel producing bacteria. Gold medal winners.
[Learn more about the project]
2012: Engineering of proteins designed to bind vitamins to white rice. Gold medal winners and an invitation to the International Jamboree at MIT where their project was very well received by many teams and scientists.
[Learn more about the project]
2013: Nevada iGEM is currently designing a suite of new proteins to combat bacterial diseases in plants and humans.
What do students gain from iGEM?
The iGEM experience allows students take charge of their own research destiny. Undergraduates must learn very quickly how to run a functioning research lab. They propose their own projects and work all summer to complete their experiments. The more experienced students must train new students in laboratory procedures and protocols. The team also talks with experts in the field to sort out scientific problems and work through ethical and environmental concerns.
In the fall, students present a poster and talk to professional scientists and engineers at regional iGEM jamborees. Medals are awarded based on accomplishments, and a few teams are chosen to attend the International iGEM final competition where they compete with teams from Europe, Asia, and the Americas.  Team work, good planning, and a little luck help to shape the final project, but regardless of the competition outcome, the students who participate in iGEM have a college experience they will never forget.
Why we need your help

NYU_Abu_Dhabi,2017,Team:NYU Abu Dhabi#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," future, the NYUAD team envisions similar workshops that can reach a larger audience in the UAE.
For further details, please download our powerpoint slides and the protocols we used for both engineering and biology workshops.
NYUAD iGEM team wrote and printed Synthetic Biology 101, a magazine on synthetic biology that deals not only with an overview of synthetic biology, but also a variety of topics ranging from iGEM competition, importance of food safety, NYUAD iGEM team project in 2017, and many more. We distributed the magazine personally to people who participated in our various human practices activities. The pdf version of our magazine was also shared online.
One Saturday evening, inspired by a TED talk that he recently watched on iGEM, a student from NYU New York emailed us, How can I start my own iGEM team?. For a freshman minoring in genetics, iGEM must have seemed like Disneyland; a Jamboree of 4000 outstanding minds, representing 300 teams from five different continents, all gathered at the same place to share what they’ve accomplished in the past year. Moreover, when we hosted a high school workshop with students and teachers from Brighton College Abu Dhabi, we sensed a great interest from them in iGEM. What is the best advice we can give these potential iGEM participants?
Firstly, it should be noted that this competition is open to a diverse group of educational institutions. iGEM reunites synthetic biology enthusiasts all the way from the high school level up to graduate students and researchers. This mixture of people of varying expertise on this interdisciplinary field provides a perfect opportunity to learn from one another. A high school or an undergraduate student who is starting to learn about synthetic biology and desires to start an iGEM team should reach out to faculty or researchers who work in this field in order to obtain helpful guidance. Nonetheless, if an institution does not count with a group specifically dedicated to synthetic biology, it is still perfectly possible to participate. In this case, biology and engineering faculty can act as mentors.
Another important aspect to take into account is funding. Despite research in STEM generally requires access to costly equipment, reagents, and facilities, iGEM teams with heterogeneous access to resources have participated successfully in the competition. A concrete example of a team with scarce resources who succeeded at the Giant Jamboree is Team Sumbawagen , who did not have access to a key piece of equipment for their project, but still worked hard in order to solve a significant issue of their community. Collaboration with other teams is key to overcome problems as the"

External Support
We were able to do a lot, but not everything. The external support we received was undoubtedly an added value for the team and facilitated a lot in completing important tasks the team, our supervisors and advisors were not able to perform. Thus, the team is eternally thankful for the effort the following people put into helping the team:
Louise Dynes, for helping us from day one with the various task including outreach, team organization, fund raising, fund management and travel.
Ed Bolts lab, for providing us with dCas9 for the final stages of our lab work.
Eurofins and Source Bioscience, for helping with DNA sequencing.
Groningen iGEM Team, for accepting to collaborate with us by testing and providing results from the revival of our freeze-dried cells.
Sheffield iGEM Team, for accepting to collaborate with us by testing and providing results from the revival of our freeze-dried cells.
Valdemar Marques, for doing the 3D modelling of our key transport device.
Yazid Lakhdar, for providing support and advice on our 3D model as well as on the prices of materials.
Jason Young, for reviewing and updating our 3D model, as well as helping with the actual 3D printing.
Sarah Chapman, for providing support with freeze-drying.
Euridice Real, for helping us with the team pictures.
Words of Appreciation
The Nottingham iGEM team would like to once again give thanks to everyone who has directly or indirectly contributed towards making our project possible and easier to carry out. Our words will never be enough to show the extent of our gratefulness. Thanks a lot."

To team members. I have read all the mails and they are great. Try to develop more ideas on the environment part.
- Make a list of ideas and categorize them.
- Do not think about if they would work or not, yet. That's not brainstorming.
- If you want to be more specific, think about what parts or circuits you could use for the idea.
Have you all studied what synthetic biology is? Check out http://partsregistry.org/Catalog . It might help you out. The file included contains my suggestions about your ideas. Have a nice day everyone.

Paris,2009,Team:Paris#EthicalReportNaturalityArtificiality_-_-_TEXT.html," the intellectual goods. But, as we will see later, it will also permit to critics to use the arguments of the opensource and free software movements.
If we add, to that two upsetting point, the trends of costs and the industrialization of the material and intellectual production of the artificial living, we are risking to assimilate synthetic species to exchangeable goods and commercial products. Thus, what kind of property, non already explored, could be reach by these mechanisms? Does every constructed thing have to be understood as product? Don't you think that something like a species has to be defended from that merchandizing by our ethical approach. Can't we do as environmental ethicist with can, enlarging the people and things concerned by the “means and end” kantian maxim or by the intrinsic value?
Most of that stakes will be retaken in our next analyze about opensource but we have to wonder with caution that question of alienability and the patrimonial status of the living. We will see that opensource models will permit us to see how the living, now both natural and artificial, could be understood both as “nobody's property” and as a “common good”.
F. Conclusion
To conclude this reflexion about naturality and artificiality, I want to focus on something quite different. I wanted to reverse our perspective and make an “open” conclusion by rejecting the question “from what and who do we have to protect 'nature'?” in order to reach “from what and who is ‘nature’ protecting us?”. My aim, inherited from the social studies of science and also from gender and cultural studies, will be to put into their light how political and cultural stakes are involved in the construction of a discourse about nature. The stake of naturality will be now considered through that conceptual tradition : the living is natural.
Social parts of scientists regarded as pure decipherers of nature, reaching objectivity and formulating the universal truths they discover is at the heart of the criticism and the deconstruction of science studies. Thus, theoreticians showed the influences of political, cultural and social contexts in the production of scientific facts, practices, discourses and results. The analysis of scientific controversies was regarded by science studies as a better way to enlighten that process of construction. Many analysts showed how scientific research and debates weren’t about discoveries of a natural phenomenon, now visible to the scientist but to a construction of it. The scientist who was the “winner” of the controversy was the one whose story was written and maintained for a long time as History of science. By constructing nature (with the help of facts"

NCTU_Formosa,2013,Team:NCTU Formosa#project_-_-_TEXT.html," our first design, the device has a cuboid body and a thread top. This thread top is capable to change the light intensity, simply by changing different top with different number of LEDs.
We use corrugated paper to make a prototype of our light control device. It has one red light LED and the device is covered by several layers of black plastic bag, preventing any possibility of light leaking.
As mentioned above in the beginning, using red light as an input condition is an default environment in our project. Our ultimate goal is to regulate multiple genes as more as possible. So, in the future, by employing more different conditions, such as different lights, we would be able to regulate more genes.(one light sensor would result in controlling two more different genes) We hope that our project could eventually serve as a standardized model and set up with a standard operating procedure which offers future iGEMers to manipulate the control of multiple genes by simply changing the environmental conditions.

Gold Criterion
The team at Oxford has been working on a method of cell-free detection of Chargas disease. Specifically, they are testing for the presence of cruzipain, which is known to cleave and release the peptide hirudin from the transmembrane OmpA precursor. To measure cruzipain activity, they are using the Spytag/Spycatcher system. First, they must attach Spytag, a short peptide, onto the OmpA protein. We have assisted the team by running a CG simulation of OmpA bilayer insertion and simulation with SpyTag/SpyCatcher. This simulation, performed on the supercomputer cluster at McMaster University, provided insight into protein conformations and system stability after the OmpA+Spytag fusion protein was inserted into a model membrane.
Collaboration on this project has involved sharing of information on the proteins involved. Below are the 3D images of the two proteins involved in the simulation, OmpA and SpyTag. Furthermore, communication has been required to create the most realistic bond between OmpA and Spytag on a computer. After discussing this issue, we reached the consensus that the optimal route would be to create a harmonic artificial potential between the two proteins.
Below, we have attached the molecular dynamics simulations we ran of their chimeric protein. We showed which residues may be potentially unstable in both the Spytag and SpyCatcher proteins. The root-mean squared fluctuations (RMSF) is proportional to protein stability, and is unique to SHARCNET supercomputer clusters in Ontario, Canada. With this, we were able to offer atomistic resolution.
Oxford provided us with the code for reaction kinetics, which we implemented heavily in our modelling section."

Safety
Biosafety
Q: What risks does your project have in the laboratory stage? What actions have you taken to reduce the risks?
A: Our experiments were done at the S1 or S2 risk level, which means that the materials used in our experiments were not known to have serious negative impact on human health. Nevertheless, in order to reduce the risk to the lowest conceivable level, we also used all the necessary protections, including wearing rubber gloves and special experimental clothes. Furthermore, we always had advisors or instructors nearby so that we can call for help if anything goes wrong.
Q: Are your teammates qualified for these experiments and able to ensure their safety?
A: Yes. All the team members received trainings prior to the experiments, including background introduction and information on potential risks, and have rehearsed all standard procedures beforehand. Our advisor Xuan Wang, who is a previous iGEM participant, gave us about ten classes introducing the definitions and basic procedures of biological engineering, the normal steps and schedule of the iGEM competition, previous teams’ designs and outcomes, and a brief background on the ideas about our project. During all the experiments he was always accessible to ask about experimental steps, for suggestions, or for help. Before the first time we did each experiment, he gave us notices about potential risks and things we should care about, and sometimes refreshed our knowledge of the standard steps when we made mistakes. Some of us had attended the Gene Engineering course, taught by Chuan Ni, before the iGEM competition, which includes extra basic training and rehearsing.
Safety Devices
Q: Do you think your current design is sufficient to ensure safe and ethical practice?
A: We still need some further improvements. Our current design includes inflammation detection and the reporting of results, but the bacteria left in the intestinal system or in the environment might influence the pre-existing balance. Thus, we still need to find some way to kill the engineered E. coli after the journey is finished and the results are obtained. Generally, we have two ways of solving this problem. First, DNase can be used to destroy the engineered bacteria’s genes. We are planning to use a weak promoter for the DNase gene, so that the DNase gene is expressed slowly throughout the process.  After modifying the bacteria and doing plenty of experiments, we want to keep the time until complete destruction of the bacteria’s DNA between 14 to 24 hours. Secondly"

--------------------------------------------------
To Do:
Meet with Adrian at 10 am in SFH.
Linearize parts
autoclave pipette tips and microcentrifuge tubes
--------------------------------------------------
Eletrophoresis gel: We messed up and digested the wrong part.  We did Z0279 instead on Z0507.  Z0279 is already in a yeast plasmid, while Z0507 is not.  This digest will yield nothing useful to us.
Thus, we decided to begin a restriction digest on Z0507 in order to get it into pRS306.
For Z0507, one can use 38 uL of plasmid, to yield 3.903 ug of DNA.  This would require 3.903 units of each enzyme which translates into 0.326 uL of EcoRI and 0.390 uL SpeI.  However, one can probably use 1 uL of each just to be safe.    In such a case, one will add no water.  Together with 5 uL BSA and 5 uL 10x buffer, this will yield a 50 uL reaction.  Ran the restriction digest for slightly over an hour in the incubator and then placed on heating block to denature enzymes.  Placed in fridge in preparation for work with it tomorrow or later in the week.
Running the gel: As mentioned before, since Z0279 is useless when digested with the enzymes we used, there was no point to extract it from the gel.  Also note that Z0842, when cut with EcoRI and SpeI, yields two pieces of DNA that are only about 2100 bp apiece and only 40 bp from each other.  This is impossible to separate on a gel.  Due to this oversight, we must run another restriction digest for Z0842, except this would be a triple digest that cuts a unique site only in the unwanted strand and not in the insert and also not on the desired vector for the part (pRS306).
Pre-weighed tubes for gel extraction:
{
Z0842 tube #1:
Starting weight = 1.0113g
End weight = g

Cloning
The two correlated gblocks were cloned into pDG268neo using gibson assembly and transformed into E. coli - resulting in pDG268neo_beta and pDG268_GP35. The insert of the correct sequence were verified by sequencing.
 
Figure 1. Representation of the inserted plasmid pDG268neo_recombinase. The plasmid exists with each of the recombinase proteins CDSs (Beta and GP35). They also have different RBSs since they are optimized for the CDS. The neoR cassette contains a promoter and RBS and a terminator, but sequences and positions of these features are not known.
 
These two plasmids were transformed into B. subtilis 168 using natural competence and transformants was verified using colony PCR. Resulting in the following two strains:
∆amyE::beta-neoR
∆amyE::GP35-neoR
For the construction of the remaining two strains, a DNA fragment containing the neoR cassette and the recombinase expression cassette was amplified by PCR from pDG268neo_beta and pDG268neo_GP35. This was carried out by primers with homologous tails for a mutS upstream fragment in one side and for a mutS downstream fragment in the other side. Appropriate mutS up- and downstream fragments were amplified from the B. subtilis genome, using a cPCR approach. This PCR was carried out by primers that contained tails homologous to the biobrick suffix and the biobrick prefix. The biobrick backbone was amplified from BBa_J04450, with primers that amplifies from the biobrick prefix to the biobrick suffix. Thus, the four fragments: recombinase-neoR, mutS upstream, mutS downstream and the linearized pSB1C3 could be assembled using gibson assembly into two different plasmids: pSB1C3_beta-neoR and pSB1C3_GP35-neoR, see Figure 2.

Lethbridge_HS,2015,Team:Lethbridge HS#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," allowing for the development of subdivisions. With an increase in roadways, more native flowers should be planted to show the diversity of Alberta plant life. An increase in flowers would also help the declining bee population in Alberta. The proposed cost of the seed mix would be $28 for 400 seeds per bag. Bees would not only pollinate the new flowers, but also the existing vegetation and the local crops in the surrounding area.
Introduction
The City of Lethbridge is known as one of the sunniest cities in Canada. This sunlight allows for native plant life to thrive despite the fact that Lethbridge does not receive much rain. Lethbridge has been steadily growing for the past few years allowing for many subdivisions to develop. As more roadways are created, native flowers should be planted to show how diverse the plant life in Alberta is. In addition to making our city more aesthetically pleasing, this would help to increase the bee population within our city. Currently, Alberta's bee population is in decline due to a number of factors including overwintering, poor health, and colony collapse disorder. To prevent any further harm to the bee population, trying to increase the bee population within our city would be a small way to try and help this species that we cannot live without.
Meadow Mix
The types of seeds that were included in the mix were chosen based on the following factors: cost, drought-tolerance, how high the plant would grow, how much sunlight the plant would need, how much the plant would spread, if it attract bees, if it is native to Alberta, and its ability to grow in the open. A total of eight types of seeds are to be included in this mix. Eventually, we decided on the following: Tufted Fleabane, Golden Aster, Blue Flax, Wild Bergamot, Yellow Penstemon, Slender Penstemon, Lance-Leaved Stonecrop, and Blue-Eyed Grass. The proposed cost of this mix would be approximately $28 for about 400 seeds per bag.
Project Goals
Our main goal for this project is to see more flowers be planted in the City of Lethbridge along designated roadways. If this happens, there might be an increase in the bee population within the municipality. This would increase pollination not only for the flowers being planted, but also for existing plants. This could also have a positive effect on the local agricultural industry as an increase in pollination could help some of their crops thrive.
Conclusion
If this proposal was successfully implemented Lethbridge would not only look more vibrant, but this proposal would also help a"

The need for an effective delivery system:
Once the peptides have been synthesized there is a need to make sure that only the antimicrobial peptides enter the milk,and not the medium, host organism or other proteins. Ergo,there was a necessity for a system that would selectively only allow the release of the antimicrobial peptides.
Thank you Team Groiningen!
We didn't have to look far for such a system ,as the - 2012 Groningen team had designed a system as a part of their project that suited our needs. However,we had to find an alternative to the TPX membrane they used as their outer layer as our antimicrobial peptide have a size of 1.05kDa without the glycine residues and 1.16kDa with the glycine residues. Dialysis membranes served as the best alternative for TPX as they can be constructed with a pore size of ~1kDa.The diagram below depicts the system, the outer dialysis membrane of size 1kDa and the inner PVC membrane."

Sequencing the genetic information of these phages has allowed us to construct multiple peptide suggestions that may bind to our nematodes’ surface proteins.  This would allow the biosensor to aggregate at the detection sites and create a stronger signal.
In our project, phage display has been used in a whole new way. Performing phage display on a whole organism is an unconventional and unpublished procedure. By creating a working protocol for the purpose of finding a specific binder for strongyles we have applied this Nobel-prize winning method in a new way.
Figure 4: Flowchart representing the phage display outline.
3. Reporter System
After receiving the results from either the transcriptomics or the phage display, they need to be combined with a reported to get a functioning diagnostic tool (Worm Buster).  We have adapted and troubleshot the expression of a fluorescent chromoprotein, UnaG, to be able to detect our worms in both the intestines and in feces. This would enable a relatively simple and quantitative way for ranchers to detect the worms of interest, using a cheap UV lamp, a dark room, and a camera!
In order to make this a viable reporter system, we wanted to make sure the original biobrick part was functional.  We show how we tweaked this part in order to study if it works properly so that it could be potentially used in future studies.
Figure 5: We would be able to detect the wormd in feces with this method.
4. Modeling
Optimization of the Time Between Treatments
To make sure the unnecessary use of anthelmintics is minimized we have created a model that compares regular and optimized usage of anthelmintics. When referring to the optimized use of anthelmintics, this means that the horse only receives treatment when the amount of parasites exceeds a certain threshold. Our model calculates given the initial amount of worms on the pasture and in the horse. Ideally, the information could be used with the worm buster to get a better overall result of our project. Our solution will not only be able to tell how large the treatments should be but also when they should be administered. This would guarantee the lowest amount of anthelmintics usage, and hopefully help combat the issue of growing resistance. Due to this fact, our model constitutes a large improvement on the potential implementation of our project since it directly brings us closer to our ultimate goal, which is the decrease in resistance development and the improved physical health of horses.

With this we can understand the scope of genetic engineering techniques to the mankind and should deal with things more scientifically. (The basic tests done to ensure the stability of the gene in an organism is discussed in the following questions). Talking about ‘jumping of genes’ or horizontal gene transfer from one organism to another, it is a theoretical phenomenon (observed in labs between microorganisms) which is not observed practically in crop fields.
2. How's the effect of GMOs on the environment such as soil and other flora and fauna estimated?
Some of the foreign countries have grown GM crops for years and have not been reported with any considerable harmful effects. This gives us the motivation to start with the discussion of conducting field trials to assess the long term effects in India.As part of regular approval process extent of pollen transfer, soil nutrition analysis, effect on useful bees and insects and so many other tests are performed in confined fields. Before going into analyzing the effects on soil, the crop is grown for 3-4 generations for achieving gene stability of the inserted gene in a location. Multi Location studies are done. GEAC seeks data of two levels of biosafety research trials for 3 crop season in different locations (usually 15 locations- 5 locations per crop season*3). For one location only one trial is conducted.
3. If somebody comes up with an effective new GM crop with certain benefits, they also come with unknown risks so could you please comment on the risk-benefit analysis being done to get to a conclusion before proceeding with the research?
Frequent usage of mobile phones has the potential hazard of leading to brain tumors but still it is introduced and used by almost all as the percentage of risk associated is very less. Here the benefits outweigh the risks. We analyze the risks associated with an organism by looking at things like whether it has got a foreign protein due to modification. ‘Compositional equivalence’ (compositional analysis with the non GM counterpart) is done to ensure that gene modifications  and not leading to secretion of any other hazardous proteins. Other studies like ground water pollutant level, toxicity analysis is also done to ensure safety.  We go further and approve a crop if the benefits of it outweigh the possible risks"

Figure 13: Results of Biolog® analysis of E.coli KRX with BBa_1465102 in comparison to Escherichia coli KRX wildtype. Respiratory activity is shown under influence of fumarate.
Figure 13 shows the respiratory activity of E. coli KRX with strong expressed BBa_1465102 in comparison to the E. coli KRX wildtype. As expected the wildtype shows higher activity in presence of fumarate as the fumarate reductase expressing strain. This effect is attributed to the fumarate reductase activity.
Because the Biolog® Microbial ID System is based on the activity in the electron transport chain and reduction of tetrazolium dye, direct conclusions about fumarate consumption are not possible. But there are indirect hints for fumarate reductase activity via the strong expression of BBa_1465102 . Fumarate reductase naturally gets electrons out of electron transport chain and transfer them to fumarate generating succinate, which is transported out of the cells under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions succinate dehydrogenase oxidize succinate to fumarate again. This created loop by expression of BBa_1465102 leads to lower electron transfer activity in the respiratory chain. So there are less electrons available for reduction of the extracellular tetrazolium dye compared to the E. coli KRX wildtype.
H-cell reactor
Fumarate reductase activity could be demonstrated by cultivation of E. coli KRX BBa_K1465102 in our electrobiochemical H-cell reactor . We show that expression of fumarate reductase increases the electron transfer into E. coli cells via neutral red as a mediator. Results of these cultivations are shown under construction results .
Fumarate reductase (Fum) from Actinobacillus succinogenes
Besides the fumarate reductase (Frd) from Escherichia coli we worked on the fumarate reductase (Fum) from Actinobacillus succinogenes (Fum). As published by Park et al., 1999 the fumarate reductase from A. succinogenes shows high activity accepting electrical reduced neutral red as an electron donor and so stimulates the metabolism in a electrobiochemical reactor system. So we planed to compare these two different enzymes with regard to activity accepting neutral red or bromphenol blue as alternative electron acceptors in our electrobiochemical reactor system .

Chalmers_Gothenburg,2016,Team:Chalmers Gothenburg#Description_-_-_TEXT.html,"arrowia lipolytica is one of the most used non-conventional yeasts, both in industry and research. It has the notable trait of being able to efficiently accumulate lipids, something that only a few microorganisms are capable of. The wild-type of this microorganism is able to accumulate lipids up to 10-15% of its biomass and with genetic engineering this ratio can reach over 90% [15]. Y. lipolytica is an obligate aerobic yeast with a wide substrate range, covering compounds such as alkanes and fatty acids [16]. Products from Y. lipolytica are diverse and include lipids, organic acids, proteases, and lysine. Most strains of Y. lipolytica can grow on acetate as a single carbon source, which is important for our project. Sodium acetate concentration of 0.4% is well tolerated, but higher concentrations weaken the growth rate and a concentration of 1% limits the growth [16].
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the most widely used organisms in synthetic biology today. Thus, it has already been thoroughly investigated and thus there are many molecular biology tools available for it. As a eukaryote, its post-translational modification machinery gives it potential to synthesize proteins which are not available when using prokaryotes [17]. Because of those reasons, it was a reasonable choice for our project. On top of that, there is a lot of competence on S. cerevisiae at the synthetic biology department at Chalmers (the department where the project was performed).
Promoter study
To be able to create a fine-tuned co-culture dependance between the cyanobacteria and S. cerevisiae a promoter for the glutamine production with a very specific strength is needed to avoid auxotrophy of glutamate in the S. cerevisiae [18]. A promoter study was developed as being a separate entity alongside of the project to provide aid for the choice of promoter for glutamine synthetase. In order to characterize the strength of the different promoters on BG-11 with 0.5% of acetate compared to 2% glucose we used GFP as reporter gene. The promoters characterized are shown in Table 1. The complete promoter study can be read in promoter study part of wiki.

N=3. *:p<0.05, **:p<0.01, ***:p<0.005, ****:p<0.0001.
2. Characterization of Aptamer
1. Specificity
To test if our probes are specific to their targets, we hybridized the probes with both their supposed targets and other targets. Microplate reader data shows that the aptamer-target pairs are significantly orthogonal.
Fig.2.1.1 Heatmap showing the microplate reader data from hybridizing different targets and aptamers. This shows that our aptamer-target interaction pairs are orthogonal. N=3.
Fig.2.1.2. Two-Way ANOVA of the data. It shows that signals are changed the most by Aptamer-Target Pairs.
2. Detection Limit
For our probe to detect minimal amount of viral RNA, it is necessary to investigate their limit of detection, as defined by the minimum amount of target RNA required to generate signal that is larger than its aptamer only (-ve) signal + 3 standard deviations. It can also be subjectively determined by visibility, though it might be less valid. Minimum amount of target RNA required to obtain a visually distinguishable difference between positive and negative signal was investigated by using 2 model aptamer probes, N2-694 and N9-545, as they represent a less sensitive and a noisier probe respectively. Reaction mixture was set with 2uM probe but in different concentration of target (i.e. 1.5uM, 1uM, 0.5uM, 0.2uM, 0.05uM).
Visually, for N2 probe, more than 0.2uM of target is necessary to visualize the difference, while ~0.2-0.5uM of target is required for N9 probe visualization. (See Fig 2.2.1 and 2.2.2)

Finally, we succeeded in making a unique website improving teams contacts and also helping teams find other like-minded projects to provide mutual collaborative assistance.
So far we received a lot of positive feedback about our initiative and people were really happy to learn about what everyone else was doing. One aspect contributing to this, is that is meant to give a quick and easy understanding of a project, so groups can easily get to know about a team within five minutes!

K2020003
– mutated expression system for subtilisin E in E. coli (S221Y) The BioBrick named K2020002 for the expression of subtilisin E in E. coli is the basic component of this new part. Therefore, it consists of the promoter BBa_R0010 , the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 , the leader sequence pelB BBa_J32015 , the newly created BioBrick K2020000 and the terminator BBa_B0010 like the expression system itself. The whole expression is based on the usage in E. coli, so the sequence of the subtilisin E gene from a wild type Bacillus subtilis was optimized for E. coli codon usage. The sequence was partly ordered from IDT ( BBa_K2020001 + BBa_B0010 ) and then cloned into BBa_J04500 , a protein expression backbone, which already carries the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 . Afterwards, a mutation in the active site of the enzyme was introduced by performing site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). The codon AGC of serine221 was substituted with TAC, which codes for tyrosine, so serine was exchanged against tyrosine in the catalytic triade of the enzyme. We were not able to exactly detect the expression of the modified proteases via SDS gel, so we proceeded by executing a skim milk assay on agar plates containing IPTG and the needed antibiotics. Therefore, we streaked out the cells containing the modified expression systems on these plates and incubated at 30°C for three days.

Fig.3 inhibition zone of △far1+△sst2 and △sst2+△far1+△ste2
Conclusion： Knock out the gene sst2 can eliminate the inhibition of the signal so that the strain △sst2 can amplify the signal when cultured with α factor. From the results above, the strain △far1+△sst2 didn’t stay at the phase G1, because the gene far1 knockout eliminates the growth arrest. Gene ste2 knockout makes the strain don’t response to the α factor.

Research the impacts acted by the various concentrations of α factor to the growth tendency of these strains in the liquid medium.
The research of the impacts acted by various concentration of α factor to the growth of Cen.PK2-1C, △sst2 of CEN.PK2-1C.
Plan and method
The growth tendency of engineered CEN.PK2-1C strains were determined by the initial concentrations of α factor from 0µM to15 µM. We planned to cultivate every engineered strain with these concentrations of α factor and obtain the value of OD600 of these strains at wavelengths of 600nm during cultivation measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometer which was calibrated by the YPD solution without strains.
Results and discussion
(1) With the concentration of α factor increasing, the growth of CEN.PK2-1C was inhibited more obviously.
Fig.4 growth curve of CEN.PK2-1C under different concentrations of α factor.
(2)the growth curve of △sst2 is lower than CEN.PK2-1C. It was strongly inhibited by α factor.
Fig.5 growth curve of △sst2 under different concentrations of α factor.
Conclusion：From the results above, we could see that in the α factor concentration range, the strain would be inhibited by α factor. With the increase of the concentrations of the α factor, the inhibitory effect to the growth of the strains enhanced. Obviously, knocking out the gene sst2 makes the strain respond to α factor more sensitively.
