When this regulation is interrupted (our purpose), two virulence factors will be inhibited at once and maybe even three because of the correlation between the exopolysaccharides and biofilm formation. Given the high impact that inhibiting the QS has, we chose to focus on modeling the behavior of this phenomenon in our project.  The model, for simplicity, only models the EamI expression but it assumes the trigger situation described before. The next image tries to demonstrate the autoregulation of the EamI gene a little bit more.
When a certain cell density is reached, bacteria start communicating between each other and therefore the quorum sensing is carried out. The interaction starts when a first bacteria produces its own AHLs (purple triangles), some of those will exit the cell wall and eventually will become external AHLs. When these molecules manage to enter the second cell, they meet an EamR protein (blue circle), creating an activator complex that will find a second activator complex to create a dimerized complex which will bind to the operator box of EamI. This dimer-complex is responsible for activating the expression of the EamI gene (purple rectangle), resulting in an AHL synthase (purple rhombus). Now that the cell is synthesizing its own AHLs molecules, it will continue to autoactivate itself on an on, and at the same time it will start to externalize more AHLs, repeating the activation cascade between cells.

All design and modelling work within the project was carried out by members of the team.  Implementation in the lab was also carried out wholly by members of the team, though with supervision when carrying out procedures that required the use of complicated (and expensive) equipment.
Generally team members were responsible for areas of the project as follows: -
Vincent Leonardo – Design, lab work and presentation. Vincent was responsible for maintaining our L-form bacteria throughout the project and leading characterisation of our BioBricks.  He also had a great hand in the development of our presentation, as well as designing the HBsu-xfp BioBricks.
James King – Design, modelling and presentation.  James adopted the position of one of the modellers in the team, also developing our modelling workshop.  He also had a great hand in the development of our presentation, as well as designing the HBsu-xfp BioBricks.
Yana Dem’yanenko – Modelling and lab work.  Yana spent a great deal of the project working on modelling our systems, specifically the cell shape model.  She also helped develop our modelling workshop and contributed heavily in the lab.
Matthew Law – Wiki coding, modelling and BioGame.  Matt coded the framework and templates for our wiki, as well as assisting when possible with our modelling.  He also began the development of an open source game based upon engineering a bacterium with BioBricks.

We made ampicillin agar plates and ampicillin antibiotic stock for cloning. The PCR Rescue of Lambda Red Recombinase was also gel purified.
Sam made Chloramphenicol plates for use later on.Redesigned leader sequence to be a full 60 bp, redesigned rescue primers again. Sequencing primers designed. MATLAB program updated to optimize for slow insertion time GFP. Script also created to total the insertion times of each GFP. Primers updated again as enzymes were re chosen, due to the presence of one of them in the CDS of slow insertion time GFP.

We conducted PCR Rescue to amplify the kanamycin resistance cassette (specifically the neomycin cassette, which also confers resistance to kanamycin) from pSEVA251 KanR plasmid. Two different sets of primers for kanamycin were tested, and the first set was successful - all 4 PCR's were correct. The second set of primers all failed. However, Emily had her first PCR success! Kanamycin cassette was gel purified.
Project Plan updated. Five GFPs will be ligated into pFTV separately, then dRBS will be ligated in. Data will be collected and sequencing will show which RBS was used by each colony. Cryogenic stock of cells harboring pFTV grown.

The UT Austin iGEM 2004 team applied the light sensing property of phototrophs to an E. coli. By aligning different phytochromes with the intrinsic kinase EnvZ from E. coli they revealed a way to create a two-component system consisting of a photoreceptor with an intracellular indigenous regulator system found in E. coli.

The photoreceptor from phytochrome known as Cph1 was isolated from the cyanobacteria Synechocytis PCC6803.

China (simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a sovereign state located in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a single-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party, with its seat of government in the capital city of Beijing.[12] It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). The PRC also claims the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory, which includes the island of Taiwan as Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province. These claims are controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan.[13]  Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's second-largest country by land area,[14] and either the third or fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement.[i] China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.  The history of China goes back to its ancient civilization – one of the world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2800 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several"

Figure 10 with color
We demonstrated that PPN can be expressed in E. coli by gel electrophoresis experiment.
Then, we use the same method to test the function of BBa_K2789032.
Figure 11 This picture shows phosphorus release of the experiment group.
From the picture 11, we can see obvious differences between the test group and WT. The more phosphorus in the sample, the bluer it is. Thus, the concentration P in the test group is higher than the control. However, as we measured the OD600 in the media, the result is largely due to the concentration of the bacteria instead of the ppx with ppn. The graph shows here is calculated by (C_1-C_2)/OD .C1 is the phosphorus concentration right before the induction .C2 is the phosphorus concentration right after the 16h induction. OD is the OD600 value which indicates the concentration of the bacteria. From the result, we think that the induction may be so strong that the protein produce is at a very high level which is not good for the bacteria growth. But if we compare the induced BL21 and the not induced group, we can still see a difference.
Figure 12 This picture shows the quantative result of phosphorus release.
Because of the growth of the bacteria, it is difficult to see the dramatic changes of phosphorus concentration of the medium. Thus we used the staining method - PolyP is metachromatic granules in the bacteria, which can be stained. It is possible to judge whether or not PolyP is present in the bacteria by staining to determine whether our protein is functional.
Figure 13 a. shows the staining result of wild type BL21 (blue spot in the picture shows polyP); b. shows the staining result of E.coli with PPX expressed (no polyP); c. shows the staining result of E.coli with PPN expressed (no polyP)
We use Albert stain for metachromatic granules, and PPX and PPN have the ability to release phosphorus from E. coli, respectively. It can be seen that BL21, which has not been transferred into the gene, shows a distinct blue color, indicating the presence of the heterochromatic granules; while the E. coli that was transferred to PPN and PPX, respectively, was not stained blue, demonstrating the release of phosphorus.
Conclusion: we proved that PPK,PPX,PPN both"

Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honor such ""nuggets"" of computational work.

Zeaxanthin
Zeaxanthin is a yellow carotenoid pigment, derived from the precursor ß-carotene through hydroxylation by the enzyme ”Beta-carotene hydroxylase”. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant and can be found in for example peppers, yolk and maize. [1] According to studies zeaxanthin has positive effects on both undamaged and impaired vision and it may prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye condition that could lead to blindness. (2) Furthermore studies have also indicated that zeaxanthin may have skin protective activities. [1,3]
Except for having beneficial properties the carotenoid zeaxanthin is one of the primary precursors for the production of the saffron metabolites picrocrocin, crocin and safranal. The production of saffron was inspired by the work of Washington team WashU iGEM 2012. Since the gene (CrtZ) that was used for the production of zeaxanthin was a eukaryotic version from Arabidopsis Thaliana, we decided to focus on finding a suitable gene to optimize the production of the above-mentioned metabolites. When searching for an appropriate gene we came in contact with Slovenia iGEM 2010 that had produced zeaxanthin in E.coli. The operon that was obtained contained genes that were originally from the bacteria Pantoea Anantis.

Waterloo,2010,Team:Waterloo_-_-_TEXT.html," has been working on a method which will be used in supplement to the already-existing ones for the detection of MRSA infections. It is a proof of concept for diagnosing the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in an infection site before it has had the chance to create an infection. This synthetic biology–based diagnostic method will take advantage of the quorum sensing mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus, and utilize Escherichia coli as the sensor and reporter
2.0 CURRENT METHODS USED FOR THE DETECTION OF METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Early detection and treatment of MRSA carriers, and persons with developed infections is of grave importance. A simplified grouping of the methods available to hospital staff for diagnosis of MRSA presence is presented below.
2.1 CONVENTIONAL METHODS
These methods have been around for a long time and involve basic plating and inoculation assays. They are quite labor and resources intensive. This is especially true nowadays, as a greater amount of tests needs to be completed to accommodate the increased number of potential patients involved with MRSA, either as passive carriers or as infection victims (Fang and Hedin, 2003.)
2.1.1 PLATING METHOD
This method usually involves two series of platings. The first one is inoculation onto one or both of Mannitol Salt Agar plates, and Blood Agar plates. The inoculated solid media then need to be incubated at 35°C for 24 - 48hrs and 18 - 24hrs respectively (Warren at al, 2004.) After growth is observed, one may identify S. aureus as a yellow colony on the mannitol plate, and as a cleared out zone on the Blood Agar, further confirming with Gram staining. Specific tests can be completed by streaking the resulting single colonies onto antibiotic plates for MRSA identification. This, however, takes up another 18-24hrs at the least. This method is very time consuming and potentially inappropriate for the time-dependent nature of infections. It is also highly resource intensive in its requirement for the technicians’ time, as well as the lab’s plates, agar, antibiotics, etc. Nonetheless, it presents 92.8% specificity in differentiation between various S. aureus, and 98.5% sensitivity in recognizing positive versus negative results (Warren at al, 2004.)
2.1.2 ENRICHMENT BROTH METHOD
This particular method utilizes liquid broth, which is to support the growth of MRSA or S."
TUDelft,2018,Team:TUDelft#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," with only Tn5  protein in parallel. We PCR amplified the integration products with primers that annealed to the adapter DNA and the beginning (or end) of the EPO cDNA and visualized the product on a 5% TBE native PAGE. Finally, we sequence verified the two integration products to determine the exact position of integration. Figure 11 depicts this experimental design.
Figure 11. Experimental design of fusion protein in vitro integration assay. The fusion protein loads DNA adapter. The sgRNA directs the whole fusion protein to the target site (~200th bp of the EPO cDNA) and Tn5 performs the integration. Integration of DNA splits EPO cDNA into two fragments of ~248bp and ~486bp. To visualize this fragment, PCR is performed with primer sets that will specifically amplify the integration fragment.
4. Targeted Sequencing with dxCas9-Tn5
We used Oxford Nanopore Technology as DNA sequencing platform for two reasons: no amplification of DNA required and the possibility of extremely long sequencing reads (examples show an average of > 100 kb) ( Jain et al, 2018 ). To prepare samples for sequencing, DNA molecules have to be ligated to DNA adapters containing a motor protein that will guide and control the diffusion of the molecule through each nanopore. Commercially available kits for library preparation make use of a transposase that randomly fragments DNA while adding these adapters ( Jain, Oslen, Paten and Akeson, 2016 ). We modified this step in library preparation to use our fusion protein (dxCas9-Tn5) instead, to direct this adapter integration specifically to a DNA target, as depicted in figure 12.
Figure 12. Schematic scheme of the targeted adapter integration for Nanopore Sequencing. The fusion protein Tn5-dxCas9 (A) finds and binds to a specific DNA target (with use of a sgRNA), (B) adds sequencing adapters at this specific site that (C) are ligated to a motor protein attached adapter to undergo (D) Nanopore sequencing.
We developed a model to generate suitable sgRNA sequences to catch all possible variations of gene doping, and we also designed and tested DNA adapters compatible with our fusion protein and ONT sequencing. We tested the directed integration of these sequencing adapters on EPO coding sequence DNA ( BBa_K2643004 ). Furthermore, we sequenced samples with ONT (MinION device) that simulate a gene doping scenario and developed software for data analysis to determine the use of gene doping.

Game play：Synthetic bio-Farm
Download the Game to PC
Synthetic bio-Farm is a flash game developed by us; it presents how several BioBricks can be composed by function to solve a series of problems in building a bio-farm. As we all know, IGEM has accumulated a huge pool of BioBricks, hoping that one day they can be composed to apply in numerous practical areas. However, due to the limitation of our knowledge, effective composition of these BioBricks has not been achieved. But our imagination has no restriction; we would like to achieve this goal in a vivid game, presenting the potential of synthetic biology in solving daily problems.
In the game, the player’s task is to build a bio-farm on a degraded land through which a heavy metal polluted river run. He can turn to seven Biobricks for help in order to finish the task.
The seven Biobricks and their functions are as follows:
Auxin System was designed by Imperial College London IGEM 2011 to help ordinary seeds fight degradation. It works by Implementing the Auxin system into a seed coat.
Bio-decontamination Kit was designed by PKU IGEM 2010, which can accomplish the detection and absorption of heavy metals in aquatic conveniently. In the game, player should build a little water processing workshop to get clean water. Clicking the workshop, players will enter a mini-game to gather the heavy metal icons and to win IGEM coins in a limited time.
AgrEcoli is a cheap, versatile soil fertility sensor developed by BCCS-Bristol IGEM 2010. It can help map the nutrient content of the fields and thus avoid excess fertilizer use.
SynBiological Bug Buster was designed by HKUST IGEM2009. It’s a novel yeast strain that could detect, attract and eliminate pests.
E.glowli was designed by Cambridge IGEM 2010. E.glowi can generate bright light output in a range of different colours. It can provide plants with extra light in"

BJRS_China,2018,Team:BJRS China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," iGEM2006_Berkeley), this result suggested that the more VHb expressed, the greater bacteria biomass would be gain at the platform, and that the expression strength of J23104 is not yet too strong to bring much burden to the bacteria. So in the future we are supposed to test several stronger promoter to find the best expression level of VHb.
Next we compared the growth curve of intracellular expressing VHb bacteria and surface displaying VHb bacteria(fig.8).
Figure 8 Growth curve of intracellular expressing VHb bacteria and INP drived VHb surfaced displayed bacteria.
From this result we can see that with the same expressing strength, the growth rate of INP-VHb transformed bacteria is higher than VHb intracellular expressing bacteria, which fitted our modeling result (fig.9 modeling on the exponential phase, K1 represents the gathering rate of oxygen by VHb), while the maximal bio-mass at platform is lower and had no difference with the control group. So maybe the surface display of VHb would mainly affect the growth rate of bacteria but do little to the biomass for it’s dissociation from the respiratory chain.
Figure 9 Prediction of the influence of VHb expression on the growth rate of bacteria under different gathering rate of oxygen.
However, this result is still too weak to support this conclusion, so in the future we will adjust the expression level of surface displaying VHb to see their effects on the growth curve both in the growth rate and the maximal biomass. Also, we will apply the intimin and autotransporter to this system to test the effect of VHb on the growth ability of bacteria under different surface display system.
Moreover, the difference between the growth curves was not very significant, and we thought maybe the normal condition contained enough oxygen so that the bacteria can grow well themselves. So in the future, we are supposed to optimize the experimental condition such as creating a low-oxygen content environment and so on."
Virginia,2009,Team:Virginia Commonwealth#Internal#Papers_-_-_TEXT.html," Standard promoter definition). Would we have to do something like this before we can use the RPU measurement talked about in this paper? Is that what the kit is for? Also, it is still unclear to me as to when this type of measurement is needed. - Trentay 15:01, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
I think the measurement of relative promoter strength as well as the measurement of absolute promoter strength are both useful tools in characterizing promoters.  Obviously reducing the variation in the measurement of promoter activity is important when working towards the standardization of quantifiable information.  However, it is also important to characterize the absolute strength of promoters based on environmental differences, which only an absolute measurement can accomplish. - Albergca 15:27, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

I just had a few questions: What is the Gateway system? What is ligation reaction? I’ve seen these terms a couple of times and wanted to know what they mean. - Trentay 15:45, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
The Gateway system (by Invitrogen) is a cloning method that provides a ""gateway"" into any expression system (e.g., shuttle genetic cassette from E. coli plasmid to a mammalian vector).  More information can be found here: http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cloning/Gateway-Cloning.html - GMcArthurIV 19:35, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
“…the processes of DNA design and DNA synthesis cannot be easily decoupled. Improvements in commercial DNA synthesis are needed that free the process from dependence on in vivo DNA propagation and replication.” (p.6) Have any other methods been developed since this paper was written? - Trentay 15:45, 8 June 2009 (UTC)
Synthetic biology: lessons from the history of synthetic organic chemistry
""For example, man-made materials, even at the nanoscale, are currently templated or built using directed assembly— exactly the opposite of how biological molecules create structure and function. Biological molecules are self-assembling systems that can adapt to change, show robust homeostasis, and can self-repair.""  The author makes these points in a different context, but what"

K1585210
This is the translational unit of methanol dehydrogenase 2 from Bacillus methanolicus MGA3. It is codon optimized for E. coli. The mdh catalyzes the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde.
Catalysed reaction by Mdh
Methanol + NAD → Formaldehyde + NADH + H+.
Expression verification & localization of the Mdh
The expression of the Mdh behind a T7 promoter was verified by doing a SDS-PAGE. To localize the Mdh not only whole cells were used but also the fragments of lysed cells and the respective supernatant. The expected bands were clearly visible in all samples proving the expression of the Mdh. However, the Mdh specific band had the highest intensity in the sample of the cell fragments whereas the same band was only of slight intensity in the supernatant. This indicates that the Mdh is incorporated into inclusion bodies.
Expression test of #IGEM#
A SDS-PAGE of the whole cell, the cell fragments and the lysate supernatant of the Mdh expressing BL21 Gold (#IGEM#) and the GlgC expressing BL21 Gold (#OHES#) as a negative control was run. The expected band at the weigth of the Mdh can be clearly seen in all #IGEM# samples. The according band with the strongest intensity occurs in the lane with #IGEM# fragments indicating the formation of inclusion bodies containg the Mdh.
To avoid the incorporation of the Mdh into inclusion bodies, the alternative E. coli strains SHuffle T7 Express and C43 were used. SHuffle T7 Express allows more efficient protein folding in the cytoplasm and lacks proteases whereas C43 allows the expression of toxic proteins. Additionally, cultivation at a lower temperature of 30 °C was tested. It was shown that all strains were able to grow on M9 medium, however, another test for the expression and localization of the Mdh did not reveal major differences between the strains. In every case the Mdh was still incorporated into inclusion bodies.
Functionality of the expressed Mdh
To test if the expressed Mdh is functional, we modified a colorimetric and fluorescent formaldehyde assay described by T. Nash . In the in the presence of formaldehyde the yellow and fluorescing diacetyl-dihydro lutidine is formed. In the reaction catalyzed by the M"
UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html,"100uM CuCl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.
Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.

University Team
Meeting with SYSU-Software & SYSU-China (2017)
We went to the Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) to meet with the two teams there: SYSU-China and SYSU-Software. At the beginning of the establishment of their teams, we exchanged experience in recruiting, teaming, projecting, and training. We also learned that the SYSU provided a comprehensive set of training courses to improve the experimental skills and abilities of team members It inspired us that we seek help from our university for providing such kinds of training for our team. The university offered a seris of useful safety courses and trainings for us as we mentioned in the safety section
Further Cooperation with SYSU-Software
Since the modeling of SYSU-Software strongly interested us, our team had established a long-term cooperation with SYSU-Software, made many face-to-face communications, and discussed in depth of the development trends of synthetic biology and the potential application fields. In addition, SYSU-Software was invited to our college to deliver a presentation and demonstration of the software they developed. We have leart a lot from their project and they also gave us many constructive suggestions on develoing our computer modeling.
Meeting with Peking & SCUT (2017)
Under the leadership of Haoqian Zhang, our three schools got the opportunity to meet and exchange. Yihao Zhang, the captain of PKU iGEM, showed us the growth and achievements of Peking from its establishment to the present. Chen nan, the captain of the SCUT iGEM also showed the process from prototype to formation. During the meeting, we have formed a clearer concept about iGEM and have a better understanding of the game.
Help NPU-China complete modeling (2017)
Weixu Wang, who is in charge of computer modeling in our team, helped NPU-China complete their model - Metabolic Flow Modeling in 2017.
Meeting with SUSTech_Shenzhen(2018)
Members of SUSTech_Shenzhen were invited to come to Guangzhou to discuss with us. We exchanged opinions on  each project. During the discussion, the team of the SUSTech raised potential problems that our project may encounter in the future, as well as areas that need to be improved, such as how to remove the resistance of the plasmid after genetic transformation.

Duesseldorf,2018,Team:Duesseldorf#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,"etically engineered cross-feeding system wherein we introduced two mutations in wildtype
E. coli
cells namely an auxotrophy and an over-production. We observed the formation of nanotubes in co-cultures where one partner was auxotrophic for an amino acid. We did not introduce any specific mutation that enabled the formation of nanotubes.
TD: We are working with a lysine auxotrophic system. Can you explain why Lysine, Histidine and Tryptophan are good candidates to work with ? Why are they so often in focus of studies?
Sh: Lysine, Histidine and Tryptophan are usually selected for their isolated biosynthetic pathways which allows for easy manipulation without affecting the production of other amino acids.
TD: What were the challenges you faced and what do you think could be challenges with our approach?
Sh: The first challenge of your project is to introduce the auxotrophies and amino acid production/secretion mutations in the different partners. The second would be to ensure that the produced amino acids are sufficient to support growth (Keep in that due to the fact that the partners belong to different classes their amino acid requirement levels will likely be different). The third challenge is to successfully cultivate the 3 organisms such that each partner remains stable over a time period long enough for you to study the interaction. Here you need to take into consideration differences in growth rates, nutritional requirements, ambient pH and so forth for the 3 organisms.
TD: What methods did you use to quantify your amino acid production?
Sh: I used both an indirect biosensor based approach and a chemical analysis technique (LC-MS) for quantifying amino acid production.
TD: What method would you suggest if we want  to extract amino acids from the cells?
Sh: Internal amino acid extraction requires two main steps - breaking open the cell and purifying the amino acids within. The cell wall and membrane can be disrupted either by physical techniques (sonication, heat, beads) or by chemical techniques (lysozyme). The choice of techniques is dependent on factors like equipment availability in the lab, number of samples to be purified at a given time, characteristics of the cell (i.e. cell wall thickness) and so on. The second step of purifying the amino acids from the cell extract also differs based on which amino acids are of interest (free amino acids, protein bound amino acids).         The method I used in my study was based on a physical disruption of E. coli cells using heat and sonication followed by solvent based extraction of internal free amino acids. This method is useful for extraction"

Who are we?
We are the first Illinois iGEM team, and we're very excited about that fact.  Our team has a diverse mix of backgrounds drawing students from all over campus.  The represented departments include bioengineering, physics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and molecular and cellular biology.  This broad background gives us a the ability to look at problems from many angles and come up with unique solutions.  Under the guidance of our advisers we have been working to put together a project to bring to MIT this November.  We have all thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity that iGEM has given us, and look forward to being a competitive team in the future.

When we tried to amplify our current DNA using the hisura-kan_F and ZFB-wp-hisura_R primers and the Phusion mastermix, it did not work (see 6/23).  We will try to gain more product in two ways:
1) Repeat 6/23 PCR but use KAPA mastermix
the KAPA mix may work better than the Phusion.
Used KAPA protocol with 1µL of kan-ZFB overlap as template, hisura-kan_F and ZFB-wp-hisura_R primers, 65˚C annealing temp, 90 sec elongation time
made 2 reactions
2) Repeat overlap extension PCR (see 6/16) with KAPA mastermix
used KAPA protocol with 1µL kan cassette and 1µL of ZFB-wp-hisura, 65˚C annealing temp, 90 sec elongation
10 cycles without primers; hisura-kan_F and ZFB-wp-hisura_R primers added; 15 more cycles
made 6 reactions
E gel to check reactions worked: all 6 overlap PCRs successful, but not the other two reactions.
kan-ZFB-wp-hisura construct 6/28/11
combined samples 1-3 and 4-6 and ran on 1% agarose gel for extraction
kan-ZFB-wp-hisura construct for gel extraction 6/28/11
used Qiagen gel extraction kit and instructions with the following modifications:
gel bands were dissolved in 500µL of buffer QG regardless of the gel volume
gel heated at 50C for 20 min (to make up for reduced amount of buffer QG)
after melting, 10µL of NaOAC (3M) were added to adjust the pH
DNA from samples 1-3 were eluted in 20µL of ddH2O; DNA from samples 4-6 were eluted in 20µL of buffer EB

TEV Protease
As a protease needed to cut the cleavage site between DAMP and Pexiganan, TEV protease is chosen to serve this purpose. TEV protease is the common name for the 27 kDa catalytic domain of the Nuclear Inclusion a (NIa) protein encoded by the tobacco etch virus (TEV). Because its sequence specificity, TEV protease is a very useful reagent for cleaving fusion proteins. It is also relatively easy to overproduce and purify large quantities of the enzyme. (Macromollecular Crystallography Laboratory, Protein Engineering Section, David Waugh)
Design
The project's main goal on this part is producing the inactive form of the pexiganan which have antimicrobial effects; DAMP-Pexiganan and producing TEV Protease which will activate DAMP-Pexiganan. For producing this proteins abundantly we use T7 promoter ,which has extremely strong transcription rate, while we designing our parts. We also decided to have Lac Operator site (that LacI protein can bind) between our gene sequences and T7 promoters to make protein expressions controllable. We researched for the expression vector that satisfy these requirements, and we found we could use the pet45-b expression vector provides the conditions we want. While we genes to order we added RFC10 prefix domain to the 3 'end of DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease and we also added BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for clonning inside to Pet45-b vector. We added RFC10 Suffix domain to the 5’ end of the same gene sequences, same way we added XhoI restriction enzyme recognition sequence for cloning inside to Pet45-b plasmid. In line with our ultimate goal we aim producing of  these two proteins in the same bacteria. To make this happen we need to ligate these two gene sequences with two plasmids these have different types of origin(Origin incompatibility).  Therefore, we have designed Damp PEX gene sequence in this manner so that at the same time we can ligate it with pColA vector. pColA plasmit do not include promoter in itself beceuse of that we added T7 promoter to 5' end of DAMP-Pexiganan gene sequence.
As stated above, we planned clonning  ordered DAMP-Pexiganan and TEV Protease genes in Pet45-b vector with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. When this clonning performed; T7 promoter-Lac"

Introduce
Words from designer: Scientific research is facing a problem of how to utilize the previous works, some of them are ignored, some of them are underestimated. We‘ve always wanted to make a difference in Synthetic Biology. With the help of our search engine, our users are able to examine previous projects and view at a different angle, and will be inspired by it. The gap between searching and designing are now gone. Once you catch the muse, your design can be done instantly.
Database
We collect data from many channels, most of the previous projects data and all of the Parts data come from the iGEM. Projects published in articles are collected on various synthetic biology Journals. Usage permissions are granted by the publication groups.
All of these are stored in S-Din database so that we can satisfy the need of our users to design a Synthetic Biological project.
Specialty
Even though the exponential increase of published papers is a field-wide phenomenon no only limited in Biology, we try to provide an experimental and innovative solution specialized for Synthetic Biology instead of a general solution. S-Din is built specifically for Synthetic Biology, allowing you to view previous projects and work in a standardized manner. S-Din surpasses Google on the Specialty in Synthetic Biology, seamless searching and designing and its unique way to inspire users.
When you search on S-Din , we provide network analysis services to help find your targets faster, and also try to inspire you. Once you find your preferred project, you are able to edit it simultaneously on our design platform. More parts can be added by the search tools provided on the left, or you can just drag in circuits that you bookmarked into your favorite before. The design can be uploaded"

Efficiency
     We used this method to construct our BBa_K1926011, BBa_K1926012, BBa_K1926013,BBa_K1926002 and BBa_K1926003. We successfully obtained the right plasmid after the first round of molecular clone.
     We also tried the method on BBa_K1926021 and BBa_K1926022 (the size of which twice as big as the former), but other than one head-to-feet product, we didn’t obtain the right plasmids.
     Therefore we suggest that this method is mainly suitable for parts smaller than 1kb, as the longer the parts, the bigger possibility for it to self-cyclize, which wastes the ligation substrates.

Added 0.0502 g of AMP to mixture
Put into plates (make sure mixture is cool)
We also ran a gel purification of the restriction digests of J63001 and J63002 in preparation for the ligation.
Gel Mixture Protocol for 1% Agarose gel:
Agarose:  0.5012 g
0.5xTBE with SYBR Safe:  50 mL
Microwaved for 1 minute on high.
Ran gel in previously used TBE 0.5x buffer.  Used all 50uL of each restriction digest by splitting up this amount among 3 wells apiece with roughly 18uL per well.  Also, ran with both a 100 bp ladder and a 1 kb ladder.  This is because one hopes to extract the excised part J63001, which is 744 bp long, as well as the cloning vector contaning J63002, which should be around 2292 bp.  When the blue dye had gone halfway down the length of the gel, removed it and placed it on the transilluminator.  Visualization at this time showed that the 1 kb ladder did not appear to work, as nothing appeared up in that lane.  The 100 bp ladder lane had visible dye, but it seemed too clumped together to get a good measurement.  In the lanes with J63001, there were two bands, as one might expect. The higher band would be the smaller piece, meaning the actual part J63001, while the lower band would be the plasmid from which this part was removed.  In the lanes with J63002, there was only one visible band, since only a small portion was removed during the restriction digest (no more than 10 bp).
Unfortunately, made the bad decision of putting the gel back into electrophoresis to help separate the bands.  This only appeared to wash all of the DNA from the gel, making it basically impossible to extract any at all.  Looks like the restriction digest will have to be conducted again using some more of the miniprep DNA.
The mixtures for the restriction digest were the same as those listed for yesterday, noting, however that there was slightly less than 27uL left of each plasmid.

IISc-Bangalore,2017,Team:IISc-Bangalore#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," calculate the Péclet number for this system. If the Péclet number is extremely small compared to 1, diffusion is dominant over advective transfer and must be considered during our calculations.
For a typical gas vesicle particle at room temperature (T = 273K),
L ~ 500 nm
u ~ 10 nm/s
RH ~ 200 nm
Substituting these numbers in Equation 2.2, we get a Péclet number on the order of 10-3, which implies dominant diffusive effects when gas vesicles are allowed to settle at the equilibrium concentration profile. In such a case, we require a model that can account for the behavior of floating particles in the highly-diffusive regime.
Evolution of columnar concentration profile
The first step in solving any problem related to diffusive transport is to write a convection-diffusion equation that takes all intricacies of the underlying system into account. For a system of sedimenting particles, it is given by[5]:
\[ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial h}(\frac{D \partial C}{\partial h})-\frac{\partial (C U(C))}{\partial h} \tag{3.1} \label{eq:3.1}  \]
where U(C) is the settling velocity of a particle in a region where the concentration is C. The fact that this velocity is related to diffusion arises due to long range (compared to particle size) velocity field interactions in the column. Two particles settling together tend to sediment faster compared to a single one due to the presence of fluid flow around the second one as a result of the motion of the first particle.
If the suspension is sufficiently dilute and the particle sizes sufficiently small, these velocity fields can be ignored and each particle can be assumed to settle with a constant velocity (the terminal velocity). U(C) now reduces to -Vs, the terminal settling velocity, which is negative in our situation because the particles are floating upwards.
The translational diffusion coefficient is not a height-dependent parameter and can be taken out of the partial differential term, giving the following equation in absence of an underlying velocity field:
\[ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial ^{2} C}{\partial h^{2}}+V_{s} \frac{\partial C}{\partial h} \tag{3.2} \label{eq:3.2}  \]
This equation can be solved either analytically or numerically to yield solutions as"

Program
Coding
Programmers need to track even minute changes to their code exhaustively, especially as the project scales up. Typical tools used for this process include git and svn, which create ""diffs"" which capture differences between files and send them over a network to collaborators.
However, no tool currently exists to support genome-scale changes in a useful way. Programming version control tools can be used to cover DNA data, but they aren't used to working with that sort of input and are extraordinarily inefficient. darwin is a way around that. It uses version control tools as a backend, so it takes advantage of their strength. But it preprocesses the DNA data to optimize these tested and proven methods of version control, producing a much more efficient and secure tracking system built from the ground up to be able to scale to genome-size files. darwin is completely open-source, so any security or optimization issues can be identified and solved immediately to help all users of the tool. It's also agnostic to the type of version control backend used, so it can be put into place on a massive variety of systems.
Biology
The basis for the workings of any organism is rooted in its proteins as provided for in its genome. Every single protein can be traced back to an open reading frame, a set of base pairs defined by a start and stop sequence that evenly divides into codons (sets of 3 base pairs). Every codon corresponds to an amino acid and through the processes of transcription and translation, proteins are manufactured in the cell.
While DNA is a relatively stable molecule, different things can occur causing a mutation in the genetic code. There are several different types of mutations which are defined by how they affect protein translation downstream, specifically insertions, deletions, and substitutions. These can either be synonymous meaning that although there is a changes to base pair, the codon still codes for the same amino acid so there is no detectable change, or nonsynonymous which may affect the makeup of the protein. Lastly, there are frameshift mutations which generate an entirely different open reading frame.

Us
Our team is proud to say that we almost did all the work on our own: finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and optimize them. However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, therefore we required help from different people: scientists, administrators, specialists and even lay persons. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and support. Our project moved forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website
Ulule is the first European crowdfunding website. We have posted our SubtiTree project on this site to collect funds for paying the Giant Jamboree fee. The collect was successful: we had 53 supporters and € 1,787 collected! We warmly thank all the supporters, it was very encouraging to see that people mobilized for us!
We would like to thank:

Business model
What is it?
A business model broadly refers to how an offering is defined and the way it will generate revenue and deliver value to customers.
Summary
Word list
Customer interface: The place where an organization meets its customers
Value proposition: An innovation, service, or feature intended to make a company or product attractive to customers.
Key activities: The most important tasks a company must carry out in order to fulfill its business purpose
Key resources: The most important assets needed to make a business model work, such as physical, financial, intellectual, or human resources.
Customer segments: The practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.
Cost revenue: The total cost incurred to obtain a sale and the cost of the goods or services sold
Revenue streams: The amount of money that it receives from selling a particular product or service.
The most used way for a company to illustrate how its business is built is the business model. According to Chesbrough & Rosenbloom 59a business model is:
“a framework that takes technological characteristics and potentials of the company as inputs, and converts them through customers and markets into economic outputs.”
In 2009, the concept of the business model canvas was developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur. The business model canvas was created as a visual template for the strategic management of a company’s business model, that allows the sketch of new or existing business models 60.
The business model canvas is built around four pillars: customer interface, value proposition, financial pillar, infrastructure management and uses nine interdependent elements: key partners, key activities, key resources, value proposition, customer relations, channels, customer segments, cost revenue and revenue streams 61.
The pharmaceutical industry has been built around the blockbuster model, where the structure of pharmaceutical companies is fully integrated, with every step in the value creation process kept in-house. For the success of the development of our product and taking into account that iGEM Stockholm would be a small company with not enough core competences to fully develop a pharmaceutical product, we have decided to build our business model to be a disintegrated one, basing our business by focusing on becoming specialists on a specific part of the value creation process, for a specific disease and creating a networking and partnerships with companies specialised in other core competences, for developing"

d-AuNPs Testing: ssDNAp interaction with EPO target DNA
The prescreening with d-AuNPs is tested with EPO DNA as target. To test the versatility of the prescreening, multiple variants of the ssDNAp were designed to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 5 targets the EPO coding sequence. Prior, the ssDNAp is heated up to let the ssDNAp anneal to EPO target DNA and create the secondary structure. The ssDNAp 5 was used in this experiment to target the EPO DNA. The ssDNAp 5, EPO target DNA and hybridization buffer were incubated:
5 minutes at 95 ºC (denature dsDNA target)
1 minute at 57 ºC (anneal ssDNAp to dsDNA target)
10 minutes at 21 ºC
20 µL d-AuNPs, 10 µL target dsDNA (1 µM), 6 µL hybridization buffer, 4 µL ssDNAp 5 (1 µM) and 20 µL of a varying salt concentration (range of 0 mM to 1000 mM) were added to the 96 wells plate.

Tsinghua-A,2016,Team:Tsinghua-A#test_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins for their low leakage level and high induced multiples, that is, high sensibility to inputs.
How well do circuits perform as evaluated by channel capacity?
I Seven circuits are evaluated in our experiment. Calculated channel capacities are displayed in fig.
Come on, this not as dizzying as it is at the first glance. Let’s look at it step by step.
More information is transmitted when both parts of the split protein are inducible.
When both promotors are TREs, both split parts are inducible, and channel capacity is relatively higher than that of channels with un-inducible CMVs. In the absence of intein, the two peptides find it hard to dimerize, giving rise to low channel capacity.
Upon addition of intein sequence, the binding process becomes irreversible since the two halves assemble into one intact protein through splicing. As a consequence, channel capacity greatly increases. Double-inducible group with two TRE promotors still win the competition speaking of channel capacity.
Comparing three inducible groups leads to the conclusion, that splitting leads to decrease in channel capacity, but adding intein sequence to peptides rescue the effect, elevating the channel capacity to even higher level.
What can the result teach us?
Inspirations for Synthetic Biology Engineering:
For synthetic biologists, it is crucial and challenging to construct AND gate. Split up a regulatory protein such as transcription factor, express two halves independently, and an AND gate is born.
Nonetheless, the act of splitting up can bring about unexpected side effects. Gene regulatory circuits are highly dependent on quantitative properties, its complexity and nonlinearity contributing to hard-to-predict behaviors of biological systems. Once an important part in the system is chopped up, who knows what will happen next?
Our program quantitatively studies the behavior of such systems. Splitting up changes the circuit’s output-input function, alleviates leakage phenomenon, improving switch-like property, and increases fold change when induced by circuit inputs. Moreover, we use channel capacity from information theory to describe how well can they transmit signals. We find adding intein sequence tremendously beneficial in that it shifts the channel capacity to a higher level, thus ameliorating uncertainty.
When it comes to designing logic gates, our findings can lead the way. Not only can splitting achieve logic gate effect, but also can it improve sensibility to inputs and defend the system against detrimental interferences of noise when intein is added. Future work shall benefit from this fundamental investigation of basic synthetic biology blocks.

Vilnius-Lithuania,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," In bulk and CAT-Seq measured esterase mutant relative activity. In silico generated Esterase mutant library was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing. The mean methylation scores for each barcoded mutant DNA template were filtered and extracted. The collected data was normalized over Wild Type CAT seq Esterase and K227R mutant (lowest activity). The relative activity, extracted from the mean methylation score of each mutant read is compared to measurement data gathered in standard sized reactions (in bulk).
The relative methylation score (reference nucleotide count) of each mutant read corresponds to the activity of the enzyme it encodes. The higher the activity of the expressed enzyme, the lower methylation score is assigned, due to the catalytic conversion of substrate nucleotides. The comparison of the results, gathered with CAT-Seq catalytic activity sequencing method and in standard sized reactions (in bulk) spectrophotometric data (Fig 1.) conclude the viability of CAT-Seq approach. The activity reading, extracted from the DNA sequence correlates with the in kinetic measurement data perfectly. The activity of each Esterase mutant is measured accurately and is assigned to the corresponding DNA sequence. These results prove and conclude, the validity of CAT-Seq as a method for screening the activity of millions of enzyme sequences and assigning the phenotype of each variant to the genotype it arises from.
Regulatory part activity and cross-interaction assessment
We have then adjusted the CAT-Seq for regulatory part characterization and showed that we can successfully record characteristics of different regulatory parts. The constructed Ribosome Binding site library ( BBa_B0030 , BBa_B0032 , BBa_B0034 , BBa_K2621038 with a downstream CAT-Seq esterase gene BBa_K2621000 ) was subjected to catalytic activity sequencing method. The mean methylation scores (reference nucleotide count) for each barcoded DNA template, housing different RBS were filtered and extracted from the DNA embedded with catalytic activity information (in a form of incorporated reference to catalytically converted nucleotide ratio). The collected activity data was normalized to BBa_B0034 data and is shown in Fig. 2.

Illinois-Tools,2009,Team:Illinois-Tools#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," has all the information we need it. By doing this, we decreased runtime exponentially. We explored several options and began with sqlite3.  This was sufficient for our purposes but in order to ensure robustness for future versions, we switched over to MySQL just before launching our program.
Using the Django web framework, creating a database was fairly straight forward but precise organization of the database was crucial to keeping runtime and update time to a minimum.  After trying several different methods, we settled on creating a database centered on the reaction. Essentially all components can be reached through the reaction model. The picture below depicts the major parts of our database and how they are linked.
Although we decreased the time it takes for the program to run by creating our own database, there are disadvantages to this method. The biggest disadvantage is that our information will not be as up-to-date as KEGG.  KEGG updates parts of their database monthly, other parts weekly, and still others monthly. We decided that in order to keep our program useful we will update our database to ensure that it matches KEGG every two weeks.
Network
Using all the information in our database we have created a large network. Our directed multigraph contains all the compounds and their connections. Compound, compound name, and stoichiometry information is stored at each node. The remaining information is stored on the edge. This includes, reaction, reaction name, reversibility, and weight. From reaction we can also access organism, enzyme, and gene information. A visualization of our graph can be seen below.
As you can see in the top figure, there are some nodes that are very highly connected and others that are barely connected. There ones that are most highly connected are water, ATP, and H+. These are the nodes that we would refrain from using when calculating a pathway. The next pictures are enlarged versions of the pathway showing the information stored in each part.
Weighting Scheme
By default, our algorithm will find the shortest path from the input compound to the output compound. We realize that this path is not always the path that the user is looking for. In order to allow the scientist further flexibility, we have created the option to weight 6 different constraints that we thought would be useful. Listed below is a description of each constraint.
Fewest  Total Reactants/Products
Adding weight to this constraint minimizes the number of reactants and products. This allows minimal disturbance of the natural flux of the organism.
Least ATP Consumption
This weight minimizes the number of reactions that have ATP as a reactant.  This allows for a more natural flow of events through the"
Brasil-USP,2015,Team:Brasil-USP#Policy#WomanInScience_-_-_TEXT.html," pequeno de mulheres. Currently, has the presence of women in exact sciences been increasing? How do you see it  in your own course?

In my course, for example, there is a small number of women.
Você diria que existe qualquer tipo de segregação ou discriminação de gênero, mesmo que sutis? Se sim, diria que isso pode ocorrer de forma inconsciente? Acredito que sim. Às vezes a gente percebe, através de pequenas coisas, que as pessoas ainda têm aquela imagem de que cientista é homem. Acho que isso pode acontecer de forma inconsciente, porque é algo cultural; a mulher já é criada para desenvolver o papel de reprodutora e o homem para desenvolver o papel de dono da casa. Na minha infância, por exemplo, os meninos ganhavam videogame de presente, enquanto as meninas ganhavam bonecas. O estímulo que vai definir quem se interessará pela área da ciência já começa desde cedo. Agora as pessoas estão um pouco mais esclarecidas sobre isto, mas na minha época não era assim. Would you say there is any kind of gender segregation or discrimination, even if it is subtle? If yes, would you say it happens unconsciously? I believe so. Sometimes we notice through little things that people still have the image that scientist are men. I think that it can happen unconsciously, because it is a cultural matter. Women are raised to develop the reproductive role and men to be the head of the family. During my childhood, for example, boys received videogames as gifts while girls received dolls. The stimulus that defines who will be interested in science starts at an early stage. Now people have more knowledge about this, but back in my time it was not like that.

(Link) This means that people are more likely to accept GMOs if they recognize an effect of a product, which is a well-known property of pharmaceutical products. It is therefore important to include the public in the laboratory work in hope of preventing a link between  synthetic engineering and insecurity. Therefore, it is important that a scientist does not become ignorant to this reality but rather aims at converting science.
What is our chances in an already established world?
Many people living in Sub-Saharan Africa remain poor and insecure as result of few employment possibilities and low productivity. Given that these populations depend on agricultural products as potato  and maize, a solution to the low productivity seems essential. Source: Paarlberg, R.: GMO foods and crops: Africa's choice.

(Link) Although the developed part of the world has the resources to help populations suffering from undernourishment, malnutrition or both, it is worth acknowledging how the help appears to others.
In relation to the strict GMO regulations in Europe, one might reflect upon the justice of offering GMOs as  food supplement to the developing countries. In addition to this, it is worth considering how the regulations of GMO in developed countries influence governments of developing countries. Source: Paarlberg, R.: GMO foods and crops: Africa's choice. New Biotechnology, 2010.27:5,609–613. (Link)
Due to the above mentioned it might be worth considering improvements to legislations concerning the use of  GMOs in relation to agriculture in European countries.
How will a controversial proposal be met by an established society?
Another consideration approaches the morals of offering GMOs to people who have limited access to food  to begin with.

Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html," detection system, but they were also used to validate the ensemble model , by comparing the probabilistic outputs of the model with the data (see understanding the mechanism ). The updated and validated model was used to answer some of the key questions that arose in our Integrated Human Practices , for example by helping us determine the optimum enzyme ratio to minimise the cost of the AlcoPatch .
Inducible Gene Switch
After successfully characterizing our choice of constitutive promoters and chromoproteins, we proceeded to obtain a working model of our mechanism. We first built Plasmid 1 and Plasmid 2 ( Figure 1: How it works? ) using the iGEM 3A assembly method.
Plasmid 1
Figure 4. Schematic representation of the assembly of Plasmid 1.
Figure 5. Schematic representation of the assembly of Plasmid 1 adapted from SnapGene.
This plasmid was constructed to obtain a constant expression of the AlcR protein. As seen in Figure 1, the constitutive promoter and the alcR were initially present in two different plasmids. They were first digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated and then transformed into E. coli DH5α. The final plasmid construct has ampicillin resistance. Upon obtaining positive confirmation of the transformants, we proceeded to transform the ligated product into BL21, a protein expression strain.
Figure 6. SDS-PAGE gel showing protein expression results. As shown by boxes in the gel, the 27kDa mRFP1 protein can be clearly seen. However, no proteins can be seen at the 98kDa region where the AlcR protein is expected to be present.
After successfully obtaining transformants with the BL21 strain, we proceeded to overexpress the protein and attempted to show the expressed 98kDa AlcR protein on an SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). Unfortunately, after several attempts, we failed to see any visible protein band on the SDS-PAGE. This could be due to many factors, one of them being that the concentration of soluble protein fraction is not enough to be visualised on a SDS-PAGE. There is a possibility that the expressed AlcR protein could be seen by doing a Western-Blot analysis. However, the lack of a His-tag on the alcR gene did not allow us to explore this option.

Peking,2018,Team:Peking#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," proteins and interaction binds the parts together. Therefore, interaction can induce phase separation and multivalence can make larger assemblies, which are two essential elements in our design that ensure the formation of synthetic organelles.
Figure. 1 Overall design
Multivalence
To design multivalent modules, it is not ideal to use multiple repeat domains, which not only makes the protein extremely large but also brings difficulties to DNA recombination. Thus, instead of using multiple repeats, we turned to de novo-designed homo-oligomeric coiled coils, namely HOTags (homo-oligomeric tags), designed by Prof. Shu Xiaokun[1]. They are short peptides with approximately 30 amino acids, therefore are ideal to introduce multivalence. There are seven coiled coils previously characterized in protein de novo design studies, among which HOTag3 and HOTag6 are the most robust in driving protein droplet formation over a wide range of protein concentrations, so we utilize them to design our SPOT.
Figure. 2 Coiled-coil assemblies and helical bundles[2].
Interaction
To design interaction modules, we tested many components and fused them to the N-termini of HOTag3 or HOTag6. Some of them spontaneously self-assemble and some are inducible. Moreover, we can regulate them using various different inducers and promoters with different intensities.
1.
SUMO and SIM
Post-translational modifications by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) are crucial events in cellular response to radiation and a wide range of DNA-damaging agents. Previous studies have shown that SUMO mediates protein-protein interactions by binding to a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) on receptor proteins. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that a protein with ten repeats of human SUMO3 (polySUMO) and a protein with ten repeats of SIM (polySIM) can phase separate in vitro[3]. Therefore, we chose SUMO3 and SIM as a pair of interaction modules that can drive the formation of synthetic organelles spontaneously. For plasmid construction, in order to make synthetic organelles visible, we chose mCherry (red fluorescent protein) and yEGFP (yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein) as reporters. Then, we fused mCherry between the C-terminus of SIM and the N-terminus of HOTag6. Similarly, we fused yEGFP between the C-terminus of SUMO and the N-terminus of HOTag3. We used the resulting constructs to transform yeast and proved that they can be"

Note
In order to be considered for the Best Model award , you must fill out this page.
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Here are a few examples from previous teams:

Exeter,2017,Team:Exeter#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,"BL21(DE3), Top10, ΔFimB, and ΔFimH), the fusion protein can be expressed by inducing the culture at 0.6 OD with 2% rhamnose. The production of the 6xHistidine tag can be probed by the use of an SDS-PAGE and a Western blot.
After 24 h growth, cultures containing the P_Rha_FimH_1His and wild-type strains were harvested. Cells were disrupted using BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Merck) and samples of the soluble and insoluble fractions were prepared for SDS-PAGE. Western Blots were probed with an anti-6xHis primary antibody raised in Mouse and anti-Mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualised with SigmaFast BCIP/NBT.
The results of this SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot provided bands at the corresponding molecular weights for the FimH_1His protein which also had binding affinities for an anti-His antibody. The result of a band that corresponds to a molecular weight marginally lighter than the entire intact FimH_1His evidentiated expression of the protein, and suggested that the signal peptide had been cleaved upon the proteins delivery to the cell surface membrane. This makes a case for successful export of the protein and therefore successful pilus biogenesis.

SDU-Denmark,2010,Team:SDU-Denmark#project-m_-_-_TEXT.html," for the conversion of the rotary motion into a linear thrust. The filament is a self-assembling polymeric structure composed of flagellin protein subunits. These are arranged in a circular way to create a hollow helical structure, with a typical width of 120-250Å and a length of 10-15µm [ 2 ].
A bacterium like E. coli typically has around 10 flagella [ 3 ]. These filaments are able to adopt a wide range of conformations under the induced torque. Numeric studies [ 4-5 ] and empiric results [ 6 ] suggest that the conformation is strongly dependent on the hydrodynamic environment that surrounds the flagellum and its rotational direction. When several flagella rotates counterclockwise, the flagella tend to bundle together in a single helix structure, due to the hydrodynamic interactions [ 4 ]. A phosphorylation cascade causes the flagella to turn clockwise at irregular intervals. This induces a sequence of deformations that changes the single helix structure of the flagella and unravels the bundle. This is known as tumble mode.
Figure 1: Image A shows a shematic picture of the molecular structure of a flagellum [ 7 ]. Images B and C show  the flagella of bacteria stuck to a surface and flagella bundles on a moving bacterium, respectively [ 6 ].
To be able to model the flow created by a bacterial coating of a tube, it is essential to know what kind of flowfield a single flagellum/bundle will create. This has primarily been investigated by numerical approaches, where the flagella are modelled as semiflexible hookian systems. Several studies [ 4-5 ] suggests that the flow created from a single flagellum is highly non-uniform, but to some degree circular symmetric at the end of the flagellum (see figure 2 A and B, below). When the flagella come together in a bundle, Floresa, H. et al. [ 4 ] suggest that this symmetry becomes less clear and flow becomes even more complicated.
Figure 2: Image A shows a cross section of a flowfield from a flagella modelled by Floresa, H. et al.[ 4 ]. Image B shows the symmetry in the flagella flowfield depicted by Reicherta, M. et al. [ 5 ].
All these results refer to flagella moving freely in aqueous solution, the question is now, whether the same is true for bacteria sticking to the surface of a narrow tube? Turner, L. et al. ["

We also invited them to our school and talked about our projects. We learned about that their project is about a kind of compound named notoginseng saponin. They told us about the process and purpose of their experiment in detail and we noticed that there are some cases they ignored. And also, we help them optimize the process of their experiment and gave them a hand on the analyzing of their result. At the same time, we invited them to our laboratory, showed them how our experiment goes on and also, gave them some advice on the operations they should take care of when they did their experiment. And they also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and all of us had a great and meaningful day!

This is not so much a problem for HAT. An alternative application that they mentioned was sheep, where a virus (Cache Valley virus, CVV) causes abortion of the lamb. This can spread to humans so a new diagnostic would be valuable. Moreover, Trypanosoma is also a problem in cattle, which might also be an interesting side-story.
We also asked them about vector monitoring, regarding our previous decision of not making it our main story. They told us that for vector monitoring the rapid characteristics of our device is not needed. Furthermore, with PCR you can detect any virus you want whereas our system is specific for one virus. Hence, we made the right choice in focusing on human screening."",,Met with Dr. Wim van de Poel and Dr. Jeroen Kortekaas,,,

3. Final eluent 2 with CP 11 promoter
4. Final eluent 1 with J23106 promoter
5. Final eluent 2 with J23106 promoter

8. Final eluent 1 with DH5-alpha as negative control
9. Final eluent 2 with DH5-alpha as negative control
10. Stage 3 eluent with promoter J23106
A in the appendix 1 is pointing towards the 50 kDa band on the ladder. B is pointing towards the band that can be seen and that likely is the colicin Fy while C is another eluent with the same promoter also showing the colicin Fy existence. This shows that the promotor J23106 can be used to produce the colicin, while CP 11 and J23113 can not.
We did manage to get some indication that the CP11 promoter might have worked but the band was not strong enough to guarantee that it was actually there. There can be quite a few reasons to why the band is not stronger than it is. There is a possibility that the protein was eluted out of the system too early which also seems to be the case to some extent. Appendix 1 lane 3 shows a band in the right position. This was not observed for the other tests but since that eluent is in a falcon tube containing about 40 ml of liquid it was probably very diluted and weak. It could also be some leakage from the well next to it.
The IMAC and SDS-page managed to provide a strong indication that we did produce the colicin Fy. There existed bands at the right places and the negative control did not have any bands at all. All experiments were conducted in the same manner and if it was another protein that by chance bonds to the IMAC gel it should have been in the negative control as well.   Most bacteriocins are not fully studied so there might always be unknown problems with them. One possibility is that they somehow hurt the bacteria in which they are produced. Since the colicin described here is supposed to only react to a specific receptor that some Yersinia species have on the cell surface the probability for the colicin to hurt the producing bacteria is very low.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Growing Back Nerves_-_-_TEXT.html," go from the spinal cord to the arms, hands, legs, and feet and allow for nerve impulses to be transmitted from the CNS, leading to an action [3]. To increase the electrical signal speed, axons are surrounded by myelin, produced by another type of cells called Schwann cells. These cells twist around the axon and prevent the loss of the electrical signal[4]. After limb amputation, the main issue within the human-machine communication is due to the damage inflicted on the nerves. In fact, the electrical signal cannot be transmitted because peripheral nerve cells are no longer able to activate target muscles or relay sensory information from the limbs back to the brain.
OUR SOLUTION
The central idea of our project is to find a way to help the motor nerves of amputees grow back and connect to our interface. Literature studies led us to think of neurotrophins as the perfect molecules to start our research on. This family of peptides are growth factors specialized in the regulation of neuronal development, survival, plasticity and nervous system function[5].
What are neurotrophins?
The first neurotrophin to be discovered was the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). It was described in 1952 by Rita Levy Montalcini and Viktor Hamburger [6]. Since then, many other neurotrophins have been discovered (BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NT-6) [7] and much progress has been achieved towards understanding how they work. Yet, NGF is still considered a “prototype neurotrophin” [5] and is generally used as an example to describe the function of these peptides. For this reason, we chose to clone this polypeptide into our bacteria, creating the first component of the NeuronArch project.
The ambiguity between NGF and proNGF.
The mature-NGF protein results from the cleavage of β-NGF from a bigger protein called proNGF, which contains a pro-sequence and β-NGF (Figure 1). Both proNGF and β-NGF proteins are biologically active, and there is, to this date, some sort of uncertainty about the exact effect of proNGF.
Figure 1: Structure of the proNGF gene. Adapted from Ivanisevic, 2013.
Indeed, whereas there is no doubt that β-NGF is a neurotrophic factor, it has still not been determined exactly whether proNGF is a neurotrophic or an apoptotic factor [8]. Many articles are still in contradiction on this matter and part of the reason is linked"

Introduction
Thinking how our project will affect society and how our solution based on synthetic biology will be contemplated by citizens was a constant concern for our team. Throughout our project, we adopted a lean startup methodology, building our device and our scenario by successive iterations. We conducted a large survey about the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, which received more than 2 300 answers worldwide. We also met the French actors of the fight against air pollution, such as the French Ministry of the Environment, city agencies, scientists, medical professionals and associations. It allowed us to present and review our project, check our assumptions and integrate their feedback to our device. To show that we have now gathered a solid knowledge of the air pollution ecosystem, we have regrouped our findings in a socio-economic legal report. Finally, we participated in a conference with scientific experts in the field of air pollution to present and validate our chosen targets, Poly aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter.

Vilnius-Lithuania-OG,2018,Team:Vilnius-Lithuania-OG#Merging Model_-_-_TEXT.html," we chose tflow as an upper limit of the time it requires for the droplets to pass through the coalescence chamber. The flow time is expressed as a ratio of channel volume to a unit-volume of fluid (total of the oil):
(31)
If the calculated time tcoal is longer than tflow, droplets will pass the coalescence chamber without fusion. That means if the droplets take a longer time to come together and merge then the time they spend in coalescence chamber, the merging will not occur. That is why we chose the tflow as the higher limit of allowed values.
Next, to find the lower limit must solve the different balance equation. We chose the lower limit as a time needed to remove the double volume of oil between two droplets. In other words, it is the situation where three droplets would merge instead of two. We express the volume of oil between three droplets as \(V_{oil}^{(limit)}=2 T_0 W_1 H\). This volume will be drained at the drainage flow rate. We then write the equation:
(32)
If the equation is True, three droplets will be fused together instead of two. Again, we need to limit our initially found tcoal values. Therefore, if the coalescence time of 3 droplets \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) is shorter than that of tcoal, we will find no pair-wise coalescence. The results are shown in Figure X below. The straight lines indicate the upper limit (time of the flow). The curves below are times for 3 droplet fusion. The points that are slightly below the curves for \(t_{coal}^{(3d)}\) represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence with the 3 droplet coalescence time being longer \(t_{coal}^{(3d)} \gt t_{coal}\).
Figure 3. Droplet coalescence time dependence on fused droplet volume ratios at different applied voltage Uapp values. The black line displays tflow - the coalescence time limit, at which droplets leave the merging chamber without fusing. Dotted lines correspond to coalescence time limit tcoal(3d) at which coalescence of 3 droplets occurs. The points that are slightly below the curves for represent the regions of stable 2 droplet coalescence
In conclusion, we find there to be an optimal range of droplet volume ratios V2/V1 that allows stable effective 1:1 coalescence. Aprox"
