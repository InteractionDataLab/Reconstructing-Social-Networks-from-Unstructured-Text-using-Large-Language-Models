By replacing the reaction rate constants of circuit obtained above, we could stimulate the all theoretical curves of mRNA and proteins, and directly mutually validated each other. However, the experimental data were limited.
Figure 4. Comparison of GFP expression data and model
So, we only presented several group of results here.To further validate the theoretical data of circuit 5’s GFP , correlation analysis was made[13].

Significance level
According to the level of significant test：
n=9, n-2=7; significance level α = 0.1 , ${γ_0.1}$=0.5822
$$ γ = 0.9026 ≥ { γ _ {0.1} } = 0.5822 $$
So the correlation is significant, and we could think the simulation of GFP was good evaluation
Further, an regression equation could be established:
CONCLUSION
In a conclusion, we validated the reaction rate constants in our system using Michaelis-Menten Equation, Empirical Formula, Partition Function and Hansch-Fujita Equation. With those constants we successfully simulated the whole processes and the results fit with the experimental data well. Besides, we comprehensively utilized research literature and our experimental data and generated a universal mathematical equation between the values of free energy of different stem loops and the decay constant.
We believe our model is beneficial to help us understand the biological system and further evaluate our project’s potential capacity.

In E. coli, nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC) and NtrB compose a two-component system where NtrC is activated by NtrB under low-nitrogen stress and activates downstream gene expression to survive such stress [2] [3] . Theoretically, NtrC/B system responds to global nitrogen change in environment, nevertheless E. coli preferentially utilizes ammonium as its nitrogen source and is much more sensitive to ammonium concentration change compared to other nitrogen sources [4] . Thus, NtrC/B is selected as the key player in our bacterial sensor. By expressing reporter proteins from NtrC-regulated promoters, we can easily monitor ammonia concentration change in aquaculture water.
Among all NtrC-regulated promoters, three of them have been well-documented and functionally validated, including glnAp2 [5] , glnHp2 [6] and astCp [7] (for more information see notebook ). We tested different properties of these promoters and decided that glnAp2 is our best choice because of its exceptional stability and high transcription level (see results for details).
We chose mRFP as our reporter since it produces high level of fluorescence and is visible under natural light. These traits are especially advantageous in hardware application. To facilitate real-time detection of aquaculture water ammonium concentration, we added a SsrA-tag at the C-terminus of mRFP to accelerate its degradation and decrease fluorescence accumulation in time and space [8] . The efficiency and ability to induce protein degradation of three SsrA-like tags (LAA, LVA and DAS) were compared (for more information see notebook ) and DAS was selected in our system (see results for details).
To sum up, mRFP with DAS-tag is expressed from a NtrC-regulated promoter glnAp2, enabling E. coli to emit red fluorescence in low-nitrogen environment and quench this signal at a higher rate to facilitate real-time detection of water ammonium concentration.
Results
Determining best culture conditions
In order to select suitable promoters responding variously to different ammonium concentration, we used sfGFP as reporter to indicate transcription level, thus evaluating activities of different promoters (See BBa_K2287001 , BBa_K2287002, BBa_K2287003 ). Since we were dealing with ammonium and nitrogen metabolism, traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.

Welcome to Melbourne, Australia
There is a lot to love about Melbourne - just ask the locals. This sophisticated world city in the south-east corner of mainland Australia inspires a deep passion in those who live here.
Melbourne is very much about lifestyle. It is no huge surprise to residents that their city has been ranked as one of the world’s most liveable cities.
Melburnians love the city's vibrant energy, restaurants, fashion boutiques, café-filled laneways, cool bars, unbeatable galleries, spacious parks and village-like inner suburbs, each with its own special character. Melbourne is less than 200 years old and never sits still. Modern, cutting-edge designs add to the fascinating mix of heritage architecture and ensure the skyline is constantly changing.
Sometimes, the best part of visiting a new city is when you depart from the tourist trail. While the big attractions can be great fun, often it’s the more subtle “insider” experiences that leave you feeling really satisfied.

We wrote a proposal entitled “Think before doing” which describes our approach on biosafety and how we aim to reach and inform our target audiences. This includes both a technical infographic as well as a comic for children. The RIVM encouraged us to think about the safety aspects of both our project and the device and rewarded us with a grant of €3000. We put our proposal into practice during the “Kennisparade”. On this day, the RIVM opened their doors to the general public, in particular children, to teach them about science. We informed the public about safe genetic modification and “crafting with DNA”. Communication was maintained with RIVM to track the progress of our project. You can check the result of the biosafety project on our Safety & Ethics page .
Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute is an organization aiming to pinpoint and solve today's questions on science, technology, and society. It also has an active role in informing politicians and society on these problems and possible solutions. An important part of their portfolio is synthetic biology. The Rathenau Institute collaborated with all Dutch iGEM teams for their “Guide to Integrated Human Practices” workshop in The Hague to share their expertise.
More info
The workshop consisted of several parts. First, the “speed dates” with experts on several human practices-related fields. Each iGEM team got to practice presenting their case to these experts, followed by a short discussion and a round of questions. We got some very interesting feedback.
For example, experts advised us to get into contact with end-users, as well as NGOs, and to take advantage of the expertise present at the Wageningen University. They emphasized that, in order for a cheap and new diagnostic to be developed, it has to be both novel and successful. A good engagement will be the factor for success. Wieke Betten, from the Athena Institute (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), said it is important for us to specify the disease we are tackling, and which population is affected the most. Other experts agreed that a clear, coherent and closed idea is needed for people to understand the aim of the project. This way, we can combine both specificity and modularity of the device.
After these speed dates we got an introduction to the iGEMmers Guide to The Future tool, developed by the Rathenau Institute. This very nice tool has exercises to facilitate human practices research for iGEM teams. For example, it contains guidelines for stakeholder brainstorming sessions, getting into contact with possible end-users and how to format techno"

Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference
From July 30th to Aug 3rd, we joined the Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference hosted by iGEM NCHU Taichung in Chung Hsing University. More than twenty iGEM teams from Taiwan, China, and Japan gathered around and shared the incredible projects. Lively discussion surrounds all the time after team presentations and at posters sessions, where we gained many valuable advices from professors and other iGEMers.
In the evening, teams hung out, had dinner, visited night markets, while sharing funny stories and problems encountered during the preparation of Giant Jamboree. Mouth-watering chicken fillet and freshly made pearl milk tea sure brought us closer together. We had a great time, especially with iGEM Fudan-CHINA, iGEM NAU, and iGEM XMU-China, who kindly approached us looking for the possible cooperation further in the future.
It was a precious experience and practice for us to present our project in front of so many Asia iGEMers before Giant Gamboree. Great thanks to NCHU Taichung iGEM team for hosting such wonderful conference!!
Mini-seminar with Mingdao, NCTU_Formosa and NTHU_Taiwan
On July 23rd, four teams from Taiwan gathered together, presented our projects in turn and exchanged feedback with each others. Fresh, creative ideas made this conference not only inspirational but also unforgettable.
We were glad to be a part of this conference taking place in NCTU. It was thrilling knowing this conference is arranged and hosted by Mingdao High School team, which has been participating and obtaining good results in iGEM.for years. 20 minutes presentation and 10 minutes questions and answer times were yielded to each team.
Mingdao aims to build low-cost, rapid-screening and accurate diagnostic device of HIV, living mosquitos is involving in this portable device!
NCTU_Formosa introduced their system of balancing varieties of bacterial growth in the soil by applying corresponding amount of bacteriocin.
NTHU_Taiwan intends to regulate the population of bacteria Vibrio, which possess great potential of commercializing.

Notebook – Protocol – 9. Cell competent preparation
1. From LB agar plate containing no antibiotics, colony of either E. coli DH5alpha or BL21(DE3) cell was taken and culture in 2 ml LB medium at room temperature for overnight for pre-culture.
2. 900 ul of pre-culture was added into 9 ml of sterilized LB medium in 50 ml polypropylene tube, inside a cleanbench.
3. Tube was shaken for 2 hours at room temperature. Because we have no UV spectrophotometer, OD (optical density) of the main culture could not be measured. However, based on our chief instructor - Dr. Arief experiment, 2 hours shaking at room temperature using the above condition culture was enough to get OD660 nm of about 0.6.

Experiments with biomimetic membranes
1. Introduction
The membrane is an important component of our protein production system as it separates the bacterial culture from the protein collection chamber. In the final protein production chamber the membrane would be an artificial biomimetic membrane.
In this experiment, we investigated the use of lipid membranes using supported lipid bilayers and liposomes.
2. Aim
The first aim of this part of our project was to investigate if the SIEC strain (i.e. the E. coli strain expressing the injectisome) would bind to a biomimetic membrane and secrete
proteins through it.
The second aim was to investigate if the secretion signal Map20 (BBa_K2871000) would increase the amount of protein secreted into liposomes.
3. Membrane composition
A mixture containing sphingomyelin (SM), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS), and cholesterol (Chl) was used for the supported lipid bilayer and liposomes in a ratio of 44:24:12:20 (SM:DOPC:DOPS:Chl). The ratio of the membrane components was inspired from Chatterjee and colleagues [1] who showed that"

Project Description
The aim of our project is to create a bacterium that can detect the presence of vibrio cholerae in water. Some bacteria use quorum-sensing. They produce and release autoinducers; signal molecules which vary in concentration as a function of cell density. When a minimal threshold of autoinducer molecules is detected, gene expression is altered. This provides a mechanism for coordinated behaviour within bacterial populations. The detection of autoinducers involves a histidine kinase in the membrane which detects the signal and autophosporylates on a His residue. A phosphate is then transferred to an aspartate residue of a response regulator which relays the signal. We aim to create a fusion protein in E.coli capable of detecting the presence of CAI-1 (cholera autoinducer). This requires fusion of two related receptors with similar topography. The signal is then transmitted down its native pathway. We have chosen 2 similar receptors to create our fusion protein; BarA and CqsS. BarA is a sensory histidine kinase present in the membrane of E.coli. CqsS is a sensory histidine kinase from vibrio cholerae which detects CAI-1. We aim to fuse the N-terminal (receptor) domain of the CqsS (which detects CAI-1 and autophosphorylates) with the C-terminal (transmitter) domain of BarA (which accepts a phosphate and relays the signal downstream. We will then insert the recombined BarA gene into a high copy plasmid. An alternative is to transform the whole CqsS pathway into E.coli. Phosphorylation of the BarA/CqsS causes the phosphorylation of the response regulator UvrY, which then binds to DNA causing transcription of CsrB (a small regulatory RNA). CsrB inhibits CsrA which, in turn, inhibits certain genes. These genes are part of the pgaABCD operon, a 4 gene locus in E.coli. Upon CAI-1 detection by the fusion kinase, transcription of CsrB causes inhibition of CsrA therefore relieving the inhibition of the pgaABCD gene transcription. We want our biosensor to produce a response visible to the naked eye. We plan to insert E.chromi (from the Cambridge 2009 project) into this oper"

Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Because our PCRs have not worked well we thought it may depends on the primer annealing temperature so we did gradient PCR with the same conditions as before ( PCR June 4th ). But this also showed no result. Because we made Coloyn PCRs from the arrived DSMZ reaction tubes our next idea was to cultivate the bacteria in media and isolate genomic DNA.
Team Activity Tests:
Since our Tecan microplate reader is not able to actively cool down to 4 °C we got the chance to meet the photometer Carry. Check ""protocols"" for further information about her. We used the same set up with 100 mM natrium acetate buffer, 0,1 U T. versicolor laccase and 0,1 mM ABTS as before but now measured at 4°C.  Our team is planning to visit a municipal sewage plant for getting some insights into the water conditions there, so we will for sure test other temperatures after having more information. Let´s hope the water there is a little warmer since laccase does not seem to be totally satisfied at 4°C. I would not either.

USTC-Software,2017,Team:USTC-Software#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," is one of the plugins integrated in Biohub to design amino acid sequence from a given protein. The algorithm requires an extremely large database (about 10 GiB), and will consume lots of computation resources during executing. The characteristics increase the risk of breaking down the whole server, and make the software unfriendly to those who want to test it locally.
In consideration of the issues mentioned above, we redesigned the execution model of ABACUS. Now ABACUS can be executed either locally or remotely. If the database and the binary files are configured correctly, ABACUS will be executed locally, otherwise it will forward the request to other servers who have the ability to run ABACUS locally.
Such mechanism perfectly solves the problems. On the one hand, ABACUS need not to be run in parallel with the master process of server, so the risk of breaking down doesn't exist any more. On the other hand, ABACUS can be executed without databases and binary files downloaded, therefore it is convenient for users and programmers.
Notice
This year we use websocket in our notification system. Now notifications can be sent to related users immediately whenever they were created as long as the connections between users and server remain. Users can be informed of what they interest in while they are using our software."

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts."

We counted cells and calculated ratios of red cells to total cells between these two cases. In consequence, by the transfection of pAct5C-GAL4, 10.1%(42/415) cells showed red color. But, without pAct5C-GAL4, no cells showed red color (0/118 ).

Drosophila cells transfected with BBa_K758005 alone
These results show that BBa_K758005 was activated and expression of LacZ were induced in the presence of the GAL4 protein.
Therfore, it can be said that BBa_K758005 was working as expected.
Establishment of transgenic flies carrying pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3
We have injected 692 embryos (w-, delta2-3) with pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA (1mg/ml in microinjection buffer). Out of them 144 were hatched to larvae and 83 were further eclosed to adults. These 83 adult flies were crossed with yw flies and their progeny flies were inspected to identify successfully transformed w+ red eye flies. The red eye screening is still ongoing. However, we have identified six transformant strains that are listed below. Chromosomal linkage of the transgene is now under investigation.

The feedback we received suggests that people found our workshop interesting and well structured. The part of feedback we scored lowest on was for helping people build their own model, possibly because they are using different software to build models. We also think we could improve the clarity of our handouts to guide people through our prepared exercises more effectively. We enjoyed delivering this workshop and feel the feedback shows our workshop was a success.  We believe the workshop presentation and handouts we developed are a great resource for those new to biological modelling.  We were happy to hear that Team:Leeds began using BioNetGen after some of their team members attended our workshop.

Summary
InterLab is a global lab cooperation which aims to gain an objective and universal accepted evaluation to some modeled parts for engineering. All labs participating in InterLab measure the OD and the fluorescence following the same protocol with the same type of instruments, resulting in a large reduction in error and an easily building global comparing system. Plus, the idea of the InterLab study also enables a common measurement platform in terms of samples and protocols so as to allow interconversion of data between different devices in the following methods.
Procedure
OD: A standard colloidal solution, LUDOX S30, was provided in 2017 measurement kit.
Fluorescence: Dry Fluorescence Sodium salt (100µM by resuspending in 1ml 1 x PBS ). Fluorescence was measured under the standard condition(EX:483nm  Em: 507nm)
Use of standardized measurements:
A gcolumnth curve for E coli DH5α transformed with the following plasmids was performed
Positive Control (BBa_I20270): well 20B
Negative Control (BBa_R0040): well 20D
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000): well 20F
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001): well 20H
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002): well 20J
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003): well 20L
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004): well 20N
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005): well 20P
All the gcolumnth curves were performed with initial uncorrected OD of 0.2
Error: It is hard for us to perform the standard fluorescence measurement"

The protocol used in this experiment is the one given with the kit. There were no changes to the protocol and the steps taken to perform the purification can be seen here:
Took four Mini-prep Binding Columns and placed them into collection tubes; to each 0.5ml of Column Preparation Solution was added. The tubes were then centrifuged for 1 minute under 12,000g.
Once the eluate in all of the collection tubes was removed, 200ul of Binding Solution was added to the four PCR Eppendorf tubes containing the PCR DNA (the four tubes containing 40ul of C0, V1, V2 and V3 PCR DNA). These four PCR DNA mixtures were then transferred to the four prepared MiniPrep Binding Columns and centrifuged for 1 minute under 13,000rpm. The eluate was discarded once again with the binding columns returned to their respective collection tubes.
0.5ml of Wash Solution was then added to the four binding columns. These binding columns (within the collection tubes) were then centrifuged for 1 minute under 13,000rpm with the resulting eluate discarded. The binding columns were then placed in their original collection tubes and centrifuged again at 13,000rpm; this time with no solutions added.
The binding columns were then transferred to four new collection tubes (appropriately labelled) whilst the original collection tubes (plus eluate from the 2 minute centrifugation) were discarded. 50ul of Elution Solution was then added to the binding columns and allowed to sit within the tubes on the bench for 1 minute.
The columns (within their new collection tubes) were then centrifuged for 1 minute under 13,000 rpm but this time it was the eluates which were kept and the binding columns discarded. The four collection tubes containing the eluated PCR products of C0, V1, V2 and V3 PCR reactions were then stored in the -20°C.
Conclusion
With the PCR products purified, another attempt at DNA gel electrophoresis under 1.5% agarose gel should confirm whether the PCR reactions to amplify our synthesized sigA promoter library has worked.

Bioremediation
Bioremediation is the concept in which biological organisms are used to repair the environment; essentially, when biology meets ecology. This is an advantageous way of eliminating radioactive/toxic waste at radioactive storage sites and facilities. Physicochemical clean-up costs of such sites can amount to as much as 265 billion dollars, making bioremediation a cost effective and environmentally intelligent way of eradicating hazardous toxic waste.
The process of nuclear waste bioremediation utilizes microorganisms such as bacteria to break down or precipitate harmful, radioactive substances. In order for this to occur, the organism being utilized must be able to withstand the potential cellular damage caused by the radioactive waste at the eradication site. Deinococcus radiodurans (D. rad) is the most radiation resistant bacteria known; D. rad is resistant to ionizing radiation, desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, oxidizing agents and electrophilic mutagens. Considering these extremophilic anomalies, D. rad is the perfect candidate for use in bacterial bioremediation efforts. It is already being tested in bioremediation efforts at sites of U.S nuclear weapon production during cold war, where a vast amount of toxic waste still remains.
There are multiple ways of accomplishing bioremediation; the substance being remediated determines the strategy used.
Toxic organic compound degradation is for the detoxification of contaminated solvents produced during nuclear weapons production. These include radioactive organic solvents such as toluene and other aromatic compounds. In recent years, D. rad strains have been produced with solvent-degrading capabilities to accomplish these goals. D. rad expressing the enzyme todC1C2BA, derived from Pseudomonas putida, have been successfully created. These D. rad strains have been used to oxidize toluene, which is then"

Wageningen_UR,2017,Team:Wageningen UR#HP#Meetup_-_-_TEXT.html," the projects were still at the early stage of development, it was very interesting and inspiring to hear all their ideas and goals. After this, it was time for another refreshing coffee break to discuss the presented projects some more.
Food for thought was provided after the break by our experts, prof. dr. Hyun Youk and dr. Robert Smith. Prof. dr. Youk gave us insight in some of the newest developments in the field of cell communication engineering, whereas dr. Smith educated us on reverse designing synthetic networks in silico.
Besides learning from experts in the fields of synthetic biology, we also got advice from experts in the iGEM area, namely Ana Sifuentes from iGEM Headquarters. Ana Sifuentes gave an update on the new developments in the world of iGEM. Additionally, we could ask her for advice on wiki or design ideas.
Concluding the seminar, the 2014 Wageningen team shared their knowledge on 'How to iGEM', as they became first runner-up in overgraduate section of the 2014 competition. The 2016 Wageningen team was also present during the break to share their experiences!
After the seminars and another round of coffee to keep everyone warmed up, it was time for the Human Practices workshop called 'Change of Perspective'. We developed this novel workshop together with our communication advisor, dr. Bob Mulder.
The goal of the workshop was for each iGEM team to get out of their 'expert' point-of-view and discover what the needs or problems would be for the end-user of their project. The teams were to find out: What would it mean to use the technology in practice? Three to six people of each iGEM team were coupled to a small group of another team. Next, one team got to shortly explain their project as 'developer'. The other team was to ask questions as 'end-user' about how the use of the technology and its influence can impact their lives or work. After 15 minutes, the roles were reversed. The experts and alumni iGEM teams were also invited to participate.
It was amazing to see how all teams got into this exercise! Some teams were really getting into their roles as end-users, asking questions that the developers could anticipate further into their project. Other teams got to think about whether their initial target group was actually the group that would need their technology most, and had to rethink what the aim of their technology would be in the first place. However, after some questioning, they found out that the aspects of their technology would be best put into use when specifically for identification of diseases.

Introduction
Our team spent a lot of time thinking about innovative ways to spread knowledge about synthetic biology and the aether project. We have particularly devoted ourselves to reaching the widest possible audience and creating a dialogue with this audience through surveys and questionnaires. We really focused on the game to interact with the general public by organizing the Fine Particulates Hunt, treasure hunt allowing as many people understand the issues of synthetic biology and our project.
We also participated in conferences and organized meetings to present synthetic biology as a possible solution to fight against air pollution. We met public institutions, such as the Ministry of the Environment and the Paris City Hall to discuss with them about our project.
Finally, to reach the widest audience, we have focused on communication through traditional media (newspapers, radio ...).
The hunt for Particulate Matter
On September 16th, 2017, we organized an innovative event to raise awareness of the stakes of our project: a treasure hunt in the streets of Paris to inform the participants in a fun way to the problem of air pollution and show them how synthetic biology could be a solution to fight against this issue.
The principle of the hunt was as follows: at each stage, participants had to find a clue to solve a final riddle, then they had to go through a booth where an activity / game around a theme took place. People who visited a stand would receive a clue about the location of the next step. The principle of ​​this event was to educate the participants in a fun way and to make sure that the ballad would be accessible to children accompanied by their parents, adults or people with reduced mobility. At the end of the event, we drew lots among the people who solved the final puzzle: ""Biologie de synthèse"" (synthetic biology in French). We had then given the participants some clues about what is synthetic biology, and how do we use it in our project. A grand prize was awarded: a bike!
The event was supported by several French institutions: The Ministry of the Environment (which highlighted our event on its website , the Respire association, the Souffle Foundation, Bike in Paris,"

Our team saw a need for improved communication between the scientific community and the public. Much of what makes the mainstream news in bioengineering are dramatic failures, biased promotional studies, and wild exaggerations, and to the average person, genetic engineering may seem unnatural and unsafe. This video, titled “Genetic Engineering: Preparing for the Inevitable” contains all of the necessary information for someone who is untrained to have a knowledgeable and informed opinion on genetic modification, and hopefully quell any worries about its safety. Interviewing three experts with varying backgrounds in ethics, genetic engineering, and genetic manipulation provide a well-rounded outlook on the history, the risks, and the current and future rewards that we may soon be reaping.

Marchisio from SBSD of Tianjin University, who is an expert in synthetic biology. We communicated         by emails and also get suggestions when talking to him face to face. Once our projects work, we may develop them         into products including heavy metal detection and cancer detection in the future.
Integrated Human Practice
High throughput screening of cfDNA of cancer
As we all know, when designing a product, it is essential to understand who will use it. With this question, we contacted         Dr. Zhong in the hospital, and she helped us to get useful suggestions from professional doctors, who may use the         high-throughput screen of cancer detection in their work. They told us every product has its suitable candidates,         when it comes to our cancer detection thoughts, people whose family has cancer history and those who always work         in an environment full of a large amount of radiation are the primary users. It undoubtedly helped us solve the problem         of what kind of people should we focus on. They also pointed out that in real life, this technology can well predict         cancer easily, but if the users want to make sure of it, imaging data is necessary. We didn't think of this a safety         problem before, so once we make it a product, we will emphasize the work of predict but bot a diagnosis. Furthermore,         the hospitals may be the first user of this product because of the straightforward approach of cancer detection,         so we intend to help each other for long.
As we are undergrads who don’t have many experiences in the lab, Dr. Zhong also showed up in our lab to give advice.

Heavy Metal Detection in Water
As citizens in China, we have seen some shocking scenes of water pollution just because factories pull wastewater directly         into the drinkable water. Though the government public laws and paid more attention to this situation several years         ago, citizens still have some concerns about the water they drink. To know the water quality of our district, we         went to the environmental protection bureau and water factories for information about heavy metal pollution of water         resource, which would help a lot in making our project heavy metal detection in water into reality. They told us         the number of heavy metals in water is low enough to drink, but most of the detection methods are about chemistry,         detecting"

Biolink Policy and Practice Tool
Risks of iGEM Projects
The bioethics of synthetic biology are discussed and described intensively in research. However, it is certainly not always clear how to apply these ethical concerns to your specific iGEM project. We were asking ourselves the question; ‘how could we improve the communication and discussion about your particular iGEM project?’ Here we propose a solution  with our Biolink Policy and Practice tool.
This tool can be used for testing both the team management and the direct application of your project. The  team management section is about the internal relations and collaboration within the team. The application section describes how the general public relates to your project. By asking them to participate into a questionnaire you will have the opportunity to engage the general public more in your project and improve your design. In both cases, the participant gets a list with statements. Each statement will be evaluated with a number between 1 and 10 (1 means total disagreement, 10 total agreement). Based on these statements, scores in different categories will indicate the expected risk or action you should take. Based on the scores in each category, the discussion can focus more specific on the points of high risk or disagreement.
To achieve the best practice with our Biolink Policy and Practice Tool, you can better use the tool at more time points during your project. Based on the outcomes of the tool, you can change the direction of the project at the right time and maybe even improve it. Before the wiki freeze you can show the differences between the starting and end point to evaluate how your project developed using the feedback from this tool.

Application
Application
Synthetic biology is a technology not readily accepted by the public. Due to unknown implications, people have to have the feeling the benefits are worth the risks in order to accept the technology. Therefore, the Biolink Policy and Practice tool           provides you a list of statements that any person of your choice can evaluate. Based on the results you can conclude what kind of aspects of your project people are willing to accept (that they evaluate as having a low risk) and what they refuse.

The Delegates of SCUT Team Went to Wuhan for iGEMers’Meetup
On 23th Aug. 2014, the first central china iGEMers’meetup held by the union of Central China iGEM Teams was solemnly opened. This meeting attracts 16 iGEM teams from 17 universities，and SCUT team also sent two delegates to Wuhan to communicate. One was our team leader, Zhang Junjie, and the other was the head of HP part, Wang Zhizheng.
The meeting lasting 2 days was organized by HZAU, WHU and HUST iGEM teams. The contents consisted of three main parts: senior iGEMers’ reports, project presentation by each team, and the discussion of debugs in experiments. On the morning of 23th  August, Dr. Tang Jun, the professor of HZAU participated in the opening ceremony and gave a welcoming speech. Then we watched the video made by the chairman iGEM Head Quarters specially for the meeting. It was really helpful and wonderful. After the opening ceremony, the seniors Zhang Haoqian and Liu Yang coming from Peking University and Ocean University of China gave us two important speeches, sharing their abundant experience about iGEM. It really paid to learn.
(pic 1 Haoqian was sharing his iGEM life.)
At first, Zhang Haoqian made a report and talked with us on five aspects. The contents were as follows: his experiences of joining in iGEM, the development of iGEM, the judging standards and some helpful tips, meanwhile he also told us the problems we faced about synthetic biology and introduced his research about synthetic biology. After that, Liu Yang raised a heated discussion with us. He asked us whether we should be guided by the application or research while we are designing our projects. Different people held different opinions. The atmosphere of discussion was pretty good. And we were so grateful for their detailed and impressive speeches.
(Pic 2 Liu Yang was explaining a research)
During the break of the meting, there were a variety of drinks and snacks in the lounge. We talked with friends as we drank coffee and ate cakes, which was so relaxing. Meanwhile there was also a poster area where we can see the posters of different teams to learn their ideas and thoughts. The posters all have their own features of their"

Uppsala,2017,Team:Uppsala#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," never been determined, we wanted to characterize the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the reaction and estimate KM of our CsADH2946 using the activity measurement results . The substrate crocetin dialdehyde has low water solubility and will therefore partially precipitate when coming in contact with water. Quantitative kinetic characterization of such a system is especially complicated since the substrate concentration at the beginning of the experiment, S0, is not known. We have therefore developed a probabilistic method that is capable of estimating Michaelis-Menten model parameters as well as the error associated with them for such systems and we demonstrate its use on our enzyme CsADH2946. The MATLAB-script we created can be downloaded here .
Enzymatic reactions are often modeled with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In this model, the reaction rate is described by the differential equation:
(1)
where [C] and [S] are the concentrations of product and substrate, respectively. Vmax is the maximum production rate of the system at saturated substrate concentration and KM is the substrate concentration when the reaction rate is half of Vmax. Reaction rate is not directly measured in the assay, so we used the experimental product concentrations Ĉ(t) to estimate the Michaelis-Menten parameters. This was done by integrating equation 1 numerically and fitting the integrated C(KM,Vmax,S0,t) to the experimentally measured product concentrations, Ĉ(t).
The product concentrations, Ĉ(t), were estimated at every timepoint from the experimentally measured absorbance spectra. Fitting was then performed by minimizing the sum of the squared differences (SSD) between the model prediction, C (from integration) and the experimentally measured progress curve, Ĉ(t). These fitting methods are good at finding the parameters that describe the data best but give no information about the uncertainty in the parameters described by the data. Use of methods minimizing the SSD is further complicated when the substrate concentration at the beginning of the experiment, S0, is not known, introducing further uncertainty in the data and demonstrating the need for good error estimation of the model parameters.
We developed a probabilistic method for estimating the kinetic parameters and the uncertainty in them. The method computes and integrates the probability density P(KM,Vmax,S0,σ) as a function of all model parameters. We set the notation θ = (KM,Vmax,S0,σ), where σ is the model noise. In this method we used Bayesian statistical inference to estimate the parameters from the experimental data. In short that means calculating P(θ|Ĉ); the probability of the model parameters,"
Braunschweig,2014,Team:Braunschweig#Project-content_-_-_TEXT.html," task of utilizing the inert compound methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. They are usually found where anaerobic and aerobic environments come together, the former providing methane and the latter oxygen. They use methane by oxidizing it to methanol, which is then further converted to formaldehyde and can be assimilated into the cellular biomass [1,2].
Methanotrophs can be subdivided into two classes which are classified mainly by phylogenetic analyses, but also by physiological and morphological differences. Type I methanotrophs belong to the γ-Proteobacteria, while type II methanotrophs are members of the α-Proteobacteria. They differ in the way the assimilation of formaldehyde, subsequent to methane oxidation, takes place [3].
Methylococcus capsulatus, a type I member, is considered a model methanotroph and has been extensively studied in recent years [4]. However, due to several characteristics it is much harder to handle than other model organisms like, for example, Escherichia coli. M.  capsulatus is thermophilic with a temperature optimum of 45°C and has a rather slow growth rate. Therefore, it would be useful if enzymes like those catalyzing the degradation of methane could be expressed in an organism easier to handle - not only for research but also for industrial purposes.

In the interest of the PUF project, we suspended work on this project but hope to work toward the realization of a enzymatic assembly line in the future.
Prospective Planning
In the future, we would like to focus more efforts on making enzymatic assembly line production of piceatannol a reality. Piceatannol may have potential health benefits, and we would like to determine a protocol that can be scaled up for mass production of the compound. Before the assembly line can become a reality, we must examine current issues with production in E. coli. Since we were not able to detect piceatannol on our TLC plates, we would first like to identify a more sensitive assay for detecting the compound as well as determine its true interaction with the bacteria after it is produced.
We must investigate whether or not the compound is being sequestered by the cells or if resveratrol fails to be taken up by the cells. These pressing issues must be resolved in order to move forward with our synthesis plans.
In a more broad sense, we must also determine if any of the substrates or products in our proposed assembly line are toxic to E. coli or exhibit any other behavior that would complicate in vivo synthesis. However, we have bright hopes and determination to explore this potentially valuable production method for piceatannol in the future.

Graph 5. Sectors     that are affected by digital espionage, according to our survey     respondents
However, the reality is a little bit different when we compare these    results with the data published by the Cyber Security Assessment    Netherlands CSAN 2015 from the National Cyber Security Centre from the    Ministry of Security and Justice from the Netherlands. For professional    criminals, as the source of the threat, “there are clear developments    which make the threat expedient” against private organisations and    citizens, making these two sectors the principal targets of digital    espionage and theft of information, In the case of Governments, either    phenomena of threats have been observed or there are sufficient    measures to remove the threat.
Since the aim of the digital espionage is to obtain and steal    information from digital sources, we asked our survey respondents how    they store their information. Surprisingly we found out that 57% of    them store sensitive information either physically or digitally while    the remaining 43% do not store it. Survey respondents commented    that they do not store them because they are afraid of being hacked. On the other side,                  the physical storing is not used because of the possibility to be    stolen. (Graph 6)
Graph 6. How do      you store your information?
Graph 7. Survey respondents would trust storing information in bacteria
Now that we know that almost half percent of our survey respondents    do not store information because they are afraid of being hacked, we    asked them if they would trust storing their sensitive information in    bacteria.
As depicted in Graph 7, 43% of the survey respondents would trust to    store information within bacteria, which shows that CryptoGErM could be    used by citizens as a storing method.
However, an outstanding amount of 26% of the survey respondents answered that they did not    know what bacteria were. This result motivated us to reach as much people as possible by focusing our    Human Practices on the promotion of synthetic biology besides our project    itself.
As a consequence the actions of the educational and outreach sections    of CryptoGErM were focused to reduce the amount of people that do not    what"

We saw no distance covered in almost all the control beads, a few moved small distances, so some currents are present. Bacteria and beads were left together for ~30mins to allow time for adhesion. No movement has yet been seen when the bacteria and beads are not left to adhere. We will look again at this, as we may have not previously looked closely enough (photographing over a time course of a few minutes).

Circles represent position at 0 mins, one colour for each bead. For example, the bead that starts in red circle    moves down and right, while that in the yellow circle moves left.
Chemotaxis assay (Yu, H.S. et al. (1997) FEMS Microbiology Letters, 156, 265-269.) has not worked so far. Currents can be seen flowing from the aspartate plug, pushing bacteria away. The focus of this week will be on getting this fixed, with a view to combining chemotaxis and the ability to move beads, allowing us to move beads in a particular direction.
The GRN for switching on the chemotactic response by binding to a bead, and signaling to nearby bacteria that a particle is in the vicinity, is almost finalised.

Newsletter
Collaboration and communication are always of crucial value in iGEM and there are many ways for iGEMers to communicate efficiently. This year, we wrote a description of our project and human practices for the September newsletter hosted by XMU-China. The Newsletters are widely read across the world by many other iGEMers. It’s our pleasure to share and discuss our preliminary work with teams all over the world.
Safety Videos
We worked with other Chinese iGEM teams (listed below) to create a series of videos introducing the critical safety instructions in laboratory. The video we made is about the personal protective equipment in the lab, which is quite important for every scientific researcher. Up to now, these videos have been watched for XXX times in total. We hope this collaboration can truly raise the awareness of the lab workers about safety.

Online Conferences
We took part in two online conferences with dozens of wonderful Chinese teams. One was with teams interested in water pollution, and the other was with teams involved in hardware design. We shared our ideas and suggestions with each other. As we are working on water related issue and applied device, these conferences were really great help for our following work.
Helping Us Verify Circuits
To fully characterize a circuit, a great amount of data is required, as only one team cannot accomplish such heavy work. Fortunately, we have FAFU-CHINA, Shanghaitech, ZJU-China, SDU_CHINA, Worldshaper-XSHS to help us perform circuit-verifying experiments and send us considerable amount of essential data, which helps us characterize our circuits better and improve our project further. Thanks to all the teams mentioned above.
Fishing Ponds Water Sampling and Analyzing
As our project is focusing on promoting fresh water aquaculture by dealing with excessive ammonia in the fish pond, it is essential to learn what the real fish pond water is like. ZJU-China and ICT-Mumbai helped us take and analyze water samples from their local lakes. Thanks to their contribution, we were able to make the media protocol simulating the real fish ponds, which is important for our future application test.

Cultures were then chilled on ice and put at 4°C
Bacterial cells were removed by centrifugation (10’, 4000g, 4°C) and then filter sterilized (0.22µm).
2 ml of this filtersterilized supernatant was then extracted with 1 ml of hexane
Extractions were done in glass tubes with rigorous vortexing for 10 minutes
The upper phase was transferred to a new glass vial
The extraction was repeated twice (total of 3 extractions with 1 ml of hexane)
The resulting ± 3 ml of extract were then reduced by evaporation under a nitrogen flow and redissolved in 50 µl of hexane.
Gas chromatography: GC-MS analyses were carried out using a 7890A Agilent gas chromatograph coupled to a 5977A mass spectrometric detector. The GC was equiped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm). 1 µl of each sample was injected using splitless injection at a temperature of 250 °C. The initial oven temperature of 40 °C was held for 1 min., ramped at 6 °C / min. to 124 °C, then ramped at 20 °C / min. to 320 °C and finally kept at this temperature for 5 min. The transfer line and ion source were held at 320 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were taken between masses m/z 30-300 with an ionization potential of 70 eV. Retention indices of standards were determined by co-injection of a C7-C30 n-alkane mixture (Supelco) and were compared with published retention indices.

Coffee and lunch breaks were used as networking opportunities! We presented a poster with more in-depth details of iGEM and encouraged the attendees, in particular the industry representatives, to speak with us.
Overall, we feel that attending this conference really bolstered our knowledge about synthetic biology in general, and what applications it is currently being used for. The talks were very interesting and some even inspired new project ideas!
Eccelso Presentation
In July, Rob and Ralf gave a presentation to a representative from Eccelso, a company specialising in the production of vegetable fats and margarine. We presented our ideas to them, and they explained how palm oil products are used in the industry. Talking to somebody with direct experience of using our potential future product was very useful, and their advice helped us to decide whether to create our fatty acids all in one production batch or in multiple batches. In addition to the great advice, they also provided us with sponsorship. Thanks Eccelso!
Young Synthetic Biologists (YSB 1.0) - 12th July 2013
In July, half of the team (the rest were either graduating or attending family weddings - slackers!) travelled down to London to take part in the first ever Young Synthetic Biologists conference (YSB 1.0). Since we couldn’t make the SynBio 6.0 conference we were ready to make the most of this opportunity to network with fellow budding synthetic biologists!
Over the course of the weekend we participated in both a poster and oral presentation, gave feedback on the other teams’ projects and received some interesting opinions on our own work (mainly concerning our model, lots of people were very interested in it!) Various workshops were provided and so we split up and each went to a separate one, we thought we might as well aim to get as much out of the conference as possible. The workshops proved to be a great way to network with the other teams, and quite soon Jess had rallied some other teams into attempting a modelling collaboration (more of that over on its specific modelling page ).
Overall it was a great experience and we’re looking forward to seeing everyone again in Lyon!

Marburg,2018,Team:Marburg#Design_-_-_TEXT.html,"id where the expression is tightly controlled by an inducible promoter. We expect this to help during cloning and transformation steps, as the toxicity of Cas9 expression is reduced in the absence of inducer. We chose pTet for this purpose. This decision is based on the characterization of this part that showed tight control and a 40 fold induction of this promoter when induced with ATc (Link to Results) . Finally, we created LVL1-pTet-Cas9, a plasmid with the Cas9 CDS under control of pTet (figure 1). We chose to built this plasmid with p15A as the ori and a kanamycin resistance cassette. This enables cotransformation of this plasmid together with a second plasmid harboring the gRNA cassette.
Figure 2: gRNA entry Vector.
The gRNA entry vector contained the scaffold of the gRNA and a sfGFP drop out for insertion of spacer sequences.
Construction of a gRNA entry Vector
To enable simple cloning of gRNAs, we constructed BBa_K2560305 an entry vector for gRNA spacer (figure 2). The spacer is defined as the 20 bp at the 5’ end of the gRNA that confers sequence specificity to the target sequence in the genome. This parts design is based on BBa_K2457002 a part which harbors a gRNA targeting LacZ of E. coli. To achieve superior cloning flexibility we incorporated the approach of using a sfGFP dropout similar to the part entry vector of the Marburg Collection BBa_K2560002 . Analogous to the cloning of small LVL0 parts, new spacer sequences can easily be cloned by annealing of oligos and subsequent ligation into the gRNA entry vector using a golden-gate reaction. This drop out helps to distinguish correctly assembled plasmids from the religated entry plasmid. The succesfully cloned plasmid then contains a gRNA expression cassette as well as a pMB1 ori and the chloramphenicol resistance cassette.
The two plasmids LVL1-pTet-Cas9 and BBa_K2560305 after integration of a spacer are compatible and can be cotransformed. As a third component a donor template has to be added to the transformation.

Collaborations
The philosophy behind our project is that we can do better things when we work together, whether that be microbes working together in a co-culture, or iGEM teams collaborating together! Here, we will outline the collaborations we've participated in this year.
 
Interlab Study
We found the interlab study particularly interesting this year because it also related to our project. In the interlab, teams aimed to reduce variations in GFP fluorescence/expression. We think this is an important goal because in our project, we are measuring one of the bacterial populations in our co-culture using GFP. Hence, we wanted to help as many teams as possible participate in the interlab study this year!
Guelph iGEM
We gifted the Guelph iGEM team with black, flat, clear-bottomed, 96 well plates so that they could complete the interlab study.
McMaster iGEM
We gave the McMaster iGEM team E. coli DH5-alpha cells so that they could meet requirement #2 for successful completion of the interlab study .
Mentoring, Brainstorming, and Troubleshooting
McMaster iGEM
We met with the McMaster iGEM team several times early in the year to discuss the different projects each of our teams were considering. We listened to each other's ideas, and provided each other with feedback.
Guelph iGEM
We first met the Guelph iGEM team last year at oGEM 2017 (a meet-up we hosted with Ontario iGEM teams). It was their first year as an iGEM team. They described the struggles and financial barriers they were facing as a new team. We have kept in touch since then. We mentored members on their team about finances this year. Jehoshua Sharma, the Guelph team's head of research, reached out to us this summer to discuss how to obtain funding for an iGEM team. We offered advice regarding:
how to pitch iGEM to department heads (as an amazing opportunity, a way to showcase the university on an international scale, etc.)

Mingdao,2017,Team:Mingdao#Demonstrate_-_-_TEXT.html," promoters (i.e., PI and Pcar) are induced in response to different concentration of glucose (GROUP 1) as shown in in Fig. 1. RFP intensity will be represented as promoter activity and measured at Ex/Em = 584nm/607nm.
Secondly, the glucose responsive repressor system (GROUP 2) will be tested in response to various concentration of glucose. GFP intensity will be measured at Ex/Em = 488nm/518nm as reporter showing the response of repressible promoter in the presence of glucose.
Finally, the glucose responsive suicide circuit (GROUP 2) will be examined in response to decreasing concentration of glucose. OD600 and cell numbers will be calculated to understand the killing efficacy of suicide circuit in the loss of glucose.
The bacteria carrying the indicated vector were cultured in LB media supplemented with 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol (Cm) at 37°C overnight. The next day, OD600 was measured and adjusted to 2.5 in M9 minimal media with various concentrations of glucose. The bacteria then were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. RFP, GFP or OD600 were indicators of promoter activities as mentioned. For suicide assay, the culture media were taken out and diluted 106 times following by spreading onto LB Cm agar plate at 37°C overnight. The third day, the numbers of colonies were counted and bacterial viability was calculated.
Result
1    Glucose responsive promoter activity
The result shown in Fig. 2 indicated that PI promoter has significant activity in LB culture media. However, the activity of Pcar promoter is greater than negative control but much smaller than PI and positive control. It’s consistent with the properties of PI and Pcar promoters just mentioned previously in GENE CLONING section and described previously in Part Resgistry [Part: BBa_K861170] by team WHU-China in 2012 who designed the promoters.
In our experiment as presented in Fig. 3, PI and Pcar promoters just responded to various concentrations of glucose with a  very slight dose-dependent increase. This phenomenon didn’t correspond to the data provided by team WHU-China in 2012 and team NCKU_Tainan in 2016. Maybe our measurement was not in an optimized condition. Or the reporter of RFP activity was not sensitive enough to respond this difference.

Fig.4 E. coli’s ability of chemotaxis towards different concentrations of succinate or malate.
The cells were diluted 20000 times. 5A is a control which doesn’t have chemotaxis towards malate or succinate.
Malate: 8F showed the strongest respond. The tendency of curve of 8F was biphasic with maximums at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and 10-5 M, and reached minimum at attractant concentration of about 10-1 M, which is similar to others’ work. With attractant concentration decreasing for 8F, the number of cells decreased slowly. McfR stayed stable at range of 10-7 M to 10-3 M, and had only one phase which reached its maximum at attractant concentration of 10-2 M, then it went down sharply at 10-1 M. There was a significant difference among 8F and 5A (p < 0.05), and quantity of cells of 8F was much more than that of 5A. So 8F has chemotaxis towards malate. On the other hand, McfR and 5A were not significantly different and quantity of cells of McfR was little less than it of 5A. So McfR shows no chemotaxis towards malate here.
Succinate: The tendencies of curves of 8F and McfR towards succinate are same. As the attractant concentration increased, the number of cells arose and reached the maximum at attractant concentration of about 10-2 M and fell sharply with the minimum at attractant concentration of 10-1 M. The quantities of cells of 8F and McfR were almost equivalent and did not have significant difference. But there were significant differences among 8F & 5A, and McfR & 5A: the number of cells of 5A are far less than 8F or McfR (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that 8F and McfR have chemotaxis towards succinate and the capacity of chemotaxis of 8F and McfR towards succinate are almost equal. Compared with chemotaxis towards malate, both of "

Thanks to their suggestions, we attained a more comprehensive understanding of the practical conditions and improved our own project.
Mingxian HUANG
Editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website:
We interviewed Mingxiang Huang, the editor of the official account of China Aquaculture Website, the largest online aquatic products market and the communication platform of fish raisers.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
The information and suggestion we obtained from this interview inspired us to go to synthetic biology for help. We expect to use genetically engineered bacterium to solve this problem. Let’s find a solution to detect and degrade ammonia-nitrogen pollution in a cheap and easy way!
Zhisheng YU
Professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in UCAS
In order to customize our project to practical conditions, we interviewed Zhisheng YU, professor of Energy and Environmental Microbiology in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Key point
The water pollution is severe in China, and aquaculture waste water contributes a lot to the ammonia-nitrogen pollution.
The current methods of ammonia-nitrogen degradation are circulating stagnant water and using activated sludge.
Administration and proper guidance is needed for fish raisers in the rural area.
It is important to concern about bio-safety when applying engineered bacteria to ponds.
Prof. YU raised up many issues that we had never concerned before and inspired us to think more comprehensively. Let’s divide the detection part and the degradation part, and do more things on bio-safety!
Mr. XU
Technician of Yancheng Cheng Dong foul water purifying factory
Does the use of bacteria in water purification have any reference meaning to the degradation of ammonia in fish pond? We interviewed Mr. XU to find out the answer.
Key point
Activated sludge which is cultivated by their workers has been used in the factory.

After 2 weeks of selection on hygromycin B the foci were harvested and expanded. The cells seemed to recover fast and moreover the red dots nearly disappeared leaving only the membrane of the scA-receptor cells illuminated by mRuby.
High resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy
In order to obtain high resolution confocal fluorescence images from our receptor constructs we transfected the Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells line with the respective plasmids. Shortly before the end of the project Christoph came up with the idea to include a trafficking signal to the C-terminus of the receptor proteins that is described to increase the surface presentation of receptors by sorting them intracellularly towards the cell membrane. The sequence of this trafficking signal is DFFdDFFJDFJDKJFKFDJFD (aagagcaggatcaccagcgagggcgagtacatccccctgg accagatcgacatcaacgtgGGCGGCttctgctacgagaacgaggtgtaa) [2] and we have inserted it into the assembled BioBrick device using PCR cloning. After the transfection of the receptor plasmids cells were stained with the following reagents: Hoechst dye for the nuclear staining at 405 nm; Alexa488-bioting to stain biotin binding proteins; mRuby3 which is a part of the receptor and is expected to show a membrane localization and Dy634-antiA3C5-Fab. The staining was followed by three washing steps with PBS. Following this staining procedure the cells were mounted on a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). The results for each fluorescence channel are given in the following figure (see Fig. ???).

6. CAT-Seq data processing and dynamic range assessment
The final step of CAT-Seq workflow is sequencing the prepared DNA library embedded with biomolecule activity using the Nanopore.
Movie 7. Nanopore DNA sequencing.
Data processing and pipeline preparation
For every analysis, the sequencing reads were basecalled using ONT Albacore v2.3.1 and demultiplexed using Japsa Package ( https://github.com/mdcao/japsa ). The demultiplexed reads were binned to different folders using our NanoCycler.sh script. To identify whether a cytosine base is methylated we used a forked version of SignalAlign (Rand et al. 2017) tool (GitHub branch: kmer_event_alignment). First, we trained our own HMM using a control sequencing run of a CAT-Seq Esterase gene amplified with only the reference nucleotides (dATP, 5’-mdCTP, dGTP, dTTP). The resulting HMM was used for all the downstream analyses involving methylation basecalling.
After demultiplexing, every sample is analyzed using SignalAlign and our prepared HMM to estimate probabilities that a k-mer in the sample contains product cytosines. Since the probability that a methylated cytosine will be incorporated at a specific site is uniform, the posterior probability distributions of having a methylated cytosine for every kmer are bimodal, with one peak close to 0, and the other close to 1 (Figure 18).
Figure 18. Example density plot of posterior probability frequencies for all kmers of different samples to have methylated cytosines.
However, this does not cause problems when calculating the mean for the same kmer. Ideally, if our sequenced molecules were uncut, we could calculate the means for every long read kmer and estimate an error, however due to this limitation we are only able to calculate errors between technical replicates.
To decrease noise in our analysis pipeline, for every experimentwe select k-mers that differentiate well between the control runs, where either only reference or the product cytidine was used. The thresholds for good differentiation are selected as an average probability for the sample kmers to have product cytosines, in the range of 0 - 0.2 for the reference and 0.4 - 1.0 for the product cytidine control samples. After filtering for the selected k-mers we then extracted the mean probability for every sample and"

We also discussed about possible opportunities of comparing our work and validating each other’s project by exchanging targets and compare our results on the diagnosis, an idea that was never realized, due to time limitations.
Also, since the iGEM Bulgaria team did not participate in the InterLab study and our team was short on silica beads, they were willing to send us their own, which would arrive faster than those send by the iGEM Headquarters. Thanks to their immediate response, we were able to complete our InterLab study in time, without any problem.
Finally, we had a great time showing the team around our city and we presented them our lab space and our University’s campus!
iGEM Thessaloniki 2018 Team
Through our communication with the only other team from Greece this year and with the help of Dr. Konstantinos Vavitsas (University of Queensland) we came up with the idea of organizing a workshop in order to introduce Synthetic Biology to a wider audience. The “SynBio Workshop: The principles of engineering life” was held at the National Technical University of Athens and throughout its course we collaborated with the team members of iGEM Thessaloniki 2018. We worked together in order to create the educational material for the presentations and to find donors for the event. Two members of the iGEM Thessaloniki Team came to Athens to provide hands on assistance during the final steps of setting up and executing the workshop. Since none of us had any previous experience organizing such a huge event, it was truly a valuable collaboration and through it we managed to overcome many issues that arose and acquire new skills.
iGEM Greece 2017 Team
Since only one undergraduate team from Greece had ever participated in the iGEM Competition, when we decided we were interested in participating ourselves, we had a plethora of questions concerning many aspects of the process. The iGEM Greece 2017 team members were quick and eager to answer all of our questions and give us guidance through the first months of setting our team up.
Also, as the iGEM Greece team members had more lab experience, they gave us useful tips and helped us many times with troubleshooting. The iGEM Greece 2017 Team also participated in the SynBio Workshop by presenting their project.
iGEM Berlin 2017 Team
The Berlin diagnostX 2017 Team had a very similar project to ours, so they were in a unique positions to give us more information about the toehold switch mechanism. The team,"
Cologne-Duesseldorf,2017,Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf#Eric_-_-_TEXT.html," Zhou et al. 2016 ). This effect can be used as a tool for engineering membrane permeability by knocking out or overexpress both genes. A knockout would lead to an increased permeability and one could think of an opposite effect in case of overexpression, but this has not been shown yet.
INP1
The INP1 knockout was designed after the skype call of Prof Dueber, who recommended us, decoupling of peroxisomes from cytoskeleton in order to improve the secretion efficiency. INP1 is responsible for the tethering of peroxisome, which would inhibit the secretion of peroxisomes.
POT1
The only protein, which is imported by the Pex7 import machinery in saccharomyces is the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (POT1). A knockout of POT1 would enable utilizing the Pex7 import for proteins of interest, which cannot be tagged at the C-terminus with pts1, without having unintended import of other enzymes.
Genomic integration of our novel Pex5 import receptor
After testing our new Pex5 import systems, which is completely orthogonal to the natural import, the next step would be to replace the endogenous system with our artificial import system. Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance (Figure 4). Afterwards the plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain which was created by our collaboration partner Aachen (double knockout strain Pex5 & Pex7).
Figure 4: Design of integration plasmid for integrating our orthogonal Pex5 import receptor.
Therefore, an integration plasmid was designed with help of the previously described yeast toolbox, containing HO locus homologies and a hygromycin resistance
The resulting yeast strain allows full control over the peroxisomal matrix proteome, by replacing the whole protein import machinery, which is the first step for creating our artificial compartment.
Outlook
Besides the genome engineering approaches, which were performed in our project one could think of more radical strategies for peroxisomal engineering. A final goal could be a “minimal peroxisome”, which contains only the proteins that are required for the biogenesis of the peroxisome and import of proteins and metabolites. On the one hand peroxisomal pathways could be redirected to cytosol or other organelles and one the other hand endogenous metabolic pathways could be redirected to our novel artificial compartment by changing the protein localization signal in the yeast genome"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#ImprovePart_-_-_TEXT.html," traditional LB medium was much so complicated for analysis that we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture and our first task was to determine best culture conditions.
At the beginning, we used basic M9 medium for bacteria culture (see notebook for composition) and applied different NH4Cl concentration to induce differentiated fluorescence intensity. We detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 using Cytation Multi-Mode reader of bacteria culture over a 10-hour range at 37℃. No fluorescence signal was detectable (the first bar in Figure 1). We hypothesized it was because basic M9 medium was short of nutrients for bacteria growth and protein expression.
To ameliorate growth conditions of these bacteria, we added 340mg vitamin B1 and 2g casamino acid per liter basic M9 medium and detected fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. This time, fluorescence signal was detected; nevertheless no apparent difference in fluorescence intensity was visible between bacteria cultured under different ammonium concentration (Figure 1). We speculated that high concentration of casamino acid, which also provides nitrogen for bacteria growth, masked the difference in ammonium concentration.
Therefore, we prepared M9 medium with same Vitamin B1 concentration but different casamino acid concentration ranging from 0.2‰ to 2‰ (see notebook ) and tested fluorescence intensity and OD600 of bacteria culture for 10 hours. Bacteria growth curves and signal-noise ratio of fluorescence intensity under different casamino acid concentration were analyzed simultaneously. Results showed that the optimal relative casamino acid concentration is 0.3 where our bacteria not only grew properly but also exhibited apparently different responses to different ammonium concentrations in medium (Figure 1,2). Eventually, we fixed our medium composition for characterization of different NtrC-regulated promoters (see notebook ). This modified M9 medium was named “working medium”
Selection and characterization of promoters
To evaluate signal-noise ratio, response delay and strength of the three promoters glnAp2, glnHp2 and astCp, we analyzed bacteria growth curves and dynamics of fluorescence intensity. Results showed that all three promoters responded to low-ammonium environment at similar rates while glnAp2 demonstrated a significantly higher signal-noise ratio and signal strength compared to the other two promoters (Figure 3,4,5). Thereby, we decided to use glnAp2 in our working system.
Next, we reduced ammonium addition in our working medium (ranging from 0 to 0.02-fold of standard M9 medium) to study the relationship between ammonium concentration and response time"

Description of targeted drug
Bevacizumab(Avastin® anti-VEGF)
-A recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody drug.
-The first FDA approved therapy designed for angiogenesis inhibition.
-Direct against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Mechanism of drug:
Bevacizumab binds to VEGF extracellularly and inhibits VEGF from binding with VEGF receptor on vascular. By this inhibition, the uncontrollable growth of blood vessels around cancer cells can be prevented. Without the great supplement of nutrients from blood vessels, the rate of cancer cells growth will decrese. Finally, the cancer cell will shrink as the lack of nutrients[1][2][3].

Cetuximab (Erbitux® anti-EGFR)
-A recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody.
-directed against the epidermal growth factor (EGFR).
Mechanism of drug:
Cetuximab binds to the extracellular domain of the EGFR on cancer cells can help prevent the dimerization of the receptors. The inhibition of dimerization  can prevent the further intracellular signal transduction and proliferation of cancer cells[1].

Lethbridge,2010,Team:Lethbridge#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," that oligoarginine tail is indeed causing the protein to which it is attached to localize within the microcompartment. We chose to utilize a technique known as fluorescent resonance energy transfer1 (FRET) to verify localization. In FRET, when a dye pair comes into close proximity to one another, one dye (the donor) will transfer some of its energy to the second dye (the acceptor). This will cause the acceptor to fluoresce without direct excitation.  The dye pair we have chose is CFP as the donor and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as the acceptor.
Here we investigate the ability of BBa_K331033 to produce CFP and emit light at its characteristic emission wavelength.
Method
In order to characterize the tetracycline repressible CFP (BioBrick BBa_K331033 ), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP- BBa_E0020 ) with an oligoarginine tag fused to the C-terminus ( BBa_K331025 ) (and preceded by a ribosomal binding site – BBa_B0034 ) was synthesized. We used our Red/White 3-Antibiotic assembly method to add a tetracycline repressible promoter ( BBa_R0040 ) for constitutive expression of the fusion protein. This construction yielded BioBrick BBa_K331033 .
The BioBrick containing plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. These cells were grown to an OD600 of approximately 0.7 in LB media, and diluted 1:10 with MilliQ H2O immediately prior to analysis by fluorescent spectroscopy.
This dilution of cells was excited at 439 nm, and the emission spectra was read from 444 nm to 650 nm.
Results
Fluorescence at 476 nm was observed. This peak, along with a shoulder occurring at approximately 510 nm is consistent with results obtained by McRae1et al. in their rapid purification of ECFP.
Conclusion
The BioBrick BBa_K331033 that we constructed generates CFP in the absence of tetracycline, as expected.
Future Directions
We will assembly this into a single biobrick which can differentially express CFP/YFP and lumazine synthase for confirmation (through FRET) that the oligoarginine tail can be utilized to localize proteins within a modified lumazine synthase microcompartment.

EPF-Lausanne,2011,Team:EPF-Lausanne#Notebook#July2011_-_-_TEXT.html,"Lac-T4Lysis fragments, for the Gibson assembly of the reporter plasmids. For both fragments, high quantities of specific product were yielded, though the backbone also contains large amounts of non-specific product.
For the backbone, lower annealing temperatures yield more product, as expected. The non-specific product seems relatively unaffected by annealing temperature (or it may decrease slightly at lower temperatures). The unspecific product present in large amounts is of similar length to the RFP gene, which is also present on the backbone template --- but determining its origin is unnecessary: it doesn't contain an antibiotic resistance gene, so plasmids assembled from it would not allow culture growth in the amplification step.
The T4 Lysis cassette fragment is a little too small. It could be due to GelRed affecting migration speed (according to Alina, it happens with large amounts of DNA), or it could indeed be an undesired product of shorter length. Please note the product quantities are barely affected by temperature (to the extent we can eyeball from the gel), whereas the expected primer melting temperatures are between 52° and 57°C, so we do not expect any product with 65°C annealing steps.
The assembly step was started. Transformation can be started tomorrow morning.

The sequencing reaction this time went good therefore the plasmid is definitely the one expected. Alessandro transformed and plated the plasmid to perform the day after the colony PCR just to optimize the protocol (this will be our positive control) for this technique that will be used to screen the gibson assembly.
Since seems to be some debris in the SOC medium bottle, we also plated it (under the same conditions of the cells) to test if something grows. Alessandro also tested the OD of the medium after 1 hour of incubation and no significant difference was found.
Douglas transformed and plated the Gibson-assembled reporter plasmids at the same time as Alessandro's plasmids. He later transformed it in a different E. Coli colony that over-expressed LacI, and therefore has a reduced probability of expressing the holin (from the lysis cassette) before they synthesise enough LacI to repress it.

OUC-China,2012,Team:OUC-China#Project#Sensor#GoalandDesign_-_-_TEXT.html," each TCS are all transcribed in the same polycistron. Moreover, it has been proved that HK translation rates are significantly lower than RR which results in all-or-none behavior. This kind of behavior shows high stochastic noise which seriously interferes function of the system. So we construct an amplifier to raise the number of HK molecules to ensure the robustness and sensitivity.  To verify the feasibility of this method, we firstly constructed an amplifier composed of constitutive promoter J23106 and HK phoR. If our amplifier could increase the fluorescence value, we could confirm that it works as expected. The experiment is still in progress due to time limit.
3.4Construct of chimeric chemoreceptor & RBS selection for appropriate expression rate
Since our experiment hasn’t got to this step, we will discuss it in our future work column .
Modeling
Since our modelers have some problem with the construction of complex topological network as well as limited time, we took modeling examples by Kierzek, A. M[5] for better design. Due to the notable phenomenon of relatively high stochastic noise in TCS, we chose the Gillespie algorithm to simulate the whole reaction process involved in TCS. The table with empirical constants and propensity functions of TCS is shown here . and we try to change the constants of translational and transcriptional process for better understanding of the mechanisms.
Fig. This is the Gillepse’s algorithm simulation of the variation of reporter genes with changing time.The x axis represents the time range and the y axis represents the molecules of reporter. (A)was run under 0.8 transcription rate of HK which is similar to the situation where J23106 is upstream of HK generator. (B)was run under 0.3 transcription rate of HK. Both of them are assumed to accept the same intensity of environmental signals by the same ratio between phosphorylated HK/non-phosphorylated one. The results show that higher HK transcription rate, which suggests higher HK molecules in the cell, exerts significant influence on the responding time and stochastic noise of the system. (A) with much more HK molecules show shorter inducing time , higher reporter molecules and more induced cells when compared with (B). It is a strong evidence for the feasibility of constructing a HK amplifier to reduce stochastic noise and enhance the response speed.
Designing schemes
Although there are still a lot of works to do with phosphate- and nitrate-sensitive sensor, we have established an essential design to link up with ratio sensor. After discussing with my team member, I proposed that the phosphate sensor should be biobricked"

Buenos_Aires,2012,Team:Buenos Aires#Results#Bb1_-_-_TEXT.html," standard restriction enzymes
The restriction sites used for RS1-3  have to be different from the ones used in the BioBricks standard. The standard RE for BioBricks are EcoRI, NotI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI.
Unfortunately, NotI was our candidate for RS3, so we have a problem here. There are different solutions. We can either use two restriction sites instead of RS3, one for each plasmid, or we can change the BioBrick standard to something like RFC[21] (Berkeley standard) that has no NotI restriction site.
An other option would be to use the restriction sites in the prefix and suffix to clone the construct into the expression plasmid. This is appealing because we don´t need new REs. Anyhow we would need to include a RS in the 5’ end to be able to directionally clone into pCM180. The new design would look something like Figure 6.
Figure 6: Alternative scheme for the restriction sites
If we make RS4 a BamHI site, we can directionally clone the construct into both plasmids (pCM180 and pEG202 ) by cutting with BamHI and NotI. In this design we would not need RS1 and RS3, but we can include them just in case we need to clone them into an other vector.
Regarding RS2 we need a restriction enzyme that produces cohesive ends, codes for acceptable amino acids, is easily available and not used in an other part of the construct. Some candidate RE are listed in Table 9.

Probably any of them will work, but the trojan peptide needs to be basic so the HindIII site looks better suited.  If we want to remove the trojan, we will have to clone the construct into a vector with no HindIII site. One way to do this is to clone it into pBluescript in such a way that the HindIII restriction site of the MCS is removed.
Looking at Figure 5 we can see that if we cut pBluescript with XhoI and PstI, the HindIII site is removed.  If we make RS1 -> XhoI (which is easily available) we can cut the construct with these"
