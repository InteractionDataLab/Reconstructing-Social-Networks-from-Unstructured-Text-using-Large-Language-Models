USTC_Software,2009,Team:USTC Software#hoWAlgorithm_-_-_TEXT.html,"The fitness value is also stored.) This value is called pbest. Another ""best"" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value, obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle. This location is called lbest. when a particle takes all the population as its topological neighbors, the best value is a global best and is called gbest.
The particle swarm optimization concept consists of, at each time step, changing the velocity of (accelerating) each particle toward its pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO). Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random numbers being generated for acceleration toward pbest and lbest locations."" (cite from the website)
Why PSO?
In past several years, PSO has been successfully applied in many research and application areas. It is demonstrated that PSO gets better results in a faster, cheaper way compared with other methods. Compared to GA, the advantages of PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The most important reason we choose to implement this algorithm into our software is that this algorithm is easy to realize parallelization. Since the most time-consuming part in our scheme is the optimization of parameters for a given topological structure. If we cannot find a efficient optimizer, it is impossible to deal with systems contains more than five or six nodes. parallelization of the optimization process will be implemented in our next version.
Basic Formulas of PSO
First we must be clear with several concepts:
particle:have a position and a velocity, fly through parameter space
velocity: velocity of a particle in the parameter space
pbest: The best solution a particle has achieved so far
lbest: Best solution obtained so far by any particle in the neighbors of the particle
gbest: The best solution achieved by all particles so far
Parameters used in PSO algorithm:
Number of Particles:
learning factors <math>c_{1}</math>, <math>c_{2}</math>
inertial factor <math>w</math>
range of parameter and velocity on each dimension
optimization threshold
The particles update their positions and velocities with following equation:
<math>v[] = w*v[] + c_{1}*rand()*(pbest[]-postion[]) + c_{2}*rand()*(gbest[] - position[])</math>
<math>position[] = position[] + v[]</math>

Our biosensor works with a GHB/GBL inducible operon obtained from Agrobacterium tumefaciens on the one hand, and a GABA inducible operon from Bacillus subtilis on the other hand. Our GBL/GHB sensor has been tested in vivo, in our newly established assay PRIA (plasmid repressor interaction assay) and has been proven functional in our CFPS (cell free protein synthesis) assay as well as in cell extract lyophilized on paper.

Background information
Pharmacology and toxicology of GHB/GBL
The maximum amount of GHB in the blood plasma is found 20-40 minutes after ingestion. At this time, the drug  reaches its peak effect on behavior. About 100 mg/ L may cause euphoria and disinhibition, while 500 mg/L may have deadly consequences and causes respiratory depression ultimately leading to circulation failure. About 1-5 % of the ingested substance are recoverable in urine. The time window for the detection is unfortunately very small (3-10h) ( Busardò and Jones 2015 ). This decreases the chance of detecting drug intoxications, because cases are often reported too late.
Date rape drugs in numbers
While it is commonly assumed that date rape drugs pose a threat to women, recent studies show an increased portion of male victims. In the emergency department in Barcelona, 505 cases of GHB intoxication were reported during the years 2000-2007, 68% of which were men. The mean age was 24.7 years. Of all patients, 97 % developed symptoms in public places ( Galicia et al. 2011 ). In our area, it was difficult to obtain numbers of cases. No studies or hospital data was available, in part because of data protection reasons. According to the helpline at our university, 3 cases of suspected intoxication with date rape drugs were reported by women at our university in the year 2014, while the local police recorded no cases. This is probably due to the small time window in which the detection of the ingestion is possible. Mrs. Frese, who works at the helpline at our university, estimates the dark figure to be a lot higher, because victims are often frightened and wait too long to seek help. “A test strip would be a valuable tool that could effectively prevent crimes.” Mrs. Frese told us"

UrbanTundra_Edmonton,2016,Team:UrbanTundra Edmonton#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html,", secondary payloads such as cubesats have very little impact on the overall fuel requirements.
There are cases where cubesats are the primary payload, in which case the impact is significant, but this is currently a very, very small fraction of all rocket launches.  We will be seeing this more over the next 10 years though.
Regarding our bacteria, in theory, a bioreactor can be seeded with an extremely small volume of culture and since the biomass required for the bacteria could be sourced from the waste of the colonists, there potentially need not be an excess amount of biomass needed to be sent to Mars solely for the bacteria. Considering this, would you say that this possible solution to oxygen production on Mars presents weight-oriented benefits as compared to a chemical method of producing oxygen (where the reactants need to be brought to Mars and become depleted over time) or the electrochemical conversion of Carbon Dioxide with the MOXIE apparatus (which requires high operating temperatures)?
Mr. Nokes: Yes.
That said, I don’t know much about all the different methods of generating oxygen from other compounds, so my agreement is based solely on what you have told me: that your bioreactor solution uses matter that can be found in situ, or that is a byproduct of a process that will be on Mars when humans go there.  In this case, the process is human digestion and the by-product is human excrement.
The thing to note is that we are entering the commercial space age.  This means that there is an explosion in options for getting into space, and that will drive launch costs down in such a way that groups like yours can focus entirely on getting your process right and maximizing it’s efficiency, durability, and functionality, without worrying too much about mass constraints.
I’m not saying mass constraints will disappear.  Your system will still need to be optimized for mass.  However, that won’t be the primary objective.  The primary objective is that it works, and that it does the job it was designed to do in the most efficient way possible.
Also, kudos for working on a process that involves handling fecal matter.  I feel human excrement is an extremely undervalued resource.  ;)
Charles Ross, HI-SEAS paticipant
To our surprise, Mr. Nokes actually had a colleague, Mr. Charles Ross, who had participated in a Martian mission simulation, called HI-SEAS. We were lucky to also ask him a few question regarding his contribution to this simulation, and about the conditions needed for sustained living on Mars and his responses are featured below.

Split luciferase complementation assays have primarily been done in mammalian cells lines (HEK293T notably), and I have not seen a paper where they have been done in yeast. I saw one paper in which it was done in Arabidopsis. I see no significant reason it cannot be used in yeast, given that the only requirements are that the two fragments are in the same cellular compartment, and that luciferase be able to function in its native state in yeast, which it can. Also, appropriate luciferins must be provided. This may pose a problem with the coelentarazine, because of the problems mentioned with multidrug resistance peptide P? Luciferin will also be an issue because you need low pH for it to be taken up, but we can examine the use of esterified luciferins.  Upon further examination the study of esterified luciferins was done in mammalian cells and in bacteria, but not in yeast. Further searches yielded no information about use of esterified luciferins in yeast (Craig et al, 1991). It appears that luciferase is not as commonly used in yeast as LacZ.   Conditions for luciferin uptake. We need to use D-luciferin. Addition of luciferin was done in the following manner: “D-luciferin (1 mM, 100 μl) in 0.1 M Na citrate buffer (pH 3.0 or 5.0) was pipetted into thewells containing induced cultures. The plate was briefly shaken and then immediately measuredusing a Victor multilabel counter (Perkin-Elmer Wallac, Turku, Finland) in the luminescence mode, using 1 s counting time. The light emission levels are expressed as RLU (relative light units = luminescence value given by the luminometer) and the normalized luminescence was calculated by dividing the RLU value of the induced culture by that of the blank solvent”  (Leskein et al, 2003).    Peroxisomal targeting of luciferases. Insect luciferases contain a peroxisomal targeting signal at their C terminus, Ser- Lys-Leu (Leskein et al, 2003).

B) Results of the luciferase assay, showing luminescence in relative luminescence units (RLU) as a function of time for the previously described three different signal peptide constructs as well as a control construct containing no signal peptide. C) Detection of secreted luciferases in the medium via a Western Blot, using an anti-Strep-tag II antibody as well as an alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody for detection.
Discussion: The choice of signal peptide was nailed down
As would be expected, the EGFR signal peptide construct showed the lowest level of secretion. Although one might think this could also be attributed to a lower functionality of the signal peptide sequence itself after being translated, the lower secretion level is more likely to stem from lower translation initiation levels. Almost completely missing a 5’ UTR as well as a Kozak sequence, slower translation initiation (being a rate-limiting step) is likely to have lowered the level of translated protein in total. The constructs containing the Igκ and the BM40 signal peptide, on the other hand, contain a longer 5’ UTR as well as the Kozak consensus sequence, and thus result in higher secretion levels. Since the BM40 signal peptide hereby showed the highest secretion levels, it was thus incorporated into the receptor constructs.
Other receptor elements: stability and detection
Apart from the functional parts that mediate the (strept)avidin-biotin interaction, other elements in the receptor were designed to make sure it is optimally translocated to the membrane, as stable as possible, and easily detectable.
EGFR transmembrane domain
For anchoring in the membrane, we decided to use a type-I membrane protein, which has a single membrane span with defined localization of N- and C-terminus out- and inside of the cell, respectively. As the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has already been successfully used in the iGEM project of Freiburg 2008, we decided to base our project on the same transmembrane domain.

So probably it's possible to detect most of the fluorescent proteins, you just need the right filter combination and a flash which can excite the relevant protein.
Does fluorescence photography work on paper?
We showed that fluorescence imaging of liquids in quite high amounts is possible with our approach. But does it also work with small volumes and on paper? To assess this we took normal laboratory filter papers. (MN 827 B from Macherey and Nagel, C 350 L and FN3 from Munktell and a laboratory filter paper from Merck), put 5 µL of the lysates on the paper and took photos with our filter systems. Exemplary the results of the laboratory filter paper from Merck are shown in the figure below. The other filter papers showed the same results. In the first row dilution series of purified GFP were added to the paper discs. In the second row sfGFP lysate were added, in the third row mRFP lysate was used and in the last row lysat without sfGFP and mRFP were added to the paper discs. The top photo was taken without any filter. As you can see, there is no fluorescence visible. The picture in the middle was taken with the filter combination for sfGFP. In this picture you can see two glowing paper discs in the first and in the second row. So fluorescence detection of 5 µL GFP on paper works up to a concentration of 17,5 mmol/L.In the bottom picture the mRFP filters were used. Three paper discs of the third row are red. So it's possible to detect the mRFP lysate up to a 1:10 dilution.
We added 5 µL of lysate to the paper disc and photographed it with the different filter combinations. In the first row dilution series of purified GFP were added to the paper discs.

Tec-Monterrey,2018,Team:Tec-Monterrey#Improve_-_-_TEXT.html," specific parts, however, they did obtain successful recombination of a target DNA into the genome with a variant of this part with the same principle. From their work, as well as that from Farzadfard, a different design for this construct is proposed, where is it adapted for the implementation of Cas1 and Cas2 proteins, instead of a recombinase, for the integration of target DNA to the bacteria's genome.
Pyear-GFP composite: BBa_K381001
This part holds a cassette for the expression of GFP in the presence of nitrates. The original composite part consists of a promoter (Pyear) silenced by a protein NsrR, which is natively produced by Escherechia coli and a cassette for expression of a GFP. NsrR protein is inhibited by nitrate ions, so that in its presence the cassette expresses the GFP and fluorescence is observed. The problem from this construct is that under basal conditions without the presence of nitrate ions, there is leaking activity in the promoter which produces GFP. To solve this problem, a new cassette for the expression of NsrR was made to overexpress this inhibition factor and reduce the leaking activity in the promoter region.
Improved Parts
In the integration of a DNA spacer into bacteria's CRISPR loci by means of Cas1-Cas2 integrase activity, the target DNA sequence to be deliberately inserted must be produced. This sequence is generated following the same basis as the SCRIBE system: a reverse transcriptase that retrotranscribes a retron sequence. Improved Part BBa_K2761010 contains two promoters responsible for the production of this DNA message. For reading contaminants in water reservoirs, construct BBa_K2761011 was made to improve the expression of GFP by the Pyear promoter in basal conditions. This improvement helps in reducing background noise and leaking effects that are naturally found in this cassette.
Inducible message generator (RT/msr-msd): BBa_K2761010
Integrating a synthetic DNA sequence into the genome of a bacteria can be quite difficult. This problem was faced by IGEM team UIUC Illinois using the SCRIBE system. To improve this part a histidine tag was added to the retrotranscriptase of the system. Using this approach it is possible to determine whether or not there is a production of the retrotranscriptase. To visualize the protein, a Western Blot is necessary. This improvement would act as a mid-point to achieve integration. Once there is the presence of the protein, then it is possible to see its activity. If the activity is not seen, then its"

Biofilms
Procedure: Degrading the July 17 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 17 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean and Lysol. 3200 μL of solution was added to each Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Two of the Petri dishes had been degraded. The other three from July 17 were washed with water once before being placed back in the 37 ˚C incubator. The goal of these three biofilms is to see if they can still grow and maintain the RFP biofilms.
Procedure: Reculturing July 17 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms, 200 μL of LB media was added to one well for each Petri dish that had been degraded with cleaner.
The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the "

On peut alors distinguer trois types de risques majeurs :
Le premier, les micro-organismes peuvent sortir de leur zone de confinement, proliférer sans le moindre contrôle et contaminer l’environnement, causant des dommages réparables ou non.
Ensuite, les organismes synthétiques peuvent développer, dans un environnement ouvert, des effets secondaires non détectés lors des phases de tests.
Pour finir, il est également important de prendre en compte le risque de bioterrorisme. Des Etats-voyous, des organisations terroristes ou encore des actions individuelles peuvent exploiter la biologie synthétique à des fins hostiles.

Libération accidentelle
Il n’a pour le moment jamais été fait mention de libération d’Organismes Génétiquement Modifiés (OGM) dans l’environnement. Il est probable qu’un OGM soit moins compétitif par rapport aux souches sauvages et ne persiste pas dans l’environnement. Cependant pour éviter tout débordement, la communauté scientifique a mis en place différents moyens de confinement :
Le confinement physique : C’est le plus utilisé ; il classe notamment les bactéries et agents pathogènes en 4 classes et détermine les obligations à suivre pour leur manipulation.
Le confinement trophique : Il s’agit de rendre le microorganisme dépendant de substances rares ou inconnues dans la nature, de manière à ce qu’il ne puisse pas se développer sans intervention humaine.
Le confinement sémantique : Il est encore à l’état de développement. Celui-ci consiste par exemple en une modification du code génétique ou en la mise au point de nouveaux acides nucléiques, appelées XNA où le sucre ne serait ni un désoxyribose ni un ribose, ce qui évite la transmission de gènes.
Un dernier moyen serait l’ajout de gènes suicides dans le génome du microorganisme détruisant la bactérie une fois sa fonction réalisée.

Introduction
The ultimate goal of our project is to demonstrate biofilm dispersal of a fully assembled wound dressing, consisting of a spider silk scaffold to which a variety of biofilm-degrading 'combat proteins' had been conjugated. Whereas this final test of our project remains to be performed, we have demonstrated that the key components of our SMITe  system work as expected. There are three steps to our goal:
Step 1: Prove that the combat proteins possess antagonistic activity against clinically relevant bacteria. This includes demonstrating their ability to inhibit or degrade biofilms as well as certain combat proteins' bacteriolytic activities.
Step 2: Prove that Sortase A may be used to conjugate biofilm-dispersing enzymes to spider silk.
Step 3: Prove that the finished product, combat proteins conjugated to spider silk by using Sortase, is capable of disrupting biofilm.
So how did we test this?
Kirby-Bauer tests and Crystal Violet Biofilm assays have been carried out investigating step 1, a more detailed procedure of how these methods work is described below.
SDS-PAGE has been performed to analyze the conjugation reaction of Sortase A described in step 2.
Unfortunately, we have not acquired any results to confirm Step 3. However, we do believe that we have shown a proof of concept by successfully testing our two main hypothesis separately.
Kirby-Bauer
A fast procedure to characterize a compound's bacteriolytic or bacteriostatic activity. Filter papers soaked in crude cell lysates containing our combat proteins were placed on agar plates onto which TOB1 E.coli had been spread. Around the filter papers, halos with impeded bacterial growth could be observed, indicating a bacteriolytic or bacteriostatic activity of our combat proteins.
Biofilm Assay
The second method used to characterize our combat proteins was a crystal violet biofilm assay. Cultures of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa were allow to form biofilm and subjected to treatment using cell lysates containing our combat proteins. The biofilm was subsequently stained with crystal violet and the absorbance measured.
Two different effects were assessed:"

Blogging Synthetic Biology
Introduction
For one of our human practice projects, our team investigated the current development of synthetic biology in some of the Asian countries. While doing research, we found out that synthetic biology is really a new field in science and that is not well-known in Asia. In fact, when some of our members tried to research information about synthetic biology in Cantonese, we could not find any webpages dedicated to share information about synthetic biology for the public in Hong Kong. To address this observation, we have decided to use an easily accessible platform called Google Blogger. This blog will be used as a means to introduce synthetic biology, share our experience and our project, and report current events related to synthetic biology. It will be written in Chinese and English so that the vast majority of people in Hong Kong can read it easily and pay more attention to this new field in science. By providing holistic and informational blog posts, we aim at raising the public awareness to synthetic biology.

Riboregulator Characterization
Introduction
Riboregulator is a type regulatory RNA that can regulate translation. One component of the riboregulator system,       cis-repressing RNA, crRNA, contains a cis-repressing sequence which is located at the 5’ of the RBS and the gene of interest.      When the transcript is formed, the cis-repressing sequence can form a loop to form complementary base pairs with the RBS and blocking the ribosome's entry       to RBS. crRNA is commonly called “lock” because it “locks” the translation of proteins. When there is a lock, we need a “key”.  The taRNA is the component of the       system that      act as a key. It can interact (in trans) with the cis-repressing sequence to unlock the RBS and therefore activate translation. The HKUST iGEM 2014       team characterized 4 riboregulator already available in the Part Registry and 1 riboregulator introduced by our team.

In the assays three control plates were made: A negative control containing E. coli strain DH5alpha which does not express flagella and therefore movement in the media should be minimal.  A positive control containing E. coli strain H10407 which is a hyper flagellated class II pathogen, these bacteria should show high motility. Lastly a wild type E. coli strain MG1655 that has about 4 flagella per cell, these cells would be expected to move farther than the DH5alpha but not as far as the positive control.
The plates were incubated at 37 degrees celcius for up to 48 hours.
The assay was carried out three times. All three times pictures were taken after 24 hours and in two of the assays pictures were also taken after 48 hours. In two of the assays 8.5 cm petridishes was used, the purpose of these assays was to see if the motility of our transformants differed from the control strains. In the third assay we used 13.5 cm petridishes to observe the transformants swimming ability compared to the wild type E. coli strain MG1655 since the motility of the transformed cells seem to surpass the size of the 8.5 cm petri dishes.
All the pictures taken after 24 hours are shown in the last part of this section while the pictures taken after 48 hours are shown and described here.

In all three assays we saw that the control plates containing no antibiotics were contaminated with other bacterial colonies. We also saw that the negative control has low motility but they are not immotile. After 24 hours the negative control has not moved much but after 48 hours the length from center to edge of the colony is 1.5cm. The wild type has moved a bit farther than the negative control after 24 hours and after 48 hours the difference from center to edge of the wild type is 2.5cm. The positive"
BOKU-Vienna,2017,Team:BOKU-Vienna#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," cDNA synthesis kits for RT-PCRs) we furthermore know that MMLV RT can also initiate replication using DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with the general sequence of efficiency being DNA-oligo, tRNA, RNA-oligo22. Unfortunately, finding data on in vivo priming conditions for any heterologous reverse transcriptase in E. coli is difficult as apparently only one study has performed reverse transcription in E. coli so far23. In this work that focused on the generation of ssDNA for the creation of DNA nanostructures in vivo Elbaz et al. designed the 3’ end of their mRNA in a way so that it formed a distinct structure that on one hand acted as an transcription terminator while on the other hand it promoted efficient priming of reverse transcription by dimeric HIV RT.
So, after an extensive literature research, those were the priming conditions we found to be worthwhile to consider:
• RNA oligos transcribed in trans featuring a defined 3’ end
• DNA oligos generated using a native retroelement (e.g. retrons in E. coli; used in a similar fashion in 24)
• The tRNA corresponding to the heterologous RT (in case of MMLV tRNAPro from mouse; transcribed in trans with a defined 3’ end)
• A tRNA of the host organism (is already present in the cell, no need for worrying about primer production)
• Self-priming using a simple hairpin or a more sophisticated structure at the mRNA 3’ end like in 23.
For ease of implementation and broad host generality we opted for using RNA oligos in our “lucky shot” D.I.V.E.R.T. experiment . Nevertheless, being able to prime with a native tRNA would be most convenient. Hence, in our priming condition assay we tested 5 of the most abundant tRNAs in E. coli for initiating reverse transcription with MMLV RT.
Reintegration of the generated cDNA
Once the mRNA has been reverse transcribed and potentially mutated it has to replace the original copy of the gene of interest. Again, different methods are available:
• Site-specific recombinase-mediated recombination (analogous to recombinase-mediated cassette exchange)25,26
• Homologous recombination
For our D.I.V.E.R.T. experiment we decided to employ the FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system as described by Turan et al.25. However, extended FRT sites needed for efficient recombination are palindromic and form stable hairpins possibly acting"
ASIJ_Tokyo,2016,Team:ASIJ Tokyo#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," featured an Anderson promoter of a given strength, followed by an oSMY gene, and then PETase. This is demonstrated in the construct diagram below:
Figure 1: Diagram of ASIJ Tokyo PETase Construct
Why Anderson Promoters?
Our team chose to use Anderson promoters in our construct for their versatility and the variety of strengths they came in. It was crucial for our experiment to be able to test a range of Promoter strengths to determine which was optimal for promoting transcription of the PETase gene. Further, Anderson promoters work for most general protein expression in E. Coli systems, so we thought that it would be compatible with the PETase gene for our project.
Why osmY?
The role of osmY in our construct was to aid in secretion of PETase. osmY is a hyperosmotically induceable protein located in the periplasm, which acts as a transporter across the cell membrane. We needed the osmY within our construct to make the rate of secretion of PETase optimal, so as to increase the amount of the enzyme in solution with each PET sample. As stated prior, the method by which to expedite PET degradation is through maximizing the volume of PETase each sample is exposed to. This means increasing the rates of both the synthesis and secretion of PETase.
Abstract
In recent years, the production of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) has increased rapidly, as a result of low production costs and consumer demands.  PET is one of the most common plastic polymers, comprised of repeating monomeric subunits of Terephthalic Acid and Ethylene Glycol. It is frequently used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and clothing fibres, especially in Japan. As avid users of PET-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of PET, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. We were further inspired to pursue this goal with Keio University’s recent discovery of Ideonella sakainesis — a unique bacteria capable of PET degradation. Thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal PETase biobrick, which would be included in the iGEM database. Ultimately, our goal is to find an ideal promoter to expedite the production and secretion of PETase.

The nice thing about MediaWiki is that nearly every element in the wiki framework (the big banner on the top of the page, the table of content, the title of the page, etc.) has a unique identifier or belongs to a certain class. An identifier is specified using the HTML tag id, whereas an element can be assigned to a class called ""title"" by using class=""title"".  Consequently, to change the look of a certain element, you have to first get to know the name of the class or the identifier and then use this name to change the appearance using CSS.
To find out the name of the identifier or the class, you can either take a direct look at the source of the page, or you can use a very powerful Firefox extension to easily extract this information. Take a look at the following ""read more"" section for details about this.

b. Directed evolution
Evolution is the change in the genetic content of a population of organisms through processes                                     such as mutagenesis and natural selection. The 4.5 billion years of evolution have allowed                                     organisms to diversify and generate numerous traits or combinations of traits; however,                                     evolution itself is a slow process, and sometimes desirable traits may not be easily                                     found in nature. This can sped up by direction evolution, a method to mimic the process                                     of evolution in an artificial way. Although there are many established methods of directed                                     evolution, one of the most extraordinary technologies is SCRaMbLE, which generated synthetic                                     chromosomes in yeast. In SCRaMblE, multiple recombinations sites were included. In the                                     presence of recombinase, the sequences in the synthetic will go through random inversion,                                     deletion, or duplication events. This could potentially be applied not only to screening                                     for the yeast strains with the best performance for a particular application, but also                                     to facilitate research in the minimal genome. It is envisaged that similar system could                                     be applied to various model organisms to facilitate research.

From May 6th - June 17th of 2009 The team researched possible topics. We knew we wanted to focus on cancer, but had to start from the beginning by researching as much as could before deciding on a final approach.
June 17th, 2009 Team has decided to focus on engineering microglia to recognize and label/destroy glioblastoma stem-like cancer cells.
June 18th - 23rd, 2009 The team has begun to search for reviews on microglia cells and to find potential markers for glioblastoma stem-like cancer cells.
June 24th, 2009 We have decided to use BV-2 microglial cell line. Have begun to search for labs in America that are using it to have a less expensive shipping cost. Also, created a gant chart. This will allow us to stay on top of our project, assess and meet our goals, and keep team members responsible for being apart of the project.
June 25th, 2009 Dr. Selkoe, from Harvard Medical School, has agreed to send us a sample of BV-2 cells. We are working to secure the correct media needed for both microglia and glioblastoma cells.
June 26th, 2009 The team has decided to meet on Fridays as well as Wednesdays to allow for more face-to-face communication.
June 29th, 2009 Today the team is having its first cell-culture meeting to prepare for working with mammalian cells. Today, we will send Dr. Selkoe our information to recieve the BV-2 line.
June 30th, 2009 The team will recieve a glioblastoma line from Dr. Yu who works with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. We are meeting with a graduate student here at the university to discuss 3D culture.
July 1st - 20th, 2009 The team has been researching, buying media, finding protocols, and waiting for our cell lines to come in. Have begun inital designs of acutal constructs. Have chosen to go with two.

We tried with our guests to think about the societal issues of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, for the ethics, the law and the economy. The ethical problems the CRISPR-Cas9 technology is bringing are huge, and for most of them, unknown. The ethical problems come with what is done with the technology: therapeutical applications ex vivo or for genetical diseases, or applications on embryos and germ cells. The ethical problems come along with the question of transhumanism. The issues are rising because of the simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, authorizing a wider scientific audience to edit the genome.
About the legal framework, our speakers made a comparison between the European legal framework, the process based evaluation, and the product based evaluation, and how the patentability was in Europe restrained by a principle of public order.
Meeting Stakeholders
Because we think meeting stakeholders is really important to build our project we met several of them.
As we said before, we met the professor Olivier Espéli, who helped us to shape our project. We also met Mr. David BIKARD, a reseacher at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and an expert on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology utilization. He helped us choosing which orthologous dCas9s to use for our project, in order to maintain the sgRNA/dCas9 recognition specificity.
On our Human Practices research, we met different stakeholders to think on this field. We met Agnès Ricroch is a professor at AgroParisTech school working on plants and their regulations, the professor Marc Fellous, Emeritus Professor at Paris Diderot University and Medical Doctor, Eric Enderlin a French and European Patent Attorney at Novagraaf, Geneviève Fioraso, french deputy and former minister of Higher Education and research, and Catherine Procaccia, French Senator working on a report on the economical and environnemental issues of new biotechnologies.
Those meetings helped us to define and shape our project, but also to think about the tool we were working on. We tried to meet stakeholders from the different fields involved (scientific, legal, politics), in order to have the broader view on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
iGEM Meet-Ups
We attend to two iGEM meet-ups, an European one, and an other, gathering the Parisian teams. We were part of the organisation of the Parisian meet-up.
These meet-ups helped us in two ways. First it was a great opportunity to have a feed-back from our peers. Then, we met there"

        3) The system can't be easily broken by external forces in that there is no distinct boundary between calcium carbonate rock and calcium oxalate film.
        So, this research project has chosen E. coli that has been transcribed with lipase to clean some stone relics that are covered with oil; then, we use E. coli, with transcription, that can secrete oxalate acid upon the stone relics. Therefore, there forms calcium oxalate to be protection film in order to preserve lithic relics.
        If we use chemical methods to generate calcium oxalate, we have to immerse the lithic relics in the chemical liquid; however, it is not suitable for the preservation of large-scale outdoor lithic relics. In fact, the natural existing calcium oxalate comes from the reaction of oxalate acid generated by microorganism and calcium compound on the surface of stone. This research project will utilise genetic engineering methods to ""graft"" the gene that generates calcium oxalate into Escherichia coli (E. coil).
    Then oxalate acid reacts with calcium lithic relics to generate calcium oxalate, which stimulates its natural formation process. Finally, there forms a fine layer to protect the lithic relics.

        (1) Lipase: lipase is the target gene segment of this experiment, and the gene sequence is synthesised by IDT Inc.
        (2)  Oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, abbreviation OAH, is the target gene segment of these experiments. The main function of OAH is to transfer oxaloacetic acid to oxalate acid; thus the oxalate acid reacts with the calcium ion to form calcium oxalate that preserves the relics. The target gene segment is synthesised by IDT Inc. after found in gene pool.

SUSTech_Shenzhen,2016,Team:SUSTech Shenzhen#Model#Sound_-_-_TEXT.html," measured using oscilloscope. Rm=100Ω.
To calculate the power of transducer, we measured voltages using oscilloscope.
Uo= 79.6V
Up-p=34.2V
Uo is the peak to peak voltage of transducer and its waveform was close to sinusoidal wave. Up-p is the peak to peak voltage between the two ends of Rm which was serial to the transducer, and its waveform was close to sinusoidal wave triangle wave.
Thus, the effective voltage was
U_{\text{rm}} = \frac{1}{2T}\int_{0}^{\frac{T}{2}}{U_{\text{rm}}\text{dt}}
U_{\text{rm}} = \frac{1}{4T}\int_{0}^{\frac{T}{4}}{\frac{{4tU}_{p - p}}{T}\text{dt}}
So,
U_{\text{rm}} = \frac{U_{p - p}}{4} = 8.8V
The effective current Ieff
I_{\text{eff}} = \frac{U_{\text{rm}}}{R_{m}} = \frac{8.8V}{100\Omega} = 88mA
As Uo= 79.6V, and its waveform was close to sinusoidal wave. We have effective power
W_{\text{total}} = \frac{U_{0}I_{\text{eff}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 4.8W
For ultrasonic transducer, not all power is sonic radiation power.
W_{\text{total}} = W_{a} + W_{\text{el}} + W_{\text{ml}}
Wa , Wel, Wml are respectively radiation power, dielectric power and mechanical power. [2]
According to references, we toke the acoustic-electric efficiencyηae=0.85. [2]
Then, we have the acoustic power Wa
W_{a} = \eta_{\text{ae}}W_{\text{total}} = 0.85 \times 4.8W = 4.1W
We assume the ultrasonic energy was evenly distributed on the transducer interface, that is: [3]

Mentoring IISER-Kolkata
For a team participating in the competition for the first time, IISER-Kolkata got in touch with us much before the announcement for iGEM 2018 came in. At that time, the later to-be members of these teams were busy with their project work at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore. The talk about iGEM started more or less over lunch when the topic of BioBricks came up.
Since then, we have been in constant contact regarding both lab work and administration on how to go about running the team. Being from an Institute from where teams have been participating for two years in a row, IISc-Bangalore was in the right position to mentor IISER-Kolkata with the knowledge we had gained from our predecessors. The interaction was especially valuable because it provided a more regional outlook on the issues we were facing and how we could go about solving them. From financial issues like how to go about submitted the registration fees to tips regarding cloning, the interaction shaped a large part of both the teams’ project work.
Organizing the All-India iGEM Meetup
A very important part of iGEM is the kind of interaction local teams have amongst themselves before they go for the Jamboree. Being from the same country we usually have similar problems relating to logistics and lab supplies.
This year, the IISc-Bangalore iGEM team organised the meetup where six other teams from the country participated and discussed their projects. The meetup itself was a mix of fun activities and presentations. This was followed by a poster presentation on the last day where the teams got feedback from the audience regarding their posters. A more strict analysis was done by two judges who graded the posters on multiple criteria. This feedback was sent to the teams after the meetup. Mr. Hassnain, the iGEM ambassador for Asia also joined us on the last day of the meetup to discuss after iGEM.
Other than IISc-Bangalore, the following teams participated in"
Dundee,2014,Team:Dundee#Safety#normal_-_-_TEXT.html," the design and prototyping of a set of components and practices to be utilised in the first instance by trained medical staff in the context of home-visits to cystic fibrosis patients.
Distribution and Storage of Genetically Modified Microorganisms
Sealed LB-Agar plates containing freeze-dried cultures of our modified E.coli would be distributed to cystic fibrosis clinics where they would be stored in the dark at 4 oC.
Rehydration of Freeze-Dried Cultures
On the day prior to a home-visit, water would be added to cultures with a sterile syringe via a one-way, filter-sterilizing valve and the plates incubated at 37 oC overnight. This would be carried out by a member of the clinical staff at the clinic and following training by a member of The Lung Ranger team.
Addition of Sputum to Rehydrated Cultures
On the day of testing, at the patient's home sputum samples would be collected in a sterile syringe that would then be fitted to a plate via a threaded valve (Fig 2). After ensuring that the syringe has been secured to the valve, the plunger would be depressed to add the sputum to the culture. It may be necessary, due to the variability in sputum viscosity, to aspirate Sputolysin® - a reducing agent- along with the sputum sample to sufficiently thin the sample for ease of use. the filter sterilising valve will prevent wild-type microorganisms from contacting the genetically modified bacteria inside the plate and thus removing the possibility of any uptake of transgenes by other organisms.
Processing of Samples
The plate containing a sputum sample would be agitated by hand to ensure adequate coverage of the medium by the sputum before being placed in the L.A.S.S.O. (Fig 4). After light detection, the plate would be transferred to a waste compartment by depressing the plunger-arm (Fig 5). The plunger-arm would be reset and the process can be repeated until the waste compartment is filled.
Removal of Used Culture Plates
The L.A.S.S.O. can be separated into two sections (Fig 6), allowing the waste compartment when full, to be either emptied or replaced with an empty compartment. In either case, the spent samples would be placed into a sealable bag and would be removed for autoclaving by the health worker ensuring the safe disposal of the genetically modified organisms.

Modeling
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.

Q protein's influence on R' promoter activity
As indicated in Ref(13), the Hill coefficient fitted by experiment is 6.4-3.3~6.4+3.3, which means that Q protein is very efficient in antitermination. As we don't know exactly the other parameters in this function, so we can not mimic Q protein's regulation effect for R' promoter dynamically, instead we suppose when 90% percent of Q protein have been reached, the R' promoter is fully activated
Parameters
T7 promoter transcription rate kt7 = 5 molecule/second
R' promoter transcription rate kpr'= 20 molecule/second (estimated according to the fact that it is faster than T7)
mRNA degradation rate dm = 0.05 molecule/second
protein translation rate kq = 0.1 molecule/second
protein degradation rate dQ = 0.003 molecule/second
Results
This is the Q protein level changing with time. When time= 1000s , 90% Q protein versus maximum amount haven been produced. At this time point, we assume that R' promoter is fully activated.
This figure is the Q protein level versus time, notice the zero point of time axis is set to the time point that R' promoter is fully activated.
Defining the time of adding IPTG as t=0, the simulated Q concentration increases with the structral proteins. When t≈2000s, the desired proteins reach a maximum and their growth rate decrease, when the lytic apparatus is designated to open. The entire lytic cycle lasts 35 min, which is much shorter than the Bottom-Up strategy and in the same order with the wildtype bacteriophage lambda production.
This modeling result matches our project design, where Top-Down approach uses the same transcription strategy (promoter R') as the wildtype lambda genome and Bottom-Up approach uses a engineered one (promoter T7).
At the steady state, the concentration of the structral proteins reach at 1.3×10^4. Assuming that there are 420 D or E major structral protein on the surface of one GenSniper viroin, the packaged viroin number is 3.0×10^1 per cell, which is near to the wildtype bacteriophage lambda packaging. When the density of the cells is 10 in the orders of 9, the titer of synthetic GenSniper will be 3.0×10^10 Therapeutic DNA/ml, which also meets the standard for industrialization.

DTU-Denmark,2017,Team:DTU-Denmark#Model_-_-_TEXT.html," response time above 45 minutes for certain venoms, and we should seek to reduce the response time. In doing this we would have to amplify the output of our device compared to that of just using chromoproteins such as AmilCP.
Central assumptions
Ideally we would like to do this with different enzymes, especially enzymes with a high turnover rate and a robustness towards snake venom. However, due to time constraint we decided to establish a proof of concept for using β-galactosidase as an amplifier of the snake venom cleavage reaction, using the following assumptions
- Incubation times are static (no flow or dilution through the system)
- Volume is kept constant
- The concentration of ONPG in the secondary reaction is in great excess. This means that our released reporter enzyme from reaction 1 will be saturated with substrate throughout the secondary reaction, and will catalyse reactions at Vmax throughout the incubation period
Design of the Model
We imagine a device with two chambers (CH): CH1 and CH2 (See figure 4). When testing for snake envenoming, a blood sample will be loaded into CH1 with a set volume. CH1 will contain some sort of biotinylated surface e.g. biotinylated beads. Our biobrick testing device will attach to the biotinylated surface via the ScAvidin domain, and if venom is present, the linker peptide of the biobrick device will be cleaved, thereby releasing β-galactosidase. After a certain incubation time in venom, the sample is transferred from CH1 to CH2.
Figure 4: Sketch of overall design of device for testing beta-galactosidase part. Please note that this device is purely for simplifying the explanation of this model, and it has little to do with our actual hardware device.
Primary reaction
As we needed a lot of kinetic parameters for our lacZ composite part, which would require a lot of kinetic experiments on our expressed part, we did a first iteration of our model, using a mixture of arbitrary values as well as values from literature to create a proof-of-concept that it would, in theory, be possible to determine an optimal timepoint for the incubation device to let the sample flow from CH1 to CH2.
In the first reaction, our expressed composite lacZ part (BBa_K2355313) is converted to ScAvidin and free enzyme by the reaction described in figure 5:

Re-suspend each pellet in 25 - 50 ml of washing buffer. Now your samples are ready for cell disruption, e.g. using the French Press method.
Preparation of cell-free crude extracts
This method can be applied to detect proteins, which are really strongly produced by the bacteria. The cell-free crude extract that has been obtained by this procedure can also be used for Western blotting. A drawback of this method is that you may lose some protein by proteolysis. Moreover, the amount of protein you will get is sometimes quite low.
The Material
1x PBS, pH 7.4
Lysis buffer
(recommended to add protease inhibitor: EDTA, Pefabloc, PMSF)
The Procedure
Harvest 2 ml from a B. subtilis culture that has been grown over night or to an OD600 of approximately 1 - 2 by centrifugation for 2 min at full speed.
Re-suspend the cells in 50 µl lysis buffer. Keep some ml of the lysis buffer for the Bradford assay. Incubate the cells for 30 min at 37°C and 350 rpm on an Eppendorf thermomixer.
Separate the soluble proteins from the cell debris by centrifugation for 10 min at full speed and 4°C. Transfer the supernatants into new Eppendorf reaction tubes. Determine the protein concentration and analyze your samples by SDS PAGE and Western blotting.
Cell disruption by French press
Many experiments required the disruption of bacterial cells, e.g. to purify proteins for enzyme activity assays or protein-protein interaction studies. A widely used method in our lab for cell disruption is using a French pressure cell, or simply French press. In principle, a French press disrupts the cell wall and plasma membrane by passing the cells through a narrow valve under high pressure. The name has nothing to do with the machine some people prepare their coffee in, but was named after its inventor Charles Stacy French of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
The Material
French press (small or big)
Disruption cell (bomb) Pre-cooled in a water bath or in the fridge
Re-suspension buffer Pre-cooled in the fridge or on ice
Cell pellets Frozen cells within a 50 ml falcon tube
The Procedure
All steps must be carried out on ice!
Re-suspend your cells pellet in re-suspension buffer by vortexing or pipetting up and down. Usually we use a pellet from 500 ml of cells with an OD600 of 0.8 – "

Program Description
Darwin is a software package to document changes to DNA which allows for easy, standardized, and collaborative editing on DNA data up to the genome scale. It builds off of tested and proven version control software, so the entire history of the tracked data is easy to browse and transfer. But Darwin is specifically focused on DNA data, speeding up the tracking process and offering significant security improvements from any current system.
Because Darwin uses existing version control systems, the majority of the heavy lifting is complete already; Darwin can be installed right on top of the existing software. Darwin's contribution is to parse and format the biological data so that it can be used more effectively with these systems. It uses a variety of heuristics to effectively split the data and granularize the changes made to produce change logging orders of magnitude more time- and space-efficient than any other method.
Current Status
The program produced by Vanderbilt's 2014 iGEM software team is named darwin, a Unix command-line tool to produce what are known as ""diffs"" between two genomic data files. The command to produce the diff is dwndiff, typically invoked by using:
dwndiff <file1> <file2>
This creates a file with the extension .vcscmp which can be used in typical version control systems.
The project in its current status can be found in its repository on github . Documentation on the produced software tool can be found on the Program page

Lambda red and MAGE:
Yesterday's prep produced tiny colonies on the MAGE plates and (so far) none on the kan-ZFB plates. Just in case it didn't work, we will redo the lambda red using even more DNA and perform a second round of MAGE using culture from yesterday that was not plated.

5µL kan-ZFB (about 1 mg)
recover 3 hrs
kan-ZFB: plate 100µL and 2 mL on kan plates
MAGE: plate 1µL and 10µL on amp plates
To see if the colonies on the MAGE plate knocked out HisB, we chose 24 colonies, resuspended them in water, and put half the cells in LB (complete media) and half in NM media (does not have histidine). 96 well plate, 150µL media, grown overnight at 30˚C.
ZF Expression Plasmid Ultramer and Primer Design
Today, we designed primers ZF_073 through ZF_085 as listed in the iGEM Primer Index spreadsheet.  These were basically two sets of primers: the primers to clone out the omega subunit and linker, and the ultramers that would construct the last part of the linker along with the type II binding sites and F2/F3 fingers.  One should refer to the primer list for the sequences.
Note: the annealing sequence for the ultramer overlap contained a 72 degree melting temp hairpin.  To get around this, I changed one of the codons in the F2 backbone.  The F2 backbone begins with ""FQCRIC"", and so I changed the codon for the arginine (R) from CGC to CGT, which resolved the hairpin problem.
June 30th - Bioinformatics
Updated Primer list and FASTA formatting
We ran into a small hiccup, when we were informed that we had forgotten to reverse translate the reverse primer sequences that were being appended to the generated sequence. This is because the primer sequences we were given were the sequences for the actual primers, rather than sequences to which the primers would bind. Luckily, we caught this error! We did have the re-run the generator because we had to make sure that our generated sequences did"

In the Evobody generating process we want to obtain a high affinity binding protein by directed evolution.      To further evolve binding proteins with an innate ability to interact with our target we want to mutagenize      them and thereby enable an ongoing adaptation to the target.
We successfully cloned two different approaches to in vivo mutagenesis, demonstrated and quantified      mutagenesis by reversion assays and determined the mutation spectrum by next-generation sequencing .
Cloning
We added several in vivo mutagensis parts to the iGEM parts registry

Wednesday 5/8
Today we raised sample’s concentration to run the gel electrophoresis in the final step. Joy mingling with surprise, we found that both PDE5A and GUCY1B3 were expressed in the cells. DNA strips stained by GV could be seen clearly.
Friday 7/8
Today we tested two methods of extract cGMP. The two methods were repetitive freeze-thawing and lysate.  From the test result, we found that repetitive freeze-thawing extracting cGMP was more effective. And we also used sodium nitroprusside to treat cells but it cannot enhance the cGMP concentration.
Saturday 8/8
Today we invited SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams to sharing academic experience. And we began a two-day cultivation today. We have the following arrangement today: extracting the plasmid, enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis’s learning includes that how to make up the gel and how to recycle the gel. It’s our pleasure to share our experiment experience to members of high school team. We spent a beautiful day together.
Sunday 9/8
We taught SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX teams that transformation and coating plates. At last we exchanged our ideas about projects and gave some guidance to high school students. The two-day cultivation ended in a satisfactory way.
Monday 10/8
We redesigned the αsubunit primers. We did the experiment again to find out the optimal primer. We successfully found out the best primer by summing up the experience of previous mistakes. Everything goes smoothly today.
Thursday 13/8
We learned to use RT-PCR instrument from professor Ye Yanrui. The professor taught us seriously. We were grateful for him. At last, We put knowledge to practical usage. We set the PT-PCR condition first. And then put the solution into the instrument and start to run. After two hours waiting, the expression of gene had been detected. According to the diagram from the computer, we found that the results of three sample which were silenced gene PDE5A were satisfactory.
On the other side, we did the experiment of cell transfection, and we decided to evaluate the efficiency for eukaryotic cell transfection by using GFP as a report gene in common transfection ways.

Therefore, when we advertised for our Bioengineering Summer Camp we made sure to market our camp to homeschool students in the area. As a result, many of our students who attended the summer camp were homeschooled by a parent. They were highly interested in being in the lab and hearing lectures from various college professors. These surveys also add to our future plan of holding a conference with high school teachers. We hope to have a gathering of WELS high school teachers to meet and ask them questions on the education of biotechnology in their classrooms. We would love to set up a time to come into their classrooms, or homes if they are homeschool teachers, and bring our lab supplies to demonstrate various lab procedures to their students. This would give an opportunity to spread the knowledge of biotechnology to high school students and igniting a passion that could be pursued in a future career.
Survey Results
The students were asked to agree or disagree with the statements on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Question 1
Figure 1
From the data shown here, we can see that most homeschool teachers would feel comfortable with teaching about genetic engineering and biotechnology.
Question 2
Figure 2
Most homeschool teachers surveyed felt that they had a well enough awareness of genetic engineering and biotechnology that they could effectively teach it. Of the homeschool teachers surveyed, most felt that they had a good knowledge of what GMOs were.
Question 3
Figure 3
When asked whether they would knowingly consume genetically modified products, most homeschool teachers responded negatively.
Question 4

The survey showed very strong disagreement towards the usage of GMO products in medicinal practices.
Question 5
Figure 5
Most homeschooling families disagree that GMOs should be utilized in medicinal practices but not in the production of food, which agrees with the results from our previous survey questions regarding whether families considered GMOs should be utilized in food and medicine individually.
Question 6

A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
Note
This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."

Experimental Approach
Based on the previously mentioned informations, we built a strong experimental approach that would allow us to create not only leaky mutants but regulable leaky mutants. We first generated porin mutant libraries and then we used a selection method to select the mutants of interest.
Mutant library construction
Mutagenesis tools are a very efficient mean to generate mutant proteins with new or optimized properties and functions. Not only these methods can help you probe through a construct for structurally or functionally essential residues and thereby help the understanding of proteins but it also is a powerful engineering tool. Through a proper experimental design it can generate mutant proteins with improved, optimized or novel properties and allow any ambitious synthetic biologists to mess around with protein engineering.
In our particular case, we wanted to show the rapid emergence of a new function coupled with a regulatory system through a strong but simple experimental design. And for that our lab had the perfect tool to bring to iGEM. Researcher from the Institute of Life Sciences at UCLouvain have recently developed a new method to build plasmid libraries by seamless cloning of degenerated oligonucleotides, called QuickLib (Galka et al., submitted).
As you can see in figure 1, the QuickLib method is a simple combination of the use of degenerated oligonucleotides to induce randomized mutation through PCR and the Gibson assembly method (Galka et al, sumbitted). We first generate linear fragment with a targeted randomized region and overlapping ends through PCR. Than those linear fragments are circularized back to a plasmid form thanks to the hybridization of the overlapping region and the combined action of the exonuclease, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase as described by Gibson et al. (2009).
We strongly believed that this new tool can find great purpose in synthetic biology as it allows to quickly and easily create synthetic plasmid libraries with high diversity. By including smart use of random mutagenesis and this tool in our experimental design we believed we could outmatch rational design throughput.

Guanajuato_Mx,2016,Team:Guanajuato Mx#ResultsAndDiscussions#MolecularLab_-_-_TEXT.html," tested the effect of commercial nisin on pathogenic bacteria. We found inhibitory activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus. This is not a surprise since nisin has effect on Gram positive bacteria. However, when we tested the activity against P. aeruginosa we did not  find  inhibition under the concentrations of the bacteriocin used in the assay (Figure 5). P. aeruginosa is a Gram negative bacterium and nisin has little effect unless high concentrations of the bacteriocin are used (i.e. 32 mg/L) (Giacommetti et al., 1996) or it is used in combination with other molecules. It will be necessary to test higher nisin concentrations (more than 25 U) alone or in combination with alginate lyase against P. aeruginosa biofilm to be sure if the biosensor based on L. lactis overexpressing nisin might  be useful to detect and kill the P. aeruginosa or it will be necessary to change nisin by another bacteriocin, for example microcin. We did not find nisin activity against E. coli (data not shown).

Conclusions
     Because our modules harbor genetic elements not available in the Biobricks collection, i.e. the chiA74p (or BtI-BtIIp), the alginate lyase gene and spchiA74, our efforts are focused on the amplification, cloning and test the functionality of those devices in E. coli previous to the module construction. The last, with the fact that we never received our Biobrick kits, delay our work. Alternatively,  we do not have previous reports about the cloning and expression of an alginate lyase from B. thuringiensis, in this regard this is the first time that this kind of gene is amplified from B. thuringiensis, the most important bioinsecticide worldwide. Additionally, alginate lyase genes have not been used previously in biosensors used  to destroy the P. aeruginosa biofilms, indicating that we are using a novel strategy to attack this pathogenic bacterium. Recently, we sent to sequence the"

This could mean that no other sizes are present; however, since almost all expected bands were very small, it is also possible that they can't be visualized by gel verification. Not many conclusions can be drawn from this.

The Final Threshold – Amino Acid Analyzer Result After Crude Enzyme Extraction
Since vitamin B6 presents originally in wild-type E. coli Nissle (Klijn), we decided to use crude enzyme extraction (see experiments ), so the cofactor of GAD was present in the reaction system. The same procedure was used to produce GABA. Then, the yield of GABA was measured by amino acid analyzer. Fig. 14 – Fig. 16 show the yield of GABA.
Fig. 14 Yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326006) with reaction pH 4.2 (crude extraction)
Fig. 15 Yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326006) with reaction pH 4.4 (crude extraction)
Fig. 16 Yield of GABA of E. coli Nissle (RPG- BBa_K2326006) with reaction pH 4.6 (crude extraction)
The prescense of peaks corresponding to 48 to 50 min suggests GABA was produced. The yield of GABA is calculated by:
`""Peak area of GABA yielded by E.coli Nissle""/""Peak area of pure GABA sample""**""Concentration of pure GABA sample""**""dilution factor""`. Peak areas were derived from the system report of amino acid analyzer. Concentration of pure GABA sample in this experiment was 500 mg/L, and the dilution factor was 60. Fig. 17 shows yield of GABA at 3 pH values.

The maximum GABA yield was 2976.79 mg/L, produced at pH 4.4. The modelling result suggests that the optimum reaction pH is 4.28, which is close to the optimum pH value in experiment. The result demonstrates that the optimum working temperature for GAD ranges from 4.2 to 4.6.
Future Plan
To make E. coli & Lactobacillus produce GABA stably and to avoid using an antibiotic selecting mark, we can insert gadA to the chromosome of E. coli and Lactobacillus. Also, to enhance the yield of GABA, modifying gadC to locate the glutamate gamma-aminobutyrate antiporter in E. coli cell membrane can help to transport more MSG into"

The iGEM10_Queens-Canada focus on establishing some basic parts for later users to use in C.elegans. And we decide to make use of this part, not only establish our own project but also test this part and characterize it. However, we find it being defined as “Sample It's complicated” and is not available in distributions. So we choose to have the part synthesized according to the sequence submitted by iGEM10_Queens-Canada and construct ChR2-YFP. After we construct the plasmids, we inject the plasmids into C.elegans by using the micro-injection technology. By doing that, we can control the behaviours of C.elegans such as moving forwards or twisting more effectively.
What's more,we will express GFP,YFP,mcherry in E.coli. By combining the color of microorgasims and C.elegans, we want to construct some interesting scenes to form a C.elegans' fancy world.
1.3 Worms testing and tracks recording
We test the C.elegans with the fluorescence microscope . In the testing, we can select the C.elegans in which our target gene has expressed stably. Then, we observe the movement of worms under specific lengh of wave. Finally, we select out the worms which performas expected and recording their tracks in video.
We next change the duration, the wave length and the intensity of the light we use so that we can grope how different conditions influence the movement of C.elegans in the form of table.
1.4 Tracks analysis and video edit
We analyse the video according to the frame and draw the track lines of each movement. Then we draw the curve graph based on the different conditions and the response of worms. Then, we perfect our video and label the casting part on the worm.
This technology will be helpful in the research on neuron's function and interaction. In the future, this technology may also be used in mechanical controlling system and the theraphy of movement defect.
2. Background
2.1 What is optogenetics?
Optogenetics involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels. It is a neuromodulation method employed in neuroscience that uses a combination of techniques from optics and genetics to control and monitor the activities of individual neurons in living tissue—even within freely-moving animals—and to precisely measure the effects of those manipulations in real-time"

Of course, the main focus were the scientific talks: One interesting talk was given by Hannah Wagner from the University of Freiburg, who synthesized a positive feedback loop with molecular switches. Mustafa Khammash from the ETH Zurich spoke about the application of optogenetics in synthetic biology and provided the Mosbach Colloquium with several posters about his research, which were displayed at the poster sessions. The general take-home-message was that synthetic biology is the chance to understand what life is. As Nobelist (1965) Richard Feynman said:
“What we cannot create, we do not understand.”
In addition to the science talks, a get-together ""Get to know iGEM"" was organized for current and former iGEM participants and interested parties. iGEM Hamburg, iGEM Marburg and former participants of iGEM Darmstadt, among others, attended.  We discussed how to establish the iGEM competition in an university and were given advice on conflict counseling in the team and on sponsorship. We also tried to motivate those interested in iGEM to apply for their university's team next year or even to form an iGEM team themselves.
A Visit from iGEM Bielefeld

Conversation with Philosopher – Ethics issue on synthetic biology
This year, we are using microorganisms as a machine to achieve our work and we call them “E. cryptor”. However, to the others’ point of view, we are a group of crazy scientists trying to manipulate life to do whatever we want. This is the perception of people working on synthetic biology. Therefore, we invited a philosopher to discuss with us on this issue. Below are some ethics questions that we should think more before doing experiments on living organisms.
Playing God VS Playing Evil ?
Paris iGEM 2009 and Imperial iGEM team 2009 have discussed playing-God issue by manipulating the nature in the field of synthetic biology.  Here we regard God as the God of Christianity. If we refer to the bible, it warns people who use the “grace of our God” as “a license for immorality”"" (Jude 1:4). It implies that we should not do anything that God does not allow. However, the Bible does NOT specifically talk about the subject of Synthetic biology and creating or modifying new organisms. Moreover, Genesis 1 refers God created everything (at that fixed time point). It did NOT mention if human being has the ABILITY and AUTHORITY to modify living organisms. As a result, debate is still going on to argue if gene-level modification on life or creation of artificial system of life is against God's work or not. Are the people doing synthetic biology playing God? This question is still controversial. What we want to share here are a few words for contemplation -  ""If I were to choose between playing God and Evil, I would rather be the former. "" Anonymous.
Curer VS Killer ?
Synthetic Biology opens a gateway of an array of applications currently under the practice of traditional methods, such as medicine, vaccine production, etc. For the traditional method, it is expensive and labor-intensive whereas the quality as well as the quantity cannot be guaranteed.  Creating a system by inserting gene inside bacteria, we can build a ""micro-factory"" for different antigens/antibodies and chemical production"
Stony_Brook,2018,Team:Stony Brook#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," biology. The pictures we took can not even express how rewarding the students felt with their experience in this interactive event. We approached this event by preparing an interactive and captivating activity in which participants were able to use their creativity and imagination. We learned that students are more inclined to participate and learn if activities are interactive.  
iSTEM Biotechnology Summer Scholars Program
The iSTEM Biotechnology Program is a summer program offered at Stony Brook University to high school students. In an effort to educate and engage the youth, we presented pertaining information to these students. We explained the basis of iGEM, our project, and gave a “crash course: in synthetic biology"". In an effort to liven up the program, we built upon activities used by previous iGEM teams at Stony Brook. Many students already had a basic understanding of synthetic biology and were able to ask us insightful questions. They were quite curious about the workings and implications of our project. We were more than happy to explain, leading to insightful discussions. We learned that these summer programs are paramount in fostering research opportunities for high school students. The students are able to gain basics about biology and synthetic biology. 
Involvement Fair at SBU
 The involvement fair, held every semester on campus, allows Stony Brook clubs and organizations to advertise to prospective members. An iGEM member, who is also the secretary of the Synthetic Biology Society, advertised both organizations to students at the university. With a small poster board set up, she was able to share the impact of synthetic biology to those who were not familiar with the field. Using activities from past outreach events, she was easily able to give a crash course in synthetic biology and answer common misconceptions. Using this approach, many were captivated allowing us to explain synthetic biology with a hands-on method. Those who came to our booth left with a basic understanding of synthetic biology and our project. Since those who came to our booth were of different majors, we also learned quite a bit. One member in specific inquired and advised us on various modeling aspects.

They also had the opportunity to learn how to do a fruit DNA extraction using oranges"
Valencia,2009,Team:Valencia#A short story#Osamu_-_-_TEXT.html," 3,000 jellyfish a day. My staff, my wife, my children, and some local students that we hired were of great assistance in the collection and processing of Aequorea. Dr. Johnson devised a ""jellyfish-cutting machine"" to speed up the process of cutting the ring from the animals. In 1972, back at Princeton, we succeeded in determining the structure of AF350, a part of the aequorin chromophore. By 1978, we had achieved a general understanding of the aequorin luminescence reaction.
Between 1965 and 1978, in addition to my work with aequorin, I also did research on the bioluminescence of various luminous organisms including the limpet Latia; the krill Meganyctiphanes; the worm Chaetopterus; the firefly squid Watasenia, various coelenterates, and luminous bacteria. I also studied the properties of GFP and resolved a controversy regarding the role of a dioxetane intermediate in the luminescence reaction of firefly luciferin. Those matters are detailed in my book (Shimomura, 2006).
To the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole
Dr. Johnson retired from Princeton in 1977, and I decided to move to a marine laboratory. Before leaving Princeton, I elucidated the chromophore of GFP (Shimomura, 1979). I also performed research on dinoflagellate luciferin and luminous scale worms. In 1981, with the kind arrangement made by Dr. Woodland Hastings of Harvard University and Dr. Benjamin Kaminer of Boston University, I moved to the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where I was a Senior Scientist. My wife, Akemi, worked at the MBL as my research assistant. I also accepted an adjunct professorship at Boston University Medical School.
Established in 1888, the MBL is the oldest marine laboratory in the western hemisphere. Over the years, many Japanese scientists have performed research at the MBL, including historic names such as Shosaburo Watase, Umeko Tsuda, Hideyo Noguchi, Sakyo Kanda, Katsuma Dan, Sachio Hiramoto, and Shinya Inoué. At the MBL, I continued my work to extract, purify and study the luminescent substance of many organisms, including the millipede Luminodesmus; the brittle star Ophiopsila; and several types of luminous mushrooms"

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"Cl2 was added to the medium. After centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant was mixed with 8-Hydroxyquinoline and K2CO3 for hydroxylamine detection and tested its UV absorbance at 700nm (see notebook for detailed protocol). Compared to sample NH2OH (Figure 5), no absorption was detected in culture supernatant (figure 6). Apart from the possibility that no NH2OH was produced, it was also possible that the produced NH2OH was exploited by E. coli. Since NH4Cl is natural nitrogen source for E. coli, decrease of NH4+ concentration does not necessarily indicate AmoA activity nor NH2OH production. Therefore, we decided to use a coupling assay to test the activity of AmoA which depends on the activity of the alpha subunit of HZS (HZSα).
From hydroxylamine to hydrazine
A senior in the laboratory helped us expressing the alpha subunit of HZS, but no expression was detected.
Solid Group-Design
We came up with a second solution of converting ammonia nitrogen into insoluble precipitation– uric acid, which ends up in sediment. This is our “solid group”. Uric acid is produced in human’s purine catabolism process with xanthine as its precursor. This reaction is catalyzed by Xanthine Oxidoreductase (XOR) in human and this enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine into xanthine. E. coli, however, lacks the ability to transfer purines into uric acid because of lack of this enzyme. Therefore, we hypothesized that introducing XOR into E. coli may enable it to produce uric acid (Figure D2). Furthermore, to elevate the efficiency at which purines are transformed into uric acid, we over expressed key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli to “pull” the reaction towards uric acid production. In this way, excessive nitrogen, especially ammonia nitrogen, is transferred into nitrogen in sediments and fish don’t have to bear the high concentration of ammonia.
Solid Group-Results
Key achievements
Successful expression of functional recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR) in E. coli and optimization of expression conditions.
Successful production of uric acid in E. coli with extra xanthine supply.

Its hosts often include humans and other warm-blooded animals, and many strains of the species can survive on dry surfaces over a long duration of time. This bacteria secretes a slime-like substance that allows it to adhere to plastic and to cells, and its infections are often linked to intravascular devices, such as prosthetic heart valves, as well as to catheters and large wounds [22].
Staphylococcus simulans: Staphylococcus simulans is a Gram-positive coccus known to colonize mammalian hosts. It is best known for its ability to produce lysostaphin, a metalloendopeptidase known to be extremely effective against Staphylococcus aureus [23].
Streptococcus uberis: Streptococcus uberis is a Gram-positive bacterium and the producer of one of the bacteriocins we worked with, Nisin U. Nisin U is a lantibiotic and acts by forming pores in target cells. Nisin U is active against various other Streptococcus species, and some Staphylococcus species [24].

UCL,2015,Team:UCLA#Notebook#Protein Cages#8 July 2015_-_-_TEXT.html," Storing Oligos with Fluorophores. Typically, fluorophore labeled oligos show a reduction in signal of about 20% after 24 months when stored at –20°C in TE. For oligos with a fluorophore modification, particularly the Cy and FAM dyes, researchers may wish to store these oligos in amber tubes or covered in foil to prevent photo bleaching which can occur over time with prolonged exposure to light.
Resuspending your gBlocks™ Gene Fragment:
1. Centrifuge the tube for 3−5 sec at a minimum of 3000 x g to pellet the material to the bottom of the tube.
2. Add 20 µL TE to the tube for a final concentration of 10 ng/µL.
3. Briefly vortex and centrifuge.
Storing your gBlocks™ Gene Fragment: gBlocks Gene Fragments can be stored in TE at −20°C for up to 24 months. If gBlocks Gene Fragments will be stored for less than 1 month, they can be resuspended in nuclease-free water rather than TE.
Procedures:
Today 15mL of TE buffer was made from 150uL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH8) and 3uL of 0.5M EDTA (pH8) and bringing the total volume up to 15mL in a falcon tube.
All primers were resuspended in TE buffer.  For the colony PCR primers, a 40uM stock was made for long term storage, and a 20uM working stock was made.  For primers for pET22b, sequencing, and amplifying, a 100uM stock was made for long term storage, as well as a 20uM working stock for the pET22b primers.
Conclusions:  The bacterial plate with the Yeate’s strain was not found in the cold room.  Tomorrow, agar plates will be made in order to restreak the bacteria from the glycerol stocks.  Dr. Kosuri suggested working trying to work with the PSB1C3 sequence by adding a T7 promoter and RBS to the PCquad sequence.  A his-tag and stop codon would also have to be made for this purpose.  This may be done tomorrow, as well as making the plates for downstream PCR and protein expression."

Microscopy system for fluorescence image acquisition
Figure 5. Acquisition system
The system’s core is a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. For GFP image acquisition we used a B-2A filter by Nikon with an excitation band between 450 and 490 nm and the optimal emission placed at 520 nm.
The illumination system is composed of a 75 Watt Xenon arc lamp connected to a Photon Technology Instruments DeltaRAM X monochromator. The home-made control of monochromator  is implemented in a Labview and permits the regulation of the excitation wavelength and the calibration of the system.
The camera used to acquire images  is a Nikon DS-5m with a DS-U1 controller. This one receives the acquired signal form the camera through a serial connection and sends it to the PC through an USB slot. Nikon also supplied an software for image acquisition (X-Data).

TecMonterrey_GDA,2017,Team:TecMonterrey GDA#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," creating science. This manual is intended to be presented to the Mexican Ministry of Education. Each team collaborated with the proposal of 10 different experiments according to the national education plan, making a total of 30 experiments. We validated them in public and private schools in the cities of Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Mexico City where we got feedback from teachers and students. We aim to awaken the children’s curiosity and to bring them closer to scientific activities through the manual and in the long term, to increase the scientific development in Mexico and to make progress in our country.
The manual consists of 30 experiments divided into 3 segments, according to their educational level and average age range. Each of them consists of the name of the experiment, objective, theory of the phenomenon studied, material, procedure and questions. Each section aims to ensure the understanding of the experiment and its relationship to the topics seen in class. Each experiment has its fundamentals clearly explained for all ages to which the manual is directed.
iGEM Tec GDL validated three of the 30 experiments of the Science Manual in a Public School in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The Elementary School principal, Manuel Cañedo, mentioned that he feels fortunate and pleasurable of having us in their school to participate with their students in science activities. Manuel Cañedo welcomed us and introduced us to the 5th graders; we explained them the activities, and all the children responded, participated enthusiastically and payed attention at all time, then we made other experiments in 1st and 2nd grade, in which children responded in the same way.
Teachers and students were excited because this experiments took them out of the daily school routine, they could all participate, they all had fun, but most importantly they all learned science.
In this picture we are creating a Non-Newtonian fluid with the second grader students. They are touching and feeling the difference between applying pressure to the fluid with the finger and not applying pressure at all.

Rules
1) Only hitting the person's hand counts, that means no arms! However, it does not matter whether it is the palm or back of the hand you hit.
2) When the defending person moves, if they hit the next person in the hand in the process, that person who is hit, is out. This is a sneaky move but it makes the game more interesting.
3) Some people play this game so that you are only allowed to move in one direction, but moving in both makes it more unexpected.
4) When you move, it is like a robotic movement. If you move you arm forward, you may not retract your hand in the same move. Check out the dos and don't of this in the video.
5) Defense or approach movements are allowed. For defense, it may be that you know you are very close to being hit so you purposely jump back to evade being hit. You can also jump towards a person if you are too far away.
That's it, that's all the rules of Ninjas. If you think we are crazy for playing this, we are not the only ones. At the UK meet up, we got many many people involved. Don't believe me? Check out our team spirit video. This game is a great ice breaker. You just have to get past the bit, that some people hit really hard.
Pegging Assassin
This is a long game and takes more organisation but is very simple. It is literally pegging someone. The aim of the game is to have as many pegs as you can by the end of the game.
How to
1) At the start of the game, we write every participants name on pegs and put them into a bag or envelope, anything opaque is fine.
2) The team then take out a peg each, if one person gets the peg with their own name on it, then all pegs are put back into the bag and a reselection is called.
3) Once everyone has different pegs then the pegging commences.
Rules
1) The how to is really simple, now for some ground rules. When we play in lab, we make sure that when anyone is working, that includes talking to someone about work, dry lab work or wet lab, they are not pegged.
2) You can peg that person (e.g hair) or any of the clothes that person is wearing so that means no bags. However due to 1 minute rule, you can peg clothes they are not wearing and the minute rule commences when they put that item of clothing"

Conclusions
From the sequencing data alone, it appears that beyond the expected PLlac 0-1 promoter region, the part is otherwise constructed as reported. However, the lack of the PLlac 0-1 promoter region means that lasR will not be expressed and there we anticipate that there will be no response (i.e. fluorescence) to the presence of the autoinducer.  To fix this part, the lasB and vector coding sequences upstream of lasR would need to be cut out and replaced with PLlac 0-1. This is predicted to restore the desired function to the part.

This was achieved using either full-length sequences ortruncated portions containing only N- and C-domains (INP- NC) or INP-NC with five additional internal repeating units to display foreign protein on the surface of cell. containing only N- and C-domains means no repeat sequent, producing no ice-nucleation activity. This indicates that the central repeating domains are not required for export to the cell surface, and are therefore, ideal spacer units to control the distance between the passenger protein and the cell surface. Importantly, INP can be expressed at the cell surface of E. coli at a very high level, without affecting cell viability: comparable to the endogenous expression of the OmpA porin[2].
Before us, there was some teams that used INPNC as display system successfully, which is encoded by inaZ. INPNC is used to display passenger protein, such as EYFP, silica binding protein and so on. After researching NCBI, we found that there are several types of nucleotides encoding INP, including inaZ, inaQ, inaK, inaV, inaX. Because inaZ, inaV ,inaX have less support by the published literature comparing to inaQ and inaK, we hope that we can use inaQ or inaK as target gene of recombinant plasmid to alleviate burden of E.coli.
WHY INPN
Then we found that using INP derivatives containing only N-domain (INPN) as display system successfully is possible. The passenger proteins are also various, such as Japanese Encephalitis Virus Pathogenicity, phosphate-binding protein and so on. There is also literature which alleges that since full-length INP is quite large (1,200–1,500 amino acid residues), functional truncated INP molecules may serve as better anchoring motifs to carry large heterologous proteins.
So we start thinking that we also could use INP derivatives containing only N-domain (INPN) as display system. As we say early, inaZ has less support. So, we use inaK and inaQ as ingredient. According to the results of literature survey, inaK-N has about 658bp and inaQ-N has about 525bp. We hoped truncated INP molecules serve as better anchoring motifs to"
