Cornell,2018,Team:Cornell#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," make their very own kits!
WLC Milwaukee
We first met Jack from WLC Milwaukee’s iGEM team through a chance meeting at Cornell, as we happened to be presenting at the same symposium as him. He introduced himself as a member of WLC Milwaukee’s iGEM team, and we quickly got to know each other. We worked with WLC Milwaukee to share some of the knowledge we’ve built up about iGEM, and what makes an iGEM team successful. Our conversation centered on team organization and practices that have helped us grow as a group. We wish them the best of luck at the 2018 iGEM Giant Jamboree!"
SupBiotech-Paris,2009,Team:SupBiotech-Paris#Introduction1_-_-_TEXT.html," less efficient face to an eukaryotic environment. Their genome should integer specific sequences, which permit them to increase their transfection efficiency. They possess, like other eukaryotic viruses, easiness to integer genetic information of therapeutic interest inside their capsid and an easiness to target a marker. Nevertheless, they enter badly in eukaryotic cells and their immunogenicity is very strong as well.
To finish, last vector of the biological class, bacteria. This vector type, one of the most original, is not very studied and only developed in laboratories. Principally used for protein secretion in vivo, this vector cannot transfect cell of interest. Trials were tested on inflammation secretion factor, or another immunostimulating agent, in tumors. In addition to its inability to transduce genetic information in cell of interest, bacterial vectors are immunogene and potentially dangerous for humans. This vector type still exists because it brings some particular possibilities. The bacterial vector can target a tissue and deliver a therapeutic protein, it is easy to produce as well and in some cases, depending of the strain, it resists to the immune system.
In the second vector class, we find lipidic and polymeric nanoparticle vectors.
Nanoparticle vectors are colloidal systems; their structure is composed of lipids or polymers, biodegradable if possible. Nanoparticles can be matricial; in this case, active principle can be dispersed or dissolved in the matrix and be released only by a simple diffusion or after biodegradation in the organism. Nanoparticles can be a type of reservoir, in this case, they are constituted by a central nucleus usually liquid and surrounded by a thin wall of lipids or polymers which the thickness is not over some nanometers.
Lipidic nanoparticles have the advantage to be biomimetic and biodegrable, moreover, they are not stable, their DNA compaction capacity is 40 to 50 less important than a virus of the same size and they are highly immunogene, even if they have “stealth” molecules (e.g. PEG).
Polymeric nanoparticles are more stable than there lipidic homologous, but their entry in cells is weaker. They have a potential toxicity and are immunogene as well, even if they have “stealth” molecules.
Each vector type has its own properties, but they have some issues as well. Vectorization technologies have several recurrent issues, specific or not to a type of vector.

Wageningen_UR,2016,Team:Wageningen UR#Notebook#Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html," the RIVM and the Rathenau institute, with the theme: “veilig verder met synthetische biologie”, or “making safe progress in synthetic biology”. During this meeting, researchers, policymakers and policy advisors brainstormed, discussed and presented their ideas about how synthetic biology should be handled in the future. We gave a short presentation about the topic of our project and how we integrated “safe by design” through toxin specificity, controlled expression of the toxin and confinement of our product to the beehive. During a short information market, we got to talk more in depth with people who were interested, presented the movie we made for the RIVM and the Resource from the future that was made in collaboration with Synenergene. There were short “break-out sessions” where safety of previous iGEM projects was discussed in small groups, and at the same time two artists made a huge and beautiful drawing of everything that was discussed during the day. We learned a lot from the interesting talks about further handling safety in synthetic biology both from a political and a societal point of view. An interesting point that comes to mind was made by Sabine Roeser (professor of Ethics, TU Delft), about how feelings of the public concerning synthetic biology can be a useful source of questions on the ethical aspects of our work. She also mentioned how art can be used to connect people to synthetic biology. In our project, we tried to achieve this through collaborating with the Design Academy Eindhoven (hyperlink). Besides, it was nice to get to know more about how the other dutch iGEM teams handled the RIVM assignment. We thank the RIVM and the Rathenau institute for inviting us, it was an inspiring day!
In short, we learned a lot from collaborating both with the RIVM and the Rathenau institute/Synenergene. When starting iGEM, safety and containment of our engineered bacterium were just “things that need to be considered in order to perform well in the iGEM competition”. The RIVM and Synenergene assignments helped us to think more in depth about different safety aspects, how safety by design can be achieved and our own opinions about it. Eventually, biosafety of BeeT became a major part of our project, with over half of the team members working on some safety aspect.
Making the Safe by design movie
In contrast to many other synthetic biology applications, BeeT is intended to be used outside the lab, in beehives, which is in close contact with nature. To get a better idea of the viability of our idea"

October 3rd
Freetime for all... yesterday was too hard and long.
October 4th
More end-user friendly technical descriptions and visualizations have been finished. The model photos were taken.
October 5th
Mila was in the costume pool of the national theatre today. It's amazing how many dresses they have... Preparing for thursday's photosession. Afterwards we met in the workspace to discuss.
October 11th
After one weekend full of preparations, together with our visiting creative directors Laura and Philipp from Heidelberg, the long-awaited shooting for 'recobrain' could get started.  The production team already met early in the morning to rework their masterplan for the day: take photos and a short commercial expressing their recobrain ideas! Shortly after the team declared to begin with the shooting at our workspace in Weimar, because the pre-production hasn´t been over-detailed but enough to start right away.  After finishing the shooting at the first three locations: a toilet(sounds weird but totally makes sense), a craftsman-room and a outdoorshot in the park; our frisky and amused team started to record the important injection main-scene in our little studio. Afterwards the shooting migrated to another location: a flat or more specific...the couch and the kitchen sink of it. To get ahead after a long break in the afternoon, everybody headed to the fitnessstudio - the official final location. Late at 11pm the last photo and film-take was made(hooray!), followed by an all night edit, photoshop, after effect session of our exhausted team members!
October 12th
To gain some clothing inspiration for our jamboree team outfits and the following product photoshoots on wednesday afternoon, Mila and Vanessa grouped up on tuesday to examine the Weimar atrium shopping-center and the theater costume pool (yeah again and again and again!). Packed with a big bag full of photographic impressions on business outfits, cocktail dresses, bridal gowns and prices the two girls finnaly returned to present their design-proposals via power-point on our early afternoon team meeting. After balancing our prospects with (more or less) the whole group, we regrettably decided not to show of in a scary artistic mirror ball suit while our presentation in Boston.  Furthermore the design and structure of our iGEM-wiki got discussed with the group once more.

Hi, everyone! my name is Yujie Zhao, a member of laboratorial group in the iGEM NKU_China team. Besides, I'm the leader of design group. In my leisure time, reading and drawing are my favorite things, because they can calm my mind. I also like challenging myself and mastering something new like making handcrafts, learning new experiment skills and subtitling movie. The word 'impossiblility' is not in my dictionary.

Hello everyone! This is Xiao Liu. It's my second time attending iGEM. I've grown from a sophomore, who was unfimiliar with synthetic biology and science research, into a senior who is devoting myself to them. I was in charge of our wiki last time and our whole project this time. I should say that iGEM has influenced me a lot in many positive ways. I hope our project will attract you this time and  my work can"

At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.
BioBrick Workshop 2014
The iGEM competition is not only about developing fascinating solutions to global or everyday problems using synthetic biology. It is about sharing knowledge and experience with your fellows. It is about achieving great results, together with like-minded people, as well as sharing your achievements with others to help them achieve even greater results, and thereby in the end creating valuable solutions for the society.
It is our experience at the 2014 DTU iGEM team that a good start is essential for a research project to be successful in all aspects. Since our team consists of several trained wetlab biotech students we chose to take advantage of our experience and arrange and carry out a workshop for all other Danish iGEM teams to help them get their iGEM projects started.
Our overall intention was to provide the other teams with a solid introduction to the iGEM competition, how to create a great wiki-website and a basic hands-on experience with essential laboratory techniques to enable their work with engineering of biological systems.
The BioBrick Workshop concept is to gather the iGEM teams of Denmark (UCPH, SDU and DTU) for a social learning experience about the core of iGEM, genetical engineering and safety. We decided to adapt the programme from the BioBrick Workshop 2013 organised by the previous year's DTU iGEM team to fit the settings of this year.
The BioBrick Workshop 2014 was hosted from Friday 2nd early afternoon until Sunday 4th late afternoon, May 2014, at DTU. Here the Danish iGEM teams received lectures about: Primer design for USER-cloning, the online tool PHUSER that can be used for designing primers, the core of iGEM, how to receive medals and Wiki design and editing in iGEM. The teams were also introduced to"
Minnesota,2009,Team:Minnesota#Designer_-_-_TEXT.html," fetch useful BioBrick information from the database to any user's desktop.
Imagine having a software tool that can build and simulate gene regulatory networks for you with minimal input. Just enter the IDs of the BioBricks in your system and SynBioSS will generate an SBML or NetCDF file of all the molecular biology dogma interactions: transcription, translation, regulation, degradation, and induction. Use Wiki to populate the kinetic constants and take this file to conduct sophisticated simulations of the dynamics of your synthetic construct.
Voila! From Biobrick IDs to distributions of protein molecules in a cell population.
All of our codes are made publicly available with Open Licenses.
SynBioSS Designer
The interface for the SynBioSS designer where the user can input BioBricks to build a model.
SynBioSS Designer is an application for the automatic generation of sets of biomolecular reactions. This software allows a user to input the molecular parts involved in gene expression and regulation (e.g. promoters, transcription factors, ribosomes, etc.) The software then generates complete networks of reactions that represent transcription, translation, regulation, induction and degradation of those parts. To facilitate the creation of detailed kinetic models of synthetic gene networks composed of BioBricks, we have adapted SynBioSS Designer to automatically generate a kinetic model from a construct composed entirely of BioBricks. A NetCDF or SBML file is generated for simulations.
Our goal for this year's iGEM competition was to overhaul the user interface for the SynBioSS Designer. Previously, the user needed to manually input all information about every BioBrick (e.g. for promoters, the user had to input whether the promoter is constitutively on or off, whether the promoter has operator sites, where these operator sites are located, etc.). Designer is now able to interface with the Standard Biological Parts Web Service, an online database hosted by Google and populated by an RSS feed of BioBricks and their features coming directly from the Official Parts Registry. In addition to the custom-built bricks that were previously the only way of submitting BioBrick specifcations to Designer, users may now pull all relevant properties of any BioBrick automatically using only the brick ID, making Designer significantly faster and easier to use. This is especially useful when adding long sequences of bricks, especially those which constitute composite bricks. The progress on this front is capped by an updated appearance for Designer's sequence construction step, which displays the BioBricks visually (with vBOL symbols ) in a user-friendly and dynamic tabbed interface.
Additionally, we sought to leverage the versatility afforded us by the Standard Biological Parts Web"

A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
Note
This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page."
Copenhagen,2012,Team:Copenhagen#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," who kindly provided us with a Lux Cassette. This contained one of the “banned” Xbal restriction sites, which we have removed and the Lux cassette is submitted as a BioBrick. We have transformed the Lux cassette from Thomas Knight into E.cloni® 5α (purchased from Lucigen).  As a control we exploited that the gene cassette had a LacI promotor and we confirmed, after adding IPTG, that the Lux cassette is able to make the bacteria bioluminescent.
For further information please visit the Parts page.
Experiences with USER cloning
We have found, that in order to make USER cloning work, it is very important that the molecular concentration of the parts, that are to be assembled, is as equal as possible. This means that a small piece must be of lower concentration in order to assemble it to a larger piece so the number of each piece is approximately the same. For ProC (35 bp) and YF1 (1131bp) a x10.000 dilution of ProC was necessary in order to assemble the two pieces.  This very problem has made it hard to assemble our construct since we have pieces ranging from 35bp to almost 6000bp.

This year our team, ecolibrium, has created a mobile game: Go Culture which aims to introduce the concept of microbial co-cultures to a wider audience. Our research into data visualization, which emerged from our reflexivity process, shows the importance of interactivity. It serves to engage the audience, and improve their understanding of our project. We believe that abstract concepts, such as the function and co-operation of microbes, can be better understood through interactive representations, hence the idea of creating a game. If you have done so yet, please download it from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store!
When we were developing our game , we used Bloom’s taxonomy to develop the objectives. This takes the form of a hierarchical framework  which we have used in other parts of our project (Armstrong, 2013).  Learning at the higher levels is dependent on having developed knowledge at lower levels (Shabatura, 2015). The summarized hierarchy we used from bottom to top was:
Knowledge - Recognition of terms and ideas.
Application - Apply abstractions to specific concrete situations.
Synthesis - Creative construction of novel ideas from multiple sources of information (Armstrong, 2013).
We wanted people who played our game, Go Culture , to be able to:
Recognize what co-cultures are and how they can be beneficial.
Explain where they occur in nature and how they can be useful to people.
Produce their own ideas for novel applications of co-cultures.
Based on the responses we received from participants in our game, we believe Go Culture succeeded in achieving our educational goals. 80% of people who played were able to recognise and explain co-cultures. Moreover, they were able to create amazingly novel applications which we had previously not considered like managing obesity through the regulation of the gut microbiome.
Over 100 people at the New Scientist Live Event, and an additional 15 students from the City of London High School contributed to the testing of our game. We had over 20 hours of contact time with players, and collected detailed survey responses from everyone.

Trc Promoter
LT:The protocol from week #11 was repeated but the transformation reaction was plated onto LB-CHL plates for proper selection. Results: The BTE digest was successful as confirmed by the gel. The trc promoter digest had the same inconclusive results as seen preciously. Colonies successfully grew from the ligation and transformation.
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:  To test viability of PDC, found information regarding Aldehyde detection plates.  Since PDC converts Pyruvate to Acetaldehyde, these plates could be a quick way to test for the presence of aldehydes in our constructs.  Growing s70/PDC/ADH in NEB B10 cells yielded bright pink colonies (aldehydes present).
Bay Laurel Thioesterase
MT: Five cultures of BTE coding region in the Topo vector (pUC57) were grown, and minipreped. The BTE samples and pSB1C3  were digested with Xba I and Pst I and ligated. Ligation was transformed using NEB Beta cells. Colonies were selected to culture overnight and minipreped, digested to check for correct band size.
A Free Fatty Acid Assay was done on BTE with the promoter sigma 70. A sample was also ran through a Gas chromatographer  to check the length of hydrocabons we are producing. Results are in the assay section.

SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
As a software team, we felt obligated to help other team with our expertise in software development and data processing. Besides, for experiments aspect, we thought we have plenty of experience to learn from others. Thus, we decided to join the community vigorously and reached out for 4 registered teams this year in traditional tracks: SCUT-China_A , NJU-China , Hong_Kong_HKUST , and SYSU-CHINA . And we also worked with SCAU-CHINA who will participant iGEM next year (They conduct their project for two years) for holding a synthetic biology conference on their campus.
SCUT-China-A
Background & Demand
We met SCUT-China_A in April on a meet-up meeting among teams in Southern China. This year they use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since they were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the SRRz gene before the experiment, they reached out for us to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Result
We built a model for their project using the same algorithm that utilized in our software simulation section. The following is the circuit they designed for their project redrawn by our design platform"

The following Saturday (October 13th), the presentation was extended to everybody, people from Grenoble of all ages. We were really surprised by the interest of the young people!
PRESENTATIONS
ENGINEERING SCHOOL
In September 2018 we presented our project and the iGEM competition in the Phelma engineering school. Some iGEM members are students from this school. The goal is to promote the competition and that some students want to be part of the 2019 team! We could answer the questions of many students and take note of their remarks.
MEDICAL FACULTY
In September 2018 we presented our project and iGEM competition to undergraduate students in Biotechnology and Medicine. Some iGEM members are students from this university.   It seemed important to present our project to future doctors and to make a discussion on phage therapy. The approach is the same as during the presentation at the engineering school.
MIDI MINATEC (SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY)
On Friday, October 12th, as part of Science Week, the iGEM team supported a Midi-Minatec (seminar conference) in front of 400 people, CEA researchers and students from the Grenoble region. This is the first time the team could unveil the Phagyzer system to the general public! The 30-minute presentation allowed to present the iGEM competition, the formation of the association iGEM, the preparation of the project and the realization of the Phagyzer system. It aroused the audience curiosity as 15 minutes of questions followed the presentation and many people came to talk with us even later!

How our system works
Figure 1: Schematic diagram summarising our system. It consists of three modules: a chemotaxis module ( Phyto-Route ), an auxin-production module ( Auxin Xpress ) and ( Gene Guard ), a containment module (Diagram by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Data for our favourite new parts
Main Page - Composite pVeg2 - IaaM - IaaH, BBa_K515100: We have shown that indole 3-acetic acid is being produced in our bacteria. In addition, we have exposed a mutant of Arabidopsis that expresses YFP in response to IAA to our auxin-producing bacteria. These plants were fluorescing more brightly than the controls.
Main Page - Composite p(tetR) R0040- RBS B0034- Dendra2, BBa_K515107: We have successfully expressed and photoconverted this protein in E. coli cells. In addition, we have photoconverted the protein inside bacterial cells that had been taken up into Arabidopsis roots using a confocal microscope.
Main Page - Composite J23100 promoter - PA2652, BBa_K515102: We have shown  that our bacteria respond to  L (-) malic acid through chemotactic behavior in comparison to cells that do not contain the construct. We have also quantified this response using capillary assay.
Data for pre-existing parts
Experience - p(TetR) mRFP - BBa_I13521 (Endy Lab, iGEM 2005): We have added the results of our thermostability assay to the experience page of this part.

Invasion operon
Fig 2. The overview of the invasion operon. It is based on a lacI/cI bistable switch. After thermal activation (42°C) the expression of genes that enable invasion of mammalian cells is activated. The invasion operon is composed of lacI – lactose operon repressor, llo – hemolysin from Listeria monocytogenes, inv – invasin from Yersinia sp., phoQ/phoP two component system detecting endosomal conditions from Salmonella typhimurium, GFP – Green Fluorescent Protein from Aqueora victoria. Proteins are fused with LVA sequence which provides quick proteolytic degradation.
The invasion operon includes lacI – lactose operon repressor, llo – hemolysin from Listeria monocytogenes ( listeriolysin ), inv – invasin from Yersinia sp., PhoP/PhoQ two component system that detects endosomal conditions from Salmonella typhimurium, GFP – green fluorescent protein. (Fig.2.). These genes are under the control of bacteriophage promoter (PR) that is repressed by cI protein. The second part of the operon is gene cIts that encodes for thermosensitive version of the cI repressor protein from phage λ. It is under the control of lactose promoter (Plac). This λ system of promoters and regulatory genes creates two mutually exclusive negative feedback loops and is dubbed the bistable switch [19]. It has two states depending on conditions within the cell. cI protein binds the PR promoter inhibiting its activity and expression of the invasion operon genes. cIts protein is inactivated by high temperature 42°C it allows the expression of invasion operon that codes for lacI . lacI stops gene expression from the Plac promoter ( the expression of cI protein). IPTG that binds and inactivates lacI can be used to switch on the expression from Plac promoter. Another way to control the operon is in trans expression of cI or lacI genes. Activated invasion operon causes internalisation of bacteria by mammalian cells. It also detects endosomal localisation using PhoP/PhoQ system . Expression of green fluorescence protein allows observation of the process"

Funding.
This project would not even come to life if it weren't for the support of Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education and the Institute of Computer Science at the Poznan University of Technology.
We have participated in the ""Generation of the Future"" programme that supplied us with 200000 PLN for research, registration, accomodation and administration. On the other hand, as the formalities were quite a burden and we were running out of time before the project has even started, we would not be able to even pay the registration fee if the Institute did not support us.
As this was our first grant, we were absolutely not aware of the obstacles we were going to deal with (even if we were aware we were not aware). The law was not on our side, but many kind people from the Ministry, Poznan University of Technology, Adam Mickiewicz University and the Institute of Computer Science were.
The symbolic ceremony of receiving the funds was held on May 8th 2013 in Warsaw in the gardens of the Prime Minister's (in the middle) offices. Another team from our university, participating in Robots Intellect 2014 was also granted financial support.

Collaborations
Collaborations are essential for each team to develop parts of the project they could not do another way because of a lack of means or skills. This way, expertise can extend the possibilities of the team to propose a more complete project. Moreover, collaboration teaches us solidarity and teamwork which are essential qualities for every single scientist who works in a team.
iGEM Aix-Marseille (HP/Bio)
During the Parisian Meet-up organized by iGEM Pasteur at the Institute Pasteur, we met the iGEM Aix-Marseille Team that solicited our help for their human practices. iGEM Aix-Marseille is producing a modified bacteriophage that could prevent the spreading of Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that ruins cereals and olive crops around the Mediterranean Sea. To provide this phage to farmers, iGEM Aix-Marseille needed the authorization of the European Commission for their GMO production. That’s why they asked for the help of our lawyer, Maxime, to accompany them through possible legal pathways which were entirely different from those we used to place Psicose on the market ( See the dossier on the iGEM Aix-Marseille Wiki ).
For our part, we needed characterization of our Psicose producing enzyme, the D-psicose 3-epimerase, to qualify our model. iGEM Aix-Marseille has a team of skilled bio-informaticians that could take over the description of our Psicose epimerase characteristics such as catalytic activity, 3D representation, affinity constants and kinetics compared to other epimerases of our enzyme’s family ( See details on our Scientific Part ).
Both teams were highly satisfied with each others work and brought a great contribution to each others project.

How did we combine design and synthetic biology?
Design was a key concept in the evolution of our project. We wanted to come up with a beautiful and useful device that would be easy to use. Jeanne Talonneau, who majored in design studies, joined our team to help on that matter. A great amount of work was done and we have managed to end up with a final product ready to be put on the market. Here are some details about the choices that have led to the design of our device.
What brought a designer to meet with biologists?
Jeanne is a good example: “I was interested in biology and studied sciences when I was young. In college, I decided to study applied arts. But I wanted to satisfy my curiosity with sciences, and therefore worked on biology-oriented design. I wrote a memoir about “the loss of control on the living”. To go further, I wanted to work on a design project including bacteria. That’s why I joined the INSA Lyon team.”
What does design bring to synthetic biology?
Design makes you think about the end-user first. Scientists try to solve specific problems, but designers tend to think at a larger scale, they also think about the environment in which the product may be used. Both approaches associate to bring a new and better response. Synthetic Biology is still a very young domain, centered on large-scale industry. A vast majority of the public never heard of it. Design could be a fabulous communication tool to get people’s acceptance on using synthetic biology based products
What are the motivations to get involved in an iGEM project?
E. chromi, developed by the 2009 iGEM Cambridge team, is an inspiring design project. They managed to combine design and synthetic biology in a very inventive way.
The idea was to make a collaborative project. Within our team, scientists shared ideas and knowledge about synthetic biology while Jeanne, our designer, brought insight from a different point of view. Most French laboratories do not take design into account, although it could be a very useful tool to communicate and come up with"

On the other hand, we knocked out (KO) a gene required for tyrosine synthesis in E. coli, TyrA. A medium containing photocaged tyrosine (ortho-nitrobenzyl tyrosine) is used to grow the bacteria: this special tyrosine is sensitive to UVs, and will be only available for our KO E. coli once uncaged.

2. Com R/S
ComS is a small peptide imported into the cytoplasm by the cell. Interacting with ComR, it will form a complex acting as a gene activator.
This peptide contains a tyrosine residue. Thanks to a collaboration with Vincent Stroobant from the Institut de Duve, we synthetized a modified ComS involving a photocaged tyrosine. This new peptide shouldn't be able interact with ComR, unless its tyrosine has been uncaged by UVs.
The ComR/ComS complex will simply activate a RFP gene, creating a system responding to UVAs.

I continued reading more about Semantic Search and its advantages compared to other types of searches as well as its disadvantages along with exploring different semantic search engines that are already available on the web, specifically for bioinformatic research (e.g. [1] , [2] , and [3] ). A couple of papers also introduced me to the idea of incorporating other types of searches in Semantic Search. I learned a bit more about text mining, natural language processing (NLP), and ontology.
Day 5: June 4, 2012
Veronica and I continued reasearching on Semantic Search for the morning. The lab then headed over to Microsoft NERD for the second half of the day where we learned about their new beta project, a tablet with Microsoft 8. The interface is definitely engaging, what with their idea of using tiles and semantic zooming. I also like how transparent they’re trying to be with people who are trying to create applications for their story. Their idea of using a picture the owner can choose on their own as part of the password was really cool! I also like how they found a way to accommodate different finger sizes by enabling users to rescale the keyboard. All the different gestures to fully use the tablet however are not intuitive and takes some getting used to. It seemed much easier when Edwin was just demonstrating the product for us than when I actually tested out the tablet myself. Although, it is great how applications can now be made using HTML5 and JavaScript. I'm definitely going to start learning how to code in these languages before the summer is out.
Day 6: June 5, 2012
Wendy and I conducting the E. chromi experiment.
The lab met up in MIT and we spent the entire day learning more about synthetic biology. Professor Natalie Kuldell gave us a lecture in the morning and had us running experiments that afternoon to try applying what we've learned and get us exposed to the lab environment (which was particularly helpful for those of us who hadn't done Biology since 9th grade). Natalie was able to make the lecture engaging when talking about the basics of synthetic biology and its similarities with other engineering practices. Once she got more technical however it was more difficult for me to follow. As for the lab, first of all, I've definitely gained a newfound respect for people majoring in the biological sciences. Lab can be very tiring--and we were only in there for two hours when labs in Wellesley College courses usually take 4+ hours!

Helping ZJU-China construct their biobrick
We helped ZJU-China construct a calcium responsive promotor which plays a significant role in their crops-protecting project. This promotor can sense the increase of calcium ion concentration cause by a medium wave signal and express downstream genes to achieve the goal of using wave signal to regulate chassis gene expression. We used Golden Gate Assembly to assemble seven different fragments of the promotor in E. coli, and used Gibson Assembly to shift the promotor onto shuttle vector for their further use. We cultivated sincere friendship with ZJU-China through our close collaboration, they also attended our Beijing-Tianjin iGEM Meetup in Beijing in spite of the 1500km distance between us.

World-wide data base of water pollution
Invited by Tianjin, we collaborated with FAFU-CHINA, XMU-China, SCUT-China A and other 5 teams to construct a world-wide data base of water pollution, especially copper pollution and cadmium pollution. After collecting all the data we need, we drew a map to visualize the data we collected. By constructing this map, we can get better understanding of the overall condition of water pollution around the world. As ammonia pollution is one of the severe water pollutions, we believed by collaborating with these wonderful teams, we can have better understanding of our own project from a brand new point of view.

Interlab study
Overview
As this is the first time we participate as a High School team, it was also the first time we participated in the second edition of the InterLab Study, where we were requested to measure the relative fluorescence of three devices containing a GFP as an expression marker and three different promoters of the same family.
In this section of our wiki, we will present our results, as well as the protocols we used and how we determined the device was actually assembled.
The devices were constructed with promoters from a family of constitutive promoters described by Chris Anderson (iGEM Berkeley Team, 2006). There are 20 promoters that have different efficiencies. This time we reported the relative efficiency of the following promoters:
1) Promoter BBa_K823005 in pSB1C3
2) Promoter BBa_K823008 in pSB1C3
3) Promoter BBa_K823013 in pSB1C3
We then assembled each one of them with a GFP cassette (BBa_I13504 in pSB1A2). The efficiency of the promoters is measured using a GFP because this is one of the most used expression markers, making it easy to compare relative fluorescence and test which promoters is being more efficient.
We measured the fluorescence in RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) with the Microplate Fluorescence and Luminiscence Reader Fluoroscan Ascent FL from Labsystems.

However, it is diffucult to understand for which purposesour     tools will be used, bestway avoiding garage bioterrorism is all parts     before adding to partsregistry must be checked , looked for toxic affect     and any environmental or human harmness. After scanning possible candidate     parts, a committe should decide whether novel part can be added parts     registry or not.And we can only warn the user about our intention while     building the application:
“BioGUIDE v1.0 software is FOR RESEARCH USE ONLY,     no medical or diagnostic use for applications of the novel Biobrick     constructs generated through our software has been described “
“No military (defense or combat) applications will be allowed in     future”
Methods
Part Extraction Standards
All information about the parts that are essential in experimental     setup of iGEM projects has been utilized. The information for the parts     available provided with all three 384 well plates in Spring 2010 distribution     have been standardized. Our standardization criteria have been discussed     in detail under Database Standardization. ER diagram has been generated     which simply describes the organization of the data. Around 70% of the     parts information has been fetched by the custom parsing code from XML     and Excel files provided by iGEM. Rest of the data had to be collected     and organized manually as the organization of these data cannot be standardized     to generate an algorithm. This step was one of the most time consuming     steps in our project. For each construct and Biobrick the information     collected was; Activity, Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor     for promoters and Inducer, Activator, Repressor and Inhibitor information     valid for synthesized molecules (mostly proteins and RNA fragments etc.)
Combination
Rules (Image Combinations) In order to build our input/output relations     graphs first we run our algorithm on the real combination dataset which     contains all few thousand different possible combinations of the biobricks.     But after performing all combinations for the first few hundred biobricks     application’s rate slowed downed tremendously, which also become very     time consuming for displaying biobricks graphs. To overcome this bottleneck     we have developed a new strategy, where we have only used the construct     combinations of the biobricks distributed within the plates. Moreover,     according to information gathered from the sub"

Currently, customs regulations in Mexico do not allow quick access for biological material, which includes the kits containing the biobricks sent to each team. This is not a new problem; thus iGEM team Tec-Monterrey 2010 (link) did, as Human Practice, a guide that explained the process, step by step, of importing biological material to Mexico without problems. However, this procedure consists of preparing the documents, sending them to Mexico City and waiting for the response from the pertinent authorities, supposing said documents are not rejected. This procedure may take three months approximately, depending on the location in which the team resides. Generally speaking, this is a procedure that can’t be applied in the case of kits arriving from the United States.
 
This year, three teams in México had problems with the arriving kits, our friends and colleagues ITESM_Mexico, UANLMty_Mexico and us. After some conversations between the teams and the iGEM Headquters, we decided to obtain the kits and look for an alternative method to get them. We also wanted to help our collegues because we wanted a fair competition, where all teams could have their kits in order to work with them at the beginning at the summer, with the same rules and the same instruments to do our best.
 
At first, we didn’t know the enormous amount of problems that we would confront with Mexican customs. First, we contacted M. Sc. Manuel Tiscareño, custom manager of FedEx at the Monterrey International Airport FedEx Customs Agency, in order to seek advice and support in obtaining the kits. He gave us tips, support and contacts in order to solve the problem. He also was invited to the Micro Congress carried out by us during the summer in our university.
 
Because of this contact, a lot of e-mails and some calls, we were able to obtain two kits that were retained in the Mexican customs at the Monterrey International Airport. We gave one kit to the UANLMty-M"

Modeling of the CARTELTM AND Gate
In synthetic biology, modeling can be applied to a wide range of topics, for example modeling of genetic circuits. In this subfield of mathematical and computational biology, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to describe the transcriptional and translational processes over time, predict the behavior of the desired circuit and also to support their further development such as optimizing for a desired output, if enough data is available (Chen et al., 1999).
Figure 1: Schematic representation of CARTELTM AND gate inputs and output
Finding the CARTELTM AND Gate
The hypoxia response element (HRE), cAMP response element (CRE) and CTLA4 promoter can be utilized for a more specific CAR expression (Fig. 1). Combining these three enhancers in an AND gate to allow a specific CAR expression (Brophy et al., 2014) proved to be quite challenging. Using endogenous systems came with a drawback - a knockout or knockdown of either HIF1, VEGFR-2 or TDAG8 had to be generated.
Generating a single knockout or knockdown is challenging enough but generating three to test all possibilities seemed quite impossible in six months. Therefore using modeling to find the best combination of enhancers and knockout was an attractive option instead of choosing a random AND gate design.
To create such a model, the changing concentration of CAR can be described with a system of coupled ODEs. For each component of the genetic circuit - proteins and mRNAs -  rate equations describing its synthesis, degradation, association or other processes are added (Chen et al., 1999). Below, it is shown how these ODEs can be set up in their simplest form.

Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Proof_-_-_TEXT.html,". The negative controls are unfortunately not visible because too little protein was left to be loaded onto the gel but the same control (unconjugated spider silk) can be seen in well 5 of Figure 7(a). In the lab books for defensin week 16 the Sortase-A-mediated conjugation between spider silk and purified defensin is described in more detail.
Figure 7. (a) Sortase Conjugation Test with Protein ZHER2. Wells 2 and 3: conjugated product, well 4: tagged peptide alone, well 5: spider silk. (b) Sortase Conjugation Test with tagged defensin. Well 7: defensin conjugated to spiders silk, wells 2-6: too little protein was loaded to be detected.
A Look Beyond
Based on the results, several combat proteins have shown efficient biofilm dispersal or inhibition. We have further shown that a conjugation between a protein and our BioBrick defensin using Sortase is fast and efficient.
Demonstrating that our final wound dressing, consisting of combat proteins conjugated to spider silk, is capable of degrading biofilm still remains as future work. With more time in the lab, we would hopefully have been able to analyse the device,  defensin conjugated to spider silk, to investigate its biofilm dispersing ability.
Nonetheless, we have seen speedy progression and several positive results with defensin. Notably, we were able to demonstrate successful degradation of both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms and were able to conjugate the purified defensin to spider silk using a commercial Sortase A. Thus, the two main goals of our project - biofilm degradation and Sortase-mediated attachment to spider silk - have successfully been demonstrated, providing a solid base for any future on SMITe - Spider silk Mediated Infection Treatment.

We also initiated some important ethical conversations with parents, such as how they would react to genetically modified foods and who would benefit and lose from such technologies.
One other special part of the museum exhibit was a large group discussion between scientists and members of the public. We sat together at different roundtables and discussed topics such as “public community labs” and “engineering mosquitos” - speaking with members of the public gave us different perspectives on implementation and perception of these concepts. In particular, the discussion about creating community labs gave us ideas on promoting collaborative mammalian synthetic biology research in shared facilities.
Finally, one of our most important contributions to the “Building with Biology” experience was to shape how the activities are developed. This event was a pilot trial, and will be expanded to over 200 different museums next year! The Museum of Science team was interested in learning more about which activities worked well and which needed improvement. Through our direct feedback forms we shared constructive suggestions on how these activities can be refined for the future. We really hope that our feedback gets implemented, and that the series really changes the way synthetic biology is perceived and discussed in the public."

We emphasized the real-world issues that synthetic biology would be able to solve, rather than in a theoretic level. We therefore improved our education, better expressing our ideas and passions to ordinary people in an accessible and interesting way.
- Suzhou The trip to Suzhou visiting a international company- Symbiotechnology helped the practice of our project a lot. In an emerging high-tech industrial park, the staff led us to visit their professional labs and invited us to give a presentation on our project in a conference room and  communicate with their researchers. This exchange brings valuable experience to our projects and clarifies the goals we pursue in our experiments.
First, after listening to the initial ideas of our research, some experts helped us to exclude eight genes we were going to explore based on the projects they had studied. Some genes are excluded because they are too rare for large-scale production or low productivity. This saves us a lot of researching time. Second, experts have highlighted the importance of conversion efficiency because the productivity of today's mainstream solutions is not high, but it is not low, so our solution must not only focus on the impact on the environment, higher conversion rate is also very important.
Although it took a few days to finish, we have gained a lot of important information, which is definitely helpful for our follow-up experimental design.

- Shenzhen
“No one should fight alone.” Having this faith in mind, we signed up the Eurasian Meetup in Shenzhen from July 24 to July 26 in order to know more about other iGEM teams both from undergraduate track and high school track. The three days there benefited us a lot in the practice and further modify of our experiments. We met the highly experienced teams from Asia and Europe. We learned about their projects and their way of dealing with problems during the experiment. One of them from a university in China gave constructional advice to the way we collect data. He mentioned that their way, which uses a special software, is extraordinarily effective for the data collecting and is very easy for making graphs to show the trends and results visually.
We are specifically improved in the aspects we see biosafety and bioethics. We understand that biosafety isn’t only about the safe chemicals we used when conducting the experiment, it is also about preventing any possible damage to us or the environment. After coming back from the meet up, we checked our process thoroughly to make sure that our product will be safe.

BBa_K2353000: tsPurple
BBa_K2353001: tsPurpleDAS
BBa_K2353002: tsPurpleLAA
Our 2017 iGEM team used existing Biobrick parts from the Uppsala team (BBa_K1033906) and also the Endy Lab (BBa_M0050-LAA, M0052-DAS). They were trying to further Edinburgh’s work by expanding upon their experiments with GFP and the degradation tags. The team sought to do this by replacing GFP with the tsPurple chromoprotein and characterizing the ClpXP system. Lambert iGEM attempted to characterize these previous parts but ran into some obstacles while working with them.
Lambert iGEM first obtained the tsPurple sequence from the 2013 Uppsala iGEM wiki page. They ordered the sequence online from IDT, hydrated it, and proceeded to carry out the 3A assembly procedures to create our constructs. The team had the tsPurple with no degradation tag, tsPurple with the LAA degradation tag, and tsPurple with the DAS degradation tag. The degradation tags were obtained from the Endy Lab sequencing and correspond to strong degradation for LAA and moderate for DAS.
The team sought to improve upon the LAA and DAS degradation tags by showing their relative strength in degrading the tsPurple chromoprotein and they also sought to improve upon the characterization of the tsPurple gene so that its relative degradation may be present for anyone who needs it."

We have continued and strengthened our long standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). This year three members from TAS (Justin, Catherine and Yvonne) are members on both NYMU and TAS teams. They learned the cloning cycle from TAS and helped run experiments for NYMU throughout the year. In Boston, they will also help NYMU present their project at the Giant Jamboree.
NYMU-Taipei also hosted a summer camp for our team members, where they taught us about different aspects of iGEM and synthetic biology. In return, we helped them increase the efficiency of their models using equations from their literature research and ran simulations using their experimental data"

SCHOOL VISITS
Session I
Date: July 2, 2015
Venue: Po Leung Kuk Fong Wong Kam Chuen Primary School
Target: P.5 students (4 classes)
Session II
Date: July 7, 2015
Venue: Po Leung Kuk Castar Primary School
Target: P.5 students
BACKGROUND
In current decades, the topic of “DNA” or “Gene” has been brought to hot discussion in the society, such as genetically modified (GM) food, cloning, genetic medicine, etc. Many movies also consist of components related to “gene”, for example Jurassic World, Spiderman, Captain America, and such like. However, how many people really know what DNA is? How many people really understand the function of gene? How many people really recognize the mechanism behind the story?
To have more people in Hong Kong appreciate the idea of synthetic biology, we decided to start everything with primary school kids because they are known to be the future capstone of the city.
CONTENT
Throughout the visit, we explained the basic idea of DNA and genetic engineering, including the “evolution” from DNA to RNA to protein, and the development of which to the students with the help of videos and animations. In order to make the whole presentation feels more relevant to their daily lives, we took cloning (e.g. Dolly the sheep) and GM (e.g. tomatoes) food as examples to talk about the principles of gene technology. Moreover, we tried to raise some social concerns regarding to GM food with the children by providing them materials and had a short discussion on the pros and cons of GM food in modern society.

We realize that we became a member of the Synthetic Biology family by participating at the iGEM competition.Thus, we carry the responsibility of ensuring the well understanding of iGEM and this new scientific branch. For this purpose, we made numerous presentations for students of different age groups and academists and discussed with them about Synthetic Biology and its future. Amoung our audience, we have achieved a great interest and found a considerable number of participants for our survey. We hope that the data we’ve collected will guide us throughout our way to Synthetic Biology in the future. In order to show how funny and perfect team we can be besides our lab work, we made a film where we introduce our team and location. As it is a very important issue to ensure the continuation of the interest especially of the youth to SynBio, we supported and worked 2,5 months with the highschool Team AUC Turkey which participated the first time at iGEM this year. By doing this, we hope to have brought SynBio closer to youngers. Additionally, we prepared a useful notebook for all iGEMERs, which contains information about this years teams, their projects and short comments for each of the projects: The Secret Book of Fatih Medical.
Visit To Dışkapı Education and Research Hospital
We were invited to the science meeting conducted every week in one of the leading research centers, Dışkapı Education and Research Hospital. After presentations of actual science projects prepared by specialists and researchers from different disciplines, we introduced iGEM and explained our our project. We brought Synthetic Biology to the agenda under the iGEM title. We tried to explain it by the means of concretizing our own studies.  After our presentation we answered the questions about Synthetic Biology and our project and took notes of the commentariesaudience. We got really helpful advises about our project and the risks and problems we may encounter during our experiments.  Further, we conducted our survey. After estimation of commentaries and survey results we conclude that we have left a positive impression about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Then we visited their advanced laboratories and animal testing"

Undergraduate Team Members
Jacky Cheung
Named after Hong Kong pop sensation Jacky Cheung, Jacky is currently a sophomore at Columbia College studying computer science with his mind set on going into medicine. However, Jacky's web design skills are rather lackluster. Nonetheless, he makes a fantastic last-minute logo designer in his humble opinion and did his best to organize and take care of soft-, dry-, and wet- lab responsibilties. Outside of iGEM, Jacky enjoys playing handball, table tennis, and basketball if he's not buried under a pile of work that has to be done or sleeping.
Samuel (Sam) Magaziner
Descended from the noble Magaziner clan of Humenne, Hungary (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire), makers and managers of an exploding powder magazine factory, Sam has turned his interests to more peaceful and less explosive pursuits.  A 4th year undergraduate Biochemistry major, Sam enjoys microbiomes, gut peptides, and long walks on the beach.  Some say his beard whispers secrets of arcane and scientific portents whilst he transforms cells.  Others say it makes him look Amish.  Regardless, Sam played a major role in construct and experimental design.
Hudson Lee
Surprisingly not named after the Hudson River, much to the disbelief of his other New York City natives, Hudson is currently a 2nd year undergraduate Biology major.  Outside of the classroom, his interests include gymnastics, Korean Barbecue, breakdancing, and long walks on the beach.  Apart from iGEM, he splits his time among Ballroom, Hip-Hop, and Capoeira dance teams.  Even with these other commitments, Hudson headed up logo and banner designs as well as wetwork.

Kong hails from Bangkok, Thailand and is a sophomore studying Biology. When not pipetting, he’s usually cooking, learning Spanish from Kenya, who he is in turn teaching Thai, and watching Netflix (mainly Gossip Girl). Though he has never been"
Melbourne,2014,Team:Melbourne#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," advised us that our project may have commercial applications, however it was probably too soon to act on the idea and convert it into a provisional patent, so we decided to hold off and wait till we had a more substantiated grasp on our commercial applications. We were also advised that if at any point we wanted to file for IP protection on the project, it would be really important to not have disclosed the details of our idea to anyone else, as this could result in us losing the right to our IP.
After doing some research on the various law firms who could offer us a provisional patent, we discovered the estimated cost would be in the vicinity of $3500-$6500 depending on the level of detail we wanted to cover e.g. the number and extent of the claims, the full description of the idea, diagrams and experimental protocols as well as the filing & service fees associated.
Due to the relatively high estimates we received, we looked into other options for filing a provisional, including recruiting a law student to join the team and contribute their knowledge to our IP protection. This avenue did not eventuate as our ideas on what we would like to patent continuously evolved over the course of the project and we could not reach a sufficient degree of clarity to bring on a lawyer for the filing of a provisional patent.
Nonetheless, we proceeded with caution, ensuring to follow the advice of the University of Melbourne’s tech transfer office and not disclose our ideas without ensuring our disclosure was protected. An instance when we had to implement this protection was during our scientific collaboration with Oxford, were we ensured Non Disclosure Agreements were signed prior to the disclosure of our project to them. They indicated their interest in using our project as a case study in their ‘iGEM intellectual property guide’, however we felt that this might put our IP rights in jeopardy, so we decided not to proceed as a case study.
At this time, our team is looking to produce at least one provisional patent following the iGEM 2014 competition on at least one of the various techniques we designed during the project.

Terra is designed to automate synthetic biology experiments run on microfluidic chips and the dispensing of the products. To utilize our system, the synthetic biologist would briefly educate themselves on microfluidic chip design or choose a predesigned chip from the 2017 BostonU Hardware team, MARS’, repository. The biologist would then fabricate and assemble the chip and connect the chip to Terra’s hardware components. They also have the option of utilizing commercially available microfluidic chips if they connect the output of the commercial chip to the TERRA Adapter, a predesigned chip for selecting outputs. They would input the parameters of the experiment to the Terra’s software interface and execute the experiment using our automated system. The outputs of the experiment would be selectively dispensed from the microfluidic chip to the 96-well plate, ready for analysis.
This system creates an interface between traditional benchtop biology and microfluidics and removes some menial work, like pipetting, from standard benchtop experiments. This would benefit the field by granting biologists more time to focus on the underlying science and experiment design behind their research.
As a proof-of-concept, Terra aims to dispense green fluorescent protein in a system within a microfluidic chip. Our experiment will consist of creating a gradient of concentrations of GFP among wells of a microtiter plate. The outputs of this experiment will then be selectively dispensed via the XY-stage according to the input to the software interface.

Macrophage-mediated Inflammatory Disorders
Mediators of inflammation induced by macrophages are critical for a variety of human inflammatory disorders (Jou et al., 2013), such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Gout. Once activated macrophages actively secrete and cause an imbalance of cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of inflammation (Jou et al., 2013).
Gout
Gout is a painful and potentially disabling form of arthritis. The first symptoms are usually intense episodes of painful swelling in single joints, most often in the feet, especially the big toe, which turns red and warm. 50% of first episodes occur in the big toe, but any joint can be involved. The diagnosis of gout can be difficult, and often treatment plans must be adapted to each person, including nutritional education and use of drugs (Schumacher, 2015).
Gout affects the quality of life due to intermittent attacks and the potential of becoming chronic (Schumacher, 2015). This disease occurs in about 4% of American adults (about 6 million men and 2 million women; Arthritis Foundation, 2015).
This disease occurs when excess uric acid (a normal waste product) collects in the body, and urate crystals deposit in the joints. Certain foods (such as shellfish and red meats, alcohol in excess, sugary drinks and foods that are high in fructose) and drugs (such as low-dose aspirin, certain diuretics, and immunosuppressants used in organ transplants) may raise uric acid levels and lead to gout attacks (Schumacher, 2015).
Over time, increased uric acid levels in the blood may lead to deposits of urate crystals in and around the joints. These crystals can attract white blood cells, leading to severe, painful gout attacks and chronic arthritis. Uric acid also can deposit in the urinary tract, causing kidney stones (Schumacher, 2015).

We would like to thank our team members for their efforts and contributions to our project, and the companies and individuals who have provided our team with generous help over the summer.
Team training and Project start
iGEM is a comprehensive competition with core of synthetic biology involving many subjects, such as computer science, mathematics and so on, so this year we enrolled new members in all majors of our university. Before this, we gave a lecture about iGEM, explaining what you need to do after joining the team, and what you can get out of it. After the written test and interview, the selected people entered one or more different groups according to their wishes. For example, this year we divided our team into four groups: the experimental group, model group, wiki group and HP group. Later, team leaders provided a list of books including synthetic biology, biological basic experiment, modeling, web making and other aspects. In addition to reading books, we needed to do some research. The team leaders assigned tasks to everyone in order to learn about the projects of the previous excellent iGEM teams. At the same time, the members of the experimental group were required to participate in weekly group meetings and the training of biological laboratory technique. The remaining groups attended meetings at regular intervals to learn about the project's progress and report their work. During the meeting, we discussed academic articles and brainstormed. What’s more, PIs and Instructors taught the knowledge of synthetic biology. After a while, we determined the direction of this year's project. When the summer vacation came, we began to experiment.

E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with both plasmids is expected to produce indigoidine at a faster rate, as compared to E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pRB5 alone.
Biobricking ychH promoter
As described in
Parts
, we wish to express enzymes for ammonia synthesis using a constitutive promoter that is active under nutrient starvation conditions. For this purpose, we chose the promoter of the ychH gene. We amplified a fragment containing the ychH promoter from the E. coli MG1655 genome using the following primers:
Fwd_BB_ychH_prom: 5’-GTTTCTTCGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGgtttttttgtcctgagtgtgtacataac
Rev_BB_ychH_prom: 5’-GAAGAAACCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTAtcacctccggaactttctg
Primers Fwd_BB_ychH_prom and Rev_BB_ychH_prom contain the prefix and suffix, respectively, of a RFC10-compatible BioBrick. The BioBricked ychH promoter, along with the native RBS, was cloned in EcoRI- and PstI-digested pSB1C3 and submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry as Part BBa_K2479000.
Biobricking glnA gene
The glnA gene is cut by EcoRI at two places. To BioBrick this gene, these sites have to be removed. We got glnA gene with modified EcoRI sites synthesized as two 1 kb gBlocks from IDT; the first gBlock carried a 3' sequence homologous to the  5' sequence of the second primer. The two gBlocks were joined together by carrying out SOE PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase. However, multiple attempts to join the two gBlocks were unsuccessful.
Getting E. coli to work
The enzyme glutamine synthetase requires ATP as a cofactor, and releases protons on catalyzing the formation of glutamine from ammonium and glutamate. Hence, ATP will have to be continuously supplied to keep on assimilating ammonium. This can be achieved by pumping out the protons formed using proteorhodopsin, which is a light-powered proton pump. The resulting proton gradient can then drive native ATP synthase to form ATP, required for glutamine synth"

In this experiment both the WT P. putida and P. putida containing BBa_K1493000 are grown in a 96-wells plate at 0, 85, 170, 255, 340 and 425µM (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75µg/ml) fusaric acid. Furthermore, E. coli DH5α cells (WT and BBa BBa_K741002 ) were also grown in the same plate but without fusaric acid. The transformed E. coli has a well characterized promoter (pLac) with the same GFP gene downstream. (See Figure 6.) By comparing the fluorescence of our fusaric acid induced promoter at different fusaric acid concentrations to this constitutive promoter, characterization is performed. pLac is used as a constitutive promoter, which has shown activity without induction of IPTG .
Figure 6.
*Significantly different from WT with p<0.05
The measurement is based on GFP fluorescence in P. putida at increased concentrations of fusaric acid to prove and characterize the activity of the fusaric acid induced promoter, BBa_K1493000 . For comparison, the well characterized pLac promoter ( BBa_K741002 , uninduced by IPTG) was used to quantify the activity of this promoter at different concentrations of fusaric acid. Our fusaric acid inducible promoter does not respond to low concentrations up to 170µM. From 255µM and up, the activity increases. The maximum measured activity of the promoter is 0.21 RPU at 425µM.
Discussion
Up to now, the regulation of this fusaric acid efflux pump was only theoretical. The literature [4,5] merely suggested a possibility in the regulation of the efflux pump yet no data is shown whatsoever but from these results the following conclusions can be drawn.
The hypothesis that the combination of the inhibiting LysR-type gene[5] and the promoter in the intergenic region is indeed fusaric acid inducible is supported by the results of the growth experiment in Figure 6. To activate the promoter, the concentration of fusaric acid has to pass a certain threshold.
To further support this hypothesis, it was observed that the transformed P. putida cells did not survive a fusaric acid concentration of 565µM or higher, likely because of over-expression of the inhibiting gene pp1262, which would not only inhibit the activity of"

To perform our construct the following procedures
were followed
1. Resuspension de biobricks
2. Genetic Transformation
3. Plasmid Extraction
4. Digestion
5. Band Purification
6. Ligation
Removing long plasmidial
1. Inoculate desired strains into 2 ml of Plasmid broth (see Appendix B) plus antibiotic.
2. Aerate at 30-37°C until the cultures are fully saturated ( 8 hours to overnight).
3. Pour approximately 1.4 ml of culture into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Sediment the cells in a microcentrifuge for 30 seconds.
5. Remove the spent culture medium with a water aspirator equipped with a micropipette   tip or with a pasteur pipette. Remove as much liquid as possible.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 0.1 ml of PEB (see p.502) with gentle vortexing. Make sure that   the pellet is well-dispersed. Clumped cells yield decreased DNA.
7. Add 0.2 ml of ALM (see p.501) and mix gently by inverting the tube. The solution will clear
8. Add 0.15 ml of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.8; see p.502). Mix well by inverting and shaking   the tube. A flocculent white precipitate will form.
9. Sediment the precipitate at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet contains chromosomal   DNA and cell debris; the plasmid is in the supernatant.
10. Recover 400ul of supernatant into a clean tube containing 0.8 ml of cold 95% ethanol. The   insoluble “pellet” tends to float; avoid taking big chunks.
11. Chill for 30 minutes to overnight at -20°C. A light-brown DNA precipitate will form. This is a  good stopping point; the ethanol precipitate can be left indefinitely at -20°C.
12. Sediment the precipitate in a microcentrifuge at 14.000 rpm for 5 minutes.
13. Discard the supernatant and"
