It means if you want to stop weight losing, what you have to do is to eat some D-xylose, and the “E. coslim” will die, shed from the intestinal wall and be poured out. What is more, designed as a two-plasmid system, it prevents all possible horizontal gene transfers.
Further safety issues will be raised and discussed in future experiments, including those operates in intestinal model and animals (For more information, click on Future Perspectives).
Safety Management and Practice
Our project has past a review of an expert committee, of which members are professors or associate professors of microbiology, genetics and bioengineering. Safety issues are considered seriously before they approved our design.                We have consulted a few experts for safety questions about both artificial intestinal bacteria and experiments. Their advices help us improve the safety of the whole planning system. For that, we thank Dr. Yulan Wang and Dr. Tiangang Liu so much.               Our lab is supervised by Teaching Centre of Experimental Biology, Wuhan University (TCEB, whose leader is our instructor Dr. Zhixiong Xie). An expert group of this centre formulates safety guidelines and guarantees their performance in all teaching labs. All experiments we do past its review. Our safety management system includes the followings: Management of Chemicals, Equipments and Experimenters: Chemicals and equipments are registered in TCEB before they are available for us. Equipments are checked and maintained regular. And an entrance guard system is used to ensure only the admitted could enter the lab.
Responsibility distribution: All members worked in the lab are divided to three groups. The group leaders arrange schedules of experiments after assessing safety issues in the group (for example, the safety train of the experimental executer). Every member records his/her  experiments in detail in the notebook of the group. Each group takes responses for cleaning and checking risks in the lab in turns. The group leader takes responses to the team leader. The team leader reports regular on safety to engineer Miss Long Yan, who is authorized by TCEB and manages the lab.
Management of Chemicals, Equipments and Experimenters: Chemicals and equipments are registered in TCEB before they are available for us. Equipments are checked and maintained regular. And an entrance guard system is used to ensure only the admitted could enter the lab.
Training: Our team members have been trained after Guidance of Student Experiments formulated by TCEB.

Aug 2 ~ Aug 15, 2010 With Zhen Wang coming up with different generations of database, I make some discussion with him and help him to modify, specify and complement our database
Aug 16 ~ Aug 22, 2010 Start to learn how to utilize dbxml to aid us in the construction of our database. Be familiar with the environment and command of this software and scan the code to capture the basic features of it which will contribute to handling its APIs in our software Try to learn how to add contents of our team’s wiki
Aug 23 ~ Aug 29, 2010 Use 2009 Minnesota igem team as a trial, I list out all the materials we need in our database but detect that there are some details we can not cover in our database. Try to tackle with this problem with Chen Liao. What’s more, I apply for some financial aid or fund for my trip to MIT and fortunately I get it from my own department: School of Computer Science and Technology! Thanks to the support of my department, I can get a chance to America, to MIT, so I have to express my appreciation again! Though it is just founded before long and doesn’t have much finance at present, my school gives great supports to students and aids them to expand the horizon and improve their abilities in comprehensive fields. With a lot of young but full of research background teachers and professors, I think my school will have a bright future!

At first we want to use MySQL to manage our database, later we find Berkeley DBXML is a
better tool, so I studied on how to use DBXML. Kun Jiang quickly write an interface using
DBXML API and a small PDF instruction, code genius! Finish database format v3.0 – the 3rd

GDSYZX
At the very beginning of the summer vocation, we received our experimental skills training courses together with team GDSYZX. After the courses, we still had frequent communication with each other.
Our team helped them amplify their PCS1 and HMA2 plasmids, which they used in their project about solving the contamination of heavy metal. They also helped us transfer plasmids p7NS1-GFP into E.coli Dh5αfor the amplification of the plasmids.
In September and October, we presented our project to each other, we give comments on each others’ PPT. For instance, our team pointed out that their ppt should be more succinct. And we also learn from their ppt that it is a good idea to use the animation effect to illustrate some actions in our project design. We also helped each other team to prepare for the presentation by asking questions. We found it useful because viewing our project from another prospective would usually remind us of some issues that we don’t pay much attention to. For example, their questions about the safety issue of our product actually pushed us to do more research and add some new information into our presentation
SCAU-China
We had long-term collaboration with team SCAU-China.
As a high school team, we lacked some of the experimental equipment necessary to complete interlab, and SCAU-China accidentally damaged their Silica Beads, we have an opportunity to establish a good interaction with the undergraduate team SCAU-China.We provided Silica Beads to SCAU-China and they loaned us their microplate reader and helped us to use it. With the help of each other, we finally successfully completed the interlab measurement task.
Based on friendly relations, this summer, SCAU-China  offered us a 7-day-crouse about the basic skill of art design, which helps us to finish our wiki and poster.
What’s more, we also  regularly hold meetings to exchange information on the project and they gave us some advice which advance the progress of our project.

Toxicity Analysis:
Our main issue was determining the genes that would have a positive effect on bacterial fermentation. Thus, we analyzed the toxicity of different inhibitory                  molecules and substances produced during pretreatment: Furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and aliphatic acids; such as formic acid, and levulinic acid.
Figure 3:                     The data were obtained from Kim et al. (2013).  According to  Kim et al. (2013), inhibitor substances were put individually into the medium in 5g/L and                      relative cell growths were calculated.  In the presence of furfural and HMF, relative growth was lower than in the presence of formic acid, and levulinic                      acid (Kim et al., 2013).
Toxicity Analysis Results:
Formic acid and Levulinic acid were shown to inhibit the growth significantly but furans were worse (Kim et al., 2013). Hence, we chose to focus on furans.                  When we discard the lag caused by the inhibitors and focus on the last state, it was possible to calculate what percentage the cell growth was inhibited.                  Furans (Furfural and HMF) showed approximately 80% inhibition which is the highest number among thus we decided to increase the tolerance of E.coli to furans.
Furans (HMF & Furfural):
According to the analysis, furans were found to be the most toxic substances when it comes to cell growth (Kim et al., 2013). The most used pretreatment process,                  dilute acid, gives rise to the formation of furanic aldehydes (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hagerdal, 2000; Larsson et al., 1999; Thomsen et al., 2009; Klinke et al., 2004).                  They are highly reactive, contributing to the birth of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which damage proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles (Wierckx et al., 2011).                   Because of the toxicity provided by furans, cell mass and productivity of fermentation decreases (Almeida et al., 2009; Palmqvist and Hahn-Hagerdal, 2000b; Thomsen et al"

If we want to know how far downstream the chemicals will be mixed vertically in the river ($L_Z$) then $l$ = $h$ and $k$ = 0.067 [1]. The larger of these $L$ values will determine where we need to place our biosensor for a giver river. This gives us the following two equations       $$L_Y=  \frac{Qw}{0.6h^2\sqrt{ghs}}$$      $$L_Z=  \frac{Q}{0.067w\sqrt{ghs}}$$
Calculation of Biosensor Placement
Now that we have equations for finding how far downstream we should place our biosensors it is time to plug in actually values. The values we need are the height, width, slope and the volumetric flow rate of the river. Since we could not measure these values ourselves we conducted research to see if environmental organizations monitoring the Alberta Oil Sands have tabulated these values. In particular the Alberta Government [2] and the Regional Monitoring Aquatics Program (RAMP) [3] have been conducting hydrologic tests on the Alberta Oil Sands for over a decade. Using data collected from these two independent sources we were able calculated $L_Y$ and $L_Z$ for several different rivers in the Alberta Oil Sands. The placement of these biosensors can be seen on the map below. In addition to these biosensors we’ve also marked on the map potential locations for our biosensors for rivers where we couldn’t get data on but are important nonetheless for quantifying the release of toxins into the Athabasca Oil Sands. These sites were chosen based on their proximity to tailing ponds and their similarity to the rivers for which we have data on. The determined locations are marked in green and the potential locations are marked in red.

Once checked, we cloned our construct into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain, a specific dedicated strain to produce high amounts of desired proteins under a T7 promoter. Bacteria were grown in 25 mL culture, and protein expression was induced with different IPTG concentrations during exponential phase at an OD600nm at 37°C. A 1 mL aliquot was centrifuged and the pellet stored at -20°C.
After two hours of induction, we centrifuged and collected both supernatant and pellet separately.
Test of RIP effect on S. aureus biofilm formation
Fluorescence reading experiments
Since RIP is only a seven-aminoacid peptide, we were not able to check its production by classic SDS-PAGE. Thus, we tried to check its expression by observing its effect on Staphylococcus aureus growth and adhesion. We grew a S. aureus strain expressing GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein), (kindly provided by Pr. Jean-Marc Ghigo) on 96-well microtiter plates with different fractions of supernatant or pellet of our BL21(DE3) pLysS bacterial cultures containing BBa_K26160001.
After 48h or more of incubation at 37°C, we washed the plates in order to discard planktonic bacteria, and read fluorescence (excitation at 485 nm and measuring emission at 510 nm).

In blue, S. aureus in the presence of culture Medium from induced BL21(DE3) E. coli expressing RIP. In green, S. aureus in the presence of the cell lysate supernatant from induced BL21(DE3) E. coli expressing RIP. Every measurement was done eight times and the bars show the average fluorescence.

Also, she asked us how we organize our fundraising. There are two possibilities for sponsoring: financial support or donations in kind. Due to the fact that Merck KGaA sponsors us every year, we usually focus on the latter. For financial support we set up letters very early every year and send these to possible sponsors. We suggested to the team to already do this for next year’s competition.
The last topic she was interested in was concerning the team structure and how we organize a team of about 30 members. For our three student team leaders it is all about communication with the members, the lab groups, the lab leader, last year’s members and our instructing professor. The team leaders must stay on top of things and arrange duties clearly to avoid two people working on the same task.
We hope the team can profit from our advices just like we did last year from iGEM Stockholm and wish them the best of luck for their first year at the Jamboree!

Again this year, iGEM TU Darmstadt was part of the German Meetup (Marburg, June) and the European Meetup (Munich, July). During both meetups we enjoyed having poster sessions, exchanging project ideas, finding possible collaborations and hearing talks of experts in the field of synthetic biology.
Meetups are a great opportunity for us to present our project to a broad and interested audience, to get in contact with other iGEM teams and as a preparation for the poster sessions in Boston. Discussions about our project were very helpful to obtain other perspectives concerning our project and gaining a lot of impressions and ideas on how to improve our project.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Model#EKD_-_-_TEXT.html,"ptophan) is maintained in the system at a constant, saturating concentration, thus the first enzyme produces the second substrate (IAM) at a constant rate. This leads to a simple, linear diffusion of IAM from enzyme A. Thus, the production rate at enzyme A of substrate 2 is simply the Vmax of enzyme A (equation 2).
$$\frac{d[S2]}{dt} = Vmax \tag{2} $$
During consultations with industry about our model, the idea of keeping the first substrate in constant supply to the system arose. Dr Warren King suggested that it would be preferable in a commercial setting, as continuous systems generally make more efficient use of resources. Dr King also confirmed it would simplify the remainder of our analysis in developing the model.
Fick’s law is used to describe the diffusion of IAM from enzyme A into the system in two dimensions (equation 3).
$$J = -D \nabla \varphi \tag{3} $$
Where J is the diffusion flux in amount per unit area per unit time, D is the diffusivity in area per unit time, and ϕ denotes the concentration in amount per unit volume. The driving force of diffusion using Fick’s law is a concentration gradient. The concentration gradient in this model is determined by the difference in production and consumption of substrate 2 between the first and second enzyme. Thus the rate of substrate consumption at the second enzyme will determine the diffusive flux toward second enzyme.
We define the second enzyme in the system as the sink for diffusion, with consumption rate a 1st order reaction defined by the Michaelis-Menten equation. At the edge of the second enzyme (represented by E4 on the diagram), the consuming boundary condition is defined by equation 3.
$$\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \frac{Vmax[S2]}{Km + [S2]} \tag{4}$$
Vmax and Km are now specific to the second enzyme; indole acetamide hydrolase. As the substrate needs to diffuse from enzyme A, the concentration of substrate reaching enzyme B is expected to be low, therefore the reaction rate at the second enzyme is dependent on the amount of substrate reaching enzyme B through diffusion. Thus the 1st order form of the Michaelis-Menten equation applies.
Our System

Model of MIN system
Tianjin Team use a classical model, density-dependent growth model, for helping BIT-China to stimulate population of E.coli growing. Also they use some other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
Then they use these equations to simulate the function of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
Figure 1. The dynamic change of cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell division process is inhibited.

Considerations:
- Wear gloves at ALL times
- Keep ethidium bromide in one place and wear gloves when using it. Once you have finished using it OR are walking to other areas of lab, remove gloves and put on a fresh pair. ETHIDIUM BROMIDE IS A CARCINOGEN – DON’T SPREAD IT ALL OVER THE LAB!
Preparing the gel
Image 1: 0.8% Agarose Gel
Make up a stock of agarose solution, in which the agarose should constitute 0.8% of the weight/volume (the rest should be made up of the buffer used for the DNA electrophoresis – see step 2 before proceeding)
Melt the agarose solution. This should be done in a microwave, initially for 3 minutes on a medium/high setting. After this time has expired take out the solution using gloves and hold up to the light. Give it a swirl and check for any solids within the solution. If it hasn’t completely melted, put it back in the microwave until it does.
***Important note: when putting gel in microwave, keep checking on it regularly (once every 30-40 secs) – it must not be left unattended!***

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," RFP gene into E. coli and in degradation part, we transformed some enzymes in purine metabolic pathway into our engineered bacteria. Therefore, no toxic matters will be produce in our bacteria. Our engineered bacteria have either chloramphenicol resistance or ampicillin resistance, which are widely used in the lab and have been widely confirmed to be safe.
Safe organism
We used and only used E. coli in our experiments. The strain of E. coli we use are TOP10, BL21 and DH5α, which means that all the organism we used in our lab are of group 1 risk. In addition, we separated our organisms from other organisms in the lab that are used by others. There is no phage or virus in our lab and our lab is of group 2 risk.
Safe Shipment
We have already sent our parts to iGEM Headquarters. Our parts are not in the select agents and toxins list. They are safe and well packed. There’s no liquid, no organism, no toxin in the package, only plasmids that are allowed to ship. Our parts are on their way to Boston, bon voyage!
Protocol
Add 1g agarose into 100mL 1×TAE buffer. Boil in miccolumnave oven to dissolve the agarose. The agarose concentration depends on the DNA size. 1% is the most commonly used concentration. Add in 5µl view dye in 100mL solution when it is cooled down to 60℃.
Choose the suitable gel tank and insert the comb. The electrophoresis comb according to the purpose. Pour the fluid agarose gel into the tank. After a complete solidification soak the gel in 1×TAE buffer to make the DNA strips clearer.
Pour enough running buffer into the electrophoresis tank and put the agarose gel in the electrophoresis tank.
Mix the sample with loading buffer sufficiently and load them into the sample lane together with proper marker. The choice of the marker is dictated by the size of the target DNA. Some PCR system already add loading.
Run the electrophoresis under 120V.
fter 15-20 min, put the gel in an UV detector and record the picture.
The 50% glycerin should be autoclaved before use.
Mix 600µl bacteria solution with 600µl 50% glycerin separately in two 1.5mL tubes.
Seal the tubes with parafilm.
Preserve one tube in -20℃ refrigerator and another one in -80℃"
Stockholm,2016,Team:Stockholm#Results-esp_-_-_TEXT.html," 60 min 37 °C incubation and 20 min of heat kill. T4 ligase was used to ligate digested EB, LT and the pSB1C3 backbone.
Subsequently a gel for both the digestion and ligation product was run. Unfortunately, no bands for the ligation and digestion product appeared in the gel, indicating unsuccessful reactions. Perhaps the gel purification might have diluted the digestion product or the conditions for digestion and ligation might not be optimal.
Digestion and Ligation, Second Attempt [❌]
We had another three attempts for digestion and ligation. Various component and time for incubation and heat kill were optimized. None of them succeeded. If the digestions were successful or not was hard to judge as the digested DNA sequence had similar size as the undigested one. We observed faint bands at over 3000 bp which might correspond to the assembled plasmid. Then we moved on with transformation the new construct into both TOP10 cells and BL21(DE3) cells. Unfortunately, the only colony observed was shown to not contain EB. It is unclear whether the fault lies with low efficacy digestion and ligation or with the transformation process.

Overhang PCR with New Strategy [❌]
After several failure in digestion and ligation, we decided to use a new strategy: amplifying the whole pSB1C3-T7-EB construct with the addition of a BamHI restriction sequence after the EB coding sequence. The PCR was performed with Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase. Due to time limitation, we only tried three annealing temperatures. Unfortunately, none of the PCR products showed bands in the gel.
Figure 11: Overhang PCR with new strategy. (1) DNA ladder (2) Overhang EB1 (3) Overhang EB2 (4) Negative control.
In conclusion, we managed to add BamHI overhang to EB after several failures. However, the digestion and ligation were unsuccessful. The digested product was hard to tell from the gel because the undigested sample had similar size as its. In all four attempts for ligation and transformation, only one colony developed in the third attempt, while it didn’t have the correct sequence.
A new strategy was tried to add BamHI"
Uppsala,2018,Team:Uppsala#test bild_-_-_TEXT.html," When untreated, the death tolI can reach up to 50%. During the seasonal rupture of cysts, millions of larvae can be released at the same time, which can result in severe and life-threatening consequences [5]. The infection of small strongyles is not one of presence, but one of quantity. They are not dangerous in small amounts and therefore it is difficult to tell whether a horse needs to be treated or not [9].
If farmers had the possibility to know when to treat their horses, prevention of mass rupture and other severe consequences like increased resistance development could be achieved. To reach this goal we have developed a model that (based on multiple parameters) calculates the optimal amount of treatments in a specified period. This will avoid unnecessary use of anthelmintics by raising the awareness in farmers regarding when they actually need to treat their horses.
Current Methods for Detection
Currently the only method for detecting/counting how many worms there are in an animal is counting nematode eggs in fecal    samples. This method is not reliable and also requires farmers and ranchers to send in fecal samples to a lab with trained personnel [4]. This technique is expensive, inconsistent, and requires time sensitive shipping of samples. Currently many horse owners are reluctant to conduct the testing; treating their horses regardless of need which contributes to the resistance problem [10].
Resistance Development
Unfortunately, the extensive overuse of deworming drugs has now lead to the detection  of worms that are resistant to the most commonly used drugs [2,4]. Since no new deworming drugs have been approved for use in horses the whole equine industry relies on macrocyclic lactones, currently the most common type of deworming drugs used. Unfortunately, cases of resistance among nematode adults have been spotted for macrocyclic lactones as well. So far, four studies with similar results spanning from Europe to North America have been published with concrete data, linking certain small strongyle species to reduced time until detection of eggs after deworming treatment, showing an increase in resistance [2].
Moxidectin is a very common drug used. It is both hazardous for the environment and is also losing its effectiveness towards worm populations [14,15].
Due to all of these facts, we have during our iGEM project developed a reporter that is suitable for the in vivo environment of horse intestines. Moreover, we have developed new applications on existing techniques to be able to find the promoter that would be coupled to the reporter which would at last create the worm buster.
By implementing the model described under Symptoms together with the worm buster, horse owners"

Do we want to note every little detail about every successful or unsuccessful experiment or just the main important aspect?
We discussed, sighted some former iGEM team wikis and decided:
each team is responsible for their own lab journal entries
we divide our lab journal in weeks and days to prevent it from looking too chaotic.
the texts are supposed to state which team is writing, which experiment has been done and what the main aspects were. Also we will write about successful experiments, as well as problems and solutions we came up with. If possible links to protocols with further information shall be created.

Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:
Imported sequences of most of the used bacterial Laccases into Clonemanager and analysed their restriction-sites:
bhal has no illegal restriction-sites
ecol has one NgoMIV-restriction-site
bpul has one XbaI-Restriction-site and one mutation two AgeI- and two NgoMIV-restriction-sites (Decided to delete the Freiburg-restriction-sites would take too much time)
tthl has one PstI-restriction-site and two NgoMIV-restriction-sites (Decided to delete the Freiburg-restriction-sites would take too much time)
xccl has two PstI, one AgeI and seven NgoMIV-restriction-sites (Decided not to change the NgoMIV-sites, since to mutate seven would take too much time)
Team Modeling:
Finding out, that the ""normal"" Michaelis-Menten kinetic isn't the right kinetic to model our situation, because therefor you need a high and steady state concentration of the substrates. We have low concentrations and not really study state. We found a transformed equation.
Thursday June 21st
Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:
Plasmid isolation and control digest with NotI on tthl(T7)_His and luckily this time the bands were where they should be. Again and again we did transformation of ligation with bpul(T7)_His laccase in pSB1C3 backbone..all fingers are crossed that this time we have colonies with the correct plasmid.
Team Activity Tests and Team Immobilization:
After all this characterizing we feel so much closer to our T. versicolor laccase that its about time to make some activity test under immobilized conditions. So now we are cooperating with Team Immobilization. We have thought about many ways how to immobilize the laccase and"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#halo_-_-_TEXT.html,"titer plate of the measurements for pH optimum determination. The more intensive the blue color, the more ABTS got oxidized. At pH 4 and pH 5 the darkest colour was detected.
To determine the optimal experimental setup for BHAL activity measurements, the best pH had to be determined. Using Britton-Robinson buffer pHs between pH 4 and pH 9 had been adjusted. 308 ng BHAL per well had been tested under these pH conditions using 7 mM ABTS. The CuCl2 incubated and therefor activated BHAL showed a high activity at pH 4 and pH 5, where most of ABTS was oxidized (compared to Fig. 9 and 10). The calculated specific enzyme activity of BHAL showed high activity at both mentioned pHs (Fig. 11). While BHAL had an activity of ~8 U mg-1 at pH 4 and pH 5, the enzyme activity decreased at higher pHs. At a pH of 6 only 1/3 of enzyme activity could be detected compared to the activity at pH 4 and pH 5. While still active at pH 7, the BHAL is not as suitable as thought for an application at a waste water treatment plant because of its high activity in acidic environments.
Figure 10: Oxidized ABTS by BHAL at different pH adjustments. The experimental setup included CuCl2 incubated BHAL (308 ng), Britton Robinson buffer adjusted to the tested pHs and 5 mM ABTS. Measurements were done at 25 °C for 30 minutes. The highest amount of oxidzed ABTS could be detected at pH 4 and pH 5.
Figure 11: Calculated specific enzyme activity of BHAL at different pH conditions. The highest specific enzyme activity for ABTS was under pH 4 and pH 5 conditions. The higher the pH, the less ABTS got oxidzed. One unit is defined as the amount of laccase that oxidizes 1 μmol of ABTS substrate per minute.
Since Regionals: BHAL activity at different temperatures
Figure 12: Standard activity test for BHAL measured at 10 °C and 25 °C resulting in a decreased activity at 10 °C. As a negative control the impact of 0.4 mM CuCl2 in oxidizing ABTS at 10 °C and 25 °C was analyzed.
Figure 13: Deriving from the obtained values of oxidized ABTS in time at 10 °C and 25 °C the specific enzyme activity was calculated"
SCUT,2014,Team:SCUT-China#Policy&Practices#Public Outreach_-_-_TEXT.html,"Our cooperator, SCAU, designed and made some models of cute characteristics which present different fields where synthetic biology can be used, which were prepared for people to take pictures. They attracted many children here to get some knowledge.
4.brochures
In the meantime, we made 2,000 brochures about Employing Synthetic Biology, To Combat Antimicrobial Resistance to showcase how synthetic biology influence and make our life better in its safety way. During the exhibition, the audiences were so enthusiastic that we were frequently asked about synthetic biology and our project.
5.signature wall
In addition, we made a ""signature wall"" to let the public express their supporting for the application of synthetic biology in our daily life. We are surprised that audiences have already signed the whole wall after the first day of the exhibition.
Conclusion
For the first a-week holiday, we totally receive approximately 20,000 people from different places at different ages. According to the number of people (the number in weekday is about 10,000 per day, and in weekends is about 20,000 per day), We predict there can be approximately 400,000 people who can learn something from our exhibition more or less. It is the efforts we pay that gave us a great return, and we are also grateful for the SCAU team helping us design photo models and do video propagandizing. In a conclusion, we can say that we make a great success on outreaching synthetic biology by combined our project.

To each of these test tubes, add 10 mL of E coli overnight. Cells were then pelleted via centrifuge at 4000rpm for 10min at 7 Celsius. Supernatant was taken out using pipets and discarded. E coli was then resuspended in 10mL M9+ supplemented with uracil and adenine.
- To four centrifuge tubes, add 0, 100, 200, and 500 uL of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (add nothing to C). The volume of the mutagen should correspond to the label on the test tube. Because 5-bromodeoxyuridine stock is a 10mg/mL aqueous solution, the final mutagen concentration in the five test tubes will be 0, 100, 200, and 500 ug/mL.
- Let the bacterial suspension incubate with mutagen for approximately 1h 30min.
- 30uL of 5.3 phage stock was added to each centrifuge tube (add nothing to C). From 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock, we know that 5.3 phage stock has 7E8 particles/20uL. Thus, to each of the test tubes, we are adding approximately 1.2E9 particles.
- Incubate phage on shaker at 37C for 3 hours.
- Added 1mL of chloroform to each test tube. Liquid culture from the four test (excluding C) tubes is then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet cell debris. Supernatant containing phage particles is removed and placed in a new tube.
- The stock solutions are now stored in 4 Celsius.
2) Titer to Determine Phage Concentration 1 (7.10)
- For each mutagenesis, specifically 0, 100, 200, and 500ug/mL, 1:100 dilution series were performed to generate 0, -2, -4, -6, and -8 dilutions.
- For each dilution, a test tube was assigned to it. To each test tube, 0.75mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight was added and then transfected with 30uL of phage dilution. After 20 minutes of incubation, 7mL of x8 agar was added to each test tube and the content was then plated.

Groningen,2016,Team:Groningen#Applications_-_-_TEXT.html,", while electronic and magnetic storage     media suffer from deterioration after just a few decades,     illustrating some of the preservation issues that must be taken     into account. For instance, while disk drives capable of reading 5     1⁄4 inch floppy disks were commonly used before the turn of the     21st century, you would be hard pressed to find one today. In this     respect, DNA presents and excellent medium for storage of     information meant for the distant future; as long as there is     intelligent DNA-based life, there will be a reason to study DNA. As     such, technologies for manipulating DNA can be expected to exist in     the future.
A time capsule holding information encoded in DNA can serve as       more than just a message to the future. Given it’s density,       durability and low energy requirements, DNA-based time capsules can       be used to preserve human knowledge for future civilizations or       extraterrestrial visitors, in case of an Extinction Level Event       that wipes out our society. The KEO space time capsule, set to       launch some time in 2017, is meant to carry a compendium of current       human knowledge, and is designed to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere in       50,000 years. Although 50 millennia seems like a long time to us,       it is a blink of an eye from cosmological and evolutionary       perspectives. Information preserved in DNA can potentially last for       millions of years [3] , and therefore may someday be discovered by a       completely new humanoid species. The Voyager Golden Records,       launched aboard the Voyager space probes in 1977 are another       example of time capsules in space. These phonograph records contain       115 images and almost 1.5 hours of sounds chosen to portray life on       Earth. These records will never be seen by human eyes again, as       they are over 2.02×1010 km away, and heading away from Earth at a       speed of about 62,100 km per hour. Instead, they are meant for an       extraterrestrial audience.  Although expected to last for millions       of years, these records represent a proverbial drop in an ocean of       human knowledge. A DNA-based archive included in such a time       capsule could represent a much more detailed snapshot of our       civilization.

Fri, June 21: Our drag-and-drop is finally looking more like our imagined final product! At this point, we can drag components, drop them, rearrange them, make them ""snap"" together when they're within 50 pixels of one another, delete them by dropping them on a trashcan icon, store their respective positions on the canvas, and them reload them in the stored positions. We've started thinking about the back-end of things, too; we're going to have to figure out how the visualization interacts with various databases, where to store the databases, etc. As of right now the basic plan is that we'll connect to BU's Clotho database, and then save certain information into local temporary storage as the user searches for and loads parts/devices. Next week, we're going to try to integrate our web page with our drag-and-drop. On a more fun note, the lab went on an outing today to eat dinner at TGI Fridays and then see Monsters University :)
Week 5: June 24 - June 28
Mon, June 24: Today, Sravanti and I mostly worked on moving our drag and drop functionality over to a web application, i.e. translating our jQuery code into Angular JS. The latter programming language is actually quite elegant and effective; there are a lot of useful built-in functionalities. For example, there is a built-in boolean property in the drag and drop functionality that allows a user to drag copies of an element onto a canvas, thus allowing for multiple copies of the same element to be used. This was a function that took some major work to implement in jQuery, so it's great that it's built in to Angular JS. Meanwhile, Diana, Tiffany, and Catherine have been working on the look and feel of the website, and it looks great! Right now, the website is tabbed, but we're hoping to create movable sliders (a la Mac OS X's multiple desktop feature) soon.
Wed, June 25: At this point, progress on the web app is extremely slow-going. We got a break from wrestling with the code to listen to Barton Fiske from ZSpace talk to us about the hardware. My team isn't using the ZSpace machine, but we've been around to watch and listen to the progress that the ZSpace team has been making on their project, so it was interesting to hear about the mechanics of the hardware itself and what makes the product so revolutionary. The crux of it seems to be the fact that it has motion parallax, which essentially adjusts the 3D image"

Hi, my name is Karen! I’m in grade 12 at Chinook High School. I joined iGEM because science is my favourite! iGEM has provided me with a wonderful amount of scientific knowledge-- but also other important things, such as Human Practices, presentation-making, and public speaking. For the future, my plan is to go into the biological sciences at university. Other than science, I love cats, cereal, and walking in nature.

Grade 12
Hello! My name is Wade Zhang, and I am 17 years old, having just finished my 11th year at Winston Churchill High School.  I joined iGEM because of my interest in poking small things for science, but it has also been very interesting learning about all the bigger things related to biological applications such as human ethics.  After I graduate, I would really like to apply the skills I have learned in a field related to promoting human health.  I like making and listening to music, and also enjoy flossing.

Histidine: 100 mg/mL, add 200 uL per liter
Tryptophan: 10 mg/mL, add 2 mL per liter
Methionine: 10 mg/mL, add 2 mL per liter
Of these, leucine, tryptophan, and methionine were made today.  To make leucine stock sol'n, dissolved 2.0025 g in 100 mL ddH2O.  To make tryptophan stock sol'n, dissolved 1.001 g in 100 mL ddH2O.  To make methionine stock sol'n, dissolved 0.500 g in 50 mL ddH2O.
Ran a gel of our PCR products from yesterday.  Visualization indicated that there were some successful PCR reactions.  From the right of the gel, there were bands in wells 7, 9, 21-24, and possibly also 16.  This appears to be slightly different than seen in the pictures taken earlier.  This corresponds to all three activators and two of the mCYC + BS parts (GliA and LexA).  Note that the actual sizes were very distinct for the activators but there was some confusion concerning the lengths and thus the identities of the mCYC + BS parts.
Ordered new dropout media.  This media has no carbon source, so we will be able to supplement it with galactose or glucose as needed.
Innoculated fresh colonies in YPD in preparation for transformations tomorrow.  Three 5 mL cultures of W3031a and one 5 mL culture apiece of GliA + GliArpt and ZifA + ZifArpt.  Took all cells directly from glycerol stocks, glycerol stock #1 in all cases (e.g. W3031a #1).  Placed in incubator ar 5:03 pm.

Purdue,2016,Team:Purdue#Design_-_-_TEXT.html," This is a problem because when cow manure is used as fertilizer, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient. Excess phosphorus then accumulates on the soil, and surface runoff can carry phosphorus to bodies of water. [5]
Therefore, our phosphorus-accumulating E. coli could be applied to remove some phosphorus from the effluent after the effluent leaves the digester. This way, the effluent contains both necessary nutrients, but there would be less excess phosphorus. We could achieve this partial removal of phosphorus by choosing  the weaker constitutive σS promoter BBa_J45992. Also, the physical design of the system could allow for reduced contact between our E. coli and water in order to achieve this partial removal of phosphorus. Our system can also be adapted for nitrification, converting ammonia to water soluble nitrite, by adding the genes for ammonia monooxygenase (BBa_K1067003), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase(BBa_K1067004), and cytochromes A and X (BBa_K1067002). (These parts came from DTU Denmark’s 2013 iGEM project.[6]) Therefore, ammonia in the effluent will not be released as gas, and microorganisms in the soil can convert the nitrite to nitrate. This would increase the amount of nitrogen, the limiting nutrient in the effluent, that plants can use, and therefore, less effluent (and less excess phosphorus) would need to be applied.
Tile Drainage
[7]
Tile drainage systems are subsurface drainage systems used in agricultural fields that lack adequate natural drainage, and therefore remain wet several days after heavy rains.  About 25% of farmland in the United States and Canada uses tile drainage because over-saturated soils provide insufficient aeration and thus inhibit crop growth. The subsurface pipes collect the excess water and carry it to an outlet pipe, where the water is emptied into a ditch or natural waterway.[8]
While tile drainage systems are beneficial due to their ability to increase crop yields and reduce surface runoff, they also are problematic due to their export of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, such as atrazine, into waterways.[9] An eight-year study on six different tile drains and a watershed outlet within the Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed in central Ohio concluded that tile drainage systems’ contribution to phosphorus in surface water is not negligible, as previously thought. More than 90% of all measured concentrations exceeded 0.03 mg/L, the recommended level for minimizing algae growth. The annual flow-weighted mean"

Fermentation
Culture drives great results. - Jack Welch
Introduction
One of the fundamental aspects when establishing a directed evolution approach is to grant an advantage to the individuals with favorable         properties. In our setup we coupled correct binding properties of our Evobody proteins to a growth advantage in the form of a gradual         ampicillin resistance. To determine the applicability of this resistance and how selective pressure can be applied, we did several fermentations         to characterize the used strain.
Shaker flask cultivation with varying antibiotic concentrations
When communicating with industry associated experts, one question we were constantly asked was:""Why do you use ampicillin? Is ampicillin an adequate         selection marker?"" We thought about the possibility to use other antibiotics as our resistance marker, but as a huge part of our selective system was based on the beta-lactamase, we were hesitating to change our system.   So, to determine whether or not ampicillin was suitable for our projects goals, we designed a series of experiments of cultivations using          different setups regarding          resistancy and a broad range of different ampicillin concentrations. The strain which we used was meant to immitate our final construct.          That is why we transformed E. coli JS200"
OUC-China,2014,Team:OUC-China#Project Policy Practise_-_-_TEXT.html," to prevent contamination of food residues in aquaculture water. If it could be applied on our project, we could effectively solve the microbial leakage problems. But it also has drawbacks: the demanding production process requirements and high cost. Because of this, application is not very wide. Could our idea be blocked up with the high cost?
This lab is manufacturing chlorella. It's a nutrient-rich feed for some fish larvae.
In the ornamental fish industry, people don't care so much about the composition of the feed. We OUC-China came to the ornamental fish market and interviewed shopkeepers. We found that the price of aquarium fishes (both freshwater fish and seawater fish) is much higher than edible fishes, and they suffer from the same disease as the edible fishes. For ornamental fish, they have a higher death rate when they get ill, which is close to 90%. Fish amateurs are willing to bear relatively high expenses to prevent their pets from getting ill. We found there wasn't any feed with DNA vaccines or other drugs, but coated pellets which aims to prevent water from being polluted by the feed sells well. Therefore if we combined coated pellet technology with our projects and tried the feed with outer coat on the ornamental fish industry, it might represent a wide-open market.
These are normal pellets on the market now.
We think that our original problem has been solved: it would be manufactured if we use yeast as our chassis. At the same time, using coated particles to achieve oral vaccine will reduce the risk of biosafety hazards. If we apply our technology to ornamental fish industry, it won't develop so many problems. One day, this technology will become mature, and then there would be much fewer problems in aquaculture.

General topic
Diploma thesis (Phage Display of cyclic peptides)
Screening
Target enzyme: Protease NS3a/4a (serin protease) of Hep C Virus; Screening strategies for function: A system to screen in vivo could be the Yeast-two-hybrid system. As reporter gen an antibiotic resistence or an antibiotic is used. Screening for survival is performed. Nobody has worked with with this protease in the literature. Two screening vectors are available in Kristian's research group. Question: Does the hybrid system works in E. coli Another screening could be fusion proteins with single parts of GFP with a peptid linker between the two single parts. So GFP is active when the peptide linker is not cleaved. Screening strategy for interaction: Microarray in vitro screening
Phage Display/Diploma thesis
A cyclic model system is introduced by one of Katja's PHD students. Linear peptide is stabilized by small organic molecule. This work didn't include disulfide bonds. Cyclization is performed with organic chemystry. The phage display was done to find the best inhibition candidate. But the results were not as expected. They also performed an IC50 value test (standard assay system)
Modelling
Microviridine L (NIES843) targets serin proteases. Possible candidates: Thermostable Penicillin G acylase, subtilisin-like protease, membrane bound bifunctional transglycosylase (PBP1b)
Question: Are these proteases a good comparison for our aim?
Team introduces itself to the different server and programms to find a good way to model the connection betwenn mnicroviridin and our target protease. Therefore screening and modeling will connect more over the next few weeeks. RimK domain (I didn't get that part, maybe Niklas will tell us more the next time)

UMaryland,2015,Team:UMaryland#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," Maryland dept. of Entomology gave a presentation entitled ""Designer Pathogens"" featuring a vast array of his research group's synthetic biology projects. The main project involved a series of experiments  that incorporated toxins from fungi and receptors from bacteria that would spread disease among mosquitos in Africa, combating the transmision malaria. Results proved effective enough to advance to open field trials.
Further Collaboration
Because of this meet-up, we were able to further collaborate in several ways with teams in attendance. We learned that Duke University was also attempting to build a DIY Thermocycler, We were able to offer some guidance to Rock Ridge High School, and had some collaboration on the Interlab Study with the College of William and Mary.
Duke and PCR
Our collaboration with Duke started during the regional meet up. We came to an understanding that our machines were heading down similar paths, at the time. We understood that our teams had the same list of hardware, peltier elements, Arduino microprocessors, and motor controllers. Seeing that our goals were aligned we thought the best probability of success for our teams would come from a collaboration. We set up an email conversation with Duke and began exchanging weekly conversations about how we were progressing and sending each other pictures of our progress. When we ran into issues with our peltier units we spoke to Duke and warned them of the potential issues, and through the subsequent conversations with them we were able to conclude that the peltier platform was not ideal for PCR. We therefore switched gears and moved to designing a hairdryer based unit. Without a collaboration with Duke and the ability to have an open forum to discuss ideas we might have failed to recognize the short coming of our first device.
Rock Ridge Virginia and Project Design
After Rock Ridge presented their initial project design at the meetup, several of our members collaborated with their team to discuss the feasibility and direction of their project. Fortunately, several of our members has already discussed the possibility of undertaking a project that was very similar in nature to Rock Ridge's project. As a result, we had already completed the necessary research to advise Rock Ridge on their project that focused on the causative agent of lyme disease. We advised them of possible gene candidates and alterations to their proposed constructs. Our team also offered our similar project proposal for a novel lyme disease biosensor to Rock Ridge as an alternative option for them to undertake.
W&M and Interlab
Due to unfortunate circumstances pertaining to the reliability of cloning, we were unable to acquire one of the interlab study parts. Fortunately W&M send us the construct to permit us to proceed to testing. We must remark that"

We have created a new amyloid parts collection for the iGEM repository. It currently includes three amyloid forming parts including, Envirowire, a csgA Sup35-NM containing part, and the improved Sup35NM BioBrick from Valencia 2010
We have collaborated with UNITN-Trento team to help them with the modelling and provided presentation feedback because as the only Italian iGem team they were unable to meet up with other iGEM teams during the summer. We went to two UK meet-ups hosted by Birkbeck, and Westminster.

Tianjin,2011,Team:Tianjin#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," material of biofuel – biomass - is easy to obtain. Cellulose makes up of most part of biomass that can be fermented to produce biofuel, and cellulose exists in almost all plants. In this way, the biofuel factory will have no problem finding materials that contains cellulose. In addition, cellulose is cheap. It exists mainly in the parts that we usually discard- straws, cobs, etc. This means those biomass costs almost nothing to get. What is more? Utilizing bio-fuels will not emit extra CO2 that are trapped under ground for millions of years. Therefore, biomass seems to be a promising source of energy, and biofuel is suitable for the mass production to replace gasoline in everyday life.
Countries and companies across the globe have begun to put into practice of biofuel production. Former U.S. president George W. Bush clearly stressed the U.S. will emphasize on biofuel in energy research in the State of the Union, and issue one specific goal to accelerate research and make cellulosic ethanol cost competitive by 2012. In Brazil, Sweden and Austria, biofuels are no longer just a pipe dream but rather a practical energy source. Shell and BP, which are forward-looking, have already invested a large fund in the research of biofuel, hoping to remain in advance in this new technology.
There are two ways of producing bioethanol, from direct fermentation and cellulose hydrolysis. Because direct fermentation requires glucose from food plant like corns and canes, which has been criticized as immoral when so many parts of the world suffered from starvation, researchers are striving to produce ethanol from ethanol.
There are roughly four procedures of cellulosic ethanol production: pretreatment, cellulose hydrolysis, ferment, distillation.In pretreatment, many factories use waste sulfuric acid to liberate the cellulose from the lignin seal and its crystalline structure so as to render it accessible for a subsequent hydrolysis step. Although using waste acid lowers the cost, it leads to the emission of furans, acetate and phenols (FAP) in the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. People do not want FAP at all. And so does the yeast. Those chemicals hinder the growth of yeast of the subsequent fermentation procedure by causing allergic symptoms in yeast and greatly reduce the ethanol output.This negative reaction has become a major issue concerning ethanol production, so various corporations invest in different approaches to recover the production level. For example, many bio-fuel producers conduct detoxification before fermentation in order to remove the inhibition. Although this method works,"

Real-time PCR is so called because the amplicon accumulation can be directly monitored during the PCR process, using fluorogenic probes or fluorescent dyes that intercalate with dsDNA.
 
Cells were prepared as described above; harvested, lysed and total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent according to manufacturer instruction (Gibco Life Technologies). All solutions were treated with the RNase inhibitor DEPC (Sigma). DNAse was used to remove genomic DNA from RNA samples and reverse transcribed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). The real-time PCR was performed with the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on the Roche LC 480. We used primers, specific for IFN-β, IFN-α, IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8. Data was analyzed with the LightCycler 480 Software.

CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY
 
 
Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase micrograph contrast and/or to reconstruct three-dimensional  images by using a pinhole to reject out of focus fluorescent light in specimens that are thicker than the focal pane. In is widely used in life sciences, a major application of confocal microscopy involves imaging either fixed or living cells and tissues that have usually been labeled with one or more synthetic fluorescent probes, immunoflourescent reagents or contain fluorescent proteins.

Survey with ETH Zürich team
Despite being a small country, Switzerland has no less than four national languages. It also benefits from a large pool of cultures from all around the world. While probing the opinion of the public about synthetic biology and our project, it would have been a shame not to take advantage from this diversity. Luckily, the ETH Zürich team had the same interest in the public opinion as ours for their project. As we were about to hold a stand in Lausanne’s (French speaking part of Switzerland) street, our teams therefore developed together a survey integrating general questions as well as more specific questions relative to our projects. The survey was big success, so we decided to go one step further and organized another similar event in Basel (Swiss-German speaking part of Switzerland) with the ETH Zürich team. Doing so allowed us to gather the opinion of even more people and helped us investigating the difference between the populations of those two cities. Find more information about our results on the ETHZ wiki or on our Human Practices page.
Survey in Basel
Getting ready for the Giant Jamboree:  After the survey in Basel, the EHTZ team invited us to visit their lab. We performed a simulation of our presentations for Boston in order to get used to talking about our projects to other synthetic biologists, and of course to get rid of this stage fright!

Mathematical description of droplet coalescence

Introducton
CAT-Seq system design incorporates a droplet merging step as a way to enrich the droplets containing the Product Nucleotides by combining them with droplets that contain DNA amplification mix and Reference Nucleotides in high-throughput.
Yet, as we began to grasp the droplet merging techniques, effective merging appeared to be an extremely difficult task. The merging was not efficient – only 1 to 5 droplets merged for every 20 of droplets that contained the Product Nucleotides. Each droplet that has not merged is a huge loss of information. As our goal is to create a biomolecule activity recording system that is not only fast, but also accurate, increasing the effectiveness of the droplet merging step was of the highest priority.
Videos displaying faulty and inefficient droplet merging due to poorly chosen parameters
The merging difficulty stemmed from the fact droplet merging techniques consist of large number of different parameters that depend on each other – droplet volumes, water and oil phase flow speeds, electrical field strength that helps the droplets to merge, microfluidic chip dimensions and other.
For this reason we have decided to develop an in-depth mathematical model to determine the appropriate merging system parameters that would provide effective droplet merging in CAT-Seq.
Here we present the full mathematical description of the active fusion of droplets in a microfluidic chip. The droplets from two populations are fused together one-by-one using specially designed droplet coalescence chip and an electric field. The full scheme of the chip is shown in Figure 1:
The electric field is created by plugging the voltage to the metal electrodes (Fig.1 A). One of the droplet population is being produced on a chip (Fig.1 B) and at the same"

Delete this box in order to be evaluated for this medal criterion and/or award. See more information at Instructions for Pages for awards .
Entrepreneurship
Best Supporting Entrepreneurship Special Prize
In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus on commercializing their work. We have now moved to an award as the best work in this area may come from teams who are not solely focused on entrepreneurship.
The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for this prize.
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2016 Sydney Australia
2016 Pasteur Paris
2014 UCC Ireland
2014 Imperial College London
Patents and intellectual property
If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.
This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision."
Aachen,2018,Team:Aachen#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," many studies, and also there are no long-term studies.             What can you tell me about it?
Taina Mattila: There are many studies being done, some positive, some negative.
In most kinds of sleep disorders, the efficacy is inconclusive. It is unclear whether the effects are clinically relevant.             So, for example, a patient falls asleep 10 minutes faster than he does normally,             does it have an effect on the patient's wellbeing or functioning? What is the threshold how much faster you have to fall asleep in order to improve your quality of life?             What I've seen so far is that in jetlag there is the strongest evidence of efficacy.
Katrin: Did you hear that taking Melatonin could be also beneficial for shift workers and have you heard of other benefits?
Taina Mattila: On shiftwork, there is not enough evidence for efficacy based on what I have seen in the literature.
Leon Bongers: There is EFSA, that's the European authority for food products and supplements.             They have decided on the indication of the reduction of sleep onset [the time you are still awake after going to bed].             It seems that it is indeed reduced by melatonin. But so far the MEB has not accepted the sleep onset time reduction as an indication for a             medicinal product and therefore it cannot be registered for this indication.             But there was a lot of discussion in the MEB. So far we have not accepted it as an indication for melatonin as a medicinal product.             But it's the most important reason to use it as a supplement.

Radio Interview
Interview with a local radio station
Bringing synthetic biology, iGEM and our project to the public eye is a big part of human practices.             On August 1st we met with a local radio station, the ""Hochschulradio"", in Aachen and had an interview with them.             We had the opportunity to present our project und talk about the importance of melatonin to a wide audience.             Furthermore we talked about iGEM and what it means to us.

pHCMC04 = This is a 8,089 bp vector. It was chosen for its compatibility with B. subtilis and ability to promote high expression. This vector has proven stability advantages. This vector requires that Gram-positive compatible ribosome binding sites are selected. The internal PxylA promoter will transcribe all sites with the appropriate RBS. The vector coding sequence APE file from 1,203 - 2,692 was identified as a potential target site for the insertion of our DNA assembly.
Total Design Assembly bp: 3,499 bp - Total Vector with Assembly - 11,588bp
Transformation Protocols
A variety of B.subtilis competent preparation and transformation protocols were identified in order to obtain the optimal transformation efficiency. Manipulated strains, such as the spo0A3 mutant, are known to be difficult to transform unless electro-competent preparation and electro-transformation are performed (CITE). A variety of these protocols from literature were identified and are proposed below:
The first protocol was shared by the UC Santa Cruz with our team. The remainder of the protocols were identified by our team and shared with UCSC for their experimentation.
Procedure #1 : Bacillus subtilis - Multiporator / Eppendorf Eporator - Transformation Protocol No. 4308 915.504 - 08/2003 - Electrocompetent cells and Electroporation Transformation is described in this protocol. Protocol references the Journal of Microbiological Methods (1999).
Procedure #2 : Transformation of Bacillus subtilis by Electroporation - Institute of Horticultural Research, Littlehampton, West Sussex, By Michele Stepheson and Paul Jarrett. Describes the use of electroporation performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser and Pulse Controller as described by Dower et al. (1988). Illustrates PPEG as a superior electroporation medium than glycerol in the transformation of B. subtilis and that a particular ratio of transformation medium is required for maximum transformations.

Technion-Israel,2014,Team:Technion-Israel#Project_-_-_TEXT.html," is designed to facilitate cell-to-cell communication, which is based on the diffusion of a small quorum sensing molecule called AHL (N-Acyl Homoserine Lactose). AHL can diffuse through cell walls. For effective cell-to-cell communication, the cells must have two things:
(1) LuxR, a protein which binds to AHL (a ""receiver"").
(2) A genetic gate which can produce large amounts of AHL (an ""antenna"").
This circuit contains two parts:
The first part consists of the promoter Pcat, a constitutive promoter, which regulates LuxR expression in excess at all times. The LuxR protein can bind to AHL produced by neighboring cells, activating the Computational Circuit.
The second part consists of the promoter, PT7 RNA polymerase, which is controlled by the T7 polymerase synthesized by the Toggle Switch, and regulates the expression of LuxI – an enzyme that produces AHL. When the PT7 promoter is activated, it produces large amounts of AHL. This amplifies the signal produced by the toggle switch, before it is diffuses out through the lossy channel.
We believe that using the toggle switch is an improvement compared to the Alpha System, because Goni-Moreno and Amos’s analysis of the use of toggle switches for noise reduction showed positive results (Goni-Moreno & Amos, 2012).
We believe that amplified AHL production (using the T7 polymerase) would reduce the noise in our system because the error term in the Fokker-Planck equation (the equation commonly used for modeling noisy system) for this system, is reduced by a factor inversely proportional to this amplification (link to Ittai’s reference [13]).
RNA Splint
RNA Splint for protein split and assembly - luxI as inspiration and CMR for proof of concept
Our system is made for the detection of substances in very low concentration. It is based on a signal transduction and amplification between the individual bacterium. The major risk in systems like this one is that a false positive result will activate the whole system, rapidly. In order to solve this problem, we came up with few methods. One of those methods is the split of a key component protein, which activates the system: LuxI. It allows the communication of an activation signal to between all of the cells in the sample. We thought it would be feasible to solve it by ensuring the production of LuxI only when a toxin is in the sample. To avoid the leakiness of the promoters we have decided to split the LuxI gene so each part will be regulated under a different"

Week 3: May 26 - 30
We introduced ourselves to the online software ‘Benchling’ and began cataloging our parts. We will be using Benchling to keep track of our parts during the cloning process. We also used Benchling to construct our first reporter/repressor test systems in silico. Performing cloning in silico helped us get an idea of the steps that we will need to take, and to plan out the restriction digestions that we will need, i.e. how to use the BioBrick system to assemble our constructs and exactly which enzymes to use.
We have gently settled on the idea of using a two-part genetic circuit, where the repressor gene regulates the reporter gene in a fashion analagous to ‘gates’ in electrical engineering (Brophy & Voigt, 2014) . We cloned several more parts, specifically the repressor/promoter pairs: C1-lambda, C1-434, and C2-P22. Promoters will be used as operators - though they function as promoters, we will be using the strong, constitutive promoter Pveg instead, then the repressible promoters will instead function as an operator. By using a strong, constitutive promoter we will ensure optimal expression regardless of the operator used. We also repeated efforts to clone RBS, pTetR, and TetR - up to the point of completing miniprep and confirmation by colony PCR.
We requested more B. subtilis parts from iGEM HQ - a terminator, and several RBS sequences and plasmid vectors. All but one of the vectors will be an integration vector which will allow us to integrate our constructs into a specific locus in the B. subtilis genome. The RBS sequences will offer improved translation rates in B. subtilis compared to using RBS sequences originating from E. coli.

Ever since World War II, the West has seen an expansion and intensification of anti-scientific sentiment, which today primarily concern Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). We will for that reason explore GMO’s role in history, to see if a historical perspective will allow us reach a new understanding of these sentiments. You can read all about it here.

A Historical Perspective on GMO
From Food Concerns to Sustainable Energy
When talking about the history of GMO, we have the rare privilege of choice, as  depending on how you define GMO, One could potentially choose any historical period as their starting point. For instance, we could be examining the breeding of wolves to dogs, or simple agriculture, where the bad seeds are destroyed in favour of higher quality crops Rangel G. From Corgis to Corn: A Brief Look at the Long History of GMO Technology. Genetically Modified Organisms and Our Food. August 2015.
For the purpose of narrative, we will be starting our examination with the dawn of the 20th century. A time in which stale and rotten food lead to health concerns. Through several years, the public was continuously made aware of health problems regarding food in the United States. This culminated in the 1906 statute:, which allowed the inspection and ban of products JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. . During the time leading up to this act, the public grew to appreciate items labeled as pure. A trend we can observe in most journalistic material from the time period O’Keefe TJ. The Alliance herald. : (Alliance, Box Butte County, Neb.) 1902-1922. T.J. O'Keefe; 1902.
This need for pure food naturally originated partly from several years of unsatisfactory food and health concerns JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. , and partly from a political fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 1906. .  The readers became aware of unsanitary practices in the American food industry. Sinclair was considered a whistleblower, having exposed the practices of the food industry. After the act of 1906, we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time"

“We’re doing the project on si-RNA; however, in CORE Design there are no parts on si-RNA. To make CORE more universal, is it necessary to add si-RNA as biological parts so that the database of CORE is more complete?”
(In fact, it is impossible for CORE to contain all the biological parts in the nature, whether they are in Registry or not. However, CORE can add new parts and define the type of your new parts, so it is possible for users of CORE to extend the parts in the database of CORE.)
“Co-development is good! We can help each other on this platform.”
“For CORE Bank, it should consider the situations in which teams’ projects contain no genetic circuits. Say, how can our project be stored on this repository?”
(It is a good suggestion, and we should work harder on these suggestions)
Inspirations
For team that does not take genetic circuit design as their project, what they feel most useful in CORE might be the Co-development module. It is a platform designed for not only collaborative construction of genetic design but also question and answer. If they have any problem in their project, they can feel free to ask questions and get answers.
Although most of the teams’ projects are devoted to genetic circuit design, we should take more into considerations; for example, not all teams devote their project to circuit design. CORE Bank is aimed specifically at hosting the genetic design of teams; Maybe, there should be a repository for other kinds of project?

ETH_Zurich,2014,Team:ETH Zurich#labblog_-_-_TEXT.html," = g([AHL]) = f([AHL]) + aLeakiness. We obtain the expected information that the signal over noise ratio is greater by one order of magnitude for the riboregulated system than for the non-riboregulated system. A drawback from the riboregulated system is that the amplitude of the signal corresponds to the amplitude of the noise in the non-riboregulated system.
The experimental design also allowed us to detect eventual cross-talk with other signaling molecules, the one corresponding to the las system and the one corresponding to the rhl system. No cross-talk was observed with the signaling molecule of the rhl system. However, the las system signaling molecule activated the Lux promoter. We chose to model this cross-talk, which corresponds to the induction of a promoter, by an Hill function. This fitting allowed us to verify that the Hill function was adapted to describe a cross-talk phenomena. The derived parameters indicated that the concentration in the las signaling molecule had to be high in order to have an effect on our system (It was two orders of magnitude away from the needed concentration of AHL to activate the system). Nevertheless, once activated, the effects of these crosstalk are not to be neglected. Check the following article for more information on the experimental setting.
These results are promising and we look forward to fit the dynamic data of this system.

6-4 Consideration of Safety
After playing cards with the students, we were able to have a talk with the school principal and vice principal. They appreciated us for creating cards and teaching the students about synthetic biology in a simple and approachable way.
It was their first time to learn about synthetic biology in detail, so the principals were impressed of the possibility of this field. However, they had doubts about the safety using genetically engineered creatures. Since those creatures do not exist in nature, we do not know what will happen when they are released into the wild. If something happens, it might take a long time to get the previous nature back. Many people have this fear of genetic engineering, and this leads to the bad image of synthetic biology. Based on these doubts, we explained to them the scientists’ measurements for safety. When we make a discovery, for example “iPS cells”, we consider if it is okay to use them for human or nature on a long-term basis. Just like inventing a new medicine, we have to test them on animals for more than ten years, and when the safety is secured, we decide to use them on human.
By discussing with the principals, we were able to know the public mind toward synthetic biology. We feel this image is due to the ignorance of this field. If we can get more people informed of the reality of synthetic biology, maybe we can change the general opinion. We will continue interacting with a variety of people so that more and more people can learn about synthetic biology.

However, we had to make sure that our cells were not lysing in the process and releasing their contents into their surroundings; thus we once again performed a western blot, this time using a different anti-body used to check the presence of RNA polymerase which is only found inside of the cell. From the results we can see that each different cell was very rich in RNA polymerase, however we could not detect it in the supernatant (Fig. 3).
Motility Assays

We created two spiRNA agents specific for fliC in E. coli using BBa_K1963004 and transformed these plasmids in to MG1655 E. coli cells. We ran motility assays on these strains to see if our spiRNA was binding to the fliC mRNA, preventing translation and inhibiting the ability to swim. We used non taregtting spiRNA on a plate as a positive control and compared it to spiRNA with a 24 bp sequence of CDS which is part of fliC and on spiRNA-RBS-CDS which also covered the ribosome binding site.
For our non-targeting spiRNA plate, we saw a larger colony size than the two other plates which showed a very small amount of growth. This indicates that our spiRNA containing a micC Hfq binding site from E. coli is successfully binding to the CDS and stopping the bacteria from swimming (Fig. 4A). We then worked out the average colony area. We got a larger average colony size for our empty vector than our two plates with our spiRNA. This again infers that our spiRNA is indeed working in the way that we expected. The spiRNA seems to work better for the CDS than the RBS-CDS as we got a smaller average colony size and a smaller standard deviation, however, we would need to run some further experiments to see if this is truly the case.
Looking at these results, it can be"

UMaryland,2017,Team:UMaryland_-_-_TEXT.html," we created a test part that combined our sensing part with a GFP reporter and another test part of constitutively expressed TLP with a histidine tag for easy isolation and detection.
Sensing Results
µ
To test how our sensing system responded to the presence of fusaric acid, we created a construct with our constitutively expressed fusaric acid activated repressor (phlF), respective promoter (PphlF), and a GFP reporter (BBa_K2477008). We grew our construct in different molarities of fusaric acid (0µM, 100µM, and 500 µM) along with a negative control without a GFP reporter and a positive control with a constitutive GFP reporter. We found that sensing-reporting bacteria did not grow in any concentrations of fusaric acid, while our controls did. Therefore, we were unable to characterize our proposed sensing mechanism. Had our test worked, we expected to see decreased fluorescence with the presence of fusaric acid, with a more dramatic lowering than our positive control. We tried this test again using salicylate, another compound found to stabilize the phlF repressor, in hopes to get results of sensing. Fortunately, this compound was not toxic to the cells, but our results showed no significant decrease in fluorescence upon addition of salicylate.
TLP Expression
We planned several tests to determine the expression and activity of TLP. Our first set of tests were assays for basic TLP expression. Had these tests been successful, we planned to move on to test the ability to TLP to act as an antifungal, and ultimately the ability of our E. coli to kill F. oxysporum.
SDS-PAGE of TLP
To test expression of TLP in a bacterial cell, we created a part to constitutively expressed TLP with a 10x histidine tag (BBa_K2477006). Cells were grown overnight to full OD then sonicated. The cell lysate was purified with a Zymo Reserach His-Spin Protein Miniprep Kit.
SDS PAGE of purified protein - An SDS PAGE of the product from his-tag purification was performed. The left lane is the ladder and the right lane is eluate from the column purification, determined by nanodrop to have 12.5 ug of protein. We expected to see a band around 18 kDa but saw no significant banding at any location.
Several other SDS PAGE gels were ran (not shown) with different conditions. To account for the possibility that the TLP is insoluble"

Originally we intended on using BBa_K639003 to detect whether our cells were stressed when placed in various toxic byproducts. However, as the data below shows, this biobrick is very leaky. As such, we are using the stress sensor as a marker for cell growth and also to show that the cells had been successfully transformed with the correct chloramphenicol resistance.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#Human Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," saving bees our duty? Is our project good? Is it worth taking risks involved? Bioethical dilemmas that will be addressed below.
From the meeting we had with Dr. Roca, we discussed the importance of not only considering human rights but also environmental rights. The next question arose: Should humanity intervene and conserve biodiversity by any means?
The participation in MEXMUN helped us to realize the importance of being responsible for the risks involved in the creation of any biotechnological tool; from there these questions arose: Should we develop the treatment even though it could result in the development of pathogen resistance? Or, in the worst case, damage the innate immune system leaving bees unable to defend themselves?
Based on comments from Ph.D. David de Jong, Dr. Ernesto Guzmán Novoa, M.S. Alejandro Romo Chacón and M.S. Adrián Ponce de León. We realized that there are no regulations to experiment with bees in Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. This led us to question whether the use of bee larvae is justified in order to obtain relevant data for the project to advance. Can even be considered morally relevant?
Bioethics

Legal
From the interviews we had with Mr. Guillermo Rodríguez and Mr. Manuel Ramírez Salcido we realized the importance of considering both national and international governmental agencies involved in the assurance of honey innocuousness. Nevertheless, the legal validation of the development of our project took a big step after the meeting we had with MVZ Ernesto Tanús Sánchez, MVZ Adolfo Arroyo, and Mr. José Luis González Miranda. In this meeting, different legislation that would be ideal to consider was mentioned; concerning innocuity, exportation, Federal Animal Health Law, Zoosanitary regulations as well as Regulations of the European Union regarding food safety.
In addition, our participation in activities of international nature, being, in this case, MEXMUN and the Environmental Risk Assessment Guide for Genetically Modified Organisms, led us to evaluate aspects of biosecurity and risk analysis. We considered it appropriate and necessary to build a legal plan in accordance with the regulations and norms pertinent to our project, covering the local and international scope for ensuring that our project is attached to safety and legality. We also have a meeting with Ph. D. Laura Esther Tovar Castillo, Director of Information and Forestering Research of the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Genetically Modified Organisms (CIBIOGEM) who give us an enriching feedback which boosts us to improve and add other normatives.

Education & Public Engagement
- A Trip to the Future and Beyond!
If you want change, look to the future! Such was the wording of our core philosophy. A philosophy that was carried out, by reaching out to the people of our society to ensure the engagement of the next generation, within the world of synthetic biology.
Ever since World War II, the West has seen an expansion and intensification of anti-scientific sentiment, which today primarily concern Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). We will for that reason explore GMO’s role in history, to see if a historical perspective will allow us reach a new understanding of these sentiments. You can read all about it here.

A Historical Perspective on GMO
From Food Concerns to Sustainable Energy
When talking about the history of GMO, we have the rare privilege of choice, as  depending on how you define GMO, One could potentially choose any historical period as their starting point. For instance, we could be examining the breeding of wolves to dogs, or simple agriculture, where the bad seeds are destroyed in favour of higher quality crops Rangel G. From Corgis to Corn: A Brief Look at the Long History of GMO Technology. Genetically Modified Organisms and Our Food. August 2015.
For the purpose of narrative, we will be starting our examination with the dawn of the 20th century. A time in which stale and rotten food lead to health concerns. Through several years, the public was continuously made aware of health problems regarding food in the United States. This culminated in the 1906 statute:, which allowed the inspection and ban of products JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. . During the time leading up to this act, the public grew to appreciate items labeled as pure. A trend we can observe in most journalistic material from the time period O’Keefe TJ. The Alliance herald. : (Alliance, Box Butte County, Neb.) 1902-1922. T.J. O'Keefe; 1902.
This need for pure food naturally originated partly from several years of unsatisfactory food and health concerns JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013. , and partly from a political fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset & Dunlap,; 1906 190"

Mitochondrial Leader Sequence
Introduction
Mitochondrial Leader Sequence (MLS) helps direct protein to the mitochondria when this peptide sequence is in front of the N-terminus of the protein of interest. MLS will be removed upon the peptide’s translocation into the mitochondria, but four additional amino acid residues (Ile-His-Ser-Leu) will be left at the N-terminus of the protein. The CDS of MLS was cloned out from pCMV/myc/mito (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA) using PCR.   This part is in RFC10 standard but cannot be fused directly to other CDS due to limitations in RFC10. Users who obtained this part can extract the part by PCR and fuse to other domains using Splicing by Overlapping PCR. MLS in RFC25 standard (BBa_K1119001) is also submitted to facilitate fusing with other CDS.
In our characterization, the CDS of MLS was assembled in frame with that of GFP reporter using Freiburg’s RFC25 format(BBa_K648013). The translation unit was driven by CMV promoter (BBa_K1119006) and terminated by hGH polyA signal (BBa_K404108). The MLS-GFP generator (BBa_K1119009) was then transfected into HEK293FT cells. Mitochondria were stained after transfection and co-localization was determined by area of signal that overlapped. To provide a positive control, CDS of EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted downstream and in frame with the CDS of the MLS in the commercial plasmid pCMV/myc/mito, (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contains the"

Dr. Su had advised us several kinds of enzymes which are able to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, and shared the experimental conditions that had been applied on enzymes in his research with us, which became a great help for the construction of our process. During the interview, we also had a tour to Dr. Su’s laboratory which equipped with small scale paper making machines. Later we established our own paper making process according to the learning from Dr. Su.
Study The Yeast Two-Hybrid System From Dr. Chang, Chuang-Rung
After knowing some candidate enzymes for deinking process, we had done molecular docking simulation to figure out which enzymes have best affinity with our substrate cellulose. Through the ranking of affinity, we had chosen three kinds of enzymes _ Glucanase, Xylanase and Lipase to deink paper, and planned to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as our engineered host. For the purpose of preserving most fibers, we came to an idea of ‘’light stimulation’’, using light to control the secretion of enzymes. To know more about the light regulatory system in yeast, we had visited Dr. Chang, Chung-Rung in National Tsing Hua University. Dr. Chang is an expert in Epigenetics and Yeast Genetics, and he not only analyzed the advantage and disadvantage of using yeast as our host, but also shared how yeast two-hybrid system works. Dr. Chang’s precious advice had great effect on the design of our photo-induced system.
Participating in 2017 iGEM Asia Conference
In Aug 2017, we had participated in iGEM Asia Conference and presented our project to teams from Taiwan, China and Japan. Through this opportunity, we received many useful feedbacks and comments, which made us improve the shortcomings and lack in our project. We appreciate for these precious advices. And what’s also precious for us is that we met TAS_Taipei in this conference, and further look for an opportunity to collaborate with each other. Through using the biofilm technique from TAS, we got the chance to improve one flaw_ the loss of fiber caused by floatation in paper remaking process. This collaboration increase the integrity of our project, and make it more acceptable by industry.
Public Education and Impact
We designed a series of activities to educate our potential customers from different ages to be environmental aware. People used to use white and cheap paper, however, producing this type of recycled paper leads to water pollution and great loss of fiber. Therefore, in every activity, we told people the principle of our INKOFF project and"
SCUT-China,2015,Team:SCUT-China#criticalThinking_-_-_TEXT.html," And at the same time, there should be a specialized department with specialized talents in charge of gene technology for professional supervision.
National Health and Family Planning Commission of Republic of China should bring the gene editing technology into the management of the third class medical technology. Think about how to regulate gene editing and therapy research by setting a threshold. For example, setting a specialized government department in investigating, registering, and supervising the total procedure of making research in gene editing and therapy is obligatory.
Actually there are many discussions about gene legislation in China and we can learn a lot from them. For example, for the lawmaker, general principle and reasonable exception rule should be kept in the lawmaking process preventing gene discrimination. Based on the general principle, employer should not require gene information from employee to prevent unfair treatment. And when it comes to the exception concerning the public safety, the employer can obtain gene information from employee but should make sure to keep the gene privacy.
[Reference：The Discussion on the Gene Discrimination from the perspective of the first gene discrimination case in China]
What can we do in advocating for political legal change?
Have a deeper investigation into gene technology legislation and prepare a comprehensive proposal for the Deputy to the People's Congress. In China, People's Congress is the lawmaker in a real sense, and if we want to emphasize the importance of starting the legislation process, we should draw the deputy’s attention with reasonable and sufficient preparation. But it’s really difficult to achieve so because of the deficiency our scholarly attainments and influence.
The other way to promote the lawmaking is to influence the government. In our country China, the government plays a role as the lawmaker to some extent even though government is administrative body. If we can make great achievement in our research about myocardial ischemia disease, we may have dialogue with the government to share our views of point in policy making. And the government may keep a watchful eye on the gene development to promote gene therapy, gene editing and synthetic biology, a subject booming since the beginning of 21th century by government subsidies, government procurement and financial allocation.
To our surprise, during the conversation with Dr. Huang, an expert in legal filed, he suggested us to have more communication with the law professors in our university, South China University of Technology, because law professors in our school are always invited to draft a law with the legislative institution. The more specialized knowledge about gene we exchange with our professors, the more information about biology like the synthetic biology and gene therapy will be shared with them. And they will have a clear understanding about the importance of gene legislation. Perhaps one day our team can serve as technical consultants to"
