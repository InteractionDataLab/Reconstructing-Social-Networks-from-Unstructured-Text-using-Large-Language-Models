Bacteria like to live as sessile communities adhered to surfaces instead of isolated planktonic individuals. These immobilised bacterial communities protect themselves by creating biofilms (what we typically call bacterial slime), jelly-like coatings comprising a mixture of long carbohydrates, proteins, and DNA molecules. In the context of UTIs, such biofilms are responsible for causing inflammation as well as providing a safe haven in which the bacteria can replicate and mature. Biofilms have accumulated within their matrix enzymes that destroy antimicrobials; this helps protect embedded bacteria against our immune system as well as administered antibiotics. Biofilms associated with UTIs can form readily on both the surface of our living cells and that of the inserted catheters, and result in infections that are largely recurrent and chronic, even after antibiotic administration.
Given that antibiotic resistance in UTI-causing bacteria is such a significant problem that it warrants even multiple specific mentions in WHO's recent antimicrobial resistance global report, the administration of prolonged-courses of antibiotics in attempt to treat biofilm-protected UTIs would of course be ill-advised. Clinical resistance towards even last-resort antibiotics like carbapenems and tigecyclines have surfaced, and at present there has yet to be any antibiotics capable of degrading and destroying bacterial biofilms released for clinical use.
Inspired by how UTIs, both their own clinical significance and with respect to the bigger picture of modern antibiotic resistance, and with bacterial biofilms as a tangible, well-characterised target in mind, our team has decided to pursue the creation of a synthetic biological system that can detect the presence of bacterial biofilms and subsequently destroy both the biofilms and the offending bacteria. To achieve that aim, our system would have to be able to perform the following tasks autonomously:
Identify the occurrence of biofilm production and other virulent behaviour by pathogenic bacteria through the detection of signals that they use to communicate
Release biofilm-degrading proteins into the infected environment to break down the biofilm
Release antimicrobial proteins into the infected environment to specifically kill bacteria without the use of antibiotics.
Enzymatic degradation of biofilms, especially the E. coli biofilms which we are interested in is a subject that has been extensively researched on, and various iGEM teams in past years have taken on projects related to biofilm degradation (eg Groningen 2014, Indonesia 2014, Lyon-INSA 2012, UBC 2010).

). So far the only T-domain exchange that resulted in a functional bpsA was achieved using the T-domain of entF - a gene involved in the enterobactin biosynthesis of E. coli. For this approach, random mutagenesis was performed to yield various mutated entF T-domains, some of which were capable to preserve the enzyme function when being introduced into bpsA (
). Other studies revealed that it is possible to exchange the A-domains of NRPS modules in B. subtilis resulting in modified non-ribosomal peptide products (
). Additionally, the selectivity of an NRPS module for specific amino acids could be modified by altering the conserved motif in the active site of the A-domain (
). Furthermore, since the endogenous 4'-Phoshopanthetheinyl-transferase (PPTase) entD from E. coli has been reported to exhibit low efficiency in activating heterologous NRPS pathways, most research in the field of NRPS involves co-expression of another PPTase (
),

Expression of Functional Indigoidine Synthetase indC derived from P. lumninescens in five substrains of E. coli
Endogenous PPTAse of E. coli Is Sufficient for Activation of the P. lumninescens Derived Indigoidine Synthetase IndC
The open reading frame of the native indigoidine synthetase indC was amplified from genomic DNA of P. lumninescens and cloned into a plasmid under the control of an lac-inducible promoter. This indC expression cassette was transformed into different substrains of E. coli, namely DH5alpha, MG1655, BAP1, TOP10 and NEB Turbo. All of these host strains express the endogenous PPTAse entD which is responsible for the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheine residue from coenzyme A to the apo-domain of EntF,  a T-domain in the enterobactin pathway(<bib id=""pmid:9214294""/>). As depicted in Figure 6a, entD does not exhibit strict substrate speceficity in being restricted to activating domains of the enterobactin pathway, but is able to activate the T-domain of indC as determined by the blue phenotype of the transformed cells. Except for NEB Turbo cells, all transformed host strains displayed a decelerated growth and significantly smaller colonies on plate when compared to the"

ETH_Zurich,2016,Team:ETH Zurich#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," of IBD. The diagnosis is mostly based on the location of inflammation observed during a colonoscopy. Also the underlying trigger of the disease is not completely understood but correlation studies proposed factors such as diet, genetic predisposition, breach of the intestinal barrier and unfavorable alteration of the microbiota, called dysbiosis 2 . The diversity of the microbiota is noticeably reduced 3 , 4 in IBD patients and the composition of the gut flora changes from symbiotic to predominantly pathobiotic microbes 5 .
Inflammation partially disrupts the integrity of the layer of epithelial cells lining the intestine. This cell layer separates the gut lumen containing trillions of microbes from the body. The damage to this essential barrier compromises its selectivity and allows for penetration of immunogenic antigens from the lumen across the epithelial layer 6 , 7 which enhances the inflammation reaction.
SENSING OF MARKERS FOR IBD
NITRIC OXIDE
Figure 1: NorR constitutively binds to DNA. Only when NO• is present it activates the transcription of the gene under control of the norVW promoter (adapted from Green et al. )
Beside the penetration of immunogenic antigens across the epithelial layer, there is also abnormal leakage of inflammation markers into the gut lumen. One such molecule is nitric oxide (NO•, t1/2 < 6 seconds 8 ). Since IBD is normally accompanied by severe inflammation, we chose to develop a sensor for NO. The sensing of NO• with E. coli has already been described by Archer et al. 9 in 2012. This work provides us with the relevant genetic elements and helps us to design a sensor for our purpose. Additionally, the authors present their system as a rapid detection strategy for diagnosing IBD related disease flare-ups, which would allow for immediate intervention.
NorR is capable of binding NO• via its mononuclear non-heme iron center. While other sensor proteins are not only specific for NO• but also for other NOx species, NorR specifically binds the NO• radical. Hexameric NorR is constitutively bound upstream of the norVW promoter, but in the absence of NO• its AAA+ domain is blocked. ATP hydrolysis by the AAA+ domain of NorR provides the necessary energy for the open complex formation involving the DNA and the RNA-polymerase holoenzyme. In the absence of NO•, this domain is blocked and transcription initiation is prevented. Upon binding of NO• a conformational change in NorR frees the AAA+ domain"

Project Management
To organize our project as efficiently as possible was our first objective. Defining the schedule of the tasks to accomplish was necessary to elaborate efficiently our project in the shortest time span and at the best cost whilst bearing in mind the constraints imposed by the competition.
This is why we had to:
Plan: to determine the different operations to be done, the corresponding dates, and the material and human needs that have to be appointed.
Execute: by implementing the different operations defined in the planned phase.
Control: by carrying out a comparison between dates and accomplishments on the level of planning and execution.
In order to do this, each manager has warranted and controlled the coordination of the actors and tasks in a concern of efficiency and yield according to the time limits, thanks to the elaboration of Gantt plannings (that you can find below).
Planning of experiments:

Hamburg,2017,Team:Hamburg#Other languages_-_-_TEXT.html," bij de meest gevaarlijke menselijke ziektes. Hoe is het zover kunnen komen? Sinds de ontdekking van penicilline in 1928 door Alexander Fleming, wat leidde tot een drastische daling in infectie gerelateerde sterfgevallen tijdens de 20ste eeuw, hebben wetenschappers een groot aantal antibiotica ontwikkeld die efficiënt bacteriële infecties behandelen. Voor een lange tijd konden we de meeste bacteriële bedreigingen bestrijden wat geleid heeft tot een vals gevoel dat alles onder controle is. Helaas moeten we een post antibiotica tijdperk tegemoet aangezien er steeds meer resistentie optreedt en dat aan een snelheid die we niet kunnen bijhouden met de huidige onderzoeksinspanning rond geschikte antibiotica. Nu zijn we bijna aan het keerpunt gekomen waarbij we genoodzaakt zijn nieuwe strategieën te zoeken om multiresistentie te bestrijden en een tweede tijdperk van dodelijke infecties te voorkomen. In 2016 is een van de eerste infecties met een pan-resistente Klebsiella pneumoniae variant vastgesteld in de VS. Alle 26 erkende antibiotica werden toegediend, maar geen enkele kon een dodelijke afloop voorkomen (de patiënt redden). Dit is een duidelijke indicatie dat er dringend nood is aan alternatieve strategieën om multiresistente soorten te bestrijden. Tijdens onze eerste literatuurstudie werd het duidelijk dat het probleem nog groter was dan we aanvankelijk dachten, wat onze beslissing om dit onderwerp te onderzoeken kracht bijzette. We stellen een mechanisme voor dat zich richt op de bacteriële ijzerwerving, nodig voor proliferatie, door het te substitueren met gallium. Het vervangen van ijzer door gallium belemmert niet enkel de essentiële ijzeropname voor het verlagen van de proliferatiesnelheid, maar blijkt ook cytotoxische effecten te hebben op de infectieuze bacteriën. De voorgestelde strategie doet denken aan het eeuwenoude Trojaanse paard gezien bacteriën niet"

iGEM Westminster wants to establish a way to degrade polystyrene (which is one of the least recycled plastics) by combining chemistry and biology. In our labs we sometimes tend to not think about the amount of waste we produce. As scientists we should try to use plastic responsibly by avoiding wastefulness,  while keeping the workflow at an optimum level. We contributed to their project by filming a video showing plastic use in our labs.

Besides working for IGEM, I've also been researching biology statistics, including bioinformatics and biology networks.
My goal is to be a biostatistician in the future, on which I'm gonna keep putting effort. Now I'm applying for an opportunity to study as a biostatistics PhD. Good luck to me, huh? : )

WLC-Milwaukee,2015,Team:WLC-Milwaukee#Modeling_-_-_TEXT.html," do not affect antibiotic resistance[1]. We assumed any of these would result in phage-resistance.
Any mutation not fitting into the above three categories we assumed would not affect assembly/function or the ability of bacteriophages to recognize the protein. Therefore these show no effect on phage resistance or antibiotic sensitivity.
Example of mutation program input (E. coli tolC sequence)
With these parameters, we constructed a program to simulate random point mutations. C++ was chosen for its universality as well as our familiarity with it. At the base of the program is a codon class; this contains room for 3 characters to be filled with 3 nucleotides from the DNA sequence. When filled or altered, the class analyzes itself to determine which amino acid it represents, its polarity, and its charge. Codons have the ability to mutate themselves (pick one of their three constituent bases and change it to one of the other three nucleotides), as well as the ability to return their contents, polarity, charge, and amino acid. Codons were organized and used in a single-linked list controlled by a polypeptide class. The polypeptide class stored a string of higher-level information about each codon in a parallel single-linked list; the information stored here was used to store what secondary structure the specific amino acid was in. When told to mutate, the Polypeptide class used a random number generator (rand() from stdio.h) seeded with the current time to pick which amino acid will be mutated; the randomly selected amino acid is then told to mutate.
Example of the file used to associate secondary structures with codons
Handling Input/Output as well as analysis of the mutations (for us, this included predicting function destruction and if it affected phage binding) was done in a main class, so the underlying classes could easily be adapted for other projects.  Input of the DNA sequence was done by parsing a plain-text sequence from a file. The amino acid properties is input from a plain text file and parsed as an integer and a string in which the string is the property of the amino acid and the integer designates how many amino acids it applies to. The user inputs how many mutations are desired through the CLI. Information about each mutation is outputted into a csv file (comma separated values) and at the end the program prints the frequency of amino acids changing their charge (or lack of it), changing their polarity, turning into premature stops as well as the percentage of mutations that are predicted to destroy function of the TolC and the percentage of mutations which would interfere with phage binding.

Duke,2017,Team:Duke#HP#Silver#Economics_-_-_TEXT.html," the disease is the loss of productive years and life across all afflicted individuals.
This loss of life and productivity is only the surface of what the disease truly does to these still-developing economies. The economic capacity, that is to say, the ability for an economy to produce is severely impacted by those factors affecting the working population. HIV/AIDS erodes at the human aspect of capacity and can substantially hobble economic growth rates(1). This in turn further deepens the problem of combatting the disease as there is less economic might to do so.
The current system in place across all of sub-Saharan Africa further exacerbates this problem as well. A majority of individuals afflicted with HIV or think that they are HIV positive must contend with drastically shortened lifespans. This is something that is a reality made possible by the stigmatization of HIV in the region. Without treatment, infected individuals face a far shorter lifespan. In Uganda, for instance, HIV is a taboo topic where individuals who think they have the virus are less likely to test themselves (2).
Fundamentally, the issue is that this is a widespread disease that is debilitating and without treatment rapidly reduces lifespan. As a result, the population that would have been able to contribute to the economic growth of the area can no longer do so. This effect is multiplied for each afflicted individual. Across sub-Saharan Africa, with so many of these individuals, the loss of economic growth is staggering.
Uganda
Uganda along has a known HIV positive population of 1.5 million with 28,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2016. Furthermore, recent research has indicated that, although the number of infections per year is now falling, this trend will reverse itself in the coming years. (2) Although people have had increasing access to treatment in recent years, there are still groups that are disproportionately affected by the disease.
Men who have intercourse with other men are among the discriminated in Uganda, and experience a prevalence of HIV estimated at 13% in 2013. (2) Although the proportion of these individuals testing has gone up according to a 2011 survey, the reliability of these results for the whole country is not very high. In 2013 the Uganda Anit-Homosexuality Act was passed by the parliament and although it was annulled due to a technicality the effects still remain.
Sex workers, by the same token, also make up one of the most affected populations in the country. Attitudes towards sex work as well as the economic situation of many women facilitate the rampant spread of the disease with an estimated 35-37% incidence in "

UCAS,2017,Team:UCAS_-_-_TEXT.html,"OR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing bacteria, IPTG seemed to promote expression and activity of XOR. This phenomena still needs further research.
Harnessing nitrogen to produce purines
Though we detected uric acid production using E. coliXOR cultured in LB with sodium molybdate (1mM), it was achieved by adding extra xanthine. In order to produce more uric acid without extra xanthine supply, we wanted our bacteria to harness more nitrogen and store it in purines, the precursors of uric acid. In de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of E. coli, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GMP (Guanosine monophosphate) share a common precursor – IMP (inosine monophosphate), and there are 11 steps to produce IMP from R5P (Figure 11). We over-expressed the two rate-limiting enzymes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase (encoded by prs gene, denoted as Prs in below) and glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF gene, denoted as PurF in below), along with other 4 enzymes involved in 4 ATP-consuming reactions (Figure 11).
Genes of all 6 enzymes but phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (encoded by purL) were successfully cloned and transformed into E. coli. These enzymes and selective combinations of them were co-transformed with XOR into E. coli and uric acid production were measured. Considering the feedback inhibition of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (encoded by purF) imposed by AMP and GMP, we mutated the 326th amino acid from K to Q (designated as K326Q), to inhibit binding of AMP and GMP. PurFK326Q was also co-transformed with XOR to test uric acid production ability.
We first tested their uric acid production activity by providing extra xanthine, and found that there was a significant increase in uric acid compared to control E. coliXOR except for co-expression of PurC and Prs(Figure 12). Particularly, co-expression of PurC and PurD and co-expression of purM and purD demonstrated largest increase among all over expressed enzymes. Then we provided no extra xanthine and measured uric acid production following a similar procedure. Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine bios"

Did we indeed make rubber?
Now that we control the expression of the genes it is time to characterize our central genes (dxs (B. subtilis) and HRT2). We invite you along on a journey through our attempts to obtain proof of concept; to show that Bacteriorganic Rubber is a true possibility.
Characterization of dxs (B. subtilis)
Functionality assay
To optimize the flow through the MEP pathway, the dxs gene was overexpressed, the expectation being increased levels of IPP and DMAPP   (see Specification ).  To examine if overexpression indeed resultats in an increase in substrate, we attempted to assay the levels of DMAPP using a headspace gas chromatography (GC)-technique.
DMAPP was hydrolyzed in acid to the volatile hydrocarbon gas isoprene. The gas was subsequently analyzed with headspace GC. A linear relationship between amount of detected isoprene and DMAPP concentration has previously been established. Source: Fisher AJ, Rosenstiel TN, Shirk MC, Fall R.

Exeter,2016,Team:Exeter#Log_-_-_TEXT.html," will officially be expanding outside of just academics based at the University of Exeter - Dr Jon Marles-Wright and Dr Thomas Howard, both academics at the University of Newcastle, have agreed to be interviewed for our series! We’ve sent out a few more messages, but haven’t had any more responses yet - fingers crossed for over the weekend!
Today was incredibly exciting in terms of our board game too - we received the 16 printed copies of BioMech, and they look incredible! We released a photo of the finalised board game on Twitter earlier, with this being the first time we’ve publically mentioned our board game, and the response has been fantastic so far! It really has been so wonderful how well it has been received!
We have also been in touch with The Sutton Trust in regards to the game, and they seem quite interested in the idea. Hopefully we will be able to sort something out with them in regards to widening participation.
The Killer Red transformations were successful this time, which is great news and means it was only a concentration issue and not a procedure error. The lab team today - Dan, Eloise, Emily, Jack and Pablo - worked on transforming Killer Orange into plasmids using a 3:1 ratio for insert to backbone. They made both ampicillin and chloramphenicol plates again for incubating the transformations. They also prepared more chloramphenicol stocks for future lab sessions.

Today, four of our team members (Alice, Joel, Andy and Jack) went on our second school visit to Colyton Grammar School based in Colyford, East Devon. They conducted a board game session with 26 students - our first board game session since having the final design printed - and gave out surveys so we could gauge the impact of the board game on the students.
We had a new work experience student join us today called Juliet - she’s a year 12 at the moment with a strong interest in Biology, and will be helping us out in and out of labs (but mostly in). Juliet will be joining the team for the next two weeks.
They also left behind three board games so the school could get extended use out of them, and continue to send us surveys on board game reception - we’re hoping to receive the first batch back within the next few days so we can get an idea of how effective the game is.

Enzymatic activity of PETase at different pHs
Yoshida et al (2016) A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate)
As shown in the graph below, there is a big dropoff in growth between pH 8.5 and pH 9.0, therefore the happy medium between E. coli growth and PETase enzyme activity is around pH 8.5. For this experiment, we had E. coli grow in LB medium and adjusted pH using NaOH. For a more detailed description, please refer to the project experiments page.

D. tsuruhatensis Metabolizing Terephthalic Acid (TPA)
Now that we have catalytic PETase and have optimized pH for our engineered E. coli, we want to be able to produce a signal in the presence of our PET degradation byproduct, terephthalic acid (TPA).
In order to produce an electrical signal from TPA in our MFC, we have to first demonstrate that our bacteria can metabolize TPA. As shown in the graph below, D. tsuruhatensis with M9 (medium with no carbon source) didn’t grow as well as D. tsuruhatensis with M9 and TPA. This shows that D. tsuruhatensis was utilizing TPA as its sole carbon source and that the addition of TPA increases the growth of D. tsuruhatensis. We also ran controls with pure M9 media and M9 mixed with TPA. Neither of these two controls contained bacteria, and as expected, neither showed any growth. We also ran growth curve experiments with Bosea and Serratia bacterias, but D. tsuruhatensis proved to be the only strain that could metabolize TPA well.

Delftia tsuruhatensis TPA utilizes TPA as the sole carbon source
Selecting Exogenous Mediator Type and Concentration
Before we could test our MFC with D. tsuruhatensis and TPA, we had to determine which exogenous mediator would be optimal for our MFC. When our D. tsuruhatensis metabolizes TPA, it releases electrons. The exogenous mediator helps shuttle these electrons from the anode to the cathode, producing voltage signal. We had to choose an exogenous mediator that would be efficiently"
Calgary,2014,Team:Calgary#Sandbox#Notebook#Journal#ModellingAndPrototype_-_-_TEXT.html,", we downloaded the ColorPal Color Matching Program. The program has the capability to assist with calibration of the sensor when detecting black and white surfaces. The sensor has its own LED light and it shines red, blue, and green light onto to the surface.  Relative and respective amounts of red, blue, and green reflected back indicate the colour of the surface, although the reflected light is mixed with the LED light. This effect can be eliminated by taking an initial reading without any LEDs turned on, and then subtracting this reading from each of the red, green, and blue components. We also started designing a formal experiment for testing the colour sensor.  We began brainstorming aspects of the sensor/device that it was very important to both quantify and optimize the operation of the sensor itself:
What is an optimal distance between the surface and the light sensor?
How does colour intensity effects measurements? (example: bright red vs faint red)
What is the minimum amount of transformed bacteria colonies needed to produce enough colour to be detected?
How does ambient light and the environment affect the calibration and readings, and will this need to be an important design consideration?
We started writing up a more formal procedure for the experiment to begin to determine answers to these questions, after we are able to get the sensor functionally working. Next week we are hoping to perform a test using an accurate plate reader to take an fluorescence reading of RFP 30 minutes overnight with different concentrations of cells.  After this data is obtained, we are planning on creating a graph and fitting a mathematical model to describe the results.  This data will allow us to determine how to achieve an ideal signal and what we need to aim for when constructing other portions of the device.  Once we get the sensor, we can perform similar measurements with an Arduino and colour sensor to ensure the results that we achieve using our device will match the results collected using a plate reader.  Using the “gold standard” of the plate reader and the experimental sensor results will allow us to jumpstart our quantitative modelling.  Additionally we broke down all of the processes and reactions that are taking place within our biological system in our device and are hoping to model each reaction individually - with the optimistic hope that we will eventually be able to model our entire system. In particular, we determined some of the parameters that we would have to determine with our models through this experiment.
To collect a more vast background knowledge on quantitative modelling of biological systems we read literature recommended by Dr. Nygren.  This week we continued to get more familiar with the Arduino Uno microcontroller. We built simple circuits to make an LED light blink in different patterns"

Law & Regulation
Overview
This summer, we modified the cGMP metabolism in mammalian cells using techniques of synthetic biology. This could potentially be developed into molecular medicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension of the lung.
In our Human Practice part, we investigated the law and regulation in China concerning gene technology, especially the gene modification and synthetic biology.
To a certain extent, it’s undeniable that gene modification is equal to gene therapy, and our project is about gene therapy to myocardial ischemia, imperceptibly we may put ourselves in the center storm of ethical and juristical issues. At the same time we want to have a deeper perspective about the ethical and juristical issues in China, so we choose to have dialogues and communications with expects in law and biology and amateur philosophers who have a greater critical thinking of moral and ethical issues, and thanks for their generous help and assistance, we finally get a complete result in the Human Practice.
A. Dialogues
Dialogues with amateur philosophers
There is an online philosophy discussion group with more than 60 people who have great interest and we have some debates whether synthetic biology based on the synthetic gene circuits makes people machine if synthetic biology is applied to human being.
The Ship of Theseus, a theory proposed by Plutarch, is one of the oldest paradoxs that we can search for help in demonstrating the question whether a man can still be defined a human being if his gene has been modified and in what degree modification can a man be ruled out of definition of human. The ship with vicarious components is definitely different from the initial one, but it’s no doubt that it was not a brand-new ship either. Well, that is a diploma that the gene modification can bypass.
Actually, the definition what human being is has perplexed people for a long time since human being come to exist. The definition of natural person has exhausted us, let alone non-natural human. But sooner or later, based on the development of gene therapy, the technique used to modified human being will come true and what should we do to distinguish natural person from non-natural human? By the proportion of gene modified or by the number of genes modified, that is a question.
We are really glad to see Merry"

SynBio Intro
SBOL in Software
Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data exchange standard for descriptions of genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems. SBOL is neutral with respect to programming languages and software encoding. By supporting SBOL for reading and writing synthetic biology designs, different software tools can directly communicate and store the same representation of these designs. This removes an impediment to sharing engineered systems and permits other researchers and commercial enterprises to start with an unambiguous representation of the design.
Both our PC offline software and web support SBOL document of terminators. Users can input terminator xml file, then our software will analyze the sequence and output the results.
Web SBOL Interface
PC software SBOL Interface
We believe our project qualify for the reward “Best SBOL Based Tool” since we fulfill all requirement of this reward
Requirement 1: Adopt SBOL in your software to enable synthetic biology information sharing.
Both our PC offline software and web support SBOL document of terminators. Users can input terminator xml file,  then our software will analyze the sequence and output the results.
Requirement 2: Document your use of SBOL by describing how it was used to perform information exchange.
Our software can take SBOL format biobrick as input. From the SBOL xml file, we extract the nucleotide sequence. The nucleotide sequence is analyzed by our software to predict terminator efficiency. Then, we can write back to the SBOL file and add efficiency information in documentation of this biobrick part.
Requirement 3: Describe any challenges you faced in conforming to the SBOL standard.
During our developing process of our software, we found that one major issue of SBOL format is that it does not clearly identify the type of the biobrick parts. We would suggest further SBOL format to include the “type” of parts, whether it is a terminator, or promoter, or RBS. And the type should be clearly defined.

Toulouse,2014,Team:Toulouse#Result#experimental-results_-_-_TEXT.html," used as negative controls.
No difference was observed between the Petri dishes with or without glucose. With glucose containing LB medium, a large halo around the paper disk was observed. This halo might be due to cells attracted by the solution, as it was not observed when cells were not inoculated in the Petri dish (data not shown). However this result was barely  reproducible. Moreover with the addition of LB medium, it was hard to make the distinction between attractive effects and cell growth resulting from random diffusion. We have therefore given up this protocol and tested alternative protocols.
2. Plug in Pond system
This protocol was adapted from a PhD work (see references [1]). B. subtilis was grown overnight to a density of 8.108 cells/mL. 10 mL of the culture was mixed with 15 mL of LB medium containing 1.5% agar kept at 45°C. The final agar concentration was 0.9%. Tetracycline (25 µg/ml) was added to inhibit growth in order to only observe the chemotaxis phenomenon. Plates were cooled down and dried, before digging wells with either a punch or 1mL tips. The wells were then filled with the attractive compound (Figure 3). After one hour at room temperature, pictures of the plates were taken and the results analyzed.
Figure 3: Plug-in-pond test design.
On our first try with B. subtilis, we made three wells per plate (Figure 4). The wells were filled with glucose at different concentrations and tetracycline was not added in one of the plates.
Figure 4: Plates after 12h at room temperature.
After one hour, no tangible results were obtained. After 12h we observed halos around the 1 M glucose containing wells in the plates without tetracycline but not in the plates with tetracycline. Again, because cells could use glucose for growth, we could not distinguish between growth and chemotaxis. Making the hypothesis that the concentration of tetracycline could have been too high and inhibited any bacterial activity, we thereafter lowered the tetracycline concentration to 15 µg/mL. We repeated this protocol with this new experimental condition. We made two wells per plate (Figure 5), one with either Glucose or n-acetyl-glucosamine and one with LB medium. As previously, no results were achieved after 1h, but after 12h we could notice halos.

Probiotic Production
Probiotics, by definition, are living microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. It has long been suggested to be health beneficial with effects like prevention of AAD (antibiotic associated diarrhoea) [1] , increase HDL in blood [2] , and when prescription of antibiotic has interrupt microbial balance in the gastrointestinal tract, probiotic may be able to restored the balance [1] . Nowadays, people have increased awareness of probiotics’ importance for health, the demand from the market thus rise and various production techniques are employed. In order for the probiotics to maintain their effectiveness all though their shelf-life, they need to be dried into pallets or powder before releasing into the market. Spray, freeze, vacuum and fluid bed drying are four major ways [3] . However, stress would be induced during the drying process and will severely affect the viability and thus the effectiveness of probiotics after rehydration.

Freiburg iGEM Team
This year the iGEM Team Freiburg tackled the problem of targeted drug delivery in the human body.
As both iGEM Team Freiburg and our team are working with Bacillus subtilis to reach our goals, we decided to support each other.
We were able to provide them with our protocol for competent cells and, thankfully, they could assist us with a transformation protocol for B. subtilis.
After trying out multiple protocols we decided to write a guide ""How to Bacillus subtilis"" including the protocols that worked best for us.
This should help future iGEM teams speed up their work with the organism.

Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Leeds,2013,Team:Leeds#Essays_-_-_TEXT.html," synthetic biology creates. As these organisms are classed as ""new"" it sometimes isn't possible to predict what they will do, or what they will effect if they are prematurely released into the environment. Genes for antibiotic resistance are inserted into bacteria in plasmids as a way to select for the colonies you want during transformation and growth of the bacterial strain; these could be passed on to virulent strains furthering problems with antibiotic resistance if the bacteria was not kept in a controlled area and accidentally released. Protocols need to be put in place to ensure safety when working with bacteria in the lab and that rigorous testing occurs before any release of these genetically modified bacteria, as well as approval from regulatory boards [3] </sup>.
The final issue that will be discussed is the religious problems surrounding Synthetic Biology. Some Religious organisations feel that work done in fields such as Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering is “playing God”. Synthetic biology manipulates genetic material of single celled organisms and can be deemed wrong because it is “unnatural” to do such things. An argument against this is that these tools are placed on the earth and we are utislising them to the best of our ability as God would have wanted us to. Synthetic biologists need to address this and give reassurance to show that although we are changing organisms our motives and intentions are to improve society [3] </sup>.
In Synthetic Biology we work towards overcoming these ethical issues, and strive for excellence within our research. There are currently laws that regulate what can and can’t be done in Synthetic Biology, however it has been suggested that an independent regulatory body should be employed to govern Synthetic Biology and make sure there are no, from the perspective of non-scientists, unethical research projects that go ahead. This is something that is currently being worked on in the SynBio community [2,3,4] </sup>.
A way to overcome the ethical issue of bioterrorism and dangerous biological parts is to regulate their distribution. This means that DNA sequences that code for toxin producing enzymes or other similar dangerous biological elements are more highly controlled and only accessible when specific permissions are granted and there is a good reason for needing to undergo research using those parts [4] </sup>.
The economic issues caused by Synthetic Biology are a little more difficult to overcome. As it is a new field most of the products it offers are in early development so for the time being potential job losses will not occur. If some products do become widely available, the hope is that the jobs will be transferred to a different sector of work based around the new device. Although by making the technology open source and free from"
EPF_Lausanne,2014,Team:EPF Lausanne#Envelope stress responsive bacteria_-_-_TEXT.html," used in basic science as a stress sensor and a proof of concept of our novel way of viewing biosensors, we aimed to integrate our engineered bacteria in the BioPad to allow fast and precise signal emission upon touch.
The split protein we chose to fuse to CpxR was the Infrared Fluorescent Protein (IFP 1.4). The IFP1.4 is an engineered chromophore-binding domain of a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans. Its split was an important landmark in the field of protein complementation techniques, as the split IFP1.4 is the first fluorescent split protein to be reversible. Moreover, due to its emission in the infrared wavelengths, the IFP1.4 benefits of high signal-to-noise ratios allowing precise analysis of spatial dynamics. The split IFP was developped in 2014 by the Michnick lab 1 .
Experiment planification
Having chosen a protein complementation candidate - IFP1.4 - and a stimuli responsive dimerizing protein (CpxR), we planned out a set of experiments that would allow us to prove that fast and specific spatiotemporal analysis of stimuli is possible.
We therefore set ourselves three intermediate objectives:
Prove that CpxR dimerizes and find out its dimerization orientation.
Prove that the system can be activated and turned off quickly.
Prove that the system can provide spatial information and that sub-localisation of the protein within bacteria is detectable.
Estimate the time elapsed between a transcription factor activation and its associated reporter protein synthesis
Moreover, to assert that our system could be used to build a BioPad, we also had two extra objectives:
Show that our system can be activated by envelope deformation - particularily by mechanically stress in a microfluidic chip.
Prove that after envelope deformation the system can be shut off.
We planned out various experiments to accomplish these objectives.
Demonstration of CpxR's dimerization & elucidation of its dimerization orientation
To prove that CpxR dimerizes and to find out its dimerization orientation, we synthesized four constructs with combinations of the split IFP1.4 fragments fused to the C or N terminal of CpxR. We amplified CpxR from the E.coli K-12 MG1655 genome. The IFP1.4 fragments - IFP1 and IFP2 - were obtained from vectors sent to us from the Michnick lab. After many PCR's and Gibson assemblies, we finally obtained our four constructs:
The four resulting strains were stressed with KCl"

The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM
On Oct 27th, our team and SMS_Shenzhen gave a lecture to students in Shenzhen Middle School. Since the junior high students have already been exposed to basic biology including fundamental knowledge about DNA, in an-hour-long lecture we told them more about detailed DNA structure, inheritance and plasmid working mechanism. We then introduced them to the central theme of synthetic biology. Most students showed great interest in the lecture and asked tons of questions, not only about what we have covered but also some extended ones. In the end, we delivered our “iGEM survival guide” to them to popularize both synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
After the lecture finished, iGEMers from SMS_Shenzhen gave us and their middle school students a tour of their laboratory. We taught the students how to use micropipettes and they were quite impressed by so many accurate, delicate equipments.
A grand gathering of young iGEMers—the first High school meetup in China
Nowadays, there are a number of successful collegiate iGEM conferences such as  CCIC (Conference of China iGEMer Community) in China while there are no formal, well-organized opportunities of communication for high school iGEMers, who, in fact, could benefit more from exchange of novel ideas and experience at the beginning of their scientific research journey. So, at an attempt to strengthen the bonds between iGEM juniors and improve our learning experience, we united with SFLS_Shenzhen to hold the first iGEM China Regional High School Meeting on Aug.19th and Aug.20th.
Considering we are relatively inexperienced in preparation for iGEM and our knowledge could be limited in solving academic challenges, we have invited an expert—Dr.ZHANG Haoqian, the iGEM Asia Representative, and friendly collegiate teams—SUSTech_Shenzhen, SZU_China and SCAU_China, whose precious advice and inspiring instructions would be very beneficial to every high school team participating.
On Aug 19th, the meetup started off by a introductory speech by Dr.ZHANG Haoqian, who gave an insight into the key factors of excellent performance and important"

RESULTS–CONSTRUCTS-BIOSYNTHESIS
In order to engineer the insect sexual pheromone pathway in our Sexy plant, we had to isolate four genes from different organisms: a desaturase (AtrΔ11), a reductase (HarFAR), an acetyltransferase (EaDAcT) and finally an alcohol oxidase (FAO). As they were coming from very different and not easily accessible organisms (two moths and a plant from Asia), the coding sequences (CDS) of the first three enzymes were obtained by gene synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT) after codon usage optimization for N. benthamiana. As for the fourth one (FAO) we tried to amplify it from the genomic DNA of the yeast Candida tropicalis, with no successful results. Nevertheless, the three synthetic genes were sufficient to produce at least two of our target pheromones, the alcohol (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and the acetate (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate.
Figure 1. Engineered pheromone production pathway.
All three DNA sequences were domesticated; that is, standardized as GoldenBraid parts and cloned in the pUPD plasmid. Subsequently, each CDS was assembled with the strong constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (P35S) and its terminator (T35S) respectively, in a multipartite assembly reaction. P35S is a strong plant constitutive promoter with high expression levels.  As result of these assemblies, we obtained three Transcriptional units (TU) ready for plant transformation.

Today I diluted some more of the BBK-CP primers.  I also miniprepped some plasmids for Chris.  I also looked into some papers on the heat shock repsonse in E. Coli, the ibpAB promoter, maltose and IPTG induction and the Raivio testing strains.  I also gave some thought to the order of our oral presentation for aGEM.

Today, I spent the day contacting different companies to attempt to raise funds for our project. We have been mildly successful so far and most of our sponsors are listed on our main page. We also began working on the powerpoint which will be presented to Thane Kubik on the 25th of August as a practice run for the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine competition.

The Kill Switch
The aim of our 2011 iGEM project is to create an E. coli kill switch using intracellular antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production ( K628006 ).
Structure
The pBAD promoter is found in nature governing the E. coli arabinose operon, responsible for the breakdown of the sugar arabinose into D-xylulose-5-phosphate.  This promoter is induced by the binding of L-arabinose to the AraC promoter region (further details on promoter structure and regulation can be found on our Modelling page ).  As a faster rate of protegrin-1 production would benefit our project by allowing for a wider range of potential applications, we chose to use the pBAD strong promoter ( K206000 ), which is a mutagenized form of pBAD that induces transcription at a lower arabinose concentration and has a higher maximum expression.  pBAD strong is only induced in the presence of arabinose, which is not naturally produced by the cell, making it a very stable promoter to work with and greatly reducing the chance of accidental gene activation.
The coding region of our kill switch ( K628000 ) is responsible for synthesizing its functional aspect, the antimicrobial peptide protegrin-1.
Our ribosome binding site (RBS) is classified as a  “strong” binding site ( J61101 ), meaning that the ribosome will very readily bind to the mRNA sequence, allowing for translation to occur quickly after transcription has finished.  We chose this RBS in order to help promote the rapid production of protegrin-1.  Our terminator is a double terminator ( B0015 ), standard in iGEM to decrease the chance of over-transcription by DNA polymerase.
How does it work?
Protegrin-1 is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) first derived from porcine leukocytes.  These peptides are part of the innate immune system and function by attacking the membranes and intracellular processes of invading bacteria.  Protegrin-1 functions to protect the body against non-host cells by integrating itself into the phospholipid bilayer of prokaryotic bacteria, destabil"

SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis
An SDS-PAGE electrophoresis is used to separate proteins based on their size by using an electric current. This protocol describes how to prepare SDS-PAGE gels, how to prepare samples and how to run the electrophoresis.
Preparing of SDS-PAGE Gel
NOTE: An SDS-PAGE gel consist of a stacking gel and a separation gel. In this protocol we use a 6% Stack gel and a 12% separation gel (this is for protein samples between 15 kDa and 250 kDa).
Prepare the following solutions for 2 gels:

Wet Lab Collaboration with the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt 2016
The iGEM team of TU Darmstadt developed a biosafety system that makes bacteria strains survive only at laboratory conditions. The idea is that they require a specific unnatural amino acid in the medium. In case the cells leave this environment, the bacterial genome is degraded by the DNase Colicin E2, leading to cell death and destruction of the genetic information. This system might impede accidental or deliberate release of GMOs and therefore tackles the problems of corporate espionage and ecological consequences of GMOs.
The DNase Colicin E2 consists of 3 domains: a cell export domain, a cell import domain and a DNase domain. The team of TU Darmstadt developed a minimalized version of this protein, containing only the DNase domain. This protein (mColWT), as well as a mutated version (mColmut; C266A), was put behind a T7 Promoter on the plasmid pSB1A3. After transformation of both constructs into E. coli TOP10 and BL21, Team Darmstadt observed a significantly lower colony count for mColWT than for mColmut on LB Agar supplemented with Ampicillin. In order to check if this apparent toxic effect of mColWT is also oberservable in other strains, we tested mColWT and mColmut via transformation in Shimwellia blattae (a strain we are using in our project) at our lab in Göttingen. Empty pSB1A3 was also transformed into S. blattae, in order to check if the plasmid is compatible with the strain.
All transformations were successful, but no significant difference in the colony count between mColWT (960 and 776 colonies; upper plates in figure 1) and mColmut (628 and 984 colonies; lower plates in figure 1) could be observed (Fig. 1).

Day 2 of the Tour of the Oil Sands
Today was the second day of our trip to the Fort McMurrary courtesy of Andrew Hessel and OSLI (Oil Sands Leadership Initiative). OSLI is an organization of 5 Oil giants who have taken the initiative to promote Youth Leadership and Biotechnology in Alberta. Today we toured the Oil Sands of ConocoPhillips Inc., which is a joint venture of Total and Surmont Inc. We learned about the SAGD method of extracting bitumen out the oil sands, discussed the potential biotechnology projects in the field of synthetic biology and took a tour of their operation sites.
We also visited the Oil Sands Discovery centre, which is a museum that describes the history and establishment of the Oil Sands in Alberta. There were self-toured exhibits tour in the museum and a 45 minute long documentary based on the history of the Oil Sands.
On the whole, the entire tour was an excellent learning experience and a huge success. The tour gave me a vision of the future potential synthetic biology projects that I can do as part of the iGEM Team Calgary. It also gave me an opportunity to understand the workings and the importance of the Oil Sands in Alberta.

Abbreviation fun times: CP, SAGD, iGEM and YMM
The iGEM Alberta teams had a chance to go on our a tour of the Conoco Phillips (CP) site up in Fort McMurray today.  A large difference in SunCor's operations compared to CP's was CP appeared to have a smaller footprint, simply due to no surface mining.  However underneath the surface, literally, the end goal was to get the bitumen out of the oil sands for processing.  One interesting perception I learned today was that CP considers themselves not really an oil producing plant, but really a water recycling plant; the oil is just a big fat plus!  Besides taking a tour of the central command center (very cool and conducive for epic LAN parties), the team was taken on a perimeter tour of the site.
I found today's tour very impactful and useful for iGEM teams; the format today was more interactive and it appeared as if CP wanted our input and feedback on where Synthetic Biology and industry can overlap.  For me personally, I found an area of interest would be the seperation and cooling of the bitumen/steam/water"

Le vecteur tissulaire a pour fonction première de délivrer le vecteur cellulaire dans l’organe cible. Si la libération se fait trop tôt, le vecteur cellulaire n’a que peu de chance d’atteindre sa cellule d’intérêt. Seul, le vecteur cellulaire est éliminé par l’organisme, mais au sein du vecteur tissulaire, il est en sécurité.

Ce premier plasmide code pour le répresseur LacI sous le contrôle du promoteur répressé (pTET) . L’activité de pTET , et donc l’expression de LacI , dépend entièrement de la fixation de doxycycline sur le répresseur TetR .
- un opérateur LacP/O implanté dans le génome du vecteur cellulaire et contrôlant l’expression de ses gènes via le contrôle de l’expression du répresseur phagique.

2.2. The fim switch(Tokyo_Tech)
Fig. 3-3-2-13.  The overview of fim switch(Tokyo_Tech)
We designed a fim switch, which promoter can be exchanged with an arbitrary promoter, the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) (Fig. 3-3-2-13).
We could not confirm the inversion of the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) by FimE(wild-type).  From the experimental results, FimB(wild-type) inverts the fim switch in both [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state as expected.  However, FimE(wild-type) unexpectedly did not invert the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state.  Instead, FimE(wild-type) inverted the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) in both [ON] state to [OFF] state and in [OFF] state to [ON] state. In other words, FimE(wild-type) worked in the same way as FimB(wild-type).
Basically, the design of the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) is similar to the fim switch(wild-type). The only difference is that we inserted restriction cut enzyme sites to fim switch(Tokyo_Tech). In detail, in fim switch(Tokyo_Tech), the sigma 70 promoter is exchanged to the J23119 promoter( BBa_J23119 ) and there are two restriction enzyme cut sites inserted each in the front (SalI and BamHI) and in the back (BglII and MluI) of the promoter. Due to the insertion of the restriction enzyme cut sites, fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) has a promoter which can we exchanged with an arbitrary promoter. We actually changed J23119 promoter in the fim switch(Tokyo_Tech) to Lac promoter( BBa_K1632006 ) as shown in the Fig. 3-3-2-14.

In deterministic model, the steady state of a single cell in design 1 depends on the time when the site-specific recombination happened (Fig. 6). And the stochastic simulation predicts similar behaviors, however it is not always consistent with the deterministic simulation, especially for those cases that oscillations stop at a phase near the separatrix of toggle switch (Fig. 7).

The toggle switch with initial state above the separatrix will settle to one stable steady state, whereas a toggle starting below the separatrix will settle to another stable steady state. The left figure shows the situation with $\beta_1=(30,15,20)$. The right figure reveals the situation with $\beta_1=(60,30,40)$.
Figure 6. Deterministic simulation of design 1. The state versus time is simulated by scanning the moment of rewiring from 100 min to 900 min. The interval of the transient state we set is 20 min
Figure 7. Stochastic simulation of design 1. The parameters we used are the same as the deterministic model. The simulation is achieved by standard stochastic simulation algorithm (Direct method).
4.3 Design 2
In design 2, we also paid attention to some characteristics of parts. The pluxR promoter gives weak basal expression independent to the present of AHL. Such a leakage contributes to the formation of positive feedback. The weaker the basal expression of LuxI is, the longer the delay of positive feedback is. If the basal expressive of LuxI is too weak, AHL cannot accumulate in the cells leading to a very low steady state (Fig. 8). The delay may result in bistability when we observe the cells in population level.
Figure 8. Delay of the positive feedback loop. We simulated the positive feedback situations under the different basal expression condition. The basal expression of LuxI $beta_0$ controls the delay of positive feedback loop.
The DNA invertion can lead to a drastic change in gene expression. And the negative feedback loop structure forces the system to converge to a lower steady state. We used an explicit Tau-leaping method (Cao et al., 2006"

Collaboration
As an iGEM team we’ve collaborated with other teams on several occasions. We organized the Dutch National Meetup and later in the year we went to the Groningen Meetup. At these meetups a lot of ideas were exchanged and feedback was given on each other’s projects and presentations. On top of that we organised a national symposium for Dutch policy makers in cooperation with the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) . On this day all Dutch iGEM teams worked together to lead discussion and inform people about the possibilities of Synthetic Biology.
Finally, we collaborated with the Delft-Leiden iGEM team to do a mutual characterisation of each other’s BioBricks. We conducted biofilm assays while Delft measured our repressible promotors for the Kill-Switch.
Biofilm assay - TU Delft-Leiden
An assay based on absorption of Congo red was used to quantify biofilm production for three BioBricks from Delft-Leiden iGEM team .
BBa_K1316013 (CC50)
BBa_K1316014 (CC51)
BBa_K1316015 (CC52)
The protocol used can be found here.
Figure 1. Biofilm production after 23.5 hours of growth at 37°C. Lower A480/OD600 corresponds with a higher amount of biofilm produced. All three transformants show increased biofilm production when induced with 0.8% rhamnose, while the wild type stays constant.

The graph shown in each matrix on the very top left describes the situation where the correct autoinducer molecule has bound the corresponding regulator and this complex has then induced the correct promoter.  The solid lines in the graphs show the model data , whereas the data points indicated with standard deviation show experimental data in triplicates (mean values of triplicate micro titerplate measurements).
Table 1 Crosstalk matrix for the promoter pLux ( BBa_R0062 )
In all the measurements conducted to create this matrix the promoter pLux was the basis and was induced in six different variations shown.  The dark blue points in the graph top left show the activation of gene expression when pLux is induced by 3OC6-HSL (Lux-AHL) binding to the corresponding LuxR regulator . The observed transition occurs at a concentration of approximately 1 nM of 3OC6-HSL. The light-blue curve plotted shows modeling data of pLux induced by 3OC6-HSL (Lux-AHL) binding to the corresponding LuxR regulator . This curve from the model and the dark blue data points obtained from experiments were plotted as a reference in all the other graphs describing pLux . Crosstalk can be observed for the cases where the 3OC12-HSL (Las-AHL) binds the LuxR regulator .  Additionally for 3OC12-HSL binding to its corresponding regulator LasR and then binding to the pLux as seen in the middle of the top row and center of the matrix.  For the case of Las-AHL binding the regulator LasR and subsequently the promoter pLux , the transition occurs at 1 nM and reaches 0.5 fold the fluorescence as pLux induced by 3OC6-HSL binding LuxR . In the case of 3OC12-HSL binding LuxR and inducing the promoter pLux , the transition is observed at approximately 100 nM and severe crosstalk is observed, meaning that the ON-OFF-ratio is not significantly different from the reference curve.
Observation of C4-HSL has shown, that there is no significant crosstalk with the LuxR regulator and LasR regulator binding C4-HSL and subsequently to pLux . This is indicated on top right and middle right graphs. However, RhlR induced with its corresponding inducer (C4-HSL) binds to pLux and activates expression of GFP at about 100 nM.

However, the cost ,the difficulty and time-consuming of separation of algal cells from liquid culture medium prevented its commercial applications and practicability on mass production. Therefore we have to find other ways to achieve better effect.
Improvement
This year we have two improvements and they are both related to the light-mediated expression system in our project.
First, about our light-mediated expression system, the HUST-China team had a similar system in their 2015 project. The difference in our two systems lies in the two fusion proteins in the system. We combine AD with CRY2 as a fusion protein, combine BD with CIB1 as another fusion protein. And the two fusion proteins from HUST-China team 2015 project are AD-CIB1 and BD-CRY2.We regard this difference as an improvement because there are lots of AD’s restriction site in CIB1.So,if we want to get a complete AD-CIB1 after enzyme digestion, we have to do a lot of point mutation for CIB1.In theory, however, AD combined with CIB1 or CRY2 has no effect on the experimental results. Therefore, we believe that the combination of AD and CRY2 in constructing plasmids is a better choice for both project and biobrick experiments.
Our second improvement is about AD protein. The kind of AD protein which in the original light-mediated expression system is Gal AD. The light-mediated expression system have already been built inside animal, bacteria, yeast, but not in green algae yet. So the biggest problem is Gal AD hasn’t been used in plants. We used VP16 AD, a similar part from virus which had been used in rice[4],to replace Gal AD, in this way, our light-mediated expression system can be more suitable for green algae. We also made codon optimization for the VP16 AD, according to the codon bias of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Synthetized by Biological company. So building an efficient, easy-controlled extraneous light-mediated system for green algae is pretty essential and also a great breakthrough.

With delightful music, all team members came to the stage to answer questions from judges and rivals. With a short meditation, Captain Tong answered the question briefly and accurately. Suddenly applauds echoed around the auditoria and smiles blossomed on everybody’s face. We saw tears in each other’s eyes and we all knew that even we were not the best; at least we tried our best.
  
   
  
  Later, we went to interesting auditoria and enjoy the presentation of other teams. We found that by auditing, our horizontals were broadened. During the poster time, we promoted BioSearch to numerous teams and got to know the need of wet team face to face. Besides competition, we also had delicious tea and dinner. Mascot Run in the evening was a great fun.
  
  
  Oct.7th, the third day was the most exciting moment for all teams. When championship was announced to award the most prominent team of Asia, everybody held his breath waiting for such joyful news. As a result, team from SJU lived up to their name and got the Finnalist. While we only achieved the silver medal, we found our project worth doing and got progress here in the Jamboree. This was not a competition, but a communication platform for college students pursuing dreams in science.

For me, a really important experience was to face the difficulties of lab work in a large team of members with profoundly varying skills and to learn how to cope with these discrepancies. My primary role in the team was the management of cell cultural issues, which is what made me the “cell culture lady” of the team.  I´m very grateful for the opportunity to learn new methods as well as to get to know new approaches to solving scientific problems and for such a great time with freiGEM2012.

During completion of my bachelor of science degree in molecular biology, I joined the IGEM Team of Freiburg.  My research interests are molecular biology, bioinformatics and plant biotechnology. My role in freiGEM 2012 was to instruct an interdisciplinary team of students in molecular cloning and experimental design. Finally, I am proud that we got the toolkit and the TAL-Vectors up and running.  It was a valuable experience working with such a team.
Lukas Boeckelmann
I am a student of Medicine in my fourth year and have always been fascinated by the opportunities that modern Molecular Biology has to offer. I have just started my MD thesis and many of the experiences I've already made with iGEM  help me greatly. I have benefited tremendously from the iGEM project: It has been very rewarding to research a topic in such depth, to discuss it with the wonderful and bright (and funny) people I have met in our team and to then develop methodical solutions that actually function well!  I am incredibly excited about the work we have done so far and about the work we will continue to do!

All parts of our bioabsorbent are driven by T7 promoter, followed by an RBS in the upstream of the part. T7 polymerase is constitutively expressed with the constitutive promoter Ptet.It is notable that RBS B0030, a weaker ribosome binding site was used as to avoid the over expression of DsbA-MBP because it might saturate the co-translational transporter and inhibit the translocation of other proteins. To avoid leakage and interference between different parts, a strong terminator of BBa_B0015 is added to the downstream of each part.

If there is a high level of red and no green, this means that there is a lot of AHLLux which will bind to the LuxR and allow the transcription of lacIm and cI. cI will then inhibit lacI, but LacIm will inhibit on the one hand the GFP (leading to no GFP production) and on the other hand tetR. Thus, as no TetR is produced, RFP will be produced.
3) GGR
When both AHLRhl and AHLLux are present, we need to consider the influence of each molecule. The input of a green state means that AHLRhl will also be present, which will bind to the RhlR allowing the transcription of lacIm. This one will inhibit GFP and also the tetR, leading to the production of RFP.  The low input of the red state means that there is also a low level of AHLLux. This AHLLux will bind to LuxR to produce cI and inhibit lacI. But, LacIm initiated by the rhlR promoter will remain in the cell and repress GFP and tetR, therefore leading to the production of RFP and LuxI.
4) GRR
When both AHLRhl and AHLLux are present, we need to consider once more the influence of each molecule. Here the green input is weak and AHLRhl concentration is low. Therefore, the AHLRhl concentration  will not be enough to express LacIm. The medium input of red means that AHLLux is present in a concentration which is within the range of the band-pass. In that case, AHLLux will bind to LuxR to produce cI but will not activate lacIm. The cI will inhibit lacI, leading to the production of GFP and TetR. The latter will finally repress the RFP leading to a final green state with production of RhlI.
Experiments
In order to complete our project, we followed mainly three courses of action. The first focuses on the network design and the mathematical modeling; it aims to draw the principles of information processing by individual cells and the cell population, with ODEs used to model the reaction of the system. Details on this part are available in the corresponding page of the Wiki : Modeling . This part was done with the help of professor Felix Naef.

Promoter (iGEM part BBa_J23100)
It is a commonly used constitutive promoter of iGEM part registry.
RBS (iGEM part BBa_B0030)
It is a commonly used ribosome binding site of iGEM part registry.
The banana odor generator consists of 3 parts.
Part 1 (iGEM part BBa_J45008 [1,2,5])
BBa_J45008 is first used by 2006 MIT iGEM team, and originated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, BAT2 gene. The function of this part is to produce enzyme to get involved in the first step in the aging reaction of L-leucine to isoamyl alcohol. We got this part from the 2007 iGEM kit.
Part 2 (iGEM part BBa_J45009 [1,3,6])
BBa_J45009 is first used by 2006 MIT iGEM team, and originated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, THI3 gene. The function of this part is to produce enzyme to get involved in the second step in the aging reaction from L-leucine to isoamyl alcohol. Because this part is not released, we cultured Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c and extract the DNA of it.
Part 3 (iGEM part BBa_J45014 [1,4,7])
BBa_J45014 is first used by 2006 MIT iGEM team, and originated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, ATF1 gene. The function of this part is to produce enzyme to get involved in the esterification reaction from isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, which brings out the banana flavor. We got this part from the 2014 iGEM kit.

Spreading the Idea at the German-wide Meetup in Dresden
This year, our team from TU Dresden organized a two-day conference for all German teams. We were very happy that students of nine teams were visiting us in Dresden to share their project ideas and talk about potential collaborations.  We saw a great opportunity in this event to inform the other teams from Germany about our vision of iGEM goes green.
Therefore, we prepared a workshop giving a general introduction regarding the overall idea behind iGEM goes green.  We presented our GoGreenGuide to the participants and showed them how to calculate the carbon footprint of their lab with the help of examples. To make this workshop more interactive, we asked the other iGEM team members to think of potential ways to save energy and consumables. We were excited that some of them were already actively trying to save energy and consumables in their lab. In a short feedback session at the end of our workshop the other teams could share their thoughts about iGEM goes green. We were happy that several teams joined our initiative.
Emission calculation
During our research concerning greener lab work, we recognized that there is nearly no data on energy and consumables consumption of laboratories. As we liked to measure the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions) the carbon footprint of our experimental work during iGEM, we developed an easy to use excel tool for calculation.
The iGEM Goes Green GHG Emissions Calculator is open access to anybody willing to calculate their labs carbon footprint. We especially offered this tool for other iGEM teams to measure the energy consumption of their devices and to count their waste of consumables for a set period of time (one to two weeks). Afterwards, they just fill in their data into our calculation sheet and the carbon footprint for the whole project is calculated automatically. We hope to gather data from different labs all over the globe. The iGEM Team from Aachen, TU Potsdam and the University of Southern Denmark are currently calculating their labs carbon footprint.
Materials
We created and designed supporting material for all iGEM teams and research groups interested in iGEM goes green. More explanations to these documents can be found on our Resources page.

Fig. 3 Minimized geometry with main measurements and boundaries described, used in all     simulations. The inflow rates of LO and OA phases are divided by 2, because their channels split into two in order     to press the stream of IA phase in junction.
Mesh
For solving the model we used finite element method, which divides geometry into small mesh elements, where         partial differential equations are solved. Interface capturing method incorporated in it keeps the mesh fixed         and the boundary discontinuities are smeared out over the finite width ϵ 3,4. To successfully capture interface         movement between different phases, mesh size should be small enough, but not too small, as every single element         adds more time to computing and quality of the results stops improving substantially at a certain point.
Most of the time we only control the size of mesh elements. For our channel domains a predefined normal sized         mesh was used, as they only contained one phase and interface problems did not occur there. For junction and         post-junction parts, a predefined extra fine mesh was used with maximum element size value set to 1µm, which is         1/10 size of a smallest expected droplet and also 1/10 of our characteristic length, which has been chosen to         be the width of horizontal IA channel (Fig. 4)
Fig. 4 Generated mesh used in all simulations. Refined grid in junction and post-junction helps     with realistic interface capturing.
Materials
Our system consists of three different fluids: OA (Outer Aqueous), IA (Inner Aqueous) and LO (Lipid carrying         organic) phases. It should be noted that experiments have been carried with fluids of many different         compositions, but here we use only one for each. IA and OA phases are quite similar so for simplicity, we set         the same densities for both of them. It has a negligible influence on the results since in most microfluidic         configurations buoyancy-driven speeds are much smaller than the actual flow speeds 3. Parameters and         compositions of materials are shown in Tab. 1.

We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

DI-lambda, the open hardware spectrophotometer
Summary
DI-lambda is an open source spectrophotometer (video 1). In 2014, members of our team began working with high school students through the Open Science School association. Very soon, we were wishing for cheap and easy-to-understand lab equipment. We realized that a basic spectrophotometer, with open documentation, could teach both lab methods and the principles behind them, all at a price low enough for students to use, share and break as often as learning requires.
A spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of light at a certain wavelength. Our device achieves this with open hardware and source code freely available on github. DI-lamba features accuracy equalling top commercial models at a very low price, and is also capable of fluorescence measurements.

DIY spectrophotometers
There have been many attempts to build open source spectrophotometers, but most are not available to the public. Our work includes key features not found in earlier efforts: Extensive documentation about design and building. A troubleshooting guide. Accuracy comparable to existing devices or industry standards.

Since we mainly used this kit for larger fragments, the resuspended pellet was only inverted and flicked to avoid shearing forces. We did not observe changes in color, that is why no pH adjustment were done. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant carefully removed with a pipet. The pellet was washed with 500 μl buffer QX1 to remove residual agarose contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and all supernatant residues removed with a pipet. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl buffer PE to remove salt contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant removed with a pipet. Pellets were air-dried for 10-15 minutes until they became white. To elute the DNA, 20 μl of water were added and pellet resuspended by flicking. After incubation according to the DNA fragment size (5 minutes at room temperature (15–25°C) for ≤4 kb; 5 minutes at 50°C for 4–10 kb; 10 minutes at 50°C for >10 kb), samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds. Supernatant, which contained the purified DNA, was pipetted into a clean tube.
Ligation
For ligation of DNA fragments, the mixture was prepared as follows:
... µl DNA (=<200ng in total-> 20-70ng Backbone)
2 µl buffer
1 µl ligase (T4)
... µl water
=> 20 µl in total
After an incubation for 2 minutes at room temperature, or for 1h or over night at 4°C, the product was loaded on an gel for electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments.
Nucleotide Removal
For removal of excess nucleotides after enzymatic reactions, the QIAquick® Nucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten volumes of Buffer PNI were added to 1 volume of the sample and mixed. The QIAquick spin column was placed in a provided 2 ml collection tube and sample decanted to it. The tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 minute. Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube. Afterwards, "

We repeated the growth curve experiment with our E. coli JM109 bearing final Plas to see if the unexpected growth was caused by a resistant contamination. Cultivation was again carried out in four 500 mL non-baffled flasks with 75 mL 2xYT medium with ampicillin. Again, in two out of the four flasks N-3-oxododecanoyl-HSL was added.  The result was the same as yesterday, all culture showed normal growth. We needed a new strategy for future experiments.

Investigators: Jan, Anna, Melanie
We figured that maybe our ampicillin resistance was too potent because even the basal expression allowed for normal growth in medium with antibiotic.
We prepared 5 mL liquid cultures of E. coli JM109 bearing final Plas and added varying amounts of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to suppress the background expression. Tubes with 1 µg/µL to 100 µg/µL clavulanic acid showed no growth while tubes with 0.001 µg/µL to 0.1 µg/µL clavulanic acid showed normal growth.
Week 18: September 15 - September 21, 2013
This week we were happy to find a workaround for a big troublemaker: the background expression of beta-lactamase in non-induced state. We determined the critical concentration of beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid to be around 1 µg/ml. Furthermore, we directly applied it to experiments which previously were problematic because of the resistance to ampicillin under non-induced conditions.
Furthermore, we added our constructs to the iGEM Registry. Therefore our final contructs are from now on referred to as K1073034 and K1073035 for final Plas construct and final Prhl construct respectively.

New RFC iGEM_HD14
To use inteins as easy and standarized tools to modify proteins after translation we developed a new RFC for the iGEM community. Take a closer look on our new intein standard!
The Intein Library
Protein splicing by inteins is a natural process in which the catalytically active polypeptide termed intein excises itself from a precursor protein leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Deployed in our system inteins are modular instruments for several protein modifications. In our intein library you can find a list of all inteins we used, popular and really fast ones.

Aalto-Helsinki,2014,Team:Aalto-Helsinki#Research_-_-_TEXT.html," to get good quality LEDs from a known manufacturer who can supply a specifications sheet for the components.
Constructing
We wanted to be able to illuminate the bacterial culture with multiple LEDs with different intensities. We chose to grow our bacteria on microtiter plates. This choice was also affected by the fact that we had an access to a fluorometer (Thermo Scientific Varioskan) that measures fluorescence out of such microtiter plates.
We designed our LED rig so that an unmodified 96-well microtiter plate with the test cultures could be easily inserted. Our LEDs are attached to a lid that can be placed on a standard microtiter plate. 16 LEDs will illuminate the wells on columns 11,9,7,5 and rows B, D, F, H.
Our LEDs' spectrum peak is at the value of 470nm. This value is specified by the manufacturer but the spectra of individual LEDs can vary. Our aim was to measure the emission spectra of LEDs with a spectrophotometer to be sure of the excitation wavelength, but unfortunately the spectrophotometer at the aiding lab was not functioning and we were not able to get the emission spectra.     We did however measure the intensities of our LEDs at 470nm wavelength.
We measured intensities for two randomly selected LEDs (nr. 9 and 6) out of the total 16.     Measurements were done with a UDT instruments S450 Optometer with 1cm2 detector.     The measurements were done in a dimmed room and measured at 470nm. We measured both LEDs when the LED rig was supplied with a USB voltage of 5V and using 4 AAA-type batteries.     One of the LEDs was also measured with nearly depleted batteries for reference.
.: LED intensity as a function of intensity parameter. The intensities were measured for two LEDs (nr. 9 and 6) with different power supplies attached to the rig. USB refers to 5V input from a computer and newbatt refers to 4 fresh batteries of AAA-type (LR3). Intensity of LED nr. 9 was also measured with nearly depleted batteries for reference (oldbatt).
. maps the intensity parameters to absolute intensity values. We can conclude the measured LEDs are very close in measured intensities and this suggests that the LEDs' intensities of the different components don't vary much.

Thanks to:
Distribution of the work was done democratically within the team; each of us chose the field that  interests him more:
The laboratory team work under the guidance of Professor Berkovich who served as the scientific  advisor of the group. We implemented this in practice the experiment and of course planned the next  step into the night. Professor Berkovich helped us to examine the results and move on to the next stage  of the experiment. Completion of the scientific knowledge was done with our staff of teachers; we  studied the methods together from the Internet. The data processing was done by the team, primarily  by the members who are strong in mathematics.
The Community Working Group worked completely independently. The teachers assisted us technically  to make the events that occurred at school come real, all the initiatives were ours, the students. This  group was also used for documenting the entire process, Writing surveys and their implementation.
Our English teacher Dave helped us with the rhetoric of the presentation in a professional manner, with  emphasis on fluent English.
The site was the most complex, but for that there are friends who helped. 2 members of the group  (computer geeks) built the site together; whenever they had a problem our math teacher gave them a  solution – Ofir and classmates who are also addicted to computers.
After a long and extremely busy summer we would like to say:
We would like to thank all the generous donors, where without them it would have been impossible to be part of this competition. Each group enlightened us in a different field, each of the groups and the people are inseparable partners of Team ""FLAVOFF"".

In June, four team members from UT-Austin visted NC A&T for a week to present a series of molecular biology workshops. Each day’s workshop would start with a “dry-lab” component such as generating project ideas, experimental design, and computational tools for synthetic biology. This was followed by a “wet-lab” application, such as transformation, PCR, and cloning. In July, five members of the NC A&T team visited Austin for another series of workshops. These activities focused on how the Austin team applied the techniques covered earlier for the MAPs and p-cresol degradation projects. More advanced techniques were demonstrated, such as advanced primer design for plasmid assembly, and the use of non-canonical amino acids for protein engineering.

Figure 6: Maltose plate 3 column graph, mean growth rates on maltose gradient in 96 well plates. Media maltose (1-8) represents columns 5–12 (TP.Maltose) wells.
Results: Consistency is shown for high growth in column 5 (1g/L) but remains more or less level throughout the increasing maltose concentrations. Such consistency indicates LW06 is somewhat poor at maltose metabolism but is able to survive on it. Mean growth rates are small, though this is potentially explained by a highly limiting culture volume. However, data from the plate reader indicates clear exponential and plateau events during growth. In conclusion, growth under maltose conditions is possible. Conditioning for maltose consumption may be required to improve final culturing with C. reinhardtii when it is exporting maltose, in future co-cultures. The problems with the first experimental run, contamination in the blanks and controls, were most likely due to condensation on the interior lid or displacement of culture material in the controls and blank sections of the plate during agitation. As a result of this, data from this experiment is to be discounted for analysis and should be considered when proceeding with experiments in the future as to avoid issues of contamination.

ProteinGAN Architecture details
ProteinGAN networks are comprised of residual blocks that showed the best performance in ImageNet challenges. They are also a widely adopted in various implementation of GANs. Each block in discriminator contains 3 convolution layers with filter size of 3x3. The generator residual blocks consist of two deconvolution layers (transposed convolution) and one convolution block with the same filter size of 3x3 (see Figure 6).
Figure 6. Residual Blocks
We have experimented with 3 up-sampling techniques: Nearest Neighbor, Transposed Convolutions (deconvolutions)  and Sub-Pixel Convolutions (Shi et al., 2016). After conducting numerous experiments, we have chosen Transposed Convolutions as the best suited for dealing with proteins.
Figure 7: Architecture of generator and discriminator
The addition of Dilation into ProteinGAN
Convolution filters are very good at detecting local features, but it has limitations when it comes to long distance relationship. As a result, a lot of deep learning algorithms uses RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) approach when it comes to sequences. However, it has been showed that convolution filters with dilation outperforms RNN (Bai, Kolter and Koltun, 2018). The idea of dilation is to increase receptive field without increasing the number of parameters by introducing gaps into convolution kernels (Figure 8). Dilation rate was applied to one convolution filter in each residual block. The dilation rate was increased by 2 in each consecutive block. In this way by the last layer of the network, filters had large enough receptive field to learn long-distance relationships.
Figure 8: (a) dilation rate equals 1 (standard convolution), (b) dilation rate equals 2, (c) dilation rate equals 4. Red dots are where 3x3 filter is applied, colored squares show receptive field given previous convolutions. Source: (Yu and Koltun, 2016)
Self-Attention
Different areas of protein have different responsibilities in overall protein behaviour. In order to for network to capture this, self-attention mechanism (Zhang et al., 2018) has been implemented. To put it simply, it is a number of layers that highlights different areas of importance across the entire sequence. There are 64 such filters in ProteinGAN and ReactionGAN implementations.

Warwick,2016,Team:Warwick#Integrated Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," available treatment may render identifying health hazards potentially pointless. To tackle these problems, the team proposed a colorimetric sensing system that could be supplied to charities and governmental aid associations. However, he did warn that colour is subjective, and so for application within more developed areas, such as supplying environmental consultancies, we determined that a more quantitative measurement would be more helpful. We also considered further developing our product by combining the sensor with a water purification treatment.
After more detailed discussion, the team gained a greater insight into the potential interference resulting from other metal ions present in the sensing solution – potassium for example, interferes with the detection of lead. FredSense found they had to take preventative measures to reduce the effects of arsenic on antimony detection in particular, an interaction which we had not previously considered. Following this, we decided to combat any potential interference issues we may have by treating sample water with 18-crown-6 ether. This reagent specifically binds and masks potassium and sodium ions in solution, preventing their interaction with our sensor and reducing the chance of false positives.
New Forest Survey
On the 9th of September, a member of our team visited the New Forest – an area identified as a ‘Lyme disease hotspot’, to conduct a survey determining how aware members of the public were of Lyme disease. By handing out questionnaires in Lymington town centre, as well as visiting neighbourhoods in the surrounding rural area.
These questionnaires showed that almost everyone (87%) was uncomfortable with the idea of a self-test kit and whilst the majority (73%) were fine with drawing blood at home, there appeared to be a lack of trust in the reliability of a test not completed by a professional, such as a GP.  With 47% of people being comfortable with the idea of collecting their tests from a pharmacists, and a further 33% were happy to collect their tests from a doctor, we decided to target clinics as the main recipients of our product.
As well as reviewing the design of our product, our questionnaire also focused on public awareness of Lyme disease, something our team looked at tailoring our sensor to. We found that very few people knew what Lyme disease was or how serious it could become. Of those who had heard of it, the only symptom that could be consistently named was a bulls-eye rash, something that only presents itself in around 25% percent of cases. As well as this, very few appeared to have the opinion of Lyme disease as a prevalent disease, even when data was gathered in areas where there is a high risk of contracting Lyme disease, such as the South Downs.

iGEM Netherlands
The iGEM teams within the Netherlands have put their heads together to benefit from each other’s work under the banner of “iGEM Netherlands”. The goals of the organization include creating an environment in which supervisors and previous iGEMers share their knowledge and experiences with the new Dutch iGEM teams, as well as establishing a channel for discussion of ideas and exchange of knowledge and bricks. This initiative aims to improve the research quality and collaboration between Dutch universities participating on the iGEM competition, teaching the iGEM ideals to the new iGEMers and providing feedback on the human practices and safety measures. In this manner, the teams will be better prepared to tackle the obstacles they might encounter during the iGEM competition.
In order to implement the objectives of this initiative, a series of start-up courses were organized by iGEM Netherlands in a sequential order, presenting topics that ranged from a general introduction to iGEM and its role in promoting synthetic biology, advanced cloning techniques and modeling. Furthermore, a project presentation afternoon was organized in order for teams to present their projects to the other teams and get feedback from them. This event was finalized with a delicious BBQ.
iGEM Netherlands is the first of its kind, where a collaborative effort has been established on a national scale within the context of iGEM. This has been very beneficial in boosting our projects towards success with the knowledge that we have gained during the start-up courses and activities that have been organized. This type of collaboration would be beneficial to other iGEM teams as well, should they choose to do so.

pT8-O: BACTH in a plasmid
Introduction
First introduced in 1998, the bacterial two-hybrid system (BACTH) based in Escherichia coli facilitated the screening of interactions between two proteins, and provided a simpler, yet powerful, alternative to the well-known yeast two-hybrid technology (Karimova et al.; Battesti and Bouveret). BACTH utilizes the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase. Here, the two complementary fragments of adenylate cyclase, T18 and T25, are each fused to one of the proteins of interest. Good interaction between the two proteins allows for the reconstitution of the two halves of adenylate cyclase, thus restoring the synthesis of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP (Figure 1). In catabolic operons, such as the lac operon, cyclic AMP binds to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), increasing the affinity of CAP for DNA, and thus transcription through CAP’s interaction with RNA Polymerase.
Design
Existing kits of BACTH has T18 and T25 in two different plasmids (Figure 2).
Because our RISE system involves transforming another plasmid carrying the genes required to produce gas vesicles (BBa_K2389060) and we know that transformation efficiency suffers with multiple plasmids, we wanted to streamline the BACTH system and combined both T18 and T25 subunits in one plasmid, which we refer to as pT8-O (Figure 3). To facilitate its use, pT8-O has the following features:
Constitutive promoter
The BACTH kit Team UAlberta ordered had both T18 and T25 subunits under the control of the lac promoter, which allowed for inducible expression. However, we wanted to ensure that expression of the two subunits, and the proteins of interest, is not the limiting factor in the production of gas vesicles. Therefore, we replaced the lac promoter with the strongest constitutive promoter in the Anderson promoter collection (BBa_J23100).
Strong RBS

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," synthesis, from which point we could use modelling to illustrate just how effective our scaffold could be.
Our understanding how our scaffold system would appeal to consumers was furthered by the results of our symposium’s attendance survey. When the audience members were asked from which field they would most want to see synthetic biology advances, over 46% of respondents said pharmaceutical synthesis. This helped us shape the direction of our commercialisation work, validating our choice to focus on the taxol side chain synthesis pathway as a case study for our scaffold’s commercial viability.
Challenges for Innovation
As suggested by the title of the symposium, the panellists were prompted throughout the questions to provide insight on the challenges or barriers they perceived were faced by teams developing innovative synthetic biology tools, especially from an Australian perspective. In addition to the previously discussed issues of product adoption and clear public engagement, other issues such as research costs and access to funding were explored. The fact that projects developed in Australia had a much lesser prospect of accessing the “Bay Area Scene” in the United States highlights how innovation in Australia is somewhat less advantageous. However, as mentioned by Kearnes, the innovation culture in Australia is booming regardless thanks to growing support from the government, with A$13 million invested by CSIRO to establish the Synthetic Biology Future Science Platform2.
The symposium wrapped up with positive conclusions about the opportunities that young scientists and engineers have today, whilst reflecting on the importance of exposing high school students to interdisciplinary pursuits, such as those promoted by synthetic biology projects. This is backed in Australian literature, with Gray et al. (2018) 2 stating that:
“The development of synthetic biology research and industry will be underpinned by strong education programs in high school.”
This influenced our decision to get involved in educational outreach initiatives such as the school workshop and educational package.
