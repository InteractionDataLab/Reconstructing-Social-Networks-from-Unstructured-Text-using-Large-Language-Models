Evaluation of ideas presented.
June 1
Two more possible project ideas brought forward.
1. Idea for detection of proliferating bacterial cells. After     more research and discussion it was found that the complexity of cell surface     ligands of Gram Negative bacteria may mean that the project is not likely to be     feasible.
2.  Designing  bacteria which dissolve chewing gum on     pavements raised by Silvia. This idea is to be explored further.
June 6
More work being done on the chewing gum idea. Additionally,     other members of the team have been reading more about the iGEM competition and     biobrick assembly.

Secretion and Production of Monoterpenes in Yeast
OBJECTIVE: To create a model to assay the production of monoterpenes in our genetically engineered yeast cells given that they contain the metabolic genes IDI1, K6R-hmg2, erg20-2 and a monoterpene synthase.Model Creator: Gurpal BisraModel Advisors: Dr. Eric Lagally, Dr. James Piret, Dr. Steve Withers, Dr. Joanne Fox, Shing Zhan, Alina Chan, Rafael Saer, Eric Finlay
I, Gurpal Bisra, simplified the mevalonate pathway [1] to only enzymes associated with our project – IDI1, HMG2 and ERG20. I created first order Michaelis-Menten differential equations for the simplified chemical reactions. For this, Dr. Eric Lagally referred me to 2 sources: “Writing Differential Equations” [2] and “Chapter 6- Transport and Kinetics” [3]. However, many constants and concentrations must be known to solve these differential equations. An enzyme database “BRENDA” contains some kcat and km values [4]. However, more research must be done to determine the currently unknown constants. These differential equations can be solved in MATLAB to plot monoterpene concentration as a function of substrate or time.
Figure 1: The Mevalonate Pathway as found in yeast (Ignea et al. 2011).
Our team wants to mass produce monoterpenes so we...
1) Replaced HMG2 with the mutant variant K6R-hmg2, which is stabilized against protein degradation [5].
2) Replaced ERG20 with the mutant variant K197E erg20-2, which produces ""25% FPP and 75% GPP instead of 75% FPP and 25% G"

LMU-TUM_Munich,2016,Team:LMU-TUM Munich#Supporting Entrepreneurship_-_-_TEXT.html," -0.445! This is surprising as often team functionality plays a large part in project success. Perhaps this means the team splintered off into different groups, where only some team members founded a business independent of the rest. This is evident from the survey and graph as well, showing only a few people from the original teams founded the business. From the qualitative interviews, some teams did in fact only found with a few members of the original iGEM team. Without more information on this data, however, it is hard to make accurate assumptions on why team functionality does not enable business creation in this case. On the other hand, having an entrepreneurial spirit in the team has an extremely significant relationship of ß = 0.00, with all other variables held constant, meaning the drive and motivation to found a startup enables biotech business creation. Judging from the qualitative interviews, it certainly appears true that entrepreneurial spirit played a role as the founding teams were passionate and worked hard to secure funding and resources to found a business.

Market growth proved the most significant factor in predicting founding in terms of markets and product characteristics, with a p = 0.007 and a positive coefficient of 0.53, with all other variables held constant. This implies the Founders were relatively aware of or stumbled upon a market opportunity with their iGEM project and were able to access the market in time to found a viable business. From the qualitative interviews, some of the founders either knew during their project development that there was market growth, or only after the iGEM competition. Either way, it is clear that market growth related to a business is beneficial to founding a startup and so conducting research on the marketability of an idea could be beneficial when choosing an iGEM project.

Technique standard and Database Circuit+ Clotho application: Circuit List and TTEC Synthetic biology laboratory management
Human practice
Motivation
Synthetic biology is now meeting its golden age. Under the spirit of give, get and share, many standards have been set up and several websites have been put online. It is the ideas of standardized and modulated, which was borrowed from electronic engineering, that allow synthetic biology to prosper. For example, Registry of Standard Biological Parts ( http://parts.igem.org/ ) based on standard parts, together with iGEM, promotes synthetic biology a lot among undergraduate students. However, we find that not every part has high quality, for the standard cannot support some level of DNA in synthetic biology and therefore many complicated parts are marked as “composite part” and there was no standard and database for genetic circuit. We can see from IT industry that, new, proper standards can always strengthen the industry and in every step of development of IT, there is a classical standard with it. To make the language of synthetic biology more precise, to coordinate with the original idea of synthetic biology that we can see the behavior of genes just like the relations in circuit, we proposed two technique standards about logical gene module and genetic circuit. Inspired by the idea of Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we also give a solution to record and share standard genetic circuits online, that is Circuit+.
Actions
So, here’s our actions
Technique standard and Database
We proposed two technique standards this year (RFC 101 and RFC 97) to give accurate definitions of logical gene module and genetic circuits. The standard of genetic circuits is very powerful and works as the theoretical base of the software. The standard of logical gene module deals problem of regulation relations and you can see it in LGD (Logical Genetic Diagram). We designed a database carefully to record the circuits we find in a stand format And many software share the same central database.
Circuit+
We develop Circuit+ as our weapon to promote the idea and standard. So, it works like Registry of Standard Biological Parts. It is website of circuits’ information and behind it is the well-built database. And you can find many ways to browse and find a certain circuit."

Manchester,2016,Team:Manchester_-_-_TEXT.html," with a visible colour change according to their blood alcohol concentration thus giving them the ability to monitor their personal intoxication levels. Having an indicator to show how intoxicated a person is could help reduce the undesired consequences of being too drunk, the knock-on effects of these to the public services, drink-driving, as well as the prevention of serving alcohol to people who are over the limit and much more.
Science Behind AlcoPatch
It is known that the ethanol concentration in sweat is linearly related to the blood alcohol concentration [3]. Based on this, we aim to develop an ethanol biosensor by using synthetic biology, based on two separate potential methods to measure intoxication levels. The first mechanism involves the use of alcohol oxidase (AOx) in a cell-free system to oxidise ethanol to acetaldehyde that produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product. H2O2 is used as an oxidising agent by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to convert ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) to produce a gradient of the colour green. The second mechanism involves activation of the ethanol-sensitive transcription factor alcR in engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) . The activated transcription factor then activates the alcA promoter leading to the expression of chromoproteins.

Cambridge,2011,Team:Cambridge#Society#Questionnaire#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," carried on by their iGEM mentors or supervisors, who were often professors or post-Doctoral students in the lab they were working at. More recently, the judging criteria of the iGEM competition has encouraged new teams to further characterise the BioBrick parts submitted to the Registry by previous iGEM teams. This is important, since many parts that have been submitted have little or no documentation so future teams can do a lot to improve the usefulness of the BioBricks available. Some teams, such as Slovenia, build upon the work they do year on year, and have been extremely successful in the competition (winning 3 times in the past 5 years in Slovenia’s case). Teams such as Cambridge 2009 have also had their BioBricks requested from other scientists, who have subsequently used them in their own research.
Impressively, several projects were also continued by some members of the team as part of their Master’s or PhD thesis. Some papers were also published by the students which were printed in acclaimed journals such as Nature and Cell (team UTAustin 2004,2005,2006) and presentations made at conferences such as BioSynBio. This is indicative of the scientific importance of the work done. Some titles of the publications can be found in the Appendix.
Through our research, we have found that some notable work has been produced following on from projects undertaken as entries in the iGEM competition. In this way, iGEM has allowed students to give a direct contribution to research in synthetic biology, very soon after participating. The students are often inspired to produce very ambitious biological machines, often aiming to solve a well-known global problem, such as facilitating the breakdown of hazardous chemicals (e.g. crude oil, TU Delft 2010), sustainable production of biomaterials (e.g. biocellulose, Imperial College London 2009). As a result, there is often much media coverage of iGEM projects (e.g. Bioluminescence by Cambridge 2010 was featured in New Scientist magazine), raising the public profile of synthetic biology in a positive light. In this sense, it can thus be argued that iGEM projects have done much to both publicise synthetic biology as well as contribute significantly to the science.
The Impact of iGEM on Career Paths
We asked iGEM alumni whether or not they personally believed that iGEM affected their subsequent career paths. The results are shown in Graph 4.

In fact, we found out that, even though the students had advanced biology courses, the material taught does not always include synthetic biology. Throughout the day, we did our best to show these students a different side of the field of biology and convince them that we can hack life!
Presentation
We welcomed the students with a presentation that consisted of three parts. The first one was about iGEM, the modalities and principles of the competition, the number of participating teams, the contribution of each team, etc. The second part was about Synthetic Biology. After introducing them to common lab techniques and procedures, we talked about our project, Bio LOGIC.
After the presentation, we separated them into three groups for three different activities.
Ethics debate
The future use of novel technologies is a matter that every scientist with integrity has to think about. To make the students reflect about actions and consequences, we prepared an ethics debate during which we gave the students a role with a specific opinion. The goal was to make them think of opinions that diverge from their own and to make the activity more fun with a little drama. At the end of the debate, we took some time to discuss the activity without the roles. We were pleased to see that what we had opened their eyes on different aspects concerning the responsibilities linked to research in the field of synthetic biology.
Lab immersion
Even the most renowned scientist started by pipetting water, this is why we prepared a few activities in the lab to let the students see how it is to work in the world of synthetic biology. After giving them safety guidelines and safety equipment we made them plate chromophore cells to introduce them to cell manipulation techniques (you can see the 3 best results below), run a gel colony PCR to teach them about plasmids, PCR and gel size separation. The last proposed activity was a workshop using a website to design logic circuits.
Mini iGEM
As we wanted to give them an overview of how the competition works, we made them imagine iGEM projects. In this activity, small groups of students worked together to create iGEM projects and then explained them to the other groups. They were asked to think about feasibility, usefulness, safety and ethics. During the brainstorming, each group was coached by one of our team members. We introduced the concepts of kill switch, biobricks, motility, transcription pathways, transporters and bio-informatics to them. The ideas that they shared with us were surprisingly smart and imaginative for students who had received little technical and background information on the matter. Some"

Based on previous experiments, we would expect current production in combinations 2 and 4 as they both have wildtype S. oneidensis MR-1 and receive lactate.  In addition, however, we would expect combination 1 to also produce current. As described above, wt E. coli would break down lactose into lactate, and S. oneidensis MR-1 would break down lactate to produce current.
From the data above, we found that combination 1 did indeed produce current with a delay relative to the positive control. The delay can be attributed to the time it takes for E. coli to break down lactose into lactate, thus adding an extra step in the carbon source to current production pathway compared to our positive controls. These results are exciting in that they show a possibility of taking advantage of this cooperative effort to achieve inducible current.
Future directions
Our work with creating a system of inducible electrical output in S. oneidensis has laid the foundations for many different exciting avenues of further inquiry which look to take advantage of a bacteria-computer interface that combines the amazing sensitivity and adaptability of bacteria with the speed and analytical abilities of electricity and computers.
Using the same principles underlying the lac system, the arsenic biosensor developed by the University of Edinburgh iGEM 2006 team could be introduced into S. oneidensis, allowing for the coupling of arsenic sensing to an electrical output, a form of a data which is easier to automate and transmit.  This could be further extended to other chemical sensing systems, such as the lead sensor created by the Brown iGEM 2007 team and the mercury sensor made by the MIT iGEM 2007 team, resulting ultimately in an array of different strains of S. oneidensis which all respond to the presence of different chemicals with an electrical output that can be monitored by a computer.  This could theoretically allow for the remote sensing and analysis of the chemical composition of an environment over"

Collaboration with the iGEM Team from SDU-Denmark
We invited the iGEM Team from the Southern University of Denmark to Bielefeld to share and exchange knowledge and of course to meet another iGEM team. On the 25th of September Asbjørn Müller, Andreas Kjær, Malou Reedorf and Ida Appel visited us on a surprinsingly sunny saturday in Bielefeld. Most of the german iGEM teams ( Bielefeld , Bonn , Darmstadt , Göttingen , Marburg , Munich ( LMU and TU ) and Tübingen had organized a common day in each city across Germany to inform about iGEM, Synthetic Biology and to present their projects. We thought that extending the common day to other European teams would be great, so the SDU-Denmark team also presented their project and helped us to communicate with the guests. We think that both for our teams and for the guests the cooperation between the teams was a great success and an enrichment. The pedestrians, who visited our booth, could see that young scientists from different countries can work together to find innovative solutions. We also wanted to show that teams from all over the world are encouraged in Synthetic Biology, trying to find new solutions for old problems.
Together we talked with a lot of people, showed microorganisms and isolated DNA from different fruits to educate about the basics of modern life sciences. We also had organized some games for kids (see here: Street Science ).
On Sunday both teams presented their projects and after that we had a long discussion trying to find solutions for each other’s problems in lab. We further discussed both our modeling approaches and how to improve it.
Main discussion points were:
To find a solution for our problem with the expression of some laccases

We asked the public in Lausanne about it, and the main answer was neither “the people” nor “politicians”, but by a great margin: “scientists”. Oliver Peter totally agrees with this answer: “That’s very clear and very easy: it’s you [scientists, who are responsible]! You and your conscience. You can never delegate an ethical decision to a committee, to your boss or anyone else for that matter. In the end, if you do not feel good about it, you must not do it, even if people disagree with you”. This, of course, is one way to see the problem. But it creates a paradox: on one side, people ask for more interaction with scientists and on the other side, they fully delegate the responsibility of research to the scientific experts. “It is a very complicated question, and you are talking about the crux of the matter. We do not really know who has to debate. Of course, society, because those are ethics problems that affect it as a whole”, Prof. Duboule says.
How can society as a whole be represented for such a debate? “Scientists have to shed some lights using their knowledge in order to clarify what was not properly understood”, Prof. Trono suggests.  “We need ethicists who think deeply on social repercussions of research. However, the general public also has the role to be well informed, and not indoctrinated. It is a societal dialogue, and this role is claimed by ethics committees – I’m thinking about the National Academy of Sciences in the USA for instance – that aim to represent society as a whole”. Prof. Trono was not the only one to mention ethics committees. “There are national ethics committees consisting of scientists, politicians, and sometimes philosophers in each country. Judgment has to come from there, if those committees are reliable of course. But you, as a scientist, have to wonder about your own project. The first defence line is people [scientists] like you”, Prof. Lefort insists.
Another way the media address the matter of responsibility in Science is by invoking “playing God”, a very strong symbol (which goes back to the polemical way some media cover scientific topics), and can be understood as “not respecting what God gave us by modifying the genome”. Xavier Gavend, theologist and chaplain at EPFL gave us another view on this subject by invoking the great importance of humility (which Prof. Benaroyo also mentioned as being a necessary quality for a scientist): “From a Christian perspective, it is with humility that greatness can"

Newcastle,2017,Team:Newcastle#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," from 4 replicates, in a 5-alpha Escherichia coli chassis in LB media and SOC media, measured as Arbitrary Fluorescence Units/OD600. The GFP expression levels were measured every hour over a period of 24 hours. The GFP expression levels were compared to a synthetic GFP construct in an E. coli chassis as a positive control and a non-fluorescing E. coli device as a negative control. The E. coli cells were grown at a neutral pH over 24 hours, at 37ᵒC and 220 rpm. Error bars represent standard error.
Temperature
The GFP expression of 5-alpha grown at 31ᵒC in SOC media at a neutral pH was 1.68x105 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 6.10x103 AFU/OD600 after 24 hours of incubation. This was higher than the GFP expression in the 5-alpha grown at 37ᵒC and 43ᵒC, which were 4.08x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 7.13x103 AFU/OD600 and 3.94x104 AFU/OD600 with the standard error of 4.38x103 respectively (Figure 2.2). There was a significant difference in mean GFP expressions of 5-alpha between 31ᵒC, 37ᵒC and 43ᵒC in SOC media over the 24 hours (ANOVA, F2,72=12.10, p<0.001). A post hoc Tukey test indicated that there was no significant difference between the expression at 37ᵒC and 43ᵒC (p>0.05) but the expression and 31ᵒC was significantly different to the other temperatures (p<0.001). The Gibson Assembly construct in 5-alpha also had a higher GFP expression in LB media compared to SOC media during the stationary growth phase at 31ᵒC.

Investigating the needs in antibiotics field, we visited our general practitioners. They confirmed that there is a demand for diagnostic tools that reveal antibiotic resistance. Doctors seem to face challenges considering viral or bacterial infections, the identification of the pathogen causing the infection, resistance detection and the susceptibility to existing drugs.

See our applied design page .
Validation with Dairy Farmer - Paul Oosthoek
We also received feedback on how we can improve our device. Paul stated that it would be better if the test really showed which specific antibiotic should be used for treatment, instead of knowing which antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Another piece of feedback was to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 1.5 mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to increase the visibility and to be more user-friendly.

Description
What are PCBs?
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of man-made chemicals that contaminate many of the world’s lakes and waterways1. They were originally produced for industrial and commercial applications, and although their manufacture has been banned since the 1970s, these deadly toxins are still present in the environment today, mainly due to bioaccumulation, as well as due to the improper disposal of old electrical equipment. It has been known for several decades that PCBs do eventually break down, but because they are highly nonreactive and resistant to acids, bases, and heat, their rate of decomposition in the environment is slow. The pathway by which they are broken down was only recently discovered. A bacterium called Dehalococcoides mccartyi has been observed to break down PCBs with a variety of enzymes, the genes for three of which (pcbA1, pcbA4, and pcbA5) were sequenced in 2014 by Wang2. The figure below depicts the dechlorinating mechanism of these three genes on PCB and PCE (tetrachloroethene) molecules.
Image courtesy of PNAS2
Why is this an issue?
PCBs are probable human carcinogens, have acute toxic effects, and can cause significant impairment of the immune system and thyroid. They are also known to disrupt hormone functions and generate developmental issues - women exposed to PCBs can give birth to children with significant neurological and motor control problems1. Compared to other waterways, the Washington Puget Sound has a considerably high level of PCBs, which bioaccumulate in organisms over the years. For native predators such as the orca, the biomagnification of PCBs up the food chain has been severely detrimental3.
As stated before, the bacterium Dehalococcoides mccartyi has the ability to dechlorinate PCBs, thereby reducing their toxicity. However, D. mccartyi is an anaerobic species, and can only obtain energy through organohalide respiration. This makes them difficult to work with in terms of practical applications.
What is our solution?
In our project, we aim to transfer pcbA1, pcbA4, and pcbA5 - the genes responsible for producing the PCB-dechlorinating enzymes - into E. coli bacteria. Unlike D. mccartyi, E. coli is able to thrive in aerobic environments such as oceans and waterways, making them a much more suitable species to use in potential PCB cleanup operations. Our end goal"

Overcoming Weaknesses and Threats
4.6 Anticipation
Doping knows a long history of development. As a rat race, detection methods have for a long time been following up on developments in doping use. We believe we should not be naïve in the sense that this time we are first, since there are certainly clues that gene doping is already happening. However, gene doping is different from more conventional doping in the sense that it is highly versatile. Therefore, we thought of a method to anticipate further developments within gene doping. This we do through our self-learning algorithm for gene doping sequence classification as is described on our software tool page. We challenged engineers at the Cyber Security Week to hack our method in order to become as strong as we can be against gene doping. In this way we are the first to openly use collaborative strengths in the race against doping.
We realize that inventive and knowledgeable people could potentially mess with our system, as with almost every detection method. Therefore, we asked all stakeholders"

For optimum growth bacteria must adapt to their environment, one way to do this is by moving towards advantageous conditions. To do this they must be able to both move and to control the direction of that movement. The signaling pathways that control this directionality form into large arrays of receptors and kinases. The best studied arrays contain transmembrane receptors, however many species also contain arrays that are non-transmembrane and therefore in the cytoplasm. My work focuses on the"

Introduction
Currently, hormone detection methods are costly and time consuming. It can take many days to collect, store, test and analyze a sample. For example, the commonly used Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit can cost $500-$1100 per 96-well plate. Each test performed using this kit is usually done in triplicate. Costs for lab technicians, supporting equipment and storage also add to these costs and hormone researchers may spend tens of thousands of dollars for these tests. Hormones in a sample may also degrade before they can be appropriately processed, which may lead to inaccurate results.
The Lethbridge Entrepreneurial iGEM team is in the process of developing a method of detecting hormones using the concepts of synthetic biology. Our system is designed to detect hormones without extensive sample preparation, eliminating long waits for lab results. Eventually, we hope to expand on this and develop a real time assay. This will allow researchers and medical practitioners to observe fluctuations in hormone levels in real time, obtaining more critical information about hormones and their physiological effects. Our assay will also be modular, allowing the user to monitor multiple hormones with the same system. We are actively working on the research and development of our idea. With the help of the University of Lethbridge Industry Liaison Office and Office of Research Services, we are also in the initial stages of patenting our method.
In order to achieve our goal, the Lethbridge Entrepreneurial team has incorporated the company Synbiologica Ltd. We have developed a business plan around our idea. We have since participated in the South Venture Business Plan Competition (University of Lethbridge) and the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge (Community Futures Lethbridge). We received first place in both of these competitions. We also participated in the TEC Edmonton Business Plan Competition and though we did not win, we received extremely valuable feedback. Our team has also attended local business development workshops and conferences and we will be attending the MEDICA Conference in Dusseldorf, Germany, this November.

USTC,2010,Team:USTC Software#dev_-_-_TEXT.html,". If the forest structure has changed, we must find some ways to determine which tree structure is preferred and based on this to arrange them. We know each tree could be uniquely converted to a binary tree by taking the first child of each node as the left child and its siblings as its right child. The Huffman algorithm is used to generate the Huffman code of each node in the binary tree. Since the Huffman code of each node represents its path to the root node, we can restore the tree structure from the Huffman codes of all leaf nodes. Hence, the Huffman codes of leaf nodes could uniquely determine a tree structure. With help of Huffman codes, it is simple to compare the forest structure after and before exchange of both chains.
To go further, we must define the preference of each forest structure due to exchange of chains: compare each node of the first tree by their Huffman codes and weights in the same way as comparison of strings and if equal, compare the next until difference appears or to the end of either forest. If one is less than another, it has higher priority. With this definition, the order of those equal chains in the first-stage sorting is determined by the one which generates the forest strucuture with highest priority among all possibilities. By performing this algorithm for all groups of equal chains obtained from the first-stage sorting, we could find both the unique order of the chains and the groups of equivalent chains (exchange of the order fo several chains in the same equivalent group will not change the forest structure). The figure illustrates this idea graphically.
It is easy to compare two structures with help of chain sorting. We only need to compare first the chain list in order, chain by chain, and if equal, compare both associated forest structures. If two structures are same, the comparison must be equal since chains and trees are all in their unique order. If the comparison is equal, they must be the same structures since we could uniquely generate a Chain-Node structure from the chains as well as its associated forest structure.
Structural pattern match of template species
We assume that if a combination of species in the species list could be structurally matched to reactants and modifiers templates defined within a reaction, they are possible to react with each other in the way as the reaction template describes. Hence, it is important to find such matchings between species in the species list and template ones defined in the database. We will first give the basic idea and then some modifications.
Blocks of ST and NST part on a template chain
Combinations of NST block matchings form a region restriction for ST part blocks

Amsterdam,2017,Team:Amsterdam#Collaborations_-_-_TEXT.html," that is the most carbon efficient. As calculated by team Amsterdam, this will most likely be the Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria convert CO 2 directly into fumarate, fuelled by sunlight. For E. Coli , on the contrary, you needs to grow sugar crops, harvest them, and extract the glucose as a carbon source to grow. Taking the whole process into consideration, cyanobacteria will yield more fumarate per CO 2 . Exploring other options such as these could provide an efficient and possibly cost-effective way to produce the fumarate that would lower methane emissions in cattle.
Conclusions
From this pleasant collaboration, we can conclude that adding fumarate to cattle feed remains a promising strategy to reduce methane emissions, although some hurdles have yet to be taken. Some studies report conflicting results about the effect of the addition of fumarate to cattle feed on methane production. Thereby, the absence of oxygen in cattle rumen opposes challenges for the growth of photoautotrophic organisms and oxidative growth of heterotrophic organisms.
On top of that, the exact yields of the strains developed by iGEM team Amsterdam and the proposed E. Coli mutant in this paper have yet to be defined. Nevertheless, as shown by the UNL iGEM team, methane emissions pose an enormous problem to our world, that need interdisciplinary teams to come up with out of the box-solutions such as these.

Pasteur_Paris,2018,Team:Pasteur Paris#Membrane_-_-_TEXT.html," invasive possible. To make a choice, a compromise must be made between the selectivity and the degree of invasiveness of the electrode. The ""secondary"" criteria are stability and repeatability. We will present the neural electrodes by exposing their performances in terms of selectivity and level of invasiveness.
I. Extra-neural electrodes
1. Helicoidal electrode interface:
Helicoidal electrodes are placed surrounding the nerve and are made of flexible metal ribbon in a helical design. This design allows the electrode to conform to the size and shape of the nerve to minimize mechanical trauma. The structural design causes low selectivity. Helicoidal electrodes are currently used for functional electrical stimulation, to control intractable epilepsy, sleep apnea, and to treat depressive syndromes.
2. Cuff electrode [2]:
Considered as extraneural electrodes, cuff electrodes are widely used to perform basic and applied electro-neurophysiology studies and are particularly interesting for their ability to achieve good nerve recruitment with low thresholds. The cuff-style electrode provides a cylindrical electrode contact with a nerve for each of an arbitrary number of contacts, is easy to place and remove in an acute nerve preparation, and is designed to fit on the nerve (Cf. Figure 1). For each electrode, the electrical contacts were cut from metal foil as an array so as to maintain their positions relative to each other within the cuff. Lead wires were soldered to each intended contact. The structure was then molded in silicone elastomer, and individual contacts were electrically isolated. The final electrode is curved into a cylindrical shape with an inner diameter corresponding to that of the intended target nerve. These electrodes have been successfully used for nerve stimulation, recording, and conduction block in a number of different acute animal experiments by several investigators.
Figure 1: Schematic of a nerve cuff electrode. Retrieved on Oct. 14th from MicroProbes for Life Science[1]
The activity recorded by the cuff electrode represents the simultaneous activity of a large number of active axons. The potential of action seen by the electrode is overlapped, allowing only a ""global"" image of the activity inside the nerve. As a result, the selectivity of the recording is limited by the number of axons undergoing simultaneous discharge and by the position and surface of the contact of the cuff electrode. This type of measurement, therefore, does not allow the identification of fiber activity alone.
Increasing the number of electrode poles allows increasing the selectivity of this type of electrode. A multi-pole cuff electrode is then called a cuff electrode having more than three contacts. These contacts can be rings or"
Stockholm,2015,Team:Stockholm#Description_-_-_TEXT.html," The fluorescence producing bacteria could potentially be used for various different purposes. Another speculation was whether the use of quorum sensing potentially could achieve amplification for the signal.
Biobricks for QS
The two biobricks chosen for the readout system were BBa_K1157006 and BBa_T9002 :
They share the same basic layout, where the QS receptor is coupled with a constitutive promoter and the fluorescent gene is coupled with a promoter activated by the complex of QS receptor and QSM.
The biobricks were chosen as the QSMs are of similar lengths, while the structures were different enough to ensure that there would be little to no crosstalk between the systems. https://2013.igem.org/Team:Concordia/Interface

Experimental plan
There are several biobricks which produce fluorescent proteins when exposed to different QSMs. Two different colored proteins were chosen as well as two different QSMs. Colours were chosen to have well separated spectra and the QSMs to not  interfere. The two biobricks would be tested separately with their corresponding and non-specific QSMs to determine regular levels and possible interference. The two biobricks would then be cloned together and again characterized with each QSMs. Different levels of each QSMs simultaneously would also be characterised, as this scenario would be likely in the full system.
Modeling the EnvZ/OmpR pathway
To predict the correlation between the concentration of activated EnvZ and signal intensity, we modeled the mechanism from EnvZ to OmpC and OmpF. Depending on the osmolarity level, the output is either OmpC  (in the case of high osmolarity) or OmpF (low osmolarity). By determining this connection we can then adjust the EnvZ amount to get the desired product, OmpC.  After the OmpC translation, the two quorum sensing molecules (QSMs), BHL and RhlR, are activated to further produce GFP. By analyzing the ratio at which OmpC triggers the QSMs, we can achieve"

Shiga toxin 1 and 2 have 55% homology and are composed of 5 identical highly conserved B subunits that bind to the Gb3 host receptor cells and a single A subunit which enters the host target cell and cleaves rRNA. Cattle do not have Gb3, consequently, O157:H7 infected cattle are asymptomatic and difficult to detect. More than 200 serotypes of E.coli contain shiga toxin, of these, some have LEE (locus of enterocyte) which does not directly indicate pathogenicity. Other strains of pathogenic shiga toxin producing E. coli recognized by the USDA as harmful are: O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O118:H16, O121:H19, and O145:H28 (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012). These strains are also known as the Big Six. Currently, the USDA targets both the eae and stx genes using PCR. When these genes are being used in identification, if the sample tests positive for both eae and stx, the sample undergoes further testing. If it only has one or neither of the genes, the sample is considered safe and testing stops (USDA  Laboratory Guidebook, 2012).
Regarding our TALE construct, we compared 2 standard construction strategies for multiple DNA fragments: Golden Gate and Gibson Assembly. Gibson Assembly is a one-step isothermal reaction involving an exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase. All enzymes are put together in one reaction along with DNA fragments and the vector and incubated at 50°C for 15 to 60 min. (Gibson et al., 2009)
Week 7: June 10 - June 14
This week, we had the opportunity to tour Cargill Meat Solutions’ High River beef plant and experience firsthand the stringency and efficiency of the meat processing facility. Global prevalence of O157:H7 in cattle farms is 20% (Chase-Topping et al., 2008) and the presence of super shedders is influenced by the E. coli strain and host dependent factors (breed, sex, reproductivity, stress, movement) independent of the external farm environment (Chase-Topping et al., 2008). These few super shedders are important factors to pre-harvest contamination"

Jilin_China,2018,Team:Jilin China#Measurement_-_-_TEXT.html," sfGFP from iGEM parts registry cannot be used because it contains the commonly used IIS restriction enzyme site. In order to solve this problem, we designed BbsI free site-directed mutagenesis sfGFP for Golden Gate and prokaryotic codon-optimism sfGFP_optimism. We compared these two parts with sfGFP and added them to the registry. As can be seen from the data, sfGFP_optimism has a strong fluorescence intensity, so we finally apply sfGFP_optimism in the construction device.

4. Double terminator
In order to prevent the leakage of the gene, we decided to add two terminators(BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012) at downstream sfGFP.
Methods
Before we did experiments, we encountered a problem -- what methods did we use to accurately reflect the change in our RNA-based thermosensor with temperature?
Before solving this problem, we must determine how the protein expression of the chassis organism E.coli DH5α is affected by temperature. In order to solve this problem, we have designed positive control devices with different intensities. Their RBS sequence predicted by the software will not form a stem-loop structure.
Fudan_China team helped us to measure some of the positive controls and plotted sfGFP expression intensity curve with temperature and got the following results:
Figure 2. Fluorescence expression of positive control at different temperatures at 8 hrs. The figure’s horizontal axis represents the temperature range (28℃ to 42℃), and the vertical axis represents fluorescence intensity of sfGFP. (A) represents positive control-1, (B) represents positive control-2.
As the figure shows that the expression intensity of sfGFP by E.coli also increases with elevated temperatures. So we came to the following conclusions:
1. E.coli DH5α protein expression will be affected by temperature.
2. The change of temperature and the expression level of sfGFP are approximately linear.
We are very grateful to Fudan_China for helping us in this experiment. Other cooperation about us will be recorded on the Collaboration page, you can Click Here!
After obtaining such a conclusion, it is important to eliminate the influence of temperature to the bacterial protein expression . Therefore, as for the data processing, we mainly reflect the sfGFP intensity expressed by bacteria at a unit concentration"

* As the tubes were spun with their lids open, they were placed such that lids pointed away from the direction of spinning.
Restriction Digest of Extracted PCR product
Restriction digest was performed using EcoRI-HF (5’) and SpeI (3’) restriction enzymes.
NEB’s Double Digest Finder was invoked and it was determined that CutSmart Buffer would be used for the digest.
The buffer was completely defrosted and shaken before use.
There is a recommended digestion protocol on NEB Cloner. 50µL reaction mixtures were set up with component volumes as recommended, except for the DNA where all 30µL of the extraction mixture (in elution buffer) were used in the digest. There would be up to 50ng of DNA in each tube of extraction mixture (from the gel bands).
Incubation at 37℃ was also done for 2 hours (ThermoMixer program 3) instead of the recommended 5-15 minutes, with shaking at 300rpm.
Restriction Enzyme Digest of the iGEM HQ linearised pSB-1c3
125ng of pSB-1C3 was dissolved in 5mL Milli-Q water.

Upon completion of restriction digest incubation, the gBlocks and the plasmid backbones were purified again using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit. PCR products and plasmid backbones need to be purified in order to remove remaining impurities including agarose gel and restriction enzymes. At the elution step, the gBlock inserts were eluted using 30µL elution buffer whereas the plasmid backbone was eluted using 50µL of it.

SCAU-China,2016,Team:SCAU-China#HP#Silver#test_-_-_TEXT.html," embodied in the following two aspects: one is that the encoding products of marker genes might be potentially toxic and allergenic for human or livestock. Antibiotic genes might be transferred into gut microbes' genome of humans or animals, increasing the resistance of the microbes to the antibiotics, and which results in reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics in clinical treatment; the other one is that marker genes could be spread through pollens or in other methods into other organisms, which is called genetic drift. Genetic drift can transfer antibiotic genes to weeds or other plants, which is threatening the ecological environment now.
In order to reduce the side effects of antibiotic marker genes, we use a technique called selectable marker-free technique in the project, so the final aSTARice is a marker-free transgenic plants(MFTPs). We design a Cre-loxP based side-direct recombinant system to knock out hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, minimizing the effect of the selectable maker gene.
In order to reduce the risk of genetic drift as well as the threat to the ecological environment, we add isolation area to surround the experimental fields. By isolating the transgenic rice, we reduce the possibility of genetic drift caused by the transfer of the pollen, sufficiently guaranteeing the safety of the project. What's more, we are also analyzing coding products by HPLC and trying to make sure that there is no harmful products in our rice.
Rice was chosen as the chassis though it isn't included in the white line, but we checked-in with the official website in the beginning. Because we are the first team who choose rice as chassis, we have to assess the safety for rice.
Rice is the self-pollinated plant so that the genotype in the individuals is pure and homogeneous. The probabilities that cross-pollination takes place in two flowers are just 1%, and the distance of the effective spread of rice pollen is hardly beyond 1 meter.
The phenomenon of pollen escape is the main way which leads to the flow of exogenous gene of transgene plants. Recently, the researches of transgene plants verified that the exogenous gene of transgene plants will flow to the same species or weeds and even the conventional species. As iGEMers, we took safety into consideration carefully so that we consulted plentiful papers, and then we found a conclusion that under the close distance less than 1% adjacent non-genetically modified plants would take place gene flow. If we increase the distance to 5~10 meters, the probabilities decrease to 0.001%~0.0001%, which means nearly no gene flow would happen in theory. When"

Conducted by: Einan Farhi and Mor Pasy
Date: 15.7.18
Experiment goal and significance: The objective is to create a stable cell-line of the BV2 cells with a     knockout mutation of the Inhibitor of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Kinase subunit     beta (IKBKB) gene. With which, we aim to demonstrate how targeting the     Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway will diminish the amount of     inflammation promoting cytokines produced by the immune representative     cells of the brain.

Theoretical background:
In the experiment we used a px601 commercial vector designed to express a Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) conjugated with a Green Fluorescent     Protein (GFP). Mor P. cloned the F4/80 promoter into the vector upstream of     the Cas9-GFP construct instead of the original Cytomegalovirus (CMV)     promoter. This promoter is considered to be expressed highly in microglia     versus the other types of cells of the brain1. Into the guide     RNA sequence of the vector was cloned a targeting sequence complementary to     sequences that reside in various exons of the IKBKB gene. Generally, the     CRISPR/Cas9 system is used to deliver a sequence-wise accurate double     strand break which should dramatically increase the chances of a knockout     mutation in the targeted gene2. The knockout of IKK-β should, in     theory, decrease the amount of Inhibitor of kappa-B (IκB) that is sent to     degradation and thus maintain a persistent inhibition of NFκB. A stronger     inhibition of the NFκB complex might produce a weaker expression of its     target genes, among them: Interleukin 1 subunit α (Il1α) 3 and     Tumor Necrosis Factor subunit α (TNFα)4.
Procedure:
Cloning of plasmid.
Electroporation with plasmid.
Validation of transfection success according to expression of GFP.
Validation of resulted mutation using the T7E1 assay.
Checking for a diminished expression of IKK-β using Western Blot     analysis.

Collaboration with the University of Edinburgh
The University of Edinburgh iGEM 2015 team is creating a paper-based biosensor to detect purity of and contaminants in illicit drugs. In an effort to increase the applications of the proof-of-concept biosensor, the team wanted to incorporate microbial cellulose as an alternative to filter paper. This could decrease the cost of the biosensor as well as making the disposal easier. By using microbial cellulose that our team provided, the University of Edinburgh team was able to check the binding affinities of a cellulose binding domain (CBD) to the cellulose to see whether microbial cellulose-based biosensors are feasible. Our bioHYDRA project involved testing processed and unprocessed cellulose, and we sent the Edinburgh team a sample of each. This allowed the Edinburgh team to see if there is an advantage to the processing for their applications, and, since our future work includes expressing CBDs on spore coats, the processed sheets will be better for our applications as well. The data (see figure) shows that less protein dissociation occurred from the processed sheets.
For the collaboration, the Edinburg IGEM 2015 used the BBa_K321357, which is an sfGFP fused to the cellulose binding domain CBDcex transcriptionally activated by Lacl. Since the CBDcex is attached to a fluorescence, sfGFP, the strength of the binding affinity is correlated with the absorbance level. The y-axis measures the absorbance in relative fluorescent unit while the x-axis is the time incubation. Although there is large error bar, there is a distinguishable difference between the binding affinity of the CBD onto the cellulose unprocessed and processed sheet. The high absorbance for the processed sheet indicates that the CBD binds more effectively than the unprocessed sheet. This experiment will be repeated in the near future.

In the program, we try to use the growth-promoting function of gdh to achieve the purpose of retaining the plasmid as much as possible, so as to have a positive effect on industrial production.
Since gdh already exists in the genome of the strain, we cannot determine the exact function of exogenous introduction of gdh. Therefore, we knocked out the gdh on the genome of the strain, making the growth of the strain after gdh knockout restricted, and importing gdh with exogenous source. The growth rate difference of the strain is larger than before. That is, the growth advantage of the strain exogenously introduced into gdh after knocking out the genome gdh is more obvious than that of the defective strain, so that the growth promoting function of gdh can be more clearly manifested. If gdh does have a certain plasmid retention capacity, under this apparent contrast, we think that the plasmid retention time should be longer when the exogenous gdh is introduced and fully expressed after knocking out gdh on the genome, while other strains, including strains that have lost the plasmid and the strains with weak expression ability, will be eliminated due to slow growth, thus achieving the function of screening the plasmid-preserving strains, which is of great significance for the industrial production of engineering bacteria.

Dr. Ryan began by talking about some misconceptions surrounding Alzheimer’s disease - one of them being that individuals with the disease are unable to do everything that they used to be able to do. She explained that, even when a person with Alzheimer’s cannot do something - for example, continue a conversation with someone that took place a day before - that does not mean that they are never able to do those things. They may not be able to do it one day, but the next they might. Additionally Dr. Ryan discussed how the nature of conversation surrounding Alzheimer’s is always negative. Nobody, she says, ever really focuses on things that might be gained from Alzheimer’s. She gave us an account of someone she knew who, after developing Alzheimer’s disease was able to create beautiful paintings. Dr. Ryan encourages everyone to not focus solely on the things that someone with Alzheimer’s cannot do, but to also focus on the things that they can do. She also encourages us to see the person underneath the disease because that person is still there.
The Future of mGEM Human Practices
This year, the topic of the iGEM project was on understanding alzheimer's, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease and socially relevant to the broader McMaster, Hamilton, and Canadian communities. Building upon conversations with researchers and community stakeholders, has led McMaster iGEM to pursue research projects  in an area of public health relevance for the Hamilton and Canadian community. Through this strategic alignment, we hope to pursue issues relevant to our local community and engage with stakeholders  to advocate and raise awareness for these important issues, beyond just the lab. We see this relationship of conducting basic scientific research on a core public health issue as a strength of our team, and we look forward to continuing and building upon our relationship with the Hamilton community.

Mathworks matlab seminar on using matlab more efficiently when analyzing data. Was very helpful for our modeling team (Mike and Grant and Brian)
9:30 am to 11:00:
Rainen and other sponsors held a breakfast discussion section meeting. Lajja and Sarah went to discuss product sponsorship.
Yuan worked in the lab continuing to research genomes and coding regions that were needed for all of our parts for pcr and synthesis.
Brian tested the efficiency of the transformed e. coli competent cells as outlined in the protocol section:
Concluded that the cells were 10^5 efficiency, which while slightly too low for the purposes of our final design, would work well for transforming supercoiled parts from the registry
Yuan started making more competent cells at 10^6 efficiency
Wednesday
Continued searching for the coding regions of the phytases and the entire genomes of the organisms they came from (for pcr)
Also continued searching for the coding regions of the parts and the genomes of the organisms they came from (for pcr)
Jennifer came to the lab and taught us about how pcr works and how to assemble the primers for pcr. Specifically, there is a calculator online that helped with forming the primers for pcr: http://simgene.com/Primer3
The heuristic rules for primers were as follows:
Avoid primers that are complementary to one another.
Avoid primers that have internal complementarities—it can lead to hairpin formation.
Be sure that the 3' ends of the primers are exactly complementary to the template strand.
Primers that end in C or G are most efficient.
Primers should be about 50% G+C in content.
Tm for primers should be similar to one another within 3 degrees C.
Primers should have a Tm (melting temperature"

Mr Holmes
Cellock Holmes - A Case of Identity
""What's living on the table in front of you?"" seems to be an easy question to answer: microoganisms.
However, ""Which microorganisms are there?"" is not such a trivial question anymore, especially in environments where you only want to have a non-pathogenic microflora or no microorganisms at all, such as lab spaces or health care institutions.
Our project Cellock Holmes solves this case of identy.
Cellock Holmes encompasses our 2D biosensing technology with which can detect bacteria on solid surfaces. Cellock Holmes is mainly devised to overcome the drawbacks of existing techniques and aims for a faster, inexpensive, open source, mobile and an easy to handle detection method.
We demonstrate the proof-of-concept for Cellock Holmes by detecting an opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This gram-negative prokaryote infects patients with open wounds and burns as well as immunodeficient people. P. aeruginosa cells use quorum sensing to communicate with each other by secreting autoinducers into their environment. Using a Synthetic Biology (SynBio) approach, our team engineered sensor cells, so-called Cellocks, that are able to detect the native autoinducer of P. aeruginosa and elicit a distinct fluorescence signal. Further, the response time of our sensor cells has been highly enhanced by the use of our special REACh construct . The advantages of our REACh construct is also backed-up by a model of our biosensor's kinetics.
While Cellocks are specifically designed to detect P. aeruginosa, with a modular composition of our genetic device, it is possible to easily engineer Cellocks to detect autoinducers of other bacteria"

People are in fear about their properties, their families, their lives. Media and some politicians stoke those fears and produce an atmosphere that brings people to switch the priorities from 'freedom' to 'safety'. And this might have a high price. How do we want to punish people for misbehavior, what would come up if everyone has the possibility to use bacteria and virus for tracing e.g. intruders. Which other secondary effect would an area-wide DNA database have, for example on the employment market. How far are we really willing to go to protect our 'safety'?
Mila Burghardt
Product Description
The BacteSafe® system protects you and your property, at home or at work. This highly personalized system allows you to choose from 5 different security levels, differing in the effect that the specified BacteSafe® virus has on the intruder:
SL 1: color trace on the hands
SL 2: color trace on the face
SL 3: blood count signature that can be traced back to the location of the illegal entry
SL 4: paralysis in one leg
SL 5: sickness, medical attention needed within 48 hours
These security levels can also be combined.
Each BacteSafe® effect can be neutralized by the required anti-virus, which is offered by the police or the owner of the BacteSafe® System that activated the infection.
BacteSafe® consists of:
- the BacteSafe® stop gel for defining the perimeter of the area you want to protect
- the BacteSafe® database terminal for registering permitted visitors and for programming the security system via a connected DNA printer
- the BacteSafe® update gel to transmit the DNA sequences that will keep the system up to date
- the BacteSafe® fungus, programmed with the DNA sequences. It constantly analyses people inside the BacteSafe® area.
If anybody entering the perimeter is not listed in the DNA-library, the fungus becomes visible by turning red and allows fast and easy location of the exact point of trespass. In addition, it responds to the intrusion by ejecting the specified personally-modified virus (according to the chosen security level) which infects the intruder.

UNSW_Australia,2018,Team:UNSW Australia#Public Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," were seen as difficult to adapt to an Australian context, due to language barriers. Using the William and Mary 2017 iGEM team’s educational outreach database, we discovered that such distributive educational tools were limited. Noting this, our team was confident that adapting previous educational documents to an Australian context would effectively emulate the ethos of accessible synthetic biology education.
In order to develop a truly useful package that addressed the new state syllabus, the team discussed ideas with a syllabus notes developer named Maddie, who specialises in the upper high school Biology courses. This allowed the ‘package’ idea to be fine-tuned, part of which included introducing a “How to Use This Package” document for teachers, that outlined how their required teaching outcomes were met by the package content.
Developing the document from the workshop involved cutting out elements that had been identified as key in engaging students in challenging topics such as biotechnology and synthetic biology. Students would most likely no longer have access to authentic research materials and equipment, and would be learning from their teacher rather than a novel presenter. Although these sacrifices were necessary to ensure students state-wide had realistic access to this educational support, the team used other techniques to ensure that the resulting package was still interesting. This included adapting certain parts of the package to use group based learning and inquiry-based practicals for high engagement levels, rather than the more inefficient ‘transmission of information approach’2. This idea of “workshop-based biology” was developed throughout the whole package3.
Distribution
The package was distributed to a range of high school biology teachers throughout the New South Wales state via a sharable Google Doc. Please click on the icon below to view our finalised package as of the end of iGEM 2018:
Click on the icon above to review the package
Our package has also been uploaded to a Google Drive folder because it allows our team to edit and add resources to the package, even after its distribution. For example, future teams could build on the content in the package, potentially addressing other syllabus modules and adding new experiments. It also allows teachers and schools to easily share the package with colleagues using standard online communication methods.
To further ensure this package was accessible and adaptable, the team decided to provide the components of the package in editable document formats (such as Word and PowerPoint), rather than in fully formatted PDF files. This allows teachers to download the files as a base, and modify them however they see fit to effectively teach their class. We believe this is important, as there is a move within the education system to encourage flexible teaching and learning approaches and it is therefore necessary to have"
Dundee,2016,Team:Dundee Schools#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," standard deviation, however, we would need to run some further experiments to see if this is truly the case.
Looking at these results, it can be seen that we have managed to prove that our S.O.R.D. can be secreted and that our spiRNA from E. coli is able to affect the motility of bacteria. Some further experiments we could have ran would be to test our spiRNA containing a chiA Hfq binding site from Serratia marcesens to see if it also works at reducing bacteria motility. We know Hfq is an RNA binding protein but we don’t know how this function could be affect once it is fused together with OsmY. In future, we could run an experiment called an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to see if it can still bind to the spiRNA."

Users interact with the application by executing the following protocol:
Pick a message from the queue to encode by clicking on it, or users can search for their own message to encode by clicking on the ""Pick up your message"" button.
Initiate the translation process by clicking on the ""Encode"" button and watch as the chosen message is synthesized into DNA, using the Codon Dictionary.
Begin the lab protocol by inserting the encoded DNA into the plasmid.
Pick an E-Coli from the tank and drag it onto the workspace to act as a means of storage.
Insert the plasmid containing the encoded DNA into the chosen bacteria, and return it back to the tank.
Throughout the process, users can click on the various bacteria to see the database of encoded messages contained within each bacteria displayed in the ticker, including the users’ own message.
Experience first hand the translation process and watch as a message is encoded into DNA.
Simulate the protocol of inserting encoded DNA into bacteria.

Implementation
Bac to the Future was implemented as a web application using HTML5, Javacript, JQuery, and CSS for the interface. It is hosted on Google App Engine using the Python run-time environment. Finally, the Twitter API was used to create the feed of messages.
Results
FIGURE. Results showing positive user engagement
To test Bac to the Future, our team conducted preliminary user studies involving the observation of 15 high school students in the MIT-Wellesley Upward Bound program , students who had some exposure to science but were mostly unfamiliar with synthetic biology. In our study, the students were given a brief, 10-minute presentation of synthetic biology, followed by a demo of Bac to the Future. Afterwards, the students were given a chance to interact freely with our application. Through our user study, we observed that twelve in fifteen students found the the experience to be very fun, and ten in fifteen students felt involved and engaged in the activity. In addition, the students felt more comfortable with their knowledge of synthetic biology after the study.

Biotinylated thrombin can readily induce membrane scaffolds dimerization because there were typically 1-4 biontin in one molecule leading to scaffolds crosslinking (B). 15-mer and 29-mer aptamer with short (C) or long (D) linkers were both effective in inducing crosslinking. But it seemed that long linkers (D) is more potent than short linker (C) in this system. )
(The upper figure demonstrates another two typical confocal image of E.coli with (C) or without (A) the two kinds of thrombin aptamers. The thrombin concentration was adjusted to a final value of 0.2nM. Figure B and D shows the spatial fluorescent intensity distribution across the image of the left figure accordingly.)
(The green fluorescence intensity was significantly stronger than the control group when thrombin aptamers with short linkers were added to the solution. The final concentration of thrombin was adjusted to 0.2nM. p<0.01, n=3, t-tset. A.U., arbitrary unit.)
Detect thrombin using β-lactamase testing strip
For the second set of inner-membrane scaffolds, two parts of β-lactamase were fused to the periplasmic ends. When 19-mer and 25-mer biotin-modified aptamers are added to the solution and thrombin is present, aptamers act like a bridge linking streptavidin-fused membrane scaffolds and thrombin. In this way, two molecules of membrane scaffolds are pulled together and the two residuals of β-lactamase will meet each other again to become an integrity part with enzymatic activity. This activity can be detected by commercial β-lactamase testing strips, with a total preparation time of about 40 min.
(β-lactamase testing strip. Left shows β-lactamase positive, right shows negative. As β-lactamase was split into two parts in our project, β-lactamase positive actually means the formation of dimerized inner-membrane scaffold. Because dimerization depends on biotinylated aptamers targeting specific molecules, β-lactamase positive indirectly tells the existence of target protein in the solution. )

From 2010.igem.org
Overall Project
The ultimate goal of USTC_Software 2010 team is to promote synthetic biology throughout the world. To attract more people who do not have biology background to be interested in this area, we plan to develop a modeling-and-simulation game specially designed for synthetic biology. Users are taught to learn the basic knowledge in the area via constructing their genetic circuits as input to our software and try to understand the system behavior as output. This is the basic functional module. We also plan to develop a rating system to grade users' design for given tasks, and a more friendly game interface that can fill the process of input with joy and ease. Though more functions are expected, we focus on the basic module, modeling-and-simulation, at the first stage of our project.
In practice, many CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools, such as TinkerCell and Synbioss, have been developed to model and simulate biological systems and give the system behaviors as guides. However, they all need users to provide details of the system network, such as the activation and repression of transcription and translation reactions in genetic regulatory network. It is so difficult for even professionals to construct a detailed network of a complex system depending only on their minds. In this sense, modeling through CAD tools will not reduce the work of modeling: users are actually required to model manually and input their model in details.
However, since our software is developed for non-biological background users, it is unrealistic to expect them to model their design manually. To solve this problem, the USTC_Software 2010 team attempts to take synthetic biology modeling one step further by introducing new methods for automatic modeling of biological systems. Just as the word automation implies, users are only required to submit their assembling of parts, and the generation of biological model is automatically done by our program. Being the first-ever team trying to develop a synthetic biology automatic modeling tool, we focus on genetic regulatory network for the first year and develop our software tool, iGaME, which will assist the design of genetic function modules for biological systems in synthetic biology. We believe this will greatly relieve users from handling complex interactions of species in biological system.
Many novel and revolutionary concepts are proposed during our development. The first is our Chain-Node model for complex structure with multiple chains bound together. It is necessary for automation since behaviors of species (such as how it react with other species) must be determined by their structures instead of their names:"

Aim
- To expose high school students with the general concepts of synthetic biology by holding a workshop.
Description
This workshop was held in Chinese as a medium of instruction to F5 (grade 11) students. In the workshop, a brief introduction of synthetic biology is first introduced, followed by explanation of relative concepts such as the Central Dogma, Recombinant DNA Technology and Biosafety. The process of transformation was carried out to familiarize students with what they had been learning in their biology class. Besides, materials for fruit DNA extraction experiments were given to groups of students to let them try out the implementation of scientific principles, and of course, have fun learning science!
Achievement
The feedbacks of workshop were satisfactory. Some students claimed that they had an interest in engaging into this field. Majority agreed that our workshop has influenced them in a field of synthetic biology.

As is shown in the graph, this system can be reasonably considered as a TCS. The amount of NtrC-Pi (Conc) and NtrB-Pi (Conb) are two key parameters of this system. Four factors influence Conc and Conb: NtrB helps NtrC’s phosphorylation, NtrC starts the production of NtrB, Conb reduction caused by PII and constant NtrC production. Also, it should not be neglected that the inherent degradation of NtrC and Ntrb is in proportion to their own concentration.
Thus, the evolution equation of this system can be written as:
Where y0 can be expressed as:
The four parameters b, c, y0, x0 invited here respectively represent the velocity of the four processes mentioned before. To be emphasized,y0 describing the change of Conb caused by PII. Parameters a, d is the coefficient of proportionality between Conc or Conb and its depredating velocity. This is a differential equation and the evolution process could be treated as a Markov Process*.
Here we apply methods from dynamic system to conduct further analysis:
First, Consider evolution matrix A, calculate the eigenvalue λ of A
Solve this equation, get
and the eigenvector is
Since parameters a, d are relatively small compared with c, b and they are both negative, it can be easily spotted thatλ1>0,λ2<0 and the ordinate of the vector I1>0 while that of I2<0. If we temporarily put aside the parameters x0, y0 and the definition domain of Conc and Conb, this system could be explained and predicted by the phase flow graph shows below.
Every curve in the graph is an orbit of the system with different initial Conc and Conb. This means that the system with certain initial condition evolves alongside the curve that passes through that point. Thus, with any certain set of parameters, we can determine how the system evolves according to the graph.
So how to draw this graph? How to calculate the function of the curves in the graph? If we consider a system with the evolving law written as
Rewrite r(t) using the eigenvector I1, I2, defined vector X=(Conc, Conb)
Take this back into the differential equation, after simplify, get

FLUID DYNAMICS GOVERNING EQUATIONS
In this section we examine the physical laws behind the flow of the gastrointestinal fluids.
The basic differential equations that govern the flow of fluids are the Navier – Stokes equations and the continuity equation. The mathematical form of those equations is as follows:
\[\rho \left( {\frac{{\partial {\bf{V}}}}{{\partial t}} + {\bf{V}} \cdot \nabla {\bf{V}}} \right) =  - \nabla p + \rho {\bf{g}} + \nabla  \cdot \left( {\mu (\nabla {\bf{V}} + {{(\nabla {\bf{V}})}^T})} \right) - \frac{2}{3}\mu (\nabla  \cdot {\bf{V}}){\bf{I}})\] \[\rho \nabla  \cdot {\bf{V}} = 0\]
where ρ (rho) stands for fluid density, V is the velocity vector of the fluid which produces a velocity field and μ (mu) stands for dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Let's analyze further each term in the equations:
$\rho \left( {\frac{{\partial {\bf{V}}}}{{\partial t}} + {\bf{V}} \cdot \nabla {\bf{V}}} \right)$: This term represents all the inertial forces.
$ - \nabla p$: This term all the pressure forces.
$\nabla  \cdot \left( {\mu \left( {\nabla {\bf{V}} + {{(\nabla {\bf{V}})}^T}} \right) - \frac{2}{3}\mu (\nabla  \cdot {\bf{V}}){\bf{I}}} \right)$: This term all the viscous forces.
$\rho {\bf{g}}$: This term represents the external gravitational force of weight.
All these terms combined together, comprise the well-known Navier-Stokes which represent the conservation of momentum. The continuity equation for incompressible fluids represents the conservation of mass in the system. Another way of writing the Navier – Stokes equations for incompressible fluids is the following one:
\[\rho \left( {\frac{{\partial {\bf{V}}}}{{\partial t"

However, we still have not included ionic nor metallic bonding in zMol, so the vast majority of elements really cannot interact in any way with one another. It seems likely that a future zMol team will have to work on this.

Monday was our last day of work on zMol and zSeq, and yesterday we started work on zTree. The program is intended to visualize hierarchies of data in a visual format which is easy to understand. Already, we have managed to create one ""carousel"" of data - the tree will ultimately be made up of a series of interlocked carousels. However, we have been having lots of trouble integrating zSpace and Unity3d - some earlier errors which we thought we had fixed are recurring. We decided to try moving from the ""pengrab"" script which had been written by prior students back to the pen scripts zSpace wrote. So far, we have the pen's ray appearing in the program, but it does not interact with rigidbodies.
July 10
We tried for a few days to correct the problems we were having integrating Unity and zSpace. Actually, we had a zSpace team member come in to try and assist us with reconfiguring our zSpace machine to allow it to work properly with Unity. For a time, we did manage to get everything to work. He updated our zSpace software, and told us that the most recent release of Unity actually is incompatible with zSpace's current software - so we downgraded Unity. However, soon after this, problems again began to recur, and we decided that for now, we would have to work without any zSpace functionality. This week, we got the foundation for zTree underway. Now that we have experience with Unity, it is much easier to code within its guidelines. Our code for this program is much more modular than zMol was by the time we finished with it, and we hopefully will be able to keep this code commented throughout our work with it, so that future teams will be able to understand what we did. Currently, we are working on just creating one part of the tree - a ""carousel,"" which will be able to rotate around and display different biological parts (or really, any subdivision of a hierarchical structure).

This week was very fruitful for zTree. Today, Cassie and I are splitting from each other, to allow us to work more quickly and efficiently. I will be working on the ""back end"" of the program, while she works on the ""front end."""

To me, biotechnologies nowadays are widespread and the fields of application keep on expanding. However, people know little about it and what is going on in the scientific area, which is a shame and a problem because that makes them more keen on misjudging scientific advances.
Jean Delhomme
Why did you take part in iGEM?
I took part to the iGEM project because I thought it was a great opportunity to learn. I wanted to be more self-directed and to work in a team project. The Human Practice work was also very interesting and I want to learn more about how to reconcile science and ethics.
What was your responsability during this project?
I was the head of the Human Practice approach. So I set up surveys, interviews and pedagogical events in order to understand the needs of the public, their knowledge and fears about GMOs and to explain them what we plan to do with our project.
What did you learn from this experience?
I learn a lot thanks to the iGEM adventure. I had never work on projects so big in a team of students. So I became a lot more self-directed and got confidence to build new projects.
To what extends have this experience changed the way you conceive your future job?
During the project, I met a lot of people (researchers, teachers, non-scientists …). Those meetings have been very inspiring and showed me some fields where I could work later. The iGEM adventure make me want to work on other projects as researcher.
What comes to your mind when you are told about biotechnologies?
For me, biotechnologies are the use of living organisms in order to create something useful for the humanity. Because of my Human Practice responsability, the question of the integration of the biotechnologies in the society is very important for me. I think biotechs allows us to do fantastic things but every scientific advance have to be ethically questioned and clearly explained to the public.

Why did you take part in iGEM?
I wanted to join Toulouse iGEM team to have the opportunity for the first time to lead a project from beginning to end. The principle of creating living systems to answer different problems is something which is fascinating for me.
What was your responsability during this project?

The main goal of our design is to make the bio-sensor capable of detecting harmful substances at far lower concentrations than existing bio-sensors. To do this, we designed a system which produces a chain reaction resulting from the input of a single molecule. This system utilizes a Cell-to-cell communication channel called quorum sensing, to make it possible for a cell which sensed a single molecule of the material detected to “inform” the surrounding cells of the existence of this toxin, causing them to produce a signaling molecule, and then inform their neighbors and so on, creating a chain reaction.
Unlike other biosensors, our system is meant to be as versatile as possible- with a minor change at the genetic level it can detect molecule A instead of molecule B. That saves us the need to construct an entirely different detector for every dangerous material out there.
The alpha system consists of three gates.
Each gate plays an important role in the detection process inside the cell, but the system as a whole is also based on communication between bacteria via quorum sensing.
Gate 1
Built and Biobricked (BBa_K1343000)
The goal of the first gate is to produce the quorum sensing molecule, AHL, when a material of interest is present in the bacterias' environment. As a result, this part can be replaced by any bio-sensor which uses AHL production as its output.
The construct includes a changeable promoter for the detection of the material of interest. In the example above the promoter is Ptet which is repressed by tetR; when tetracycline or its analog aTc is present, tetR is removed
When the material is present it will get into the cell, attach to the promoter and the transcription of the LuxI gene will begin. LuxI gene encodes for an AHL synthase. AHL is a signal molecule that can diffuse freely into the cell and out.
The NheI restriction site was added to the construct so that the promoter activating the gate can be easily changed. EcoRI restriction site is found at the beginning of the prefix, and by a simple restriction reaction with the two enzymes we could take the promoter out and replace it with a different one.
But why do we want our bacteria to produce AHL molecules? How does it help us to see if a toxin or an allergen is present in our sample?

Gate 2

The gate serves as a sensitivity tuner, allowing us to control on the timing of the measurement. When we want"

As an inexperienced newcomer, I am still doing some very light works in the lab, mainly serving as a helping hand for the other seniors on our team. The mechanisms and theories behind most experiment designs I’m still catching up with. For my own biology career orientation, I would like to work in the Bioinformatics field and work on technologies that will be able to help biologists explore further, and operate simpler.
