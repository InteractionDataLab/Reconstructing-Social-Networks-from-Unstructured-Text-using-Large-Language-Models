Streamlined mass action model
We met with Thomas Ouldridge again after the previous model and he showed us how we could combine many steps of the reaction to slim our model down to just 4 parameters and 5 species, as well as giving us some more accurate parameters for our system.
With fewer parameters it was much easier to see the effect that varying each parameter has, and thus draw meaningful conclusions from the relationship between the parameters and GFP output.
Given the knowledge of the system that we had, it was reasonable to incorporate:
the GFP maturation into ktranslation
the opening of the toehold switch into the binding of the miRNA
We used mass action kinetics to model the decay of the RNAs and the opening of the toehold switch, however we modelled transcription and translation such that DNA and the open switches weren’t used up. We assumed the pool of resources was constant, as our construct would not significantly deplete the cell free extract’s resources. [6]
We also made the assumption that our inducible promoter could be modelled as a constitutive one. Given arabinose concentration is constant and the assumption that the time taken to induce the promoter was negligible, no changes to the way transcription was modelled were necessary, other than neglecting resource degradation. This was confirmed experimentally when we characterized part BBa_K808000 .
In this model we included a term for miRNA decay, assuming that it decayed at the same rate as the other RNAs in the system. This was on the recommendation of Thomas Ouldridge as the degradation of miRNA is not well documented in our cell free system.
As we were not confident in this assumption we tried running the model with different miRNA degradation rates and found that between 5×10-4 and 5×10-3 the amount of GFP produced in the positive case increased by a factor of 3. Outside of this range the difference was small. As our value is within this range the uncertainty introduced by the miRNA degradation rate was high. However, this did not affect the model's usefulness  in understanding the qualitative effect of varying the parameters as the miRNA degradation rate stretches the GFP against time graph horizontally. This changes the time our test takes, but not the final difference in GFP output.
As with our previous model we assumed protein degradation was negligible as our cell free system does not contain any proteases.
Following correspondence with Oxford’s modeling team, we changed the values of"

Previously to the study of the codifying nucleotide glmS sequences, Glms protein was analyzed to check the reported high level of conservation of the C-terminal part of this protein ( Milewski, 2002 ). Thus, a multialignment, a circular and squared tree and several logos of all the downloaded Glms sequences were obtained (figure 5). It is mentionable the high level of conservation found in the last 15 amino acids of this protein in all organisms which contrast with the lack of any conservation in the previous amino acidic sequence (this difference is perfectly shown in all sequence logos). It is also interesting that the consensus sequence of this C-terminal part of Glms protein match perfectly with the amino acidic sequence resulting when translating the nucleotide consensus obtained in figure 3.

Pull it down and let it cool until solidified
When you need to use it, put it on the hot plate and heat it up for about 10 mins
Then, turn on the stirring button
ALWAYS keep an eye on the flask. When all the solid turns into liquid, stop heating the flask
Transfer the flask to a black surface and when it is warm, add appropriate antibiotics in it (300 ml of agar needs 300 ul antibiotics)
Normally, 300 ml can pour up to 10 plates, so obtain 12 in case
Pour only a thin layer of agar into each plates
Put corresponding color stripes onto the side of the plates

Normally we do 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 2%, 4%
The arabinose concentration is in the freezer
Use the LB tubes and add the accurate amount of arabinose in. Remember no matter what the concentration of arabinose is, you cannot add more than 200ul of arabinose solution into the LB. Therefore, if needed switch to use 20% arabinose instead of the 0.2% arabinose with the concentration needs more than 200ul of 0.2% arabinose

Riboregulator Feature Page
In this feature page, several teams that have worked with riboregulators are highlighted. More outstanding riboregulators are also identified according to the these criteria: availability from Part Registry, usage frequency, and availability of characterization information of the riboregulator system. Finally, abstracts or summary of different teams’ projects that used or planned to use riboregulators are included; links are provided to each team’s riboregulator page for more information. This feature page can help users to quickly scan through the available riboregulators, and determine whether the riboregulator system is feasible for the project in mind by comparing previous projects that have used the riboregulator system.
Introduction to riboregulators

Artificial riboregulator system used to control post-transcriptional regulation
Regulatory RNAs are small RNA that regulates biological processes such as transcription or translation. The use of regulatory RNAs has been a great interest in the field of synthetic biology because it provides an additional level of regulation for biological circuits and systems. Regulatory RNAs have also used by many iGEM teams. We have identified 7 teams that have used cis-repressing (CR) and trans-activating (TA) riboregulator system and more teams that have used riboswitches. For example, UC Berkeley 2005, UC Berkeley 2006 and Caltech 2007 contributed many CR and TA devices to the Registry.
Artificial cis-repressing and trans-activating riboregulator system was introduced to the iGEM community by the UC Berkeley iGEM 2005 team. The riboregulator system as a whole acts to regulate translation at the RNA level"

Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway available in the Registry demonstrated production of carotenoids up to beta-carotene
Aims
Add additional genes enzymes and achieve biosynthesis of carotenoids zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin
Prepare DNA-guided biosynthetic pathways for production of zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin in E.coli
Achievements
We demonstrated production of zeaxanthin in E.coli using parts from the Registry
We added an additional carotenoid biosynthetic pathway enzyme crtO and demonstrated formation of a carotenoid that was probably echinenone
We constructed DNA-guided biosynthetic pathway constructs but did not have time to test it experimentally as the cells with three plasmids grow extremely slow
Background
Carotenoids form a large family of colored compounds, naturally occuring in plants and bacteria. Besides being vitamin A precursors, many carotenoids have a potent antioxidant activity and are therefore widely used as food supplements, food colorants in cosmetics and as animal feed. According to BCC Research total global market for carotenoids was worth $766 million in 2007 and is expected to increase to $909 million till 2015. The largest share goes to beta carotene, with asthaxanthin closely following and canthaxanthin in the third place.
Due to difficulties in obtaining some carotenoids from natural sources on a large scale, they are produced by chemical synthesis. But especially in food industry they are generally preferred from natural sources over synthetic compounds. Also due to the cost and sustainability, there is a large interest to use microbial hosts for carotenoid biosynthesis.
Biosynthetic pathway
Many carotenoids have been produced in E.coli using reconstitution of a plant biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. The precursor for carotenoids is farnesyl pyrophoshpate. The first three enzymes in the"

We also made an assumption that drag force, viscosity and buoyancy force are the only forces affecting the velocity of the GVP’s and all other forces are negligible.
Lets assume a sphere with radius r=a. The viscous and incompressible flow of the sphere will have only radial and polar angle dependent velocity components.
After manipulation:
Substituting f=rk leads to a 4th order polynomial with exponents -1, 1, 2 and 4.
Using different velocity components and radial pressure gradient from above
Carrying out the integrations and solving for Force due to pressure, and force due to viscosity.
Final equation derived by G. Stokes in 1851:
Limitations of Stokes Law
There are several assumptions made to meet the limitations of the Stokes law. We assumed the following behaviour of the bacteria in the LB culture:
Fluid flows in parallels layers, with no disruption between the layers - Laminar Flow
E. coli bacteria are spherical shaped, rather than rod.
LB solution is homogeneous, uniform in composition, with a single density (not a gradient)
Bacteria and GVP’s do not interact or interfere with one another
All molecules have smooth surfaces
Qualitative Model for Terminal Velocity
To understand the affect of different parameters, such as number of bacteria, number of gas vesicles per bacteria, E.coli diameter, density, and viscosity, we created a model in Java using Netbeans. This model allowed us to qualitatively understand how each parameter influences the velocity of the bacteria in accordance with Stokes’ Law. This model also assumes that the random movement due to bacterial death and diffusing is negligible.. From this model, our team was able to understand how these parameters affect buoyancy and how they can be tuned to increase or decrease bacterial separation due to buoyancy. However, in the future, it will be more useful to incorporation diffusion coefficients. sedimentation rate and interactions between molecules to more realistically represent what happens to the bacteria in culture.

International Questionnaire
Purpose:
We were honoured to be cooperating with universities around the world to do this international questionnaire. The cooperating universities include Technische Universität Berlin, Beijing Institute of Technology, Universidade de São Paulo, Chang Gung University, University of Leicester, Université de Toulouse, Tianjin University, Kungliga Tekniska högskolan, Karolinska Institutet and University College London. We aimed to collect opinions from people around the world on the application of our project. Recently, there was a controversial discussion over the problem of contamination of lead in water tap supplying water to household in Hong Kong. Therefore, the concern from the Hong Kong society on water quality has raised and we want to observe results from other countries to see if they are also concerning the water quality problem in their countries or not, or how serious they perceived this problem.
Method:
We distributed the questionnaire from middle August to late August. The method we used to distribute the questionnaire is online-distribution. The questionnaire contains questions from all the above-mentioned universities.  And we are able to receive responses from other countries with the help of oversea collaborating university. As we may not be able to receive responses thoroughly from the world if we just online-distribute by ourselves, it is essential to cooperate with these universities to observe the result more accurately from other countries.
Result:
We focus on the opinion difference across countries.
We have asked three questions related to the importance and application of water filter to examine their opinions towards water treatment, which is one of the applications of our project. All of the three questions are ranking questions. The range is from 1(the most negative) to 6(the most positive).
The three questions concern:
Q1. the degree of satisfaction of the respondents toward the current quality of drinking water;
Q2. the degree of the respondents wishing to lower the levels of heavy metals in drinking water;
Q3. the degree of willingness of the respondents to install a small ‘heavy metals water-filter’ at home.
General
We received 473 responses from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 77 responses from Brazil, 13 responses from France, 563 responses in total.

We were informed that UofT had performed an analysis of the ability for GolS and GolS_P118A to react to copper ions in solution, using a CPRG assay, which yielded strange results. We thought we would test their constructs for copper and gold binding, as well as silver and aluminum, in order to offer more data to them for better characterization of GolS and GolSP118A.
We initially wanted to determine if our DH5ɑ E.coli would express GolS constitutively, so we set up an preliminary reaction of untransformed cells, cells transformed with GolS, and cells transformed with GolS_P118A, in liquid media with X-gal and different concentrations of gold. We were excited to see that, following day, the cells containing gold and X-gal had blue precipitate, while untransformed cells had no blue product. Due to time constraints and lack of material, we were unable to perform a CPRG or ONPG assay with our liquid cultures. However, iGEM UofT informed us that we could send them pictures of our liquid cultures since they were developing a mobile app that could relate color development to GolS activity. We decided then that our liquid X-gal assay would be acceptable.
We grew untransformed E. coli cells with no antibiotic, E. coli cells transformed with GolS grown in chloramphenicol, and E. coli cells transformed with GolS_P118A grown with chloramphenicol to an OD of 3. We diluted our cells into a final volume of 600 µL of M9 media, having an OD of 1.5. We used Au (III) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM, Cu(II) at 1 µM and 10 µM, Ag (I) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM, and Al (III) ions at 1 µM and 5 µM. Pictures were taken at different time points after the addition of ions, shown in the pictures below. Reactions were incubated at 37℃, 300 RPM.

This gel indicates that the restricted product hasn't been lost as the OBP2A gene fragment can be seen as a distinct band at 500 bp. A re-ligation of OBP2A into the pSB1C3 backbone will now occur.

Figure 4: Presequence Digest of pSB1C3-OBP2A. All seven plasmid purifications of the overnight cultures done on the 26/6 were digested to see if they contained the OBP2A insert. It is clear from the gel that all but sample 3 contain the insert for OBP2A as they all have faint bands at 500 bp's which corresponds to the size of OBP2A. It also appears that sample 5 contains the highest concentration, so that will be the sample that is sent for sequencing.

It can be seen from this gel that samples 5, 6 and 7 may have inserts in them as they each have two distinct bands, one of which corresponds to the 100 bp size for the OBP2A for pT25. As a result all three samples will be sent for sequencing.

Abstract Concept of Chain
When it comes to biobrick assembly, DNA of plasmid is often considered as an abstract straight line where biobricks can be placed on and connected together. It actually acts as the basic frame of biobrick assembly. Inspired by this, we present the abstract concept of chain, which also acts as the basic frame of part assembly. Chain is an abstract straight line where different parts can be placed on and connected together. Part is the basic unit of chain, and chain can have as many parts as possible.
To go beyond DNA, and to unify the data structure of Species, we extend the concept of chain in MoDeL to include all the parts we can describe, including RNA, protein, and even compartment, compound and substituent, etc. Parts of DNA, RNA and protein, are all originated from DNA, and they are considered as “Sequence”. Sequence can be connected to other parts of sequence on a chain. On the contrary, parts of compartment and compound are considered as “Non-sequence”. Parts of non-sequence cannot be connected to any other part on a chain, which means, they can only exist on a One-Part-Chain. Substituent is used as a substitution of any other part, so it can be either sequence or non-sequence.
It is important here to mention that the Sequence/Non-sequence division is only a rule guide the modeling. It is not a constraint to Chain-Node model. Actually, we choose to maximally preserve the flexibility and leave all the freedom of constructing a species to users. Users are allowed to construct ANY species they can using Chain-Node Model. For example, one can create a strange species with compartment, compound, and DNA parts on the same chain, which makes little sense in biology. So, it is really up to the users to decide how to use Chain-Node Model in modeling.
Abstract Concept of Node
Node is used to characterize binding structure in biological complex. Node is an abstract concept of binding site or site that can be bond. Links always exist between a binding site and the sites it binds together, indicating the relationship between them. We use trees to represent the binding structure in complex. The parent node represents the binding site, and the child node represents the bond sites. For example the binding structure of TetR dimer is considered as a TetR2 node with two TetR nodes as its children. There is one exception though, the ROOT node. ROOT node is used as the top node in a tree. It can only have one child and no parent. The function of ROOT is"
XMU-China,2018,Team:XMU-China#Results_-_-_TEXT.html,", ideal band at about 50 kDa are shown in E. coli BL21 transfected with BBa_K2623022 and BBa_K2623024, respectively. However, we could see neither bands nor traces in lane 2 and lane 4 loading with OMVs samples. We suppose that our sample loadings are not enough for the LOD (limit of detection) of SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Because of limited time, we couldn't repeat this experiment. Whatever, our HSFCM data have shown that OmpA-ST could be encapsulated into OMVs.
Demonstrate the SC-L7Ae inside E. coli BL21
Similarly, in our total circuit, we used non-RFP part (BBa_K2623026) to fulfill L7Ae-C/Dbox linkage. It's demonstrated that the SpyCatcher (SC)-L7Ae could be expressed inside E. coli BL21 firstly. Under the induction of IPTG at 0.5 mM, we could detect the expression of SC-L7Ae (Figure 6).
Figure 6. SDS-PAGE figure of the SC-L7Ae.
Lane 1: induced-BL21.
Lane 2: uninduced-BL21. The red arrow points to the band of the SC-L7Ae.
Though no IPTG was added into E. coli BL21 as negative control (lane 2), we could still see our band at about 70.4 kDa indicated for SC-L7Ae. However, SDS-PAGE is not an ideal approach for identify our targeted protein. In our future plans, we would use anti-SC mAb to immunoblot our SC-LA7e.
Demonstrate the ST/SC conjugation inside OMVs
Though we have revealed the OmpA-ST inside OMVs, we are inclined to figure out the ST/SC bioconjugation inside OMVs. Hence, we fused mRFP1 to SC-L7Ae (BBa_K2623026) to build SC-L7Ae-RFP (BBa_K2623025) (Figure 7). We linked our two non-GFP OmpA-ST parts (BBa_K2623022 and BBa_K2623024) with BBa_K2623025 and BBa_K2623026 to form four new parts:

Chloroform is the most toxic agent we have used for extraction, but it provides up to 99 % pure PHB Ramsay, J. A., et al. (1994). ""Extraction of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate using chlorinated solvents."" Biotechnology Techniques 8(8): 589-594. .
The Ethyl acetate extration method involves the least toxic substances and requires no pretreatment, but fairly large amounts of chemicals are needed for the extraction, which provides a purity of 97-99 % Aramvash, A., et al. (2015). ""An Environmentally Friendly and Efficient Method for Extraction of PHB Biopolymer with Non-Halogenated Solvents."" J Microbiol Biotechnol 25(11): 1936-1943. .
Evaluation of Extraction Methods ( Top )
We use Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HNMR) in order to determine the purity of PHB extracted with the different methods. HNMR is a method in which the structure of a molecule is analyzed in a magnetic spectrum. The spin of different hydrogen atoms allows us to determine the amount of and study each distinct type of hydrogen atoms. By analyzing such a spectrum, the content of the sample can be determined.  For details on how we performed HMNR analysis, see protocol HNMR - Measurement of plast purity .

Figure 5 shows an illustration of our modified type I secretion system. The figure illustrates how PHB are secreted due to the recognition of HlyA.
In order to avoid the high costs of plastic extraction we are utilizing a type I secretion pathway for the toxin, hemolysin, to make the bacteria secrete the plastic itself. The secretion system requires only two transport proteins, hemolysin B and hemolysin D. Together these proteins are responsible for the secretion of hemolysin in pathogenic strains of E. coli. Since PHB is not a protein compound, applying the system directly, is not possible. Instead we bio-fused a domain of the toxin hemolysin A with a protein called phasin. Phasin is a protein used in R."

Cambridge,2012,Team:Cambridge#Ribosense#Results_-_-_TEXT.html," include here what we plan to do, in order that future teams might benefit. We plan to insert the fluoride riboswitch into the ratiometrica construct and check that they work together as expected, i.e. get consistent readings for various concentrations, in spite of varying cell densities.
Magnesium Riboswitch
For the magnesium riboswitch, we successfully made the following construct:
The construct made in the pJS130 vector for the detection of changes in Mg2+ ion concentrations
The sequence of this construct was verified via Sanger sequencing.
To characterize this construct, we used a 96-well plate reader to assay the effects of the different concentrations of Mg2+ and IPTG on the levels of GFP. We expected the presence of either to allow the expression of sfGFP, however because transcriptional attenuation by the riboswitch occurs before expression of the repressor protein, it was expected that Mg2+ would somehow demonstrate a dominant effect.
Normalized final fluorescence readings from our construct. Readings were adjusted against final OD620. The construct did not work as expected.
As can be seen, our initial assay did not give the expected results. At differing IPTG concentrations, the response to magnesium seems to have inverted.
Typical growth curves of our construct. Magnesium concentrations varied from 1 μM (most red) to 5mM (most green).
We repeated this experiment, using a different range of magnesium concentrations (1μM - 5mM) and doing duplicates in alternate rows. The cells grew well, although they did not appear to do so in an exponential fashion. It is believed that this may be a feature of the minimal medium in which we were performing the assay, as failed tests using a rich defined medium (which, unfortunately, autofluoresced at GFP wavelengths due to the aromatic amino acids it contained) showed normal exponential growth with the same construct and at identical magnesium concentrations.
Having collected OD620 data as well as fluorescence data, we hoped to generate graphs containing fluorescence readings normalized to cell density. We used the following formula to normalize our data:
Initial analysis produced fairly convincing data, as shown in the graphs below (top images). Certainly, the part appeared to produce a convincing response to magnesium between 1 μM and ~10μM, within the sensitivity range of the original paper. A more modest increase can be seen past this point. More careful analysis of the raw data indicated that this apparent trend may have been an artifact of the normalization formula, as no particularly convincing trend can be seen in the raw final fluorescence data (bottom images).

Stockholm,2010,Team:Stockholm#Planning_-_-_TEXT.html," play different roles depending on the type of the tissue targeted and on the mechanism(s) involved in the cellular signaling. These compounds, acting mainly through their nuclear receptors (vitamin D receptor—VDR), protect the epidermal melanin unit and restore the melanocyte integrity by two main mechanisms (reviewed in Birlea et al.33): controlling the activation, proliferation, and migration of melanocytes and the pigmentation pathways, and modulating the T cell activation that is apparently correlated with the melanocyte disappearance in vitiligo. The multiple effects of VDR on immune cells lead to the recognition of vitamin D as a potent immunomodulator.” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.19
“Experiments using normal melanocytes62,63 and melanoma cells64 of animal and human origin showed a stimulatory effect of vitamin D compounds on melanocyte differentiation and tyrosinase activity. Studies showed that topical application of vitamin D3 on the epidermis of mice increased the number of DOPA-positive melanocytes.65 Indirect data about the stimulatory effect of vitamin D on tyrosinase were provided by animal models fed with vitamin D, which in contrast with vitamin D-deficient animals showed a greater skin tyrosinase activity in response to UV irradiation.66” - New Insights on Therapy with Vitamin D Analogs Targeting the Intracellular Pathways That Control Repigmentation in Human Vitiligo, p.19
(“Opposed to its stimulatory effects on melanocyte differentiation, vitamin D was also reported to have an inhibitory effect on the melanocyte growth,67–69 an effect that was confirmed on several other cell types as well. As such, vitamin D has been shown to act as a regulator of replication in keratinocytes, and has been reported to coordinate the growth arrest in several types of cancer cells such as prostatic, breast, colon, leukemic, squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and Kaposi sarcoma cells.56,70,71 It may be inferred that while the stimulatory effect of vitamin D compounds on tyrosinase activity and the modulatory effect on T cell infiltrate may enhance repigmentation in vitiligo, their suppressor effect on melano- cyte growth would minimize or delay the pigment restoration. Therefore, designing new vitamin D analogs able to stimulate melanocyte differentiation and to enhance tyrosinase activity is of a particularly high interest in vitiligo.
The mechanism through which vitamin D ex"

Figure N.2: BioBrick BBa_K2848004 confirmed by sanger sequencing.
To obtain the basic BioBrick encoding only nisA, BBa_K2848004 was digested with BbsI and XbaI and ligated after removal of the promoter and RBS fragment (Figure N.3). This resulted in the basic BioBrick BBa_K2848003 confirmed by sanger sequencing (Figure N.4).
Figure N.3: Agarose gel of the pSB1C3_araBAD_NisA_LY construct digested with XbaI and BbsI. As marker we used the 1 kb Plus DNA ladder from NEB. The product containing the araBAD promoter is 1242 bp long. The product holding pSB1C3 and the protein coding region for NisA is 2275 bp long.
Figure N.4: BioBrick BBa_K2848003 confirmed by sanger sequencing
To confirm the production of pre-nisin in E. coli we used western blot (Figure N.5) for visualization (pre-nisin having higher molecular weight then natural nisin).
Figure N.5: Western Blot of pre-nisin. As marker we used Roti-Mark Standard Protein Marker. Pre-nisin has a molecular weight of 7.37 kDa and was detected using an alphaHis antibody. The red arrow indicates NisA.
Since we aimed for a visually more pleasing confirmation, we used SDS-PAGE of pre-nisin with silver staining in figure N.6.
Figure N.6: SDS-PAGE of pre-nisin with silver staining. As marker Roti-Mark Standard Protein Marker was used. The black arrow indicates NisA with a molecular weight of 7.37 kDa.
Outlook
We are currently able to produce pre-nisin with the required tags for purification and linkage but for further application nisin has to be fully processed in order to enable its complete antimicrobial effects. Therefore, we cloned the processing enzyme cluster nisB, nisT, nisC, nisI and nisP (required for post-translational modification, resistance and export) in our BioBrick BBa_K2848004 downstream of nisA. This theoretically enables us to produce fully processed nisin containing the YAAY"

The Constructor facilitates the cloning strategy of complex pre-designed genetic circuits from elements of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts[1]. Although the Constructor specifically focuses on this Registry, the same search algorithms for assembly optimization recommendations can be applied to other extensive and well-defined parts libraries. Furthermore, the Constructor uses a straightforward transcriptional unit concept, which could be expanded by including different parts such as splicing signals. Finally, the web tool could be further optimized by suggesting alternatives for certain parts, like available reporter genes with another fluorescent ability, or different inducible promoters.

we performed three times in YPD medium and three times in SD-Leu-deficient medium. A time                         period of 0h-48h was selected and detected once every four hours. After excluding some                         experimental operational errors, we obtained the results in the figure.
It has been shown that external NADH dehydrogenases Ndi1 and Yno1 are involved                         in the generation of intracellular oxidative stress, however, the results measured by the                         fluorescence microplate reader cannot exclude the interference of dead cells on OD600, we                         therefore examined the ROS accumulation through flow cytometry.

Replace the                             promoter of yno1/ndi1 in yeast genome
In order to reduce the pressure on our engineered strains from the addition of plasmid and to                         prevent plasmid loss, we decided to introduce the gene circuit which increases the level of                         endogenous ROS into the yeast genome. We chose to replace the ndi1/yno1 promoter with                         the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1p we used. Because the promoter of the endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene in yeast is a bidirectional promoter, we chose to insert the gal1 promoter upstream of the ndi1/yno1 gene by OE-PCR.
Fig.6 Replace the promoter of yno1/ndi1
After successfully replacing the promoter of the yeast endogenous ndi1/yno1 gene,                         to obtain the overexpression effect, we tested the mRNA quantity. The results are as follows.
Fig.7 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout (YY, in red below).
Fig.8 qPCR result in original strain (C, in blue below), and in strain with yno1 overexpressed and ndi1 knockout (YN, in red below).
According to the result, we could find out that strain with yno1 overexpressed and yca1 knockout had an obvious increase of mRNAs. However, we didn't get the same result in ndi1                         overexpressed strain. We believed this result showed that the overexpression of ndi1 was                         failed while the yno1 one succeeded.

Human Practices
We considered our project from three aspects: education , ethics , and economy . To achieve this, we have done various outreach activities: School-visits, creating videos and a card game, hosting a symposium of bioethics, developing our original ethics code, and creating devices of protein production control. We also designed some genetic circuits which recreate other versions of Sow White. Through these activities, we could communicate with the public and improve our project from their feedback.

Major Collaboration- wet lab with  Nanyang Technology University Singapore
Bidirectional Collaboration With NTU Singapore
For the third consequtive year, Macquarie University has collaborated with the NTU Singapore iGEM team . After a number of discussions, we were able to organise ways so that we could both assist each other.
Following our success last year in the purification and in vitro assays of their dCas9 constructs, they requested that we repeat said process with their new mutant variants this year.
To assist us, we required them to perform a quantitative PCR on two of our composite Chlorophyll biosynthesis parts. BBa_K2664007 which adds a tail to protochlorophyllide, turning it into chlorophyll a (Figure 4) and BBa_K2664006 which adds a magnesium ion to protoporphyrin IX (Figure 5). As we have changed the promoters from lac to trc on a number of parts, we wished to quantify protein expression after induction with IPTG in our parts.
What We Did For Them:
The in vitro assay that we performed was on four truncated dCas9 mutants: 3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP.  This project used the dCas9 enzyme to form a Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with gRNA, and subsequently bind to the target sequence in our PCR product (similar to what we did for the last two years). The results from the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) show that the dCas9 enzymes (3ple, 3ple 4QHP, Rec2_HNH, and Rec2_HNH 4QHP) no longer retain their nuclease activity (see Figures 2,3). This is evident from the gel shift present, the shift of the target sequence protein, indicating the mutant dCas9 has bound the target sequence of DNA from its slower migration through the gel (see Figure 2,3).

FAFU-CHINA,2017,Team:FAFU-CHINA#Engagement_-_-_TEXT.html," Conference of Chinese iGEMer community(CCiC), we invited Prof. King L. Chow and Prof. Kenneth A. Oye, who are the headquarters of iGEM competition. They delivered a keynote speaking about biosafety for all participators and held a face-to-face communication with Chinese iGEMers. They also answered the questions what Chinese iGEMers trapped in and concerned about. Additionally, for this CCiC we dedicated to create a condition for all participators to communicate with each other, which is a good chance for separate trainers to exchange experience and materials.
After the Fourth Conference of Chinese iGEMer community, we made a questionnaire about three topics which were raised by Chinese iGEMers during the iGEM HQ face-to-face communication.
Part 1.The expenses of iGEM competition
1. What do you think about the fees：$4500 USD team registration fee and $695 USD per team member Giant Jamboree attendance?
2.  Why do you hold the view that the expenses of iGEM competition is too high?
3.  Do you think the financial announcements should be published by iGEM headquarters?
Part 2.The quality of Biobrick Parts
1.  In the past few years, have you ever used Biobrick Parts in the iGEM competition?
2.  Did you use Biobrick Parts in the iGEM competition this year?
3.  What happened when you used the Biobrick Parts which was committed by other iGEM teams？
4.  what do you think that iGEM HQ has been considering the feasibility of the method about Biobrick Parts transmission which just provide the sequences supersede the nucleotide parts?
Part 3.About the IDT special offers for iGEM teams in China
1.   Did you used 20 kb of FREE custom DNA from IDT?
2.  If you have used the IDT special offers, how long would you get your nucleotide?
3.  In the competition this year, did you customized your DNA?
It is undeniable that Chinese iGEMers play an important role in the iGEM competition. There are 92 Chinese iGEM teams (Including 10 teams come from Taiwan and 5 teams come from Hong Kong. ) participate in this year competition and in the 2016 iGEM Giant Jamboree Chinese iGEM teams performed well. However, we still have lots of challenges about the iGEM competition and synthetic biology development in China. How to solve these problems? How to develop"

& E- BLOCK 1 & Background Research
(Origin of “BLOCK”)
We propose to write popular science readings and spread our project idea in WeChat, which to be specific, is spreading in form of ""WeChat Push"" —a prevalent way of scientific knowledge propagation in China – as well as accept the timely response from our readers' comments and surveys results. All the pushes are sent under the official account of Tongji Life Science and Technology Department, but are featured in series called ""i积木"", which is homophonic for iGEM in Chinese and means ""my blocks"".
For better understandability to the readers, whose ages might vary from 8 to 80, we process the contents of WeChat Push series in a mild way. That is, to start with comprehensive description of synthetic biology, followed by popular science readings in several aspects of our project, such as the intestinal flora, tumor, immunotherapy and gene therapy, and finally came the basic conception of our project, how we induce immunoreaction by oral administration of processed attenuated engineered P. aeruginosa. The pushes came out once a week, several of which were followed by the relative surveys we designed for collecting social response to the certain topic and more significantly, the points of view on our project.
& E- BLOCK 2 & ""Presentation in High School""
When it comes to spreading new concepts, students are always the best group to be advocated, for efforts may get paid off if you could inspire them and lead them into further research.
To reach this goal, we held a lecture in the first middle school attached to Tongji University. There we talked about basics of synthetic biology, cancer, etc. In this way, we generated a lot of students who were interested in biology and made them think about both the length and the quality of life.
To start with synthetic biology, we first threw out this concept which was not quite familiar to most of students. The topic then went into the understanding of ""standard parts"" with practical usages, some of which were projects of iGEM in the past five years. It was easy to"

Future work
To promote MoDeL for wide use as a standard, we need to refine the structure of MoDeL definition and extend its content to enable descriptions of more biological process. In the future, the new version of MoDeL will be proposed and new functions of iGame will be added.
Next version of MoDeL
MoDeL is young, to be exact, just born. There must be a long way before he can stand up and run by himself. At this stage, we have to take extra care of him. Knowing the drawbacks of MoDeL, we have already got a list of improvements waiting to be implemented in the next version of MoDeL. They are:
Enhance MoDeL to support description of intra-molecular reactions.
If it is applied, our software will become a useful tool to study the competition mechanism between intra-molecular and inter-molecular reactions.
More powerful substituents.
Only six kinds of substituents are far from meeting the demands of more accurate modeling and complex reaction mechanism. At present, substituent parts are limited to match only parts on one chain, and they are not allowed to represent a structure with more than one chains and trees. This needs the extension of definition of substituent parts by designing a unified format that can provide enough information.
Enable description of transcription and translation reactions.
Currently, transcription and translation are handled differently with other reactions. It is necessary to modify MoDeL to incorporate description of the two reactions.
Eliminate the inconsistencies.
In the current version of MoDeL, a bunch of inconsistencies exist. For example, the identifiers of compartments follow different restrictions from other global identifiers, and some components’ attributes are required to be a certain value. These problems make MoDeL not so elegant when looking at details. Work must be done to improve its consistency.
Be more independent.
Currently, some of MoDeL syntaxes are defined for specific algorithms of iGaME. Being a language for automatic modeling, cooperation"
CLSB-UK,2017,Team:CLSB-UK#Software#Assistant_-_-_TEXT.html,"’s very easy to use the software in existing workflows; if your protocols aren’t already on Protocat they simply need to be uploaded and they’d instantaneously be available on our app.
We looked into protocols.io’s API , another protocol database, and contacted the team there to try and get access to the public protocols without the user’s login details. Their cofounder, Alexei Stoliartchouk, informed us that they are working on adding that ability but at the time of writing it had not yet been implemented.
We also looked into sourcing protocols from OpenWetWare . Despite having an immensely useful database the protocols are not in any standard format and thus very difficult to parse automatically. We talked with Michigan Software , who are looking into standardising a protocol format as part of their human practices work.
Testing and feedback
Several teams tested it at the UK meetup, including Judd-UK. Judd suggested the team lookup feature and the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), both of which we implemented soon after.
Judd also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step. We tried to implement this but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature. This was because the natural language processing algorithms tended to match the numbers to part IDs.
Future work
As it’s open-source (GPLv3 license) and available on Github , other teams are free to build other functions or improve the current ones. In the future all kinds of biological queries could be supported such as looking up particular reagents or safety instructions. It also has the potential to control future IoT lab equipment, such as WiFi-enabled centrifuges or electrophoresis power supplies.

Given the fact that the problem of excessive ammonia in the fish pond need be solved while the current detecting and degrading system is imperfect, we designed our project and hardware to solve the problem in a more efficient, convenient and economic way. We used engineered E. coli to detect and degrade ammonia, considerably reducing the cost. We also designed a hardware to convert optical signal transmit by bacteria into warning message for fish farmers to read.
We have implement our idea of detecting and degrading ammonia with our engineered E. coli. Data and graphs in this page demonstrate what we have achieved in our project. Three promotors we chose to detect ammonia were proved to work well and we successfully detected considerable amount of uric acid in the culture medium our bacteria bred in. we also improved our project by adding ssrA tag to the RFP our detecting bacteria express and transform enzymes into degrading bacteria that enhance the produce of uric acid.
For convenient detection of ammonia nitrogen in fishponds, a device was designed based upon our sensor bacteria, which express RFP in low ammonia concentration water. The device is able to provide relatively accurate information while the cost is lower than most ammonia detection equipment on the market. The user only needs to fix our equipment on a"
Bielefeld-Germany,2012,Team:Bielefeld-Germany#Results#halo_-_-_TEXT.html," fraction contains 90 % laccase. This leads to a BHAL concentration of 10,9 ng mL-1.
Figure 6: Activity assay of each purified fraction of recent produced BHAL. Samples were re-buffered into H2O and the protein amount in each fraction had been adjusted. The measurements were done using the standard activity assay protocol over night. The first number indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution.
Since Regionals: BHAL activity depending on different ABTS concentrations
To be able to calculate the activity in Units mg-1, measurements had to be done under substrate saturation. This allows the comparison of Units mg-1 with other laccase activities and data found in literature. For this purpose ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM were applied in an experimental setup containing Britton-Robinson buffer (pH) and a temperature of 25 °C. For measurements with 0.1 mM to 5 mM ABTS 616 ng BHAL were used (Fig. 7). For measurements with 5 mM to 8 mM ABTS only 308 ng BHAL were applied (Fig. 8). Applying less than 7 mM ABTS a static increase in oxidized ABTS was given. Measurements with 8 mM ABTS showed a slower increase in oxidized ABTS as with 7 mM ABTS (Fig. 8). This may be due to a substrate toxication. The most compromising ABTS concentration was 7 mM with the highest increase in oxidized ABTS. Therefore a substrate saturation was reached with 7 mM ABTS.
Figure 7: Activity assay to determine the substrate saturation with ABTS as a substrate. Measurements were done with 616 ng BHAL laccase in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C. ABTS concentrations ranged from 0.1 mM to 5 mM.

TUDelft,2009,Team:TUDelft#Ethics background_-_-_TEXT.html," are the consequences of do-it-yourself synthetic biology, when people can engineer organisms in their own backyard. Regulations and policies should clarify these uncertainties. But the problem is: who is responsible? Should the government create certain guidelines, or should the scientific community self-regulate their own research? Are existing guidelines and safety measures on genetic engineering enough, or do we need to extend this? What about the open source properties, what if somebody patents a gene? Another question that follows from this discussion is whether synthetic biology is as new as some papers make us believe. Do we really need new guidelines? Did we not already describe safety regulations to keep modified organisms in the laboratories?
These are difficult questions, certainly because key stakeholders will have different opinions and demands (e.g. see Figure 1 , critics and enthusiasts). Although these questions have an ethical undertone, they are better categorized in the policy and regulatory field. The ethical aspects have been described extensively. It is now up to the policymakers to identify the problems, see where guidelines are needed and implement clear regulations when necessary.

Reductionism
As has been stated by Arthur Caplan (Director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania) during his speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars, Synthetic biology: is ethics a showstopper? , the key ethical issues in synthetic biology are reductionism (when life is reduced to genetics) and playing God (the bottom-up approach of creating living systems). Issues concerning safety, security and handling of intellectual property rights should be related to politics not ethics. Although these topics need good regulation, ethics does not play a great role there. Instead, bio-ethicists should focus on questions concerning life, specifically the reductionist (top-down) approach towards understanding life, and the bottom-up approach to create life.
The reductionist approach in general, is a method to understand complex systems by understanding its subsystems. So essentially, you break down a system into smaller components and try to explain how the system works by evaluating the components. This theory is depicted graphically in Figure 3. Although this method has been used abundantly in science to describe phenomena that occur in nature successfully, in some cases it is still limited. The main reason for this limitation is the occurrence of emerging properties that cannot be described by only looking at the components of system.
In synthetic biology and in science overall, the top-down approach has been applied to identify how a system works as it does. In physics, one might calculate the velocity of a falling ball by taking into account the gravitational force, and the friction between"

EF-1alpha Promoter
Introduction
The constitutive human Elongation Factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) Promoter regulates gene expression in mammalian cells. It is known that the CMV promoter is commonly used for constitutive expression, and here we introduce EF-1alpha promoter as an alternative mammalian promoter, which works in a wide range of cell types. The origin of this part is from Homo sapiens chromosome 6 genomic contig, GRCh37. p13.
In our characterization, the sequence of EF-1alpha Promoter was assembled in front of a GFP reporter ( BBa_K648013 ) and hGH polyA terminator ( BBa_K404108 ) using Freiburg’s RFC25 format. The EF-1alpha promoter-GFP was then transfected into HEK293FT cells and in vivo green fluorescence signal was observed under fluorescence microscope. The positive control was iDUET101a plasmid ( Addgene Plasmid Number 17629 ) that contains EGFP reporter driven by an EF-1alpha promoter. A negative control was made by GFP generator that does not contain the EF-1alpha promoter. As a side by side comparison, a CMV promoter driven GFP reporter was also transfected, though a quantitative comparison between the two was not conducted in our characterization. Detailed protocols for our characterization work can be accessed via the link.
Characterization Procedure

-       EF-1alpha characterization construct: EF-1alpha promoter – Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) – hGH polyadenylation sequence (hGH pA) - pSB1C3 (BBa_K1119010 – BBa_K648013 – BBa_K404108 – pSB1C3)

DNA Gel Electrophoresis
The PCR amplicons of the colony PCR performed on 12-06-2018 were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer. 4μL was pipetted into each lane. The gel was imaged using a gel documentation system with UV-light.
Unfortunately, the PCR reaction did not result in the required PCR amplicons. However, the positive control colony (pACYCDuet-1) did also not results in any PCR amplicon. Therefore, it is likely that the PCR reaction itself was not successful and needs to be repeated.

UAlberta,2017,Team:UAlberta#HP#Gold Integrated_-_-_TEXT.html," respect to both expanding our target audience demographic and tailor our approach according to our target audience) and suggested different approaches that could set us apart and influence a larger population. Our discussion with her lead us to develop our video called Explaining the importance of the Alberta Biology Curriculum.
Team UAlberta’s outreach initiatives were mainly focused on education. Initially, we did as all iGEM teams end up doing:. we reached out to high schools such as Archbishop Macdonald High School and set up presentations to explain synthetic biology and to demystify genetically modified organisms. However, after receiving feedback from the students whom we were presenting to, it was found that we didn’t achieve the impact we had hoped to.
In response to this, we reached out to Dr. Aberdeen at the University of Alberta who specializes in teacher education, and e discussed alternative strategies. . We discussed the role of formal education in students’ formative years, as well as how learning continues outside of a classroom setting, which we believe is something that is often overlooked. From this, we expanded our strategy so that we pay proper consideration to Canada’s diverse cultures and languages, as well as expanding our target audience from high school students to their parents, friends, and society as a whole.
From our discussions about our team’s preferred learning styles and the role of technology in education, as well as how to best leverage our team’s strengths for this undertaking, we concluded that the best medium sharing information would be through a video which can be accessed by anyone through our wiki. We planned to translate the video into many languages, striving to encompass Canada’s multicultural society.
Afterwards, we developed a storyboard for what the video should cover, and decided that the importance of the Alberta science curriculum at the high school level should be stressed as it is a good starting point in providing a foundation for the future.
Dr. Ryan Noyce
While speaking to Dr. Trudie Aberdeen, we came to understand some of the barriers facing effective science communication to the general public, such as misrepresentation of the facts. At the same time, Dr. Ryan Noyce, a research associate in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Alberta, was encountering the same barriers. Dr. Noyce works in the lab of Dr. David Evans, which studies poxvirus. Specifically, Dr. Noyce has spent over a year re-engineering the horsepox virus. The virus has been hypothesized to have gone extinct, but Dr. Noyce believes that re-engineering it could work towards developing a safer vaccine for the deadly smallpox"

Overview
iGEM Tec-Chihuahua believes that regardless of the results we get and the goals we complete if we do not share this information, it could be considered as never done.  The essential goal we had in the developing of our Education and Public Engagement area was getting more people involved in some way or another to science. However, there are some previous steps we considered critical to do before explaining our project to other people. For this reason, we found necessary to give people an introduction to what is Synthetic Biology.
We identified the four fundamental questions that we think every team who wishes to do a great Education and Public Engagement section should abide by. Here we share this questions:
Which organizations are related to my topic? Identify the organizations or institutions linked to your project.
In those organizations, with whom can we get close to have the first approach? Contact the right person related to the area you are looking for and have a better two-way dialog.
By taking this first approach, how can they help us reach the society? Tell him/her what you want to do to enhance society's way of thinking. Don't forget to establish your storyboard and your limits, remember that something concise and well developed is much better than vague and incomplete tasks.
What are we going to do to make this changes happen? Set your working model and prepare everything with enough time. Remind to get to people's thoughts as well as people's hearts.
These four questions worked very well for our team and we share them with the objective of helping others develop their Education and Public Engagement section. Having said this, we share in the following 12 buttons below how we applied and adapted this four questions throughout the past months.

Ilia Kats
One of our team members, the secret nerd in chief of our group, Ilia Kats, had the initial idea for our project and inspired all of us with his dream of easy and efficient recycling of gold. He also came up with the concept to exploit the NRPS modularity for setting up the NRPSDesigner.
Besides all of his brainwork, Ilia was indispensable for all of the wetlab work for the different subprojects. He was single-handedly responsible for the cloning the methylmalonyl-CoA patwhay for the delftibactin project. In the synthetic peptides, the indigoidine-tag and tag-optimization subproject, he was involved in the pilot experiments. And last but not least, his programming skills were essential for the successfull implementation of our NRPSDesigner software where he used his supernatural force to eliminate even the toughest bugs.
A big THANK U from the whole team for the inspiration and great humor.
Synthetic Peptides
The main focus of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of NRPS module shuffling, performed by Joshua Sachs, Philipp Walch, Tania Christiansen and Anja Riedel. They established the experimental strategy and designed all corresponding primers needed for the amplification of the different tyrocidine modules. Tania Christiansen was especially responsible for the BioBrick submission and the cloning of the fragments into the needed RFCs.
Another essential part in the synthetic peptides subproject was the mass spectrometry, which Joshua Sachs was in charge of. Everyone in this group contributed to the great success of this part of the project! Here,"

Good for the world!
""Safe, responsible and good for the world""
Human practice is aimed at provoking careful thoughts about whether ‘the work is safe, responsible and good for the world’. Bearing that thought in mind, we have taken our project back to the city we live, and came up with new ideas to improve our project.
A visit to the city sewage plant
Our project focuses on the construction of a new kind of cellular memory machine which is capable of recording the changes of a signal in an extended time period. This aspect of our memory machine can be extremely useful in monitoring the chemical changes in the environment. So we contacted one of the biggest sewage plants in Shanghai—Xinchu sewage plant and paid a visit there.
During the visit, we talked with the workers in the plant, who told us the limitation of the current monitoring and expressed his expection of our memory devices.
We also learnt a lot about the basic process of sewage processing. We are surprised to find out that biological fermentation plays an important role in sewage processing. Actually, the decrease of COD value of the sewage is mainly caused by the consumption of the microbes in it. And the sewage plant has specially designed an Ultraviolet disinfection tank to get rid of most of the microbes just before the sewage is ready to be discharged into Huangpu River.
At the end of our visit, we took some samples from the biochemical reaction pool. Back to the laboratory, we used the samples to find out more possibilities of our engineered bacteria.
With both the advices and the experiment we conducted back at our laboratory, we came up with a lot of ideas that can be integrated into our project. We will talk about it in detail at the ‘hp-integrated’ page.
E-mailing the experts in biological synthesis
We have also laid eyes on the field of biological synthesis, one of the most dynamic fields among all the application of genetically engineered microbes.
We e-mailed two researchers from Shanghai institute of organic chemistry (SIOC) to learn about the current development of biological synthesis
From the conversation, we have also gained a lot.
Currently, the type of substances that can be monitored in a working fermentation tank is limited to simple molecules like oxygen"

What is
Quantifly ?
(VOC)
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proven                         present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present                         almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise                         or require a very long exposure time.
Bacteria
Biosensor
This is why we developed the Quantifly project : a combination of a bacterial biosensor,                             perfectly adapted to on-field measurements, and an innovative drone that will allow us to                             easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. The biosensor relies on                             bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are                             trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a                             biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices.
Bacteria
Drone
Concerning the drone, it is designed to safely contain our organisms and carry them on the                             field, thus acting as a mobile detection platform.

Output
We use the powerful open source simulator for biochemical networks - COPASI, as the output interface of our software.
It has many functions which will satisfy our needs in most situations. The tasks allowed includes steady-state analysis, time course, parameter scan, etc. The most frequently used function is to perform time course analysis. Users could obtain dynamic curves easily. What's more, it provides convenient way  to modify parameters, species and reactions. Users could understand the model's network easily with friendly user interface.

pSB1C3_IntK
BBa_K743006
This construct is an integrative plasmid which targets neutral recombination sites (slr0370 and sll0337). We selected this locus because it has been extensively used in the literature ( 11 ) and it shown to have no deleterious effects on Synechocystis viability. We selected Kanamycin resistance as our selectable marker. [PUT LINK TO CONSTRUCT HERE].
Using this backbone we have decided to put LuxAB under the transaldolase promoter.We have choose the transaldolase promoter to express the luciferase part of the operon, as in the literature the promoter is described as having a peak of expression at 2 hours past dusk, which we believe is just the right timing to ""turn on the lamp"".
We've found 2 versions of the bacterial luciferase which we will use on this construct. The first one is of Photorhabdus luminiscent K216008 from the 2009 Edinburgh iGEM team and the second one is part from the LuxBrick (K325909 from the 2010 Cambridge iGEM team) and originally comes from Vibrio fisherii but has been ""E.coli optimized"".
pSB1A3_IntC (Utah 2010 iGEM Team integration plasmid)
We plan on using this plasmid to express the LuxCDEG contructs under the regulation of the Pcaa3 and PsigE promoters mentioned above. pSB1A3_IntC .
pSB1C3_IntS
Due to issues mentioned in the results page (PUT LINK HERE) we designed a new plasmid backbone. This is an integration plasmid which makes Synechocystis susceptible to copper concentrations higher than 0.75 uM 10 by disrupting the CopS gene. We believe that this strategy serves as a biosafety measure to avoid the possibility of having a leakage of recombinant DNA to the environment. The plasmid uses Spectynomycin as a selectable marker. [PUT LINK TO CONSTRUCT HERE]
We plan on expressing LuxCDEG under the control of the promoters Pcaa3 and PsigE (mentioned above). These promoters have peak activities 1 hour before dusk. We believe that we might enhance bioluminescence yield initially by setting the substrate production/regeneration part of the operon prior to the expression of the luciferase.("

Overview
Models
Simulations
Simulation 1: Effects of increased temperatures on cell population
Effects on DpnII and TaqI production with regards to increasing temperatures
The killing term is set to be greater than the growth term in our parameters. This is to ensure there is cell death when temperatures are above threshold.
We can see that there is an increased concentration of restriction enzymes being produced at higher temperatures.
This agrees with our hypothesis that high temperatures de-repress the lambda cI promoter and result in the production of restriction enzymes DpnII and TaqI.
At the pre-steady stage, there is an initial spike in production of mRNA and restriction enzymes, hence the small “bump”. This results from the delay in production of protein cI, which eventually brings down the concentration of mRNA and restriction enzymes to steady state.
Temperature below threshold – Exponential Increase in cell population
We can tell from the above simulation that when the temperature is low, cell growth will be exponential as there is negligible cell death.
Note that we have an exponentially increasing dead cell population. However, this can be considered negligible, as the number of dead cells is of magnitudes smaller than total cell population.
Temperature above threshold – Cell population goes to zero
In the simulation, when we increase the arbitrary temperatures, cells start to die after an initial exponential cell growth. Hence temperatures indeed will induce cell death.
Furthermore, we notice that an increase in temperature will cause the “bump”to shift left and down. This shows that increasing temperatures increases rate of killing.
There is a ""bump"" in the graph of cell population. This can be explained:
Initially, there is an exponential increase in live cell population because restriction enzymes take time to be produced, hence cell growth outnumbers cell death. Cell growth is greater at a lower temperatures as well, as restriction enzymes are produced at a slower rate.
At the height of the “bump”cell growth is balanced by cell death.
The decrease in live cell population afterwards shows the time when cell death is greater than cell growth, due to the killing by restriction enzyme, and total cell population starts to decline. This is when M3 has fully kicked in.
Note that at the threshold temperature, cell death balances cell reproduction, and we would notice a straight line in the live cell curve. Above this temperature, cell death dominates.
For the dead cell population, at higher temperatures"

Due to covalent linkage, stringent washing can be used to achieve high purity of the recombinant protein that is subsequently released by cleavage of a designated protease.
Overall, our novel approach for protein purification is reliable and highly specific. It provides a better solution to reach high protein purity and quality by remedying many drawbacks of currently used methods.
Design
Magnetic bacteria Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1 is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacterium. It produces a unique organelle known as Magnetosome using iron and other metal ions. Magnetosome consists of uniform nano-sized magnetic particles (50 to 100 nm) arranged as chains in cytoplasm and embraced by a stable lipid bilayer membrane, and exhibits strong ferrimagnetism.
Fig.2 Transmission electron microscope image of (A) AMB-1 and (B) Magnetosome
Magnetosome has been used in various biomedical applications because it is easy to handle and can be used to separate target molecules from reaction mixes. Several proteins are identified to tightly bind to the membrane of Magnetosome, such as MagA, Mms16, and Mms13. Among them, Mms13 has the highest affinity to the magnetic core, and its anchoring efficiency is also better than other Mms proteins. Thus, a protein of interest can be expressed on the Magnetosome when fused with Mms13. The magnetic particles can be easily extracted and purified from bacterial lysate of AMB-1 transformant using a magnet.
Fig.3 Proteins on the Magnetosome’s membrane and AMB-1 modification by transformed with Mms13 protein.
Choosing an appropriate tag is crucial for detecting and purifying a recombinant protein. However, the interaction of tags with corresponding ligands is typically reversible and mostly has low affinity. Streptococcus pyogenes fibro-nectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys31 and Asp117. This domain can be splitted into two fragments: the small one (13 amino acids) is named as Spytag, while the big one (116 amino acids) is Spycatcher. When they meet together, the two parts can specifically associate and spontaneously form an isopeptide bond. The reaction can take place in diverse conditions, even in relatively extreme pH and temperatures.

2.- Selecting the problematic
We wanted to develop a project that could actually help to solve a real problematic in our community. In order to do so, we focused on one of the most famous industries in our country, and more specifically in our home state, Jalisco: The tequila industry!
Tequila is one of the biggest industries in México. It is an alcoholic beverage extracted from Agave tequilana,  with 558 places within different states in the country that dedicate fully to the Agave growth and tequila production. It is a major source of employment and economic gain for many in Mexico. The chain of value is not only limited to economic aspects but also cultural, ethnic, social and environmental importance of several areas of the country.   Agave is also a vital species for indigenous populations and is also used for medicine, fertilizers, food and its growth promotes development for the area as well as it helps eradicating poverty (CIATEJ, 2016 ). Tequila is now exported to around 120 countries, and the production is about 300 liters/minute (El país, 2013).
The tourism industry in Mexico is also a major economic and development tool,  a report from the National Chamber of Tequila Production states that, of the total products consumed in Mexico by foreigners, 57% accounts solely for Tequila, as it is a major attraction for tourism. Also, the same report stated that 900 thousand tons of Tequila are produced annually, employing 300 thousand people across the country  (Millenio, 2017).
But like any major industry, it produces tons of waste, the two major contaminants that result from Tequila production are bagasse and vinasse. By 2014, 240 thousand tons of bagasse were produced, which is equivalent to 20 days of residue generated in the metropolitan zone of Guadalajara city and up to this date its has doubled. The problem with bagasse is that it is a fibrous material, organic but when it is not managed correctly (which happens more often than not) it produces toxic leachates that pollutes soil and water, changing their properties, causing bad odors and the proliferation of damaging fauna such as mosquitos (Ramos, 2017).

The Jellyfish Factory
Cutting the jellyfish rings with scissors was impossibly slow; we could not produce the amount of aequorin that we needed using this technique. This problem was solved primarily by Dr. Johnson. He constructed the first model of a jellyfish-cutting machine in the summer of 1967; it was essentially a strip of wire screen that worked like a grater. An average jellyfish has about 100 light organs the size of poppy seeds located under the edge of its umbrella. By sliding the jellyfish over the screen, we hoped that the light organs would be scraped off the body and collected in a tray under the screen. We found, however, that the light organs were not scraped off by the wire screen. The next version of the cutting machine had a strip of coarse sandpaper over which seawater flowed slowly; the sandpaper was connected to one end of the first version. When jellyfish were slid down-first over the sandpaper, then the screen-most of the light organs were indeed scraped off. But the material accumulated in the tray contained an excessive amount of slime, and the quality of the material was much poorer than that of the hand-cut rings. Thus, the manufacture of a machine based on the principle of a grater was abandoned.
Dr. Johnson next purchased two circular meat-slicing blades ( 10” diameter) at a local hardware store and began to build a cutting machine; this project took the next two summers to complete. The basic plan was to install a meatslicing blade perpendicular to a black Lucite board, and with the blade slowly rotating, cut the ring off the jellyfish. The motor from a small laboratory shaker was used to rotate the blade. The jellyfish were rotated with a hand tool called a “peg,” a small disk with several short nails on one side and a 2-inch-long, stick-shaped handle attached in the center on the other side. A jellyfish on the Lucite board was gras"

USB
We make two kinds of USB. One is TAL USB, the other is Enzyme USB. They can help us easily and quickly insert our target  TALE or Enzyme, respectively.
TAL USB (BBa_K1453000)
Figure 2.3.5 Diagram of TAL USB
We design a sequence which can be used together with 2012 Freiburg's part. The TAL USB can make two specific sticky ends. The two ends are the same as the first part and the last part of Freiburg design. So when we digest and ligate them together, we can get a whole TALE. But unluckily, since the sticky ends designed by Freiburg are too similar, we can just have some mismatch sequence by using these TAL USB.
Enzyme USB
In order to easily and quickly insert the target function enzyme into our system, we design two enzyme-USBs. The enzyme USB have three fundamental components, flexible linker- enzyme adaptor-flexible linker.
Figure 2.3.6 Diagram of two kinds of enzyme USB: AarI and BsmBI
The first flexible linker has deleted the PstI recognition site. And at the beginning of the sequence there is a Bsu36I recognition site. The second flexible linker we replace the original PstI site with a isocaudamer SduI, since our part can not have a PstI recognition site.
On the other hand, the enzyme adaptor has two same restriction enzyme recognition sites. In one of our enzyme-USB, it"

Yuze WU
I will go to bed before 12 today!
Yuze is majoring in material sciences and engineering at UCAS.
He learns a lot in the project and is always inspired by his teammates. “I did many things I’ve never tried before. And when my teammates are taking pains, I do feel encouraged and believe that I have to work harder”, he says.
Yuze first worked in the lab, while later he focused on designing and making the hardware. He also took part in some HP activities. Attracted by biology science as a participants in iGEM, Yuze plans to minor in biology.
Besides, he keeps doing sport and sometimes play music for relax. He is interested in numerous things and enjoys a fulfilling college life.
Yunfan LI
Riding the subway with my MP3 is the most enjoyable thing I can imagine.
Yunfan is a sophomore majoring in biology in UCAS.
He gets a pretty memorable experience with his fantastic teammates and sapiential tutors and learns a lot in the lab. That really promotes his gcolumnth in both knowledge level and spiritual level. He also recognizes what he is truly interested in and figures out his future researching plan in cell oxidation and reduction.
He spends most of his time on fighting with the experiment in lab and draws the vestigial energy out for the hardware designing and circuit welding. The interlab work is also finished by him.
Like most schoolboys in campus, he loves computer games and sports and can play badminton quite well. Taking the public transport for aimless roaming is also his favor. However, no one can strip the comic out of his life. Remember! No one!!!
Shubo YUAN
If I rest, I rust.
Shubo is a junior majoring in biological science at UCAS.
He learns some experimental operation of molecular biology, some methods to organize material and data, and many routes from the lab to the school. He wants to make biological experiments more automated to liberate biotech hands.
He undertook most of the experimental tasks in the group of ammonia degradation. He spent most of his time adding samples. He also did some work of human practice, but mostly ended in failure.
Outside the lab he has little hobby in addition to watching anime. Learning and experimenting make him happy.

SYNENERGENE The Hague
21-04-17
The first step in our Integrated Human Practices! The Rathenau Institute together with SYNENERGENE have launched a new version of their guidelines for Integrated Human Practices. The day in The Hague was a pilot project for the iGEMer’s Guide to the Future and gave the iGEM teams from the Netherlands the chance to start working with this guide. Moreover, this day also gave us the opportunity to talk to some experts: Korienke Smit and Cécile van der Vlugt (RIVM), Dirk Stemerding (Biotechnology & Society), Virgil Rerimassie (formerly Rathenau Institute) and Marjoleine van der Meij and Wieke Betten (Athena Institute).
Since our project at that time was still under construction and very fundamental, we could still easily shape our Human Practices. From our talk with Virgil we learned that it is extremely important to have an 'easy' explanation of our project, if it can be used as a tool, what can the tool be used for? Dirk Stemerding told us that it is important to think about what our technique would add to modern research, why would people want to use it? Furthermore, it can be very helpful to look at previous projects for inspiration. From Marjoleine and Wieke we learned that it is important to think about the audience, that might change the story you want to tell. It is also very important to incorporate the views of other people into our project, have some sort of expert committee. Lastly, with Cécile and Korienke we talked about the risk analysis of the GMOs: what is safety? When is a protein safe? Apart from safety in GMOs, guidelines regarding medicines are also important to consider.
We learned a lot from this day and it was a good first step into thinking about our Integrated Human Practices.

Bacillus subtilis
Bacillus subtilis strain 168 is the bacterial species of choice for the 2009 Newcastle team. It is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive bacterium commonly found in soil. Some of our instructors and advisers, including Anil Wipat, know a great deal about B. subtilis and have worked with it in the past.
The 2008 iGEM Newcastle team and a number of other 2008 also used B. subtilis and provide a nice overview of its advantages in their wiki . Thanks to the efforts of these teams the number of B. subtilis parts in the registry is increasing. This year we have added many more.

UFAM_Brazil,2014,Team:UFAM Brazil#Safety_-_-_TEXT.html," following the sanitary rules.
What the law says?
Why are we using the requirements applied to health labs? There’s no regulation for the use of mercury in research.  In addition, the Brazilian law does not establish how should be the handling of toxic metals. It mentions only regarding to their levels released into the environment, and it is not very accurate. This brings us to a question, how to control the amount of mercury in the environment if there is no control in handling it.  Due to lack of appropriate legislation in not only to dump mercury but also for use in research, the team UFAM_Brazil have been engaged in trying to improve this legislation. ( read more ).
Sanitary requirements for the handling of mercury in laboratories (Applied to health labs).
PPE
Masks , Gloves , Lab coat.
Equipments
Use masks and goggles to protect eyes, mouth and nose against volatile chemicals, splashes and inhalation of aerosol particles. Use an autoclave to make sterile infectious material by effective heat. Use of bottles with screw cap to prevent spills and aerosols. Countertops are decontaminated before and after the development of some activities. Before developing the experiment, UV light cabin remains on for 15 minutes. Alcohol and detergent are used as chemical agents for cleaning hands against microorganisms.
Floor and Bench
The floor of the room should be waterproof, without pores and cracks and easily cleanable. The work bench smooth and easy to clean.
Storage of the mercury
The storage of mercury should be in unbreakable and airtight jars.  Code ADR: 8,66 To carry the mercury in a liquid state. Stored mercury must be labeled with the phrases: R23 ("" Toxic by inhalation"") and R33 (""Danger of cumulative effects"").  Should also contain the phrases: S1/2 (""Keep under lock and keep out of reach of children""), S7 (""Keep container tightly sealed"") and S45 (""In case of accident or sickness, immediately call your doctor (if possible show him the label).
Disposal of mercury
Disposal of waste mercury is considered biohazardous. Therefore, they must be placed in unbreakable bottles containing water inside and are sealed, labeled ""biohazardous"" and placed in a plastic bag milky white. All generated waste, such as cultures and stocks, microorganism culture media, the instruments used to inoculate cultures and biological samples are placed in order to be treated by a physical process to reduce or eliminate the microbial load. The sharps are discarded in rigid containers resistant to puncture, break and leak and"

Best BioBrick Measurement Approach
Best Model
The progress in the development of new antibiotics has been very slow during the last decades, leaving many strains of bacteria untreatable. This problem has been growing ever since the invention of antibiotics but has now become a real threat to millions of people around the world. This Threat we want to tackle with a new approach: We develop a system to test substances on a new target, c-di-AMP.
C-di-AMP was discovered to be an essential signaling molecule in Gram-positive bacteria including the pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. Both loss and overproduction of c-di-AMP have detrimental effects on cell growth, cell wall synthesis and propagation.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
Thus, the diadenylate cyclase (DAC) which catalyses the condensation reaction of 2 ATP molecules to c-di-AMP is the key factor for c-di-AMP homeostasis. We are convinced that the DAC protein is a very promising target for the development of highly specific antibiotic substances which exclusively act on Gram-positive bacteria and are not harming Gram-negative ones, including the gut bacterium Escherichia coli as well as humans. We characterized the DAC in vivo and in vitro. Here, we introduce a truncated but functional DAC, which localizes to"
