With help from other iGEM teams in China who volunteered to validate our circuit in their own lab, we obtained a large amount of data for modelling and modifying our system (see collaboration).

From August 26th to 29th, our team held the 4th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC) as             the co-organizer in FAFU. Our instructors, Lou Chunbo and Zhang Haoqian both gave talks during the opening             ceremony. They shared their iGEM experiences, raised some problems faced by iGEM and synthetic biology, and             encouraged us to work more and try to deal with them. Two members of our team attended the conference and             performed well in the presentation and poster section. Additionally, our members gave a special talk about             the Synbio Wiki (know more in Human Practice session) initiated this year by our team, which received a great response.             Through the four-day communication with other teams, we got a lot of excellent suggestions about our project             and SynbioWiki, and gave some help to them, too.

Interact With Undergraduate Teams
As the host, our team communicated with quite a lot of undergraduate teams from China during the             competition.
In June, our team instructor visited and communicated with SCAU, SYSU, SCUT, TJU and TUST. During                     the meeting, we exchanged our project ideas with them, and as one of the first iGEM teams in China,                     Peking iGEM is also taking on a responsibility to help and guide other young contestants.

During the summer vacation, our team held symposiums with OUC-China and HZAU respectively, and had                     lively discussions about our project, experiments and team management. We helped the HZAU team to                     contact Dr. Luo Chunxiong to help them get support in microfluidics. With OUC-China we keep a                     long-term communication and have had several discussions, which benefited both of us a lot.

The greater the fluorescence strength is, the shorter exposure time will be needed, thus can decrease the photobleaching (GFP will be eventually destroyed by the light exposure that tries to stimulate it into fluorescing) that will lead into lapses in data processing.
Besides, we also want to make a comparison between two different GFPs' performances in our oscillatory circuit. For example, peaks, troughs and periods in oscillatory curves. The following picture shows the difference between GFP and sfGFP both on colE1 backbone.(Fig. 2-4)
Fig.2-4 Difference between GFP and sfGFP both on colE1 backbone (P. S. Thanks the Peking iGEM team 2013 for providing us the sfGFP part.)
Three Plasmids in circuit construction
So we designed three plasmids to function as the three important parts in the oscillation circuit, and all of them are in the charge of the same quorum sensing promoter to make sure that all target genes share the same oscillatory period (Table 2-1).

Future Directions
Our work with creating a system of inducible electrical output in Shewanella has laid the foundations for many different exciting avenues of further inquiry which look to take advantage of a bacteria-computer interface that combines the amazing sensitivity and adaptability of bacteria with the speed and analytical abilities of electricity and computers.
Using the same principles underlying the lac system, the arsenic biosensor developed by the University of Edinburgh iGEM 2006 team could be introduced into Shewanella, allowing for the coupling of arsenic sensing to an electrical output, a form of a data which is easier to automate and transmit.  This could be further extended to other chemical sensing systems, resulting ultimately in an array of different strains Shewanella which all respond to the presence of different chemicals with an electrical output that can be monitored by a computer.  This could theoretically allow for the remote sensing and analysis of the chemical composition of an environment over time.
Another interesting direction would be the linking of the light-sensing system developed by the UT Austin iGEM team with electrical output in Shewanella.  In response, to changes of light the amount of electricity produced by Shewanella could change.  This would allow for the intriguing possibility of not only Shewanella conveying information to the computer, but also the computer responding to the Shewanella.  A simple example would be that in response to a chemical input, Shewanella may increase its electrical output.  Sensing this increase, the computer could turn on or off a light directed at the Shewanella, modifying Shewanella's output, creating interesting feedback loops.  This could ultimately be developed into more complex communications systems between bacteria and computers.
The possibilities are further broadened by our observations of co-cultures of E. coli and Shewanella.  Either of the systems described above could be pursued through an alternative alternative strategy of co-cultures.  For instance, an array of E. coli which respond to different chemicals by breaking down lactose into lactate could be cultured with Shewanella.  In response to an increase in lactate, Shewanella would begin to produce higher levels of"

Jurassic Wet Lab
David Urick discusses the emergence of synbio and the corresponding need for increased security enforcement
A scientist creeps through the thick, tropical undergrowth of a remote island.  He wipes sweat from his brow as his eyes keenly search for any sign of his prey. His task: recover a genetically engineered specimen that is loose in the jungle and do so before said specimen can eat him.
It’s a scene straight out of the blockbuster Jurassic World, except this scientist is no movie star.  He is on the Cayman Islands, tracking the population of Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that transmits the deadly Dengue virus. Several weeks prior, a lab-bred population of male mosquitoes were released on the island to compete with the native males for mates. These transgenic insects carry a gene that renders their female offspring flightless—a death sentence for mosquitoes—eventually depleting the population and preventing the spread of Dengue [ 1 ].
Not quite Chris Pratt.
However, these mosquitoes are an effective demonstration of where real life science stands in relation to Hollywood. While they lack the jaw-dropping qualities of a reincarnated triceratops, the potential for widespread destruction is all there. If an island can be cleared of a species in a matter of months, it is by no means a stretch to say that a more ambitious project could have dire effects on ecosystems worldwide.
Synthetic biology has opened the doors for a whole new world of innovation and discovery.  Microorganisms will soon produce drugs, fuels, materials, and probably everything else. E. coli will fight cholera and fluorescent cats will help cure AIDs [ 2 ]. A library of standardized genetic ‘parts’ and enhanced modeling techniques will only serve to accelerate progress. Heck, chickens might even turn into dinosaurs if we’re lucky [ 3 ].
Every possibility carries risk, though, and reckless advancement might carry grave consequences, as Jeff Goldblum cautioned way back in 1993.   In 2004, DNA from genetically modified corn planted in Mexico was detected in natural the natural population [ 4 ]. Like our Dengue-fighting mosquitoes, gene flow from transgenic crops can have unpredictable effects on the ecological landscape. Herbicide resistant plants can confer their immunity to"
Calgary,2009,Team:Calgary#Human Practices#Outreach#Presentations_-_-_TEXT.html," share this with high school students, maybe encouraging them to to think about summer research opportunities during their undergraduate years.
We spent some time going over the general idea of our project, focusing on the lab, Second Life and Human Practices.  At the end, we gave the students a chance to ask questions.  There were lots of questions about the competition itself and University of Calgary's previous participation.  The students seemed really interested in iGEM as well as research opportunities in general.  We had some questions about the kinds of research positions available to undergraduates.  They were interested to hear that students in numerous faculties have opportunities to do research, not just in Science.  We highlighted the diversity of our iGEM project indicating that it includes not only Biology, but also marketing, computer Sciences and Human Practices components.
Overall, both presentations were very positive experiences for our team.  Not only did we have yet another chance to share our project with others, but we had a chance to practice talking to people who have no background knowledge on the subject.  Although the students know have started basic genetics, they don't know what promoters, ribosomal binding sites or vectors are.  You can't just throw out terms like 'qrr4 promoter' or 'PCR' and expect people to understand.  Trying to explain our entire summer project in simple terms was a real challenge, but it helped us to further clarify our own knowledge.  Next year we hope to do even more outreach activities with high school aged students as teaching others is a great way to push our own learning even farther.

Protein expression and characterisation
SDS-PAGE images revealed bands in all gels that were not present in the before induction samples and the control. For MamP (Figure 1-2), the band indicated by the arrow equates to the, 26 kDa, soluble MamP protein with his-tag. For the soluble MamT protein with his-tag (Figure 3-4) the band also appears at the predicted size of the protein, 17 kD. Soluble MamX with his-tag also displays a new band at 24 kDa as expected for this protein (Figure 5-6). These SDS results validated that the proteins were successfully expressed within E. coli cells compared to the controls (Figures 7-9)

World Health Organization Statement
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently published a statement (October 2015) where it was announced that red meat and processed meat increased the probability of suffering from colorectal cancer. In fact, processed meat, which includes bacon, sausages and ham, was classified as carcinogenic for human. “For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal (bowel) cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” said Dr Kurt Straif from the WHO. The organisation has come to this conclusion on the advice of its International Agency for Research on Cancer, which assesses the best available scientific evidence. Even though this statement may be overlooked with scepticism by many people, meat actually contains a component which has been correlated with colorectal cancer: the polyamines.
Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer statistics
Colorectal cancer [7] is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new cases diagnosed in 2012.
Approximately 95 per cent of colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas. Other types of cancer that can occur here include mucinous carinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas.
The Continuous Update Project Panel judged that there was convincing evidence that consuming red meat, processed meat and alcoholic drinks (men); body fatness, abdominal fatness and adult attained height increase the risk of colorectal cancer. There was also convincing evidence that physical activity and consuming foods high in dietary fibre protect against this cancer. Garlic, milk and calcium probably protect and consuming alcoholic drinks (women) probably increase the risk of this cancer.
Preventability estimates using the new findings from the Continuous Update Project show that about 47% of cases of colorectal cancer in the UK can be prevented by eating and drinking healthily, being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight.
Both sexes + Republic of Korea had the highest rate of colorectal cancer, followed by Slovakia and Hungary. + About 54 per cent of colorectal cancer cases occurred in more developed countries. + The highest incidence of colorectal cancer was in Oceania and Europe and the lowest incidence in Africa and Asia.

McMasterU,2016,Team:McMasterU_-_-_TEXT.html," syndrome is characterized by the presence of 2 or more of the following 3 symptoms; low blood pressure, swelling, and low levels of protein in the blood.7 During the treatment phase, it is vital that patients are monitored and regularly screened for symptoms that is common to IL-2 toxicity.
Who should be excluded?
The therapy requires the body to able to respond to IL-2. Therefore, patients with IL-2 receptor deficiency would be unaffected by this treatment. Additionally, patients undergoing total body irradiation as part of a bone marrow transplant would be unable to respond to this treatment. This treatment is limited to tumours present in the intestinal lumen, and not within the intestinal tissues. Furthermore, consideration must be made to individuals with any type of immunodeficiency disorder as they might not respond optimally. Deliberations must be made case-by-case.
Frequency of treatment:
After entering the gut, lactobacillus brevis leaves 24 hours later.8 Therefore this pill will have to be administered daily to maintain constant level of therapy.
Monitoring therapy:
This pill is designed so that the patients would be able to self-administer, without the need of entering the hospital. However, we highly recommend strict regular check-ups for early detection of adverse effects and progression of disease.
To check for the presence of our bacteria in the gut, we will collect and culture patient stools during weekly follow-up visits after commencing the treatment.3 In addition, blood assays testing for the level of colon cancer tumor markers will be carried out both prior to and at monthly intervals during treatment to assess its effectiveness9. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be used at regular intervals to assess tumor size and remission. Patient will be asked series of questions that screen for symptoms of IL-2 toxicity, and blood assays will test for the localization of IL-2 release, to be isolated from the rest of the body.
Ethical Considerations:
Our product must follow the Canadian Medical Association’s code of ethics (last reviewed 2015) as radical therapeutic to a vulnerable population group.10 This therapeutic approach will be artificially modifying the levels of cytokine IL-2 in patients, many with affected immune system. Although safety mechanisms are designed in the bacteria to limit the release of IL-2 to specific cancer regions (see wet-lab), multiple follow-up trials must be conducted before this drug can be put into large-scale practice. These protocols must be clearly defined and standardized. Doctor - patient communication is an important factor to consider when introducing any novel approach to cancer therapy. Before the treatment takes place, the patient must be fully informed of the risks"

    According to statistics, the microbes we touched each day are about 3 times more than the human cells. Some specific microbes can cause infectious diseases and give unpleasant smells. Bacteria can infect any area of the body and cause different diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, food poisoning, etc. This year, we focus on infectious microbes and unpleasant smell, mainly in external environment waste beaker in the lab, and internal environment axilla. To stay on track to tackle real-life environmental problems by our PLA and 2-PE(more details of them on our Description page) in a more efficient, environmentally friendly way, here we established a good dialogue with society and integrated societal considerations throughout the design and execution in our project.

Increase of uric acid production by over-expressing key enzymes in de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
Expressing XOR in E. coli
We constructed the plasmid bearing recombinant human xanthine oxidoreductase (rhXOR, shorted as XOR) on a pETDuet-1 vector and transformed it into E. coli, thus obtaining E. coliXOR. We first cultured E. coliXOR in regular LB medium at 37℃ at 200 rpm for 12-16 hours, then added IPTG to induce expression of XOR and cultured at 30℃ at 200 rpm overnight. Then XOR activity was tested by incubating bacteria with OD600 of 100 with xanthine for 6 hours at 1100 rpm and detecting uric acid with HPLC-MS (for detailed assay, see NOTEBOOK ). In regular LB medium, no uric acid production was detected (Figure 7).
Since uric acid is reported to cause cell death, we speculated that expression of XOR in large quantity was baneful and thus expression was suppressed. Therefore, we removed IPTG and counted on leakage expression of XOR. XOR activity was tested following the same procedure, but still no uric acid production was detected (figure 8).
When we learnt that XOR contains molybdopterin cofactors as active catalytic site, we added 1mM sodium molybdate into regular LB medium and cultured E. coliXOR under same conditions as before. IPTG was added in experiment group while removed in control group. We used HPLC-MS to detect uric acid and integrated area was calculated and compared to decide the relative amount of uric acid. Since peaks of xanthine and uric acid were sometimes overlapped in UV absorbance plot (Figure 9), we integrated the MS plot. Results showed that compared to bacteria not bearing XOR (Control in Figure 10), E. coliXOR cultured with 1mM sodium had the exceptional ability to transfer external xanthine into uric acid. The function of IPTG differed regarding plasmid vectors. Control bacteria bore a pETDuet-1 plasmid same as pET-XOR, and gained resistance to ampicillin, while RSF-XOR bore a pRSFDuet-1 plasmid and was endowed a resistance to kanamycin. In pET-XOR bearing bacteria, addition of IPTG significantly inhibited its ability to oxidize xanthine, while in pRSF-XOR bearing"

10 ul KAPA readymix
0.75 ul of hindIII (primer)
0.75 ul of wF+plLacO (primer)
1.2 ul template
12.3 ul water
The first steps of the PCR involved heating at 95* (for 5 minutes) and 98* (for 20 seconds). Annealing temperature was 56*. Extension time was 30 seconds.
We ran a 1% 100 ml. agarose gel at 120V to check the success of the PCR.
Gel of our colonies, miniprep-ed colonies, and controls to check for w+zif268 insertion
The bands were rather thick, so it was difficult to estimate the exact band size. However, the bands appeared a bit below 650 bp, although we expected a size of 709 bp, so we ran an e-gel on some of the colonies to ensure that that bands were indeed the right size.
Gel to ensure our bands were the correct size (709 bp)
The bands were closer to the size that we expected, so we decided that we successfully inserted w+zif268 into the plasmid. We decided to pick colony 9 (which had the highest concentration post-miniprep) and work with that from now on. We made spec plates with 50 ul of colony 9.

Selection strain transformed with pSR01:
both plates had lots of colonies--almost too many.  We need to make sure the plasmid is, indeed, in these cells.

E gel results: lots of bands but rather messy and not exactly what we'd expect. We'll try to verify the presence of the plasmid in a few other ways.

We checked environmental regulations to see whether or not spraying defensin is feasible. We inspected the restrictions on pesticide use, in order to understand the juristic restrictions we’ll face in the future.
GMO food regulation
Our ultimate goal is to supply healthier, safer, and cheaper potatoes to the market. Therefore, we need to learn the regulations on GMO food and how they are inspected. Since Taiwan’s government is still setting rules for GMO food regulations, we voice our opinions to the government. We contacted with government officials and suggested them to comply with WTO labeling method on GMO food. The new law was passed in 2015 June.

Rule
As a member of WTO, Taiwan is required to comply with the following two rules:
What is SPS?
It is short for Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.
The principles of scientific evidences: Every country can have its own standards, but related regulations and methods to quarantine should follow scientific evidences.
The principle of necessity: It is a necessary to protect human and other creatures’ lives or health.
The allowance of temporary measures: When the scientific evidences are not sufficient, members can adopt some temporary measures to quarantine and check. However, members should try to get more information to carry out objective risk assessment and inspect the temporary measure within certain days.
The principle of non-discrimination: The measures cannot inhibit the products from same or similar countries or treat them unfairly (inclusive of hidden discrimination).
 The principle of international standard: It encourages the members to adopt the international standard and suggestion. However, if members can offer scientific evidences, such as proper risk assessment, they can adopt stricter protecting measures.
What is TBT agreement?
It is short for the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement.
The purpose of TBT is different from SPS: One country can adopt necessary measures to ensure the quality of export goods or protect human or other creatures’lives or health and also prevent fraud. The principle of non-discrimination: Under the same circumstances, it is allowed to adopt every proper measure if it will not cause any inequality or hidden limitation. It is also called Most Favored Nation (MFN).

Butanol in Plants Project
The butanol project’s goal is to synthetically produce the enzymes that make up the University of California’s cyanobacteria pathway to produce n-butanol within physcomitrella. Thereby making a plant directly produce n-butanol, an industrially relevant compound that can serve as a more efficient biofuel than ethanol. The project took on another goal when it was realized that an intermediary compound in the pathway could be used to produce (R)-Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic.

Introduction
Butanol is a four carbon alcohol with several different industrial uses such as the creation of polymers and pharmaceuticals.  However, its most notable use is as a fuel for internal  combustion engines.  Butanol is fairly non-polar due to its longer hydrocarbon chain, and is  more similar to gasoline than other small alcohols such as ethanol.  The fact that it is similar in  function to gasoline means that butanol can be used in automobiles without any changes.  This is  significant because butanol can be synthesized from biomass.  Organisms such as cyanobacteria,  diatoms, and the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum have already been shown to produce  butanol using various methods.
Our other potential product is polyhydroxybutyrate or PHB.  PHB is a polymer in the polyesters class that has many uses similar to other plastics of the same variety.  The reason this  one is an interesting option is the fact that it is nontoxic and biodegradable.  This fact makes  PHB an excellent choice for potential use in the medical industry as well as others.  Biosynthesis  of the polymer is currently achieved using microorganisms.  Our goal was to extend the  production capabilities to plants; specifically Physcomitrella patens.
Background
Our work focuses on the ATP dependent pathway described by the University of  California.  The image below gives an outline of the pathway used.  Refer to the red line.
http://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/6018/F1.large.jpg
We designed three constructs based on the pathways for the synthesis of butanol and  PHB.  The first of the three (Castor) is the same for both pathways and brings the reaction to the  intermediate 3-("

Today we decided to work on the transformation once again with Escherichia coli DH5α RR1 using Transformation Efficiency Kit as a control and DNA diluted from DNAa Parts Kit 2013 (BBa_E0840), using iGEM’s standard transformation protocol. We have to be very careful!!!!
We also had a big meeting with all our team members.

Tec-Chihuahua,2018,Team:Tec-Chihuahua#prueba_-_-_TEXT.html," wondered if our product would help against varroa, and we could tell him how one of the most important consequences of varroa is that the immune system is weakened; providing the bee with new immunity components (AMP’s) will greatly help it, so the answer is yes! Our product can help bees get fortified when they are suffering from varroa.
The beekeeper also shared with us the main routes through which the disease is transmitted from Argentina to Chile, how the bee's life duration varies depending on the production stage and also shared with us details about SAC normative.
Regarding the discussed topic on how bee’s longevity varies depending on different production stages, we explained the beekeeper another approach of our project: When the bee uses less energy in the production of antimicrobial peptides it is possible that its longevity increases.2
Bryan Saavedra did not know about synthetic biology and we gave him an approach to this area and how it had so many reaches, one of them being beekeeping. While explaining our project we absent-mindedly use a somewhat technical word that is usually complicated for the community in general. A peptide. The beekeeper, as in other times of the conversation, didn't hesitate to ask us and he attentively listened to us while we explained to him what we were referring to; he was always intrigued by our project.

3. (Optional) Attach the scar (UACUAG) and initiation codon (AUG) downstream the RBS
5’- UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG  AUG -3’
4. Attach the nucleotide sequence GGAC upstream the last construct. This produces two mismatch nucleotides (red section underline).
5’- GGAC UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG  AUG – 3’
5. Attach the RBS’s* reverse complementary nucleotide sequence upstream the last construct.

Bordeaux,2015,Team:Bordeaux#Practices_-_-_TEXT.html," be used in both industrial applications (for example to produce drugs, biofuels, biomass or biopesticides) and in basic research as tools like biosensors ( E. chromi - Team Cambridge, 2009) or against pollution ( Physco Filter - Team TU-Munich, 2013). With these new tools emerging from synthetic biology, many possible fields conducting to different experiments in science permit the intellectual and technical expansion. Bioethics is necessary to prevent researcher about its ethical limits.
Researchers in synthetic biology
The advances in biotechnology techniques also lead to dangerous possible applications causing a general fear of modified organisms by the public. They may be afraid of the organisms that can be created by synthetic biology, afraid that these organisms will somehow grow out of our control or have unexpected properties and will become dangerous for humanity. Our iGEM team observed this while talking to the general public on the streets of Bordeaux. For more information, look at our Cap Sciences section on this page.
In order to limit this fear, the question of transparency is important for scientists. Besides publishing his results, the researcher has to be able to explain his research process and the challenges of the project by stating the explored and the ignored areas. The general audience has to be able to understand his whole scientific approach. Results found, thanks to this approach, contribute to the production of new knowledge and innovation that could be shared to the general public. It is also important for the researcher to analyze his results, looking at the possible negative impacts of his research and estimating the safety and environmental risks and as well the ethical problematic. However, the researcher cannot be the only one in charge of the safety and ethics of his research.
Legal framework in France and in Europe
Creating guidelines and a legal framework is essential for safety reasons and to reassure the general public. In Europe, there is no law specifically concerning synthetic biology but synthetic biology is framed by common biology laws. In France, the first laws concerning bioethics were put in place in 1994. [2] Before, general laws existed but did not deal with the particular ethical aspects which come from biology and using living organisms. On the 1st of July, the law n°94-548 presents guidelines for data processing in medical research. This updated the law n°78-17 (1978) relative to informatic and big data processing in all fields of research. Quickly after, on the 29th of July 1994, two laws were put in place: law n° 94-653 and 94-654 which deal with respecting the human body and products which come from the"

So this is it - the final hours. It's been a ridiculous ride over the last three months, and even though some of our experiments didn't go exactly to plan (I'm looking at you, platereader, destroyer of dreams) it's impossible to deny that we've learnt a great deal. So, nothing left to say but - See you in Amsterdam!

Edinburgh,2011,Team:Edinburgh#Interviews_-_-_TEXT.html," on the degree of evidence of risk. In any case, careful monitoring of possible side effects will be necessary, accompanied by continuous assessment of the knowledge available.
What role, if any, do you think Synthetic Biology should play in how we source our food?
With view to the rejection of GMO food in many European countries, and assuming that SB will even stronger intervene into organisms used for food production compared to classical genetics I guess that it will take a long time until SB products could be used for food production. A lot of research on possible side effects will be necessary to create trust and acceptance (at least in Europe).
The field of Synthetic Biology poses a large ethical dilemma surrounding the potential risk it poses vs. the potential benefit it promises. Considering your directorial roles and your background in philosophy, what are your thoughts on this?
Are the potential consequences of Synthetic Biology too great for it to become a mainstream technological innovation?
I do not think so. Arguments in this direction such as the ""Playing God"" argument or the ""hubris"" concern are not valid ethical arguments but rather expressions of concerns, uneasiness, uncertainty etc. which are typical elements of the perception of new and emerging technological fields. Usually they disappear in later stages of research & development and transform into more ""down to Earth"" concerns which can be tackled by different types of risk assessment and management.
In general, what approaches do you think could help solve the world's environmental problems?
Is sustainability a technological issue?
In this radical formulation no. Sustainability needs much better technology but technology is only part of the game. Without regarding other (social) issues such as consumer behaviour, adequate political boundary conditions, incentives etc. the technological progress (more efficiency) could be compensated by ""rebound effects"".
If you were to give some advice to future Synthetic Biologists, what would it be?
Be active in public debate and contribute to it based on your expert knowledge. Think positive about SB but communicate remaining uncertainties in an open and frank way. Avoid ""overselling"" SB.

Human Practices
We have explored environmental, societal, ethical, political and safety aspects of our project, including how our project would fit into the current UK waste management industry.
We visited Powerday, a recovery and recycling centre in West London to learn about waste management in the UK. The visit directly influenced our project and even provided a source of recyclable waste which we used in our experiments.
""The waste and resource management sector is in a period of unprecedented change and so is a fertile ground for innovation and I look forward to seeing how this project develops... Finding new ways of recovering plastics will play a part in the resource efficient supply chains of the future"". Simon Little (Powerday, Sales & Marketing Director)
We visited local government, the Greater London Authority (GLA) at City Hall to learn about the Mayor of London's vision for recycling. We learned that our technology would complement the Mayor of London's recycling strategy.
""Imperial iGEM team's research project to extract valuable substances from non-recyclable waste that can then be used to make new products sits well with achieving the Mayor’s vision."" Doug Simpson (Principal Policy and Programme Officer, Waste and Energy Team)
We assembled a panel of experts, including synthetic biologists, social scientists and representatives of the bioplastics industry. We discussed at length the core societal, ethical and technological challenges surrounding our project, as well as broader aspects about the future of bioplastics, and synthetic biology. A video is published on our wiki. Our panel discussion framed our perspectives on how we could communicate that waste is a valuable resource and whether synthetic biology is an appropriate waste management technology. We also thought about the safety implications of how our technology would be industrially implemented.
Our team communicated with an array of individuals and organisations that are critical of synthetic biology, but supportive of increased recycling and the development of a more sustainable society. Some of our discussions are captured on our Wiki . From our interactions we learned that waste management is a social as well as technological challenge. These discussions gave us the idea to promote our project across Imperial in a novel way, our posters became fun recycling awareness posters (see iGEM community pages)
We completed and submitted our safety documentation and published general safety information on our wiki safety page

Linköping City Festival
Every year our local town hosts a big city festival at the end of summer. The festival brings a lot of joy to both adults and kids. This year LiU iGEM decided to join the festival. Since our project focuses on Alzheimer’s disease we asked Linkoping dementia association if they wanted to join us at the festival. Together we rented a big tent for the last weekend of the festival. We had activities for all ages to reach out to as many people as possible.
For the younger crowd we had a mini-lab where the kids could try to grow their own colorful bacteria. We had prepared petri dishes filled with vegan strawberry jelly, some bacteria stock of colored water and of course the magical incubator. The kids got to use pipettes to dilute the bacteria stock in a test tube and then spread a few drops of their dilute on a jelly-plate. Then we put the plate in the incubator for a few seconds, when the plate came out it was covered with jelly beans which we called bacteria. We got a lot of surprised faces and laughs from both kids and their parents! They got even more shocked when we told them that the plate was edible. We used gelatin free jelly and jelly beans to make sure as many people as possible could participate in our activities.
At the festival we also lead an interactive lab with DNA purification from kiwifruit. This lab was more aimed for adults and it was very popular. Most of the people who joined in for this lab had no previous knowledge of this kind of biology, so this lab raised a lot of questions. It was a fantastic way to start conversations and to share information with the public.
We made a collaboration with Valencia UPV iGEM , iGEM AQA_Unesp and SECA NZ iGEM for this festival. They wrote us summaries of their projects for us to share. The public was very interested and amazed by all the things you could do with synthetic biology. Of course, the people thought it was a lot to take in and sometimes hard to understand. The teams had done an excellent job with simplifying their project description and we were ready to answer questions. A lot of interesting conversations came out of this collaboration and we are very grateful for Valencia UPV iGEM, iGEM AQA_Unesp and team SECA NZ iGEM for helping us out"

Week of June 22, 2009
Decided with Adam and Doug on the data structures to store and retrieve information for the compiler, see Adam's Notebook [1] . Continued to work on Eugene compiler. Here is some sample syntax and output that works: Eugene Test Different Inputs
Week of June 29, 2009
New link for documentation, source code and jar file for Eugene
Wednesday & Thursday worked on
added entries to the wiki at source forge
adding more functionality to print statements
adding more functionality in declarations of primitives
found some bugs and fixed them, like we didn't' check all hash tables of instances if an object has already been defined for components or devices
reorganized some of the code and grammar rules
enabled access of individual elements in arrays and multidimensional arrays
enabled declarations of rules
most important event on Thursday -> release of Eugene 0.01
To Do:
still need to implement Assert
Friday worked on Assert statement
created grammar rules to recognize all kinds of Assert Statements
Assert Statements are stored in an assertList, which consists of the names of the rules to be asserted
the assertList stores the expressions in postfix notation so as to observe order of precedence
every time somebody creates a new Assert statement it overwrites over the previous one, so as not to have confusion on which assert is implemented
every time a device is created and an Assert statement exists, the method AssertRule is called:
AssertRule algorithm:
if assertList is not empty:
for every member in assertList:     start for          if(member is an operand)          start if             push to stack          else             pop from stack             evaluate result (another algorithm)             push back result         end if     end for
current restrictions
Rule declaration cannot handle currently comparison of properties
only one current assert can be implemented, need to know scope of it
not clear currently what to do with statements like p1 BEFORE p2 and either one of them or both are not in the considered device. If neither are in this device, should one return true, or if only one is contained should one return false or true??? Again it depends on the biological context.
after the end of evaluation if overall statement result is false, compiler will issue warning statement: ""Warning, the current Assert statement has been violated""
To Do:
actually run the Assert code and debug (am sure there will be some kind of bug!!)
add checking to grammar, if rules have been declared, if components or device instances inside the"

The vanA gene confers resistance to glycopeptide drugs such as vancomycin, and is commonly associated with the Gram positive species vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) – the ES of ESKAPE (Willems et al., 2005; Haenni et al., 2009).
We also identified mecA (associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) (Wielders et al., 2002) and ampC (a β-lactamase gene found in Gram negative ESKAPE pathogens) (Jacoby, 2009) as potential     targets for future expansion of the toolkit.

The CRISPR
We chose to use three CRISPR systems in our project: the cas9 systems from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) and Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) and the Cpf1 system from Francisella novicida (FnCpf1). Due to IP issues with our     collaborators, the SpCas9 work will not be discussed.
The SaCas9 protein is only 1053 amino acids in length – much smaller than both Cpf1 and SpCas9 (SaCas9’s better-known Streptococcus pyogenes equivalent) (Friedland et al., 2015). Its small size is advantageous to us, as     bacteriophages are limited in terms of the amount of DNA that can be packaged in their heads. SaCas9 is a type II CRISPR system, and works as described above. Its PAM sequence is G-rich and located downstream to the protospacer recognition site (Fagerlund et al., 2015).
FnCpf1 is a type V CRISPR system, so differs slightly from SaCas9 in a number of respects. It leaves a staggered cut rather than a blunt double-stranded break (Doudna, 2015) and has a T-rich PAM located upstream to the protospacer recognition site (Fagerlund et al., 2015). The differing PAMs of our three CRISPR systems expand the range of potential target sequences. The FnCpf1 system does not require a tracrRNA and has a much"

The self-code mode provides more flexible input options, enabling users to  program the light-exposure commands manually for every single  bacterial-culture-unit. Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able  to gain better control over the bacteria’s metabolism pathways.
After successfully constructing all the systems required and  confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the  dCas9-recombines system together. In this way, precise gene editing and  information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate  the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.

Domain Shuffling Works across Modules Derived from Different Pathways and Host Organisms
Multiple web-tools exist which offer the prediction of NRPS module and domain boundaries. One of the most common used prediction tools is PFAM which we used as a starting point to determine the best method for defining domain boundaries. PFAM predicted large linker structures between the end of the A and the beginning of the T-domain (compare Figure 8, T-boundaries from B to two). Using these domain boundaries for the native T-domains did only yield one functional native T-domain(results not depicted). We tried to improve this yield by defining new T-domain boundaries based on the predictions of PFAM and multiple sequence alingments with the respective homology libraris at the predicted linker regions. Boundaries were set closer to the preceeding A-domain, at regions were less sequence conservation was observed. Figure 8 shows the indigoidine production after insertion of native T-domains with revised boundaries. T-domain boundary combinations A1, A2 and C1 yielded functional T-domains. As the indigoidine production and cell growth was best for the T-domains created with boundary combination A2, this boundary design was used for all subsequent cloning strategies. Figure 9 depicts the success of this boundary desgin as two additional native T-domains derived from delH4 and bpsA (indigoidine synthetase) led to functional indCs and the production of indigoidine. In addition, the native T-domain from plu2642 which was already shown to be functional(compare Figure 7) showed faster and increased indigoidine production (deep blue agar plate, lower right panel on Figure 9). The results obtained from this experiments proofed two concepts. First, domain shuffling is possible across different species as the T-domains of delH4 and bpsA were derived from D. acidovorans and S. lavendulae lavendulae, respectively and were functional in E. coli. Also, shuffling of domains from modules of different substrate specificity has been proofen herein. Second,  manually adjusting the boundaries predicted by PFAM based on MSA is a functional method to predict functional T-domain boundaries.

Initially, slicing and printing took place at the local hackerspace with counseling by experienced members of the groups. The printer, a Printrbot Plus v2 was made available by the hackerspace community as well. After a total of roughly 34 hours of work, a first model was successfully printed from ABS. Like the models described in the MFC-Evolution paragraph , the design was changed several times. Some of the results can be seen in Figure 22. In early August, Bielefeld Universities Faculty of Physics offered their help. They printed out all subsequent designs with their RepRapPro Mono-Mendel using PLA plastic and also executed the slicing process.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:

Fig. 5: Fluorescence of wild type spores and B53-Sporobeads (containing the PcotYZ-cotZ-gfp-terminator construct)
This two short time lapse videos shows the formation of a spore and lollowing lysis of the mother cell.
Because of the low but distinct fluorescence of wild type spores, we measured and compared the fluorescence intensity of 100 spores per construct (see data ). We obtained significant differences between wild type spores and all of our Sporobeads (see data ). The following graph (Fig. 6) shows the microscopy pictures and analysis of the strongest of the five constructs integrated into wildtype W168 (B53) and the deletion strain B 49 (B70).
Fig. 6: Result of fluorescence evaluation of the three strains W168, B53 and B70. The bar charts show the average fluorescence intensity over 100-200 spores. For image analysis we measured the fluorescence intensity of an area of 750 pixel per spore by using ImageJ and evaluated the results with the statistical software R. The 3D graphs illustrate in one spore the distribution of fluorescence intensity across the spore surface.
As shown in Fig. 6, the wild type spore has hardly any fluorescence, whereas both Sporobeads with the integrated construct  pSBBs1C-PcotYZ-cotZ-2aa-gfp-terminator give a distinct fluorescence signal around the edge of the spore. Furthermore, it demonstrates that strain B 70 has the highest fluorescence intensity. For more detailed information look at our Data page
In summary we successfully developed functional Sporobeads that are capable of displaying any protein of choice on the surface of modified B. subtilis endospores.

Modeling Bacteria
Let´s get a closer look to the modeling of our Bacteria constructions.
Are you hungry?
The first model we did addressed our glucose-sensitive construction. We carried out three different experiments changing the carbon source, to see its influence.  First we used glucose (1) as the only carbon source. Then we added galactose (2) as an extra carbon source. Finally we put sodium acetate (3) as an extra carbon source instead of galactose. The use of alternatives to glucose is explained because  in previous tests we observed that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth. With the experimental data we fitted the following repressible Hill-like function.
And we estimated the following parameters for the 3 different conditions.
In figures 1, 2 and 3 we plot the models and experimental data for the three experiments with glucose (1), added galactose (2) and added sodium acetate (3) respectively. IPTG was added to all the experiments to induce expression.
Figure 1.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations.
Figure 2.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Galactose added to the medium.
Figure 3.
Model and experimental data for different glucose concentrations with 3 g/l of Sodium Acetatee added to the medium.
It is interesting to notice how the Hill coefficient increases  when adding Galatose and Acetate. From here we can hypothesize that having another source of carbon  makes the promoter more sensitive to changes in the glucose concentration, as the slope of the Hill function gets larger. Also the constant K decreases, which tell us that less glucose is necessary to de-activate the promoter when there is another carbon source.
Compare this results with Are you hungry? results .
Are you hot?
When analyzing the Heat Shock promoter, we decided to model the static transfer function of the Fluorescent Intensity as a result of the Temperature following the Hill-like equation:
In order to estimate the parameters of this model we performed a heat shock experiment.
Our first analysis corresponds to a heat shock applied during 10 minutes at different temperatures, ranging from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density"

ACS is a known mediator of the laccases and it is often used and needed in the studies of the  laccase activitiy As expected, the 1mM indigo carmine solution is entirely degraded within the 13 hours of the experiment in the cell extract which contains overexpressed bpul. Additionally, we have shown that more than 60% of indigo can be degraded by bpul laccase in the 13 hours of the experiment. It is important to notice, that in longer  experiments would probably lead to even more degradation since the degradation curve didn't reach the saturation.

(B) SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gel with samples from left to right: BIO-RAD kaleidoscope protein ladder; BL21(DE3) cell extract not induced; BL21(DE3) cell extract induced with 0.5 mM IPTG; BL21(DE3)-bpul cell extract not induced; BL21(DE3)-bpul cell extract induced with 0.5mM IPTG. Electrophoresis was performed in BIO-RAD's Mini-PROTEAN Tetra cell electrophoresis gear on 10% BIO-RAD mini-PROTEAN precast TGX gel. (C and D) Indigo carmine and indigo degradation by cell extract containing bpul are shown over a period of 13h. The degradation was observed in 96-well plate at the λ=650 for indigo carmine, and λ=680 nm for indigo, at room temperature. 1 µL of cell extract was added to the reaction mixture which consisted of substrate dissolved in 0.1 mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and 10 µM ACS added to the reaction mix.
Methods
Preparation of Denim and Indigo Media
We used denim pieces cut out of a pair of jeans for our experiment. We put these pieces onto M9 minimal media agar supplemented with CaCL2 and MgSO4, but without a glucose carbon source. One piece was incubated in a bottle with the lid almost closed to avoid dehydration; the other pieces were put in onto square plates with minimal M9. After a few days different colonies were taken with an inoculation loop and inoculated on LB plates for growth.

Figure 7. Preparation for bio-film
Figure 8. The way we gave light to the reaction system
Then, we put the cathode running and monitored the current. As you can see in figure 8, the strain pMC, which was co-expressing Mtr CAB and Ccm A-H, had a stronger cathode current than the WT strain before the light was given, which perfectly repeated the result we have done in the conduction system section. After the current was stable, we began to give light to the system. The light’s wave length is 455 nm and the source is a LED light bought from an online shop. The strain pMC with CdS quantum dots on it responded to the light stimulation. It had a stronger current than it was before the light was given. However, those strains without CdS quantum dots on it did NOT respond to light stimulate. Especially, for the pMC group without CdS quantum dots on it, it did NOT have any current change after we give light to the system, which exclude the possibility that the current change was resulted from the Mtr CAB proteins or the Ccm A-H protein. Moreover, after we stopped the light, the current got back to the level it was before we gave the light.
Figure 9. Cathode current
This strongly proved the assumption we had that the CdS can increase cathode current, which means that CdS quantum dots can speed up the electrons transfer process, pumping more electrons from the electrode to the bacteria in the same time utilizing light energy. This may results from the CdS quantum dots’ property as a semi-conductor. In the design part about this photosynthesis system, we have a detailed introduction about light-catalyze of semi-conductor. With light energy, we can active the electrons to the conduction band and also create a hole spontaneously. Then the hole will be filled up with the electrons from the electrode. So the cathode current getl increased.
In a word, with this outcome, we can conclude that CdS quantum dots do increase the cathode current with its semi-conductor property. So, with this photosynthesis system, we can further increase the speed of the electron transfer process which leads to the improvement of synthesis efficiency.

After mini prepping viable clones of the pBad-tRNA ligation, we decided that we wanted to see how the cells would function with more than one pBad-tRNA gene. During the week, digested pBad-tRNA plasmid with XbaI/PstI and SpeI/PstI to construct an insert and vector respectively.
5mer Reporter Project
We sent our 5mer Reporters for sequencing in glycerol stocks. Every member of our lab sent the different clones of their Tet and RFP 5mer reporters.

We entered pBad-tRNA into the registry and made their glycerol stocks for our freezer.
Over the past week we noted that the sizes of our plasmids appeared much larger than they actually were. Part of this incongruity resulted from the use of a different molecular weight marker with our gels. After sequencing our double pBad-tRNA ligation, however, we discovered a 32 bp insertion after the promoter. This insertion was palidromic and contained the NcoI restriction site. Further digestion with EcoRI and NcoI yielded the inserts expected from this mutation.
We traced the source of this mutation back to the pBad in our freezer stocks. We had to discard all minipreps and cells containing this promoter and start afresh.
5mer Reporter Project
We decided to test between pLac and pTet as the promoter for translation of our reporter. We digested and gel purified pLac, pTet, and RBS. Then, we ligated pLac to RBS and pTet to RBS. pLac+RBS produced colonies from the first ligation, but pTet+RBS produced colonies on the second ligation. These colonies were PCR screened and we found 3 pLac+"

They tested our combined densitometer and fluorometer . They found that we could hold the light sensor more securely using blue tack, or possibly superglue rather than the electrical tape we had been using. They also suggested we save a recording number rather than just whether or not a reading had been recorded and add the ability to download only the ‘recorded’ data. We implemented this, making data analysis easier and the fluorometer more powerful.
They helped us with our high school teams guide by giving us detailed feedback that we incorporated into the final guide. They gave us lots more advice for the ‘idea’ section of the guide, and helped provide us with other pertinent points for the ‘why enter,’ ‘fundraising’ and ‘equipment’ sections.

Teaching Westminster the basics of wiki development
Westminster (Biobusters)
We met Westminster several times - and thoroughly enjoyed the iGEM UK meetup they organized!
You may be interested in seeing their collaborations page .
What we did for them
We gave University of Westminster advice on how to use the iGEM wiki editing tools, Mediawiki templates, as well as pointing them to some good HTML, CSS and JavaScript learning resources.
What they did for us
We collaborated with the Westminster iGEM team in order to carry our iGEM’s interlab study. We do not have a plate reader at CLS, but Westminster kindly agreed to let us use theirs to carry out the measurements. Their PI, Dr Smith, was invaluable in helping us setup and use the machines - we are very grateful for her time and effort. Take a look at our results on our InterLab page .
Carroll High School
Although an ocean away, we communicated a lot with fellow high school team, CarrollHS.
We’re happy to have made it onto their collaborations page .
What we did for them
We helped Carroll High School with several parts of the wiki. We first explained the way the iGEM wiki is structured and how to use Mediawiki formatting and templates. We later troubleshooted parts of their wiki, writing code to fix problems they were having in their navbar, footer and with the overall layout.

Introduction
1. Inflammatory bowel disease
Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that                         affects the gastrointestinal tract. It has two major clinically defined forms, one is Crohn's                         disease that can affect any parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and the other is ulcerative                         colitis that affects the colonic mucosa [1]. Although the pathophysiology of IBD is largely                         unknown, some factors that have a major role motivating of IBD have been identified, including                         genetic factors, the host's immune system, and environmental factors [2]. Patients with IBD often have symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, and weight loss                         during disease activity [3], which decrease the life quality of patients dramatically.                         Unfortunately, IBD is not curable and IBD patients have a higher risk of developing colorectal                         cancer [1].
2. War inside the intestine
In general, when the immune system overreacts to the flora normally                         resident in the gut, it causes a series of inflammatory events that may damage and destroy the                         intestinal wall [4]. Some biomolecules are released by bacteria which induce an inflammatory                         reaction to intestinal epithelial cells, causing the destroyed tight junction between                         intestinal epithelial cells and the reduced of mucus layer thickness . When dendritic cells in                         the lamina propria sense these biomolecules, they release inflammatory signals"
Penn_State,2011,Team:Penn State#HumanPractives_-_-_TEXT.html," group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now… The Penn State 2011 iGEM team conduced a three hour workshop at the Foxdale Village retirement community in the local State College, PA area. Throughout the course of the three hour workshop residents were asked to view the video and talk with members of the team who were present to answer any quetsions they may have. The participants were also asked to answer survey questions based on their opinions and knowledge of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and GMOs before and after viewing the video.
Research Component
The Penn State iGEM team had two main goals for the video “(Re)designing Life.” The Penn State team first wanted to determine if this video provided an adequate explanation of the technology behind synthetic biology and genetic engineering to any viewing audience. Assuming the video provided enough information for the viewers to understand synthetic biology fully, the Penn State team then hypothesized that with this information, the general audience will form more positive opinions regarding synthetic biology. In particular we focused on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered through human intervention. By improving the public perception of GMOs, the Penn State iGEM team hopes to increase positive regulation of this technology without allowing severe limits by the government on scientific advancement in the field of synthetic biology and GMOs.
The adequacy of the synthetic biology information portrayed in the video as well as this information’s effects on the audience’s perceptions regarding GMOs were analyzed through the use of two surveys. The first survey first survey was given to the audience before the video in order to determine demographic information as well as a baseline for the audience’s opinions regarding GMOs. After the video was shown, a second survey was given to the audience in order to determine if the audience increased their knowledge of synthetic biology as well as if this knowledge changed their opinions regarding GMOs.
Survey Data
Statistical analysis was done based on the survey data that was collected to determine if the video was influential in changing the opinions of the participants. The questions on the survey had participants rate how strongly they opposed or supported the use of GMOs in certain situations. There were other questions on the survey; however, these had to be cut because it became difficult to accurately and truthfully analyze the survey data. We wanted the pre-survey and post-survey questions to be the same so that accurate statistical comparison could be made under the same conditions. Questions were eliminated to ensure that only the same questions got compared. Overall,"

Inhibitor
Background
IDEA
In molecular genetics, inhibitor is a DNA or RNA binding protein based on its function that it can inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA binding repressor can recognize special operator gene, then it will block the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or prevent RNA polymerase to move along the direction of DNA, thus it can stop genes from being transcripted into messenger RNA.
The RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA to prevent the translation. However, all is fair, this repression can also be relieved by some inducers. If an inducer, which can initiate the expression of gene , is present, it will interact with the inhibitor protein and detach it from the operator. RNA polymerase will have the chance to transcribe.
Corepressor is the molecule which can combined with inhibitor, helping it bind to the operator more tightly and repressing  transcription. An inhibiter that binds with a corepressor is termed “aporepressor” or “inactive repressor”. One type of aporepressor is the trp repressor, an important metabolic protein.
The above mechanism of repression is a type of feedback mechanism because it only allows transcription to start if specific inducers are present.
Inhibitor protein is widely used in logical gene circuit construction, controlling the expression of special genes or important metabolic processes
Mechanism
We choose three types of inhibitor-promoter: LacIq-plac, CI-pR and TetR-ptet to regulate the threshold based on our need.
LacIq-pLac
LacI repressor is a DNA-binding protein which can inhibit lac promoter from expressing genes, which are relative to lactose metabolism( from expressing lactose metabolism relative genes).
These genes are repressed when lactose is not available to the cell, ensuring that the bacterium only invests energy in the production of machinery necessary for uptake and utilization of lactose when lactose is present.
When lactose becomes available, it is converted into allolactose, which combines with the LacI and inhibits the LacI’s DNA binding ability. Loss of DNA binding by the lac repressor is required for transcriptional activation of the operon. LacIq is a mutation type of LacI"

Results showed that over-expression of enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis did elevate uric acid production compared to E. coliXOR (Figure 13). Interestingly, this time the combination of purM and purD exhibited lowest oxidation activity and we will design more experiments to explore the reason behind. Notably, comparing uric acid produced without extra xanthine by these bacteria with that of E. coliXOR with extra xanthine, bacteria co-transformed with Prs, PurC and PurD, Prs and PurD, PurF and Prs still showed higher oxidation activity (Figure 14). These results confirmed our idea that by over-expressing related enzymes, more purines can be produced for uric acid synthesis. Our future work is to co-express other enzymes and calibrate the ratio of different enzymes to achieve maximum uric acid production.

Conclusion
Synthetic biology can become a very powerful tool if it remains under control. Risks exist, of course, but we have to be aware of these risks causes, and the finality of taking them. It is without doubt the scientific community to make the community accept this idea, by transmitting the knowledge. Some problems, such as various diseases, seem also to be resolved through it. But the sought interests are those of the entire society, and not particular groups. It might be beneficial to put quickly in place a regulation to avoid abuses, without limiting the development of this promising science
Survey
Today everything is patented or patentable, and worse it is possible to patent in simple concepts that have not been applied. Thus the purchase, exchange, submission and management of the patents bank of a company is a real business activity and it can be really profitable. Patent an invention, a concept or a brand is there real consequences on the daily progress? That is what we asked Sup'Biotech students and non scientists to respond.
32% believe that patents represent a barrier to innovation, while 43% disagreed. The opinion seems pretty divided, which is quite surprising because in theory the patent is a tool for encouraging innovation. Indeed, the temporary monopoly allows to finance investment in R & D. However, in practice the patent appears as a secondary tool, some people do not even have little confidence, while others do not hesitate to follow the example of the law fragmentation when innovations are cumulative and / or complementary as computing, biotechnology or electronics.
Do you think that patents slow innovation?
As part of a therapeutic application, we may wonder if we can patent a living thing, giving it a value? This is the question that is facing synthetic biology.
Do you think an organism created by synthetic biology should be patented?
Like other technologies, synthetic biology would  show us  a new era, of ""Biolithic"", where the living is becoming the instrument. A tool that could be greatly promising to cure many diseases. But what is the therapeutic goal legislates she use? Synthetic biology thus challenges our life conception. Where is the boundary between natural and artificial? Can we"

""No road of flowers lead to glory.""
From our dedicated work in both wet lab and dry lab we’ve successfully proved that our STEP system can work in human cells and can be tuned to achieve an ideal output.
Figure 1. Basic theory of STEP.
At the beginning, we improved a previous part of ECFP (BBa_E0020) to be BiFC components (BBa_K2886004 & BBa_K2886005), verified their reliability and employed them to test cell membrane localisation and binding ability of STEP (Figure 2). With cyan fluorescence observed in both circumstances, we can confirm that both our developed parts and the first part of STEP system works appropriately.
Figure 2. BiFC tests. The BiFC system we designed was examined and used to test the localisation and extracellular domain of STEP.  (a) Leucine zipper was attached to N- and C-terminal of split ECFP to test the reliability of BiFC.  (b) Both terminals were attached to the transmembrane linker of STEP to see if ligand-inducible dimerization could take place.  (c) Results of BiFC. Fusion proteins are expressed in E. coli BL21 separately. They were then released from the cells and incubated for maturation. The relative fluorescence intensity of split ECFP measured via plate reader is higher than the 10% of whole ECFP we expected, which is the normal result of BiFC.  (d) VEGF-STEP localisation and dimerization test. Plasmids containing both chains of cECFP and nECFP are transfected into HeLa. A few significantly activated cells were observed under microscope, and the total fluorescence intensity of VEGF(+) group is higher than VEGF(-) group, indicating that our receptors are"

Week 8 (June 18 - June 22)
Decarboxylation
This week, we received the results of our gas chromatography of the eight tubes created last week, and unfortunately no hydrocarbons had been produced in any of them. It was thus very important for us to spend time researching why this was unsuccessful. We have found a number of things to consider. Firstly, the Washington iGEM team (creator of the petrobrick) has worked on system optimization, and has come up with an number of ways to increase alkane production. Information regarding this can be found here: https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Alkanes/Future/Vector. There are many other considerations as well. We have received feedback on our sequencing results, and have been told that 87% is not high enough; we should be obtaining results of 100%. This is a problem because it presents the possibility that there is a mutation somewhere in our PetroBrick that is preventing effective operation. We may need to design inner primers to sequence the entire PetroBrick, as it is 2392bp and this may have prevented 100% sequencing results. We have also been using plastic falcon tubes, while hydrocarbon production has been tested in glass tubes. Incubation time and initial amount of cells to be innoculated are also concerns, as we have been having many problems with cell growth. The Washington Team often had an OD600 of 10 in their production media, whereas we have been tracking the OD of our initial broth only, so it is possible that the OD600 of our broth has been very low. As demonstrated by iGEM Washington, the OD600 is of utmost importance when it comes to hydrocarbon production, and is something critical that we need to improve. We are also considering extracting alkanes from our cells using HCl rather than ethyl acetate, as we many not be removing hydrocarbons effectively from the cells. We will consider each of these things when we attempt hydrocarbon production again.

Suits
The first custom made suits arrived from our sponsor SuitSupply. We're going to look awesome during the Jamboree.
Lab work
In the lab things are also getting started: Thias, Hugo and Pieter worked on preparation of the Top10 competent cells . These will be our workhorses for the next couple of weeks.

DNA order
Aljoscha signing the DNA order
After the relaxing jam session of yesterday, we all head back to the lab/office. Besides planning the trip to Paris workshop for this weekend, we also spend some time on setting up the first transformations. Also new possible sponsors are addressed. We are still on the hunt!
The ordering invoice for the DNA synthesis are signed and on their way to Mr Gene. Of course we added their logo to our webpages igemtudelft.nl and Facebook and Twitter . And all team members have become fans on the network sites.
Lab work
Antibiotica stocks
Hugo, Ramon and Pieter made the antibiotic stock solutions. Though it is kinda hard to solubilize Chloramphenicol in water. Fortunately we have Hugo, the vortexman, on our team!
BioBrick stocks
We suspended some BioBricks from the distribution plate that we are planning to use in our project. Some of the BioBricks contain RFP. The red colour in our epps really looked nice! De BioBricks that we suspended were:
pSB1A3
pSB1K3
pSB1T3
pSB1C3
pSB3T5
pSB3C5
I13401
B0015
B0032

J61101
J61107
J61117

people who have not ever learned synthetic biology but have interested in it.
   We have promoted this to other iGEM teams, and to the public in High School Summer Camp and CCiC, where
the attending students and teams showed great interest in this simple and enjoyable game. With their suggestions, we
even developed a more difficult version later. For more details or if you want to play this game, please click here .
Mini lecture to 2016 freshmen
   We presented a mini lecture for 2016 freshmen shortly after the start of the new semester, in which we introduced
iGEM competition, synthetic biology, our team project as well as our Human Practice activities, especially the game
Genexplorer. We exemplified GFP to illustrate four basic elements in synthetic biology and how they work in real bac-
terium.
   After the lecture, with the freshmen, we also discussed the biosafety and ethics problems that brought from syn-
thetic biology. The freshmen raised some problems that our project should concern or may ignore."

IGEM Tokyo Tech
Present our project
In August, one of our team members paid a visit to Tokyo Institute of Technology for the purpose of searching for team collaboration and friendship with IGEM Tokyo Tech. We sincerely appreciate the warm welcome and excellent reception from all members of IGEM Tokyo Tech. We exchanged information of our idea of IGEM, current work of our projects and future potential collaboration.We held a modeled presentation, provided a constructive suggestion for one another and tried to improve some parts of our projects that might be challenged in Jamboree. Their project this year is about constructing a new co-culturing system across bacteria, plant cells, and animal cells through the signal molecule. ,
Adopt advice to our project
In 2009, team Tokyo Tech focused on the topic of Terraforming of Mars. An elaborately described method of creating blackened Escherichia coli was displayed on its wiki. After consulting IGEM Tokyo Tech and delving into their project, we intended to construct a plasmid containing Melanin sequence and further transform the plasmid into microalgae. Apart from in 2012 distribution kit was used, which was submitted by IGEM Tokyo Tech in 2009, when constructing Melanin plasmid. We sincerely appreciate the help from team Tokyo Tech for consulting and discussion.

Hold a modeled presentation
In August, one of our team members paid a visit to Kanagawa Institute of Technology in pursuit of team collaboration and friendship. We exchanged ideas of IGEM, team current work of our projects and future potential collaboration.We also held a modeled presentation for the purpose of both enhancing our presentation skills and figure out ambiguous parts in our project, which might be challenged in Giant Jamboree. Their project this year is about solving allergic system problem, which really inspired our team in many aspects.
Belgium: Team KU Leuven
Multilateral collaboration in translating projects
We sincerely appreciate the invitation from team KU Leuven in Belgium for team collaboration. Due to language hurdle, the spread of synthetic biology and the communication of each teams’ projects have encountered hindrance. Therefore, we decided to translate each teams’ project description into their native language respectively. This translation project is comprised of several teams worldwide with different languages. We are honorably served as one of the members of it and responsible for Traditional Chinese.  Through this mult"

Aachen,2016,Team:Aachen#HP#Silver_-_-_TEXT.html," prepared project days in cooperation with the teachers. Our overall goal was to give them an understanding of synthetic biology and microbiology and introduce iGEM to them.
We gave a presentation about synthetic biology, our project and the iGEM competition in general and afterwards gave a safety instruction and performed some experiments with them. During the visits, we were happy to answer all of their upcoming questions as they got more and more in touch with synthetic biology, our project and iGEM.
Since we visited different grades with students of different ages, we adapted every presentation and each experiment to the particular school and their demands. After the experiments and the dialogue with the students we spend some time with the teachers to reflect on our visit. While talking to them we discovered the lack of possibilities for them to perform biological experiments in schools. To meet those needs, we created a collection of easy to understand experiments that do not require any specific equipment.

Monschau
We visited a girl’s school in Monschau on two days. First, we talked to several teachers to plan and prepare our visit. We benefit from the teacher’s hints about which topics might be interesting for the students. It was a great pedagogical experience for us, as we had to think of a way how to explain the biological topics to students who do not have a huge biological knowledge.
We thought a lot about it and in the end, it was a great success. We could evoke curiosity and the girls asked a lot of questions about Synthetic Biology and iGEM.
Aachen
Moreover, we visited the St. Ursula Gymnasium in Aachen and presented our work to students who already had a good biological background through their school. We created a new presentation for this purpose and experiments adjusted to their level of knowledge. It turned out that many students were interested in choosing a biology-related topic as their study field. This led us to explaining more about our university and talking about different subjects which are interesting for example Synthetic Biology. Later, we had a lively talk with the teachers who gave us some feedback and discussed the role of genetic engineering in Germany.
Düsseldorf
In Düsseldorf, in cooperation with two different schools, we organized a whole “Biotech-Day”. It was an and challenging experience for us because there were 89 students for whom we needed to do a lot of preparation. But luckily, with the help of the teachers we managed to plan the day. We did not only present the"

It was difficult to remove the supernatant because the viscous liquid kept getting sucked up and bringing the pellet up with it.
Resuspend pellet in 1/2 volume of original 0.1X bug buster solution
18.75 ml per tube
Mix to get an even suspension by pipetting and vortexing for several minutes and spin down as in step 9.
Repeat step 11-12 two more times.
Take samples of supernatant at each wash step
Resuspend inclusion body pellet in 3% SDS solution and incubate at 60 C in the water bath for 2 hours
I used around 2 ml, but I probably could have used less, because the pellet dissolves well in the heat
Store solution at 4C until further required.
I noticed that after a day in the 4C, the solution gelled up.
According to protocol, storage at temperatures below 4°C may cause precipitation of the detergents in BugBuster reagent. Incubate in a room temperature water bath with gentle swirling to redissolve.
Some Notes
I collected the viscous (potential chromosomal DNA) substance and labeled it S4.
After the second wash step, I tried to remove all of the viscous substance, after which the resulting pellets were much smaller, and difficult to break up even after several minutes of vortexing.
Next Step is to run the different fractions, and the dissolved purified silk on an SDS gel to see if I got any protein.
Gel Image
Fig. 1 Expected size of product is 31.6 kDA
The product was expected to be purified in the lane labeled inclusion body.
The bright band in the inclusion body lane seems to be around 16 kDA as opposed to the expected 31.6 kD.
Im not sure what to make of this data. Although there is a bright and somewhat isolated band, it is not the right size.

StanfordBrownSpelman,2014,Team:StanfordBrownSpelman#Amberless Hell Cell_-_-_TEXT.html,"H were chosen for initial testing.
Figure 8. Comparison of radiation resistance genes by measuring the fraction of colonies present after exposure to different amounts of UVC radiation. SOD was a resistance gene with unknown radiation resistance qualities. MntH Mut3 was a version of MntH with a UAG stop codon for leucine. Only uvsE-transformed cells showed an indication of radiation resistance.
After determining that uvsE was a new gene that could confer increased radiation resistance to DH5-alpha cells, we repeated the experiment with three replicates of a DH5-alpha negative control and DH5-alpha transformed with uvsE.
Figure 9. UvsE confers significant radiation resistance to DH5-alpha cells after exposure to UVC. Data were determined to be significant to p<.05 and p<.01 using a two-tailed Student's t-test.
We determined that the D. radiodurans UV damage endonuclease uvsE gene can confer extra radiation resistance to E. coli. After confirming its efficacy, we used mutagenesis PCR to introduce stop codons at two different sites on the uvsE gene. Sequencing showed that our mutagenesis protocol for TTG(leucine)->TAG(stop) produces 70-95% of plasmids with the desired mutation. We are currently working on assembling this uvsE-stop codon gene with the supP tRNA to show that radiation resistance will only occur in Amberless cells when Codon Security is employed.
Conclusions
● We showed that Codon Security prevents DH5-alpha from expressing a construct containing stop codons. Despite having the supP tRNA in the construct, the cells do not survive transformation or fail to produce the protein of interest with mutated supP due to the toxicity of having a UAG-reading tRNA.
● We have created an orthogonal synthetic biology system such that genes only properly translate in the Amberless chassis.
● We isolated a radiation resistance gene from D. radiodurans, uvsE, and have for the first time shown its radiation resistance effects in E. coli.

How can we understand the impact of our project on a sociological scale?
Having already visited stakeholders from the dyeing industry to discuss the logistical aspects of our solution we decided to extend a hand to the rest of the stakeholders in the industry, as well as the general public.  We gathered over 85 attendees from various specific industries including the general public and invited them to attend a seminar where we outlined the goals and technologies we were using.  This presentation was then followed by a debate in an attempt to gather information about their thought and concerns about what we were doing.  This debate centred around three key themes which we felt best reflected the concerns of the public in relation to the development of genetically modified organisms and synthetic biology.
Are there better solutions to the problem than ours?
Is it safe to use synthetic biology in the bioremediation of dyes?
Whose responsibility is the problem?
The responses we acquired during the discussion lead our project to evolve to better fit society and industry stakeholder needs:
Question
General Responses to consider
Project Alterations in response
Are there better solutions to the problem than ours?
Remove use of Azo Dyes altogether and use alternative dyeing methodology
Collaboration with Bioartist Natsai Audrey to explore the possibility of Bacterial synthesised dyes
Is it safe to use synthetic biology in the bioremediation of dyes?
You can never know the future, you must move slowly in implementing such a plan. If there is an escape of the bacteria, you must stop them transferring DNA to other organisms or outcompeting beyond the current technology
Exploring implementation timelines at a factory level for future business plans. Creating a Xenobiological module within the project.
Whose responsibility is the problem?
Everybody's; scientists, industry, lobbyists, the general public.

Lambert used this ethics conference as a springboard for their own investigations into ethics.  As a result the team developed a simple flowchart for the synthetic biologists to use when considering the ethics of their own projects. Members of the team also attended a Business Ethics Experience held by the University of North Georgia.
Lambert High School: Engineering and MSA
The Chrome-Q prototypes designed by the team were 3-D printed by the Lambert High School Engineering department. The final Chrome-Q prototype was ordered from Shapeways.  The engineering department printed the 3-D fuge designs obtained from the Prakash Lab from their Paperfuge project. An engineering student at Lambert High School, Sahil Jain, modified one of the 3-D fuge designs to improve ease of usability. This final model was used to process cells for the final data collection.
iGEM Twitter Group
Thanks to Twitter, iGEM teams from all over the world are in a group chat where they can easily communicate and ask questions about iGEM, Jamboree, wiki, and much more! iGEM teams have easy access to other teams and can ask questions about their projects, send out surveys, or promote their apps/programs through this platform. A great and fun way to collaborate!
Chrome-Q
Lambert iGEM will continue to use the Chrome-Q instead of an expensive plate readers. Regardless of the project, the team will use chromoproteins as a reporter of the genetic sequences. As Lambert iGEM develops future projects, the team will improve the structure of the Chrome-Q. To add, the software will be further developed to be able to distinguish more color variations. To summarize, Lambert iGEM will expand the use of the Chrome-Q and app to accommodate the future projects.
Future Collaborations
The Lambert iGEM will continue to improve the 2017 project. They will collaborate with microbiologists at Emory and CDC, so the team can improve the genetic constructs that were not able to function. To add, they will continue to talk with Gibson Ridge Software to finish the app. Lastly, it is a goal of the Lambert iGEM team to send out the Chrome-Q to numerous labs. Dr. Dana Boyd Barr has shown interest in using the hardware for her labs in Thailand, Rwanda, and Peru."

Initially the mixture was applied to the paper and per recommendation 2-3 days is necessary for the cellulose binding domain to take effect. After this initial binding period, 5 x 1mL of milliQ water (with 1mM ATP) were washed over each 9-well sample each day for a week. The positive control had the FQ system, but no linker. The negative control had no FQ either.
Figure 3: Biodevice of ATP Aptamer Fluorophore-Quencher System with Cellulose Cross-linker. Fluorescence was also quantified on the Typhoon scanner for characterization purposes. The depicted timelapse gives qualitative proof that both the FQ sensor and Cellulose Cross-linker are working in tandem, as evidenced by the drastic difference in fluorescence between the experiment and controls, amplified from day 1 to day 7.
Figure 4: A schematic of the biodevice
Figure 5: In order to confirm that our biodevice was working, we measured the fluorescent activity on a cellulose sheet over the course of a week. Each day 5x 1mL 10mM ATP was pipetted onto each 9-well grid to simultaneosly wash off unattached sensors and trigger attached sensors. Fluorescent images were analyzed with Typhoon Scanner (Absorption=495nm, Emission=525nm) and processed quantitatively with Python. We understand that photobleaching and heterogeneous mixing across the wells are uncontrolled for, but this pilot study gives way for proof of concept embedded abiotic nucleic-acid based sensors.

The plastic companies will only be able to use our plastic if it fulfills the customer's wish for sustainability. Since our plastic is biodegradable, there will also be limitations to its use. The final choice of material will be made by the customer.
Interviewing Morten Østergaard Andersen
In relation to the possible functions our biodegradable plastic can fulfill in medicine, we consulted Morten Østergaard Andersen. Morten is an Associate Professor at the Southern University of Denmark, researching in different biomaterials. Morten introduced us to several experiments, which we could conduct for our plastic Nygaard, J. V., et al. (2008). ""Investigation of Particle-Functionalized Tissue Engineering Scaffolds Using X-Ray Tomographic Microscopy"" Biotechnology and Bioengineering 100(4): 820-829. Andersen, M. Ø.., et al. (2010). ""Surface functionalisation of PLGA nanoparticles for gene silencing."" Biomaterials 31: 5671-5677. . One of them was how we could use our plastic for coating different proteins. The plastic could for instance be used for coating of antimicrobial peptides onto implants. The PHB will decompose slowly, which also means that the antimicrobial peptides will be released continuously from the implant and thereby reducing possible infections and biofilm. The PHB could also be used as the implant itself in cases where e.g. the bone needs a scaffold until it has healed. However, here we should be aware of the side effects of using PHB as bone implants, if the patient is also ingesting bone stimulating drugs. These drugs can lead to the formation of bones other places in the body than intended to. Mr. Andersen made us also aware of the side effect with the use of PHB inside the body.
Mr. Andersen introduced us to how we could 3D print our plastic. He also provided us with materials about plastic polymers, which we could use for background knowledge and for inspiration of possible opportunities. Furthermore, Mr. Andersen gave us the contact to two of his master students; Martin and Casper. They had the knowledge and the equipment to make the 3D printing possible. This corporation also provided them with a new experience, since it was the first time they had the opportunity to print with this type of plastic material and see how it responded to the 3D printing.

Public
No study specifically regarding the perception of synthetic biology by the public has been conducted in Korea. It is therefore hard to judge how prevalent the concept of synthetic biology is to the general public. Sections of the Bio-Vision 2016 plan mention that efforts will be put into promoting the safe application of biotechnology. Meanwhile other events that help the general public understand synthetic biology include the 4th Bio-safety and Bio-industry Debate Competition for high school students in Korea, held by the Korea Biosafety Clearing House on April 15th of this year. One of the debates discussed the topic of synthetic biology being used to further the efforts of biotechnology. 436 high school students all around Korea participated in the competition (KBCH, 2013)
A 26-item questionnaire survey conducted in 2010 designed to measure high school students’ perception in biotechnology revealed that students had a generally positive toward the use of biotechnology on crops, and microbes, but were wary about the use of biotechnology products on animals and humans. This study also revealed that male students were more accepting biotechnology than female students (Song & Shim, 2010)
Research, People & Organizations
Research
208 projects related to synthetic biology are currently registered in National Science and Technology Service website, representing a great increase considering that only 2 entries were found in 2008. The two largest contributors to synthetic biology research are the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) with 41 projects and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) with 17 project entries. Most of the projects are related to protein engineering and bioenergy technologies (""National science and,"" )
People
According to the National Science and Technology Service website, the most active researchers in synthetic biology are Seung Goo Lee and Sung Kuk Lee, with 13 and 12 projects respectively. The following table is the personal profile of these two researchers and other scientists in the field of synthetic biology.
Organizations, Research Institutes, and Companies
There are few organizations, research institutes, and companies that are specifically established for synthetic biology. Also, Korean Society for Synthetic Biology exists, though it has no official identity or web presence. In addition, there are five institutes directly related to synthetic biology and are listed in the SynBio map. (""Synthetic biology project:,"" ).
Some organizations, research institutes, and companies are not listed in the SynBio map. This is probably because they have a synthetic biology department under a larger biotechnology institute. For example, under the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology"

Can Bees Ingest Culture?
Names: Dinula De Silva and Chris Issac
Objective: Determine if bees can ingest E.coli in liquid culture form with supplementation of sugar. Also, can mites survive on papers that have water and RFP liquid culture?
Procedure: Bees were obtained from the “Mighty Hive” near the penitentiary at 6:50 after a heinous struggle and lack of proper equipment. They were then fed RFP producing E.coli that had been supplemented with both glucose and sucrose sugars. The bees were then observed to determine if they were drinking the solution.
Mites were added to petri dishes following a sugar shake. The dishes had different paper derivatives soaked in treatment; H2O and RFP E. coli. They were then placed in the 27C iGEM incubator. They will be observed in the morning.
The bees were euthanized on EtOH, then surface sterilized in bleach, opened using a razor to expose the gut, and placed in LB to shake at 37C overnight. Problem: 50ul of kanamycin was added instead of 5ul. I suppose that’s what happens when you work a 13 hour day in the sun.

Stanford-Brown,2016,Team:Stanford-Brown#SB16 BioSensor IRES_-_-_TEXT.html," inactive and unable to translate. In the “off” state when the aptamer is unbound, IRES is bound by a-IRES and no reporter gene expression is observed. In this state the complement to aIRES, anti-anti-IRES (aaIRES, shown here in red), is trapped in an inaccessible hairpin by the end of the aptamer and the optimized modulator region.
When the target molecule is introduced, it binds to the aptamer. As a result, the aptamer changes conformation, and releases the aaIRES sequence. The released aaIRES sequence binds to aIRES (out-competing IRES), freeing the IRES complex to refold into its active conformation. Once IRES is correctly folded, this allows the sensor to translate reporter protein. The plasmid we created to accomplish this is shown in Figure 1, with the resulting molecules pictured in Figure 2.
Conceptual Design of Test Sensor
Figure 1: Annotated Geneious Map of the IRES system.
This construct contains the iGEM standard prefix, a constitutive promoter (BBa_J23119), a 5’ loop that Ogawa found to be helpful in stabilizing the construct, a “modulator region” that determines how much of the aptamer is bound to aaIRES, the aptamer of interest, aIRES, a naturally occurring viral IRES, the translation start site at the very end of it, and finally the GFP coding sequence.
Figure 2 shows how the sensor works at the molecular level. On the left (OFF): the aptamer is unbound, and the functional IRES (blue) is bound to the aIRES (red). Because of this, the functional 3-D confirmation of the IRES complex is disrupted, blocking the translation start site, preventing transcription of the reporter gene. On the right (ON): aIRES (red) is bound in this case to aaIRES (pink) rather than IRES (blue). This allows the functional IRES complex to form, and translation of the reporter protein to occur.

In conclusion colicin Fy inhibits the growth of yersinias very fast and the effects lasts for a long while acording to the results, the negative control always grows much more.
Colicin Fy specificity test
To see if the Colicin Fy really is as specific as we thought, we had to try it on other bacteria. Apart from testing them on Y. enterocolitica we also managed to get a hold of risk class one versions of Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella as well as Lactobacillus plantarum and the standard E. coli DH5-alpha. We did multiple tests with varying results.  The tests were performed in the same way as the inhibition test above. However OD600 measurements were made here since no aggregations could be seen in most of our cultures, see table A. The table indicates that the colicin Fy is probably specific, but something seems to have gone wrong with the plating, see figures E, and that result was inconclusive.
